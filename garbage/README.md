All scripts in this folder are **deprecated** and should NOT be executed.

## Question Generation

The **ONLY** authorized path for question generation is:

```
scripts/generate-questions.ts
```

This requires the arming phrase: `POWER_UP generate_questions`

## Production Export

Use `scripts/export-prod-db.ts` to export approved questions to `prod/questions.db`.

## Why These Scripts Exist

These are archived for reference only. They represent old approaches that have been superseded by the current architecture.

## If You Run Any Of These

Many will throw an error immediately. Others may corrupt data or create inconsistent state. **Do not use them.**
