No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like\nGinger, like ah, Gingeer?\nMonica: No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,\n(singing) ‘the movie star.’\nJoey: Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out\nhe’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.\nMonica: Well, what did you do?\nJoey: What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that,\nit’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.\nMonica: Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler\ngets home, (to Phoebe) because it’ll be more fun that way.\nJoey: All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone\nout a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me,\nher, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic\ndinner....\nMonica: You gave her food poisoning!?\nJoey: I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of\nthe fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.\nSo, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.\nPhoebe: Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!\nJoey: I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you\nabout Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.\n(Phoebe and Monica both stand up and gasp.)\nMonica: Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?\nJoey: I ran!!\n[Scene: A street, Chandler is kissing Ginger.]\nChandler: Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve\never met in a men’s room.\nGinger: Actually, me too.\nChandler: (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in\na puddle.\nGinger: Oh damn, I hate that.\nChandler: Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.\nGinger: Oh, don’t worry about it.\nChandler: No, really you’re gonna freeze.\nGinger: No, I’m not.\nChandler: You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?\nGinger: Some day, maybe.\n[Scene: Ross’s bedroom, Rachel getting into bed while Ross is reading and laughs.]\nRachel: Funny book?\nRoss: Hmmm.

I mean...\nRachel: Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with\nMark?\nRoss: Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?\nRachel: I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny.\nLook honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff\nwith. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.\nRoss: Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.\nRachel: Really!?\nRoss: Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you\nknow I could be a fashion..... monger.\nRachel: Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.

Y'know what the saddest part\nis, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like\nall my lives.\n[Scene: Central Perk, Leslie is singing.]\nLeslie: (singing) My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at\nthe heel, holes in the toes. Don’t care what people say. My feet’s best friends,\npals to the end. With them I’m one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light,\nI....\n(Phoebe runs in and joins her.)\nPhoebe: (singing) I stepped in something icky.\nPhoebe and Leslie: (singing) Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile.\nSticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I’ll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: The lecture, Rachel is listening closely, Ross is bored out of his mind.]\nLecturer: We’re beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and\ncolours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....\nRoss: (to Rachel) I’m really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm)\nYou’re so pretty. I love you.\nRachel: Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)\n[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is teaching Leslie how to sing Smelly Cat.]\nPhoebe: (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat,\nsmelly cat, it’s not your fault.\nLeslie: Wow, that’s great.\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah!\nLeslie: Y'know you could totally sell this. It’d be perfect for like umm, a\nkitty litter campaign.\nPhoebe: I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.\nLeslie: What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.\nPhoebe: Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by\nnow, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.\nLeslie: Aw, you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.\nPhoebe: That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s\nreally, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside\ndown to play it.)\n[Scene: The lecture, Ross is passed out against Rachel’s shoulder.]\nLecturer: ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories\nin general are very popular now.\n(Ross wakes up with a start and startles Rachel. The guy next to him starts laughing,\nwhich starts Ross laughing, Rachel gives him a look and he stops.)\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is reading the newspaper.]\nMonica: (entering) Hi!\nChandler: Hey.\nMonica: Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk’s gone bad.\nChandler: Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.\nMonica: So umm, how was your date with Ginger?\nChandler: Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking,\ngreat personality, she’s greatness.\nMonica: Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package.\nChandler: Joey told you about the leg, huh?\nMonica: Uh-huh.\nChandler: Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it\ndid. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s\nlike ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest\nperson in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.\nJoey: (entering from his bedroom) Morning.\nChandler: (to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.\nJoey: (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?\nChandler: It came up.\nJoey: Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find\nthat funny?\n(Both Chandler and Monica walk away in disgust.)\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are getting back from the lecture.]\nRoss: (entering) So I nodded off a little.\nRachel: Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t\nmake that much noise when it hit rocks!\nRoss: Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about\nstrappy backed dresses.\nRachel: Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium\nlistening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing\nthat’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we\ndidn’t know it had!’\nRoss: First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little\nbone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.\nRachel: Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah,\nblah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.\nRoss: Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I\nwonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.\nRachel: Oh, that is so...\nRoss: No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an\nunusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake\nit off, thinking it’s alive and attacking him.)\nRachel: Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with\nme this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?\nRoss: No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I\nfeel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new\npeople, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but\nI hate that I’m not a part of it.\nRachel: It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a\npart of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like, I-I-I like\nthat you’re not involved in that part of my life.\nRoss: That’s a little clearer.\nRachel: Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I\ndo. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know,\nI’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it,\nbecause it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?\nRoss: Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Ginger are eating dinner.]\nGinger: Your thinking about my leg aren’t you?\nChandler: No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?\nGinger: It’s okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need\nto know is: ‘How much it bothers you?’ because I don’t like wasting my\ntime. Am I wasting my time?\nChandler: No. No. I don’t think so.\nGinger: Okay. It’s just like anything else, you just have to get used to\nit.\n(They start making out. She opens his shirt and feels inside and stops.)\nGinger: What’s that?\nChandler: That’s-that’s my nubbin.\nGinger: What’s a nubbin?\nChandler: It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.\nGinger: You have three nipples?\nChandler: Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...\n(starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?\nGinger: Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.\nChandler: You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?\nGinger: Ah well, it’s nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I’ll see you\nlater. Okay. (She leaves and in the hall we see her shake her shoulders like when someone\nruns their fingernails across a blackboard.)\n[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing as Leslie enters.]\nPhoebe: (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?\nLeslie: Come here, come here. (they go to the side of the stage) Okay,\ndon’t get mad, okay.\nPhoebe: Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay\nLeslie: I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.\nPhoebe: No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and\nyou just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably\nwould’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I\ncan’t trust you then just forget it.\nLeslie: No, no, I don’t want to forget it.\nPhoebe: Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important\nthing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but\nwe won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Joey are watching TV.]\nCommercial: (in the background their singing Smelly Cat) Problem odour in the\nlitter box? Don’t change your kitty, change your kitty litter.\n(Monica gets up and shuts off the TV.)\nMonica: Sorry, Pheebs.\nJoey: Yeah. You okay?\nPhoebe: Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life’s gonna had you all\nkinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a\nnew song?\nJoey: Yeah.\nMonica: We’d love too.\nPhoebe: Okay. (singing) ‘Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle\nwhore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.’ That’s all I have so far.\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the whole gang except Chandler is there.]\nChandler: (entering, happily) Well hello!\nJoey: Where have you been?\nChandler: The doctor.\nRoss: Is everything okay?\nChandler: Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no\nwaiting.\nMonica: Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.\nRachel: What?!!\nMonica: Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!\nChandler: That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it.\nWhy didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!\nEnd",
