I’ve got a good one.\nPhoebe: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.\nChandler: See that is the problem with invisible dentists.\nRoss: Why? Why can’t you go to him?\nPhoebe: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.\nChandler: That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down\nthe hygienist’s blouse.\nRachel: Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!\nPhoebe: Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,\nmy mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.\nRachel: And all these people actually died?\nPhoebe: Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of\nmy teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!\nRoss: Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened\nto die when you went to the dentist.

That’d\nbe great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica\nsarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)\nJoey: Hey-hey, Ross?\nRoss: Yeah.\nJoey: I’ve got a science question.\nRoss: Hmm?\nJoey: If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why\nthere extinct?\nRoss: Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.\nJoey: Hey-hey, I’m not judging.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are babysitting Ben.]\nRachel: (holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon.

(runs to get him)\nMonica: Because he’ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a\nbear that’s dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, you’re a genius!\nRachel: Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though.\nMonica: Give it. Give it.\nRachel: Okay.\n(Monica takes the bear, grabs his hat, and rips off his head.)\nMonica and Rachel: Oh!!\nRachel: Oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today.\n[Scene: The street, Chandler and Joey are walking past a jewelery store.]\nChandler: Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are\nnice?\nJoey: I’d really prefer a mountain bike.\nChandler: Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something\nspeacial. Come in here with me.\nJoey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something\nspeacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.\nChandler: That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba\nbirthday’. I would like to get her something serious.\nJoey: Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get\nher one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.\nChandler: All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy me\nanything ever.

Everyone.\nRachel: Hi!\nRoss: How’s my little boy?\nRachel: He’s perfect, he’s never been better.\nRoss: (noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do, take him whaling?\nBen: Monica.\nRoss: Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job Ben.\nBen: Monica bang!\nMonica: Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I\nexploded.\nPhoebe: Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is\nalive.\nJoey: Uh.\nPhoebe: What?\nJoey: Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)\n[Cut to later, all except Chandler are staring out the window at Ugly Naked Guy.]\nPhoebe: Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting\nstronger too, to bring down something that big.\nRachel: Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.\nJoey: I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.\nMonica: All right, we should call somebody.\nRoss: And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t\nmoving.\nRachel: Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.\nMonica: How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.\nJoey: Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is throwing darts, as Joey enters.]\nJoey: Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when\nwe get Chinese food?\nChandler: Yeah.\nJoey: Well, now we got a reason.\nChandler: What?\nJoey: Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.\nChandler: All right.\nJoey: Hey uh, what’s a matter?\nChandler: I talked to Janice.\nJoey: Oh my God, is she going back to him?\nChandler: She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this\nmorning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that\ntwelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the\nreciept!\nJoey: What are you ah, what are you gonna do?\nChandler: I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?\nJoey: Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.\nChandler: Come on, tell me.\nJoey: All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it\nwas me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I\nwould bow out.\nChandler: What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey\nquickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?\nJoey: They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a\nfamily, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I\nwouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna\nah, come poke a nude guy?\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross has just finished putting Ben to sleep, and is\nentering from Rachel’s room.]\nRoss: Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?\nRachel: Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no\noffense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.\nRoss: It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,\ny'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.\nRachel: (confidently) I did!\nRoss: I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.\nRachel: I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against\nthat thing!\nRoss: Monica did it?\n(Monica runs into the kitchen from the terrace.)\nRoss: Monica?\nMonica: Yeah.\nRoss: Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?\nMonica: No. Why?\nRoss: Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet\nsong, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’\nand ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.\nMonica: Really?!\nRoss: Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left\nleg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of\ny'know... (walks around in a circle)\nMonica: Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)\nRachel: I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.\nMonica: (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!\n(starts to chase Ross around the living room)\nRoss: Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!\nRachel: I’ll get the hat.\n[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Janice are there.]\nChandler: Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me\nget through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.\nJanice: Okay.\nChandler: I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy\nthat breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.\nWhenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are\nthe reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter\nhow nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.\nJanice: Wow!\nChandler: Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.\nJanice: Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say\n‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way\nI feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s been\nsinging about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my\nsoulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of our\nlives together.\nChandler: Then don’t leave me!\nJanice: What?\nChandler: Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!\nJanice: No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give my\nmarriage another chance.\nChandler: No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce\nanother chance.\nJanice: (standing up) I’m sorry. (hugs him)\nChandler: Ohhh. Don’t go.\nJanice: No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn’t\nlet her go.)\nChandler: No. No! No! No!\nJanice: Honey, honey, people are looking.\nChandler: I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I\ndon’t care!!\nJanice: Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of\nChandler’s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)\nChandler: You can’t leave! I have your shoe!\nJanice: Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)\nGunther: Rachel has those in burgendy.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are holding the\ngiant poking device.]\nJoey: All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be\ndifficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.\nRoss: Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!\nPhoebe: I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a\ndead fat guy on a stick.\nJoey: All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to advance\nthe giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.\nOkay, okay, we’re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their\nview of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the\nneedle.\n(They thread the needle and start poking him, he then stirs.)\nPhoebe: He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!\nMonica: And yet, we’re still poking him.\nJoey: Okay, retract the device, retract the device.\nRoss: He does not look happy.\nRachel: Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.\nJoey: Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is listening to a Lionel Richie album]\nChandler: (singing) I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe\nenters) I can’t resist your charms. And love....\nPhoebe: (joining him) Love....\nChandler and Phoebe: I’ll be a fool for you. I’m sure, you know I\ndon’t mind.\nChandler: (high pitched) No you know I don’t mind.\nChandler and Phoebe: Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...\nChandler: I know.\nPhoebe: I know.\nChandler: I’ve found.\nPhoebe: I’ve found....\nChandler and Phoebe: ...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched,\nChandler goes low pitched) love. (they both look at each other.) My endless\nlove. (once again they don’t match tones, and they just look at each other)\nEnd",
