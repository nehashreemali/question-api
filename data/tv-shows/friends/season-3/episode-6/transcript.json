Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of\nyou?\nPhoebe: Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem.\nRoss: I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.\nJanice: Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.\nJoey: Well, that’s really a different question.\nJanice: I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who\nspends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.\nJoey: Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.\nMonica and Rachel: What?!!\nRachel: Excuse me, there was no time!\nJoey: Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?\nJanice: Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?\nRachel: Does anybody need more coffee?\nRoss: Yeah, I’ll take some.\nJoey: Hey, there’s a dog out there!\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Monica and Phoebe’s, three years earlier, Phoebe, Monica, and Ross are\nthere]\nPhoebe: Oh, that is so unfortunate.\nRoss: What?\nPhoebe: Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.\nMonica: (entering from bedroom) Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute.

(to Ross) That’s why I moved out.\nRoss: Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister\nthat you don’t live here anymore.\nPhoebe: I think on some levels she already knows.\nRoss: Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she\ndoesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that\nyou’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.\nPhoebe: Okay, well maybe not on those levels.\nChandler: (entering, with a goatee) Hey.\nRoss: Hey.\nChandler: I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.\nPhoebe: Why, nobody good?\nChandler: Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s\nplural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need\nto make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing!\nGreat apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!\nRoss: So how many more do you have tomorrow?\nChandler: Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy,\nwho I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone\n‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’\nMonica: (entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the\nfloor or come over no more!\nRoss: (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.\nMonica: What?\nRoss: I have to go.

Because I have models here y'know......never.\nEric: Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s\nbeach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell\nyou, she’s a porn star. (Chandler breaks his pencil in half)\nChandler: Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless\nit turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers\nto shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)\n[Scene: Chandler’s, Chandler is interviewing Joey.]\nChandler: (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom.

(Joey starts to take off all\nof his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her\nwhen she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the\nlandlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you\nthirsty?\nJoey: Oh, you bet I am!\nMonica: (turning around) Okay, here’s your penis!\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: continued from earlier.]\nMonica: Oh my God!!!

Cover yourself up!\nJoey: Oh right, right.\nMonica: I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to\nyou that means they wanna have sex?\nJoey: Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.\nWell, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.\nMonica: It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know,\nbut... By the way I can still see it.\n[Scene: Monica and Phoebe’s, Monica is vacuuming.]\nMonica: Pheebs?\nPhoebe: Huh?\nMonica: Where’s your bed?\nPhoebe: It’s not in the apartment?

I-I’ve, I don’t live here\nanymore.\nMonica: What are you talking about?\nPhoebe: I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t\nknow how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!\nMonica: Everybody knows!\nPhoebe: That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica,\nI, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got\nlike a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.\nMonica: Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.\nPhoebe: Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other\nside.\nMonica: What?!?!\nPhoebe: Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a\nland where people can spill.\nMonica: You can spill. In the sink.\nPhoebe: Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I\nlove you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that\nhappening.\nMonica: I love you, too.\nPhoebe: Aww, good. (they hug) What?\nMonica: What? I’m just said.\nPhoebe: No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, (now) Joey is watching Baywatch, as Chandler enters\nfrom his bedroom.]\nChandler: So ah, whatcha watching?\nJoey: Baywatch.\nChandler: What’s it about?\nJoey: Lifeguards.\nChandler: Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who’s she?\nJoey: Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.\n(Baywatch goes into one of those running scenes.)\nChandler: Wow! Look at them run.\nJoey: They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?\nChandler: Yeah, I’ll go get one.\nJoey: No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here.\n[Scene: Monica’s, Monica is coming out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a\ntowel, as Chandler is entering.]\nChandler: Well, hello!\nMonica: Hey.\nChandler: Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.\nMonica: (all depressed) Help yourself.\nChandler: You okay?\nMonica: Phoebe moved out.\nChandler: Right.\nMonica: I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I\ndon’t have a boyfriend?\nChandler: Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I\ndon’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.\nMonica: Well, I think so.\nChandler: Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my\nfavourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.\n[Scene: the bar, Ross is entering, Phoebe is at the bar, they are the only two in the\nplace.]\nRoss: (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?\nPhoebe: Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is\nwrong?\nRoss: My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.\nPhoebe: Oh no! Why?\nRoss: ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I’m\nnot one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.\nPhoebe: Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.\nRoss: (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many\ndrinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and\nshe’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look\nat her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!\nPhoebe: Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?\nRoss: Well, now I do!!\nPhoebe: I’m sorry.\nRoss: Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the\nonly woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....\nPhoebe: Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)\n[Scene: Monica’s, Chandler and Monica are still hugging each other.]\nChandler: Umm, this is nice.\nMonica: I know, it is isn’t it?\nChandler: No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?\nMonica: Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.\nChandler: Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle\na nuclear device.\nMonica: Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.\nChandler: Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,\nit’s, it’s gonna be....\nMonica: I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)\n[Scene: the bar, Phoebe is still hugging Ross.]\nRoss: Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or\nI’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!\nPhoebe: I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross.\nYou’re, you’re really, you’re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: And you’re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And\nyou’re kind (kisses him on the lips)\nRoss: Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)\n(They pause, and they the start kissing passionately, and taking off each others\nclothes, and they start to lie down on the pool table.)\nRoss: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\nPhoebe: Huh?\n(Ross tries to clear off the pool table by knocking the balls to the other end of the\ntable, but they all bounce back, and he frantically starts to throw them into the\npockets.)\nPhoebe: Okay, it’s okay.\n(Phoebe jumps on to the table and lays down, Ross follows her and hits his head on the\nlight hanging over the pool table.)\nPhoebe: Oh. (they start kissing again)\nRoss: Wait, wait, wait.\nPhoebe: What?\nRoss: My foot is stuck in the pocket.\nPhoebe: What?\nRoss: No, I can’t get it out.\nPhoebe: Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.\nRoss: No, come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!\nPhoebe: What?\nRoss: Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)\n(They both look at each other and start laughing (Lisa almost lost it there), and sit\nup. Ross hits his head on the lamp again.)\nRoss: Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.\nPhoebe: You have chalk on your face.\nRoss: Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)\nPhoebe: Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this\nwas real grass.\nMonica: Hey, are you okay?\nRoss: My wife’s a lesbian.\nJoey: Cool!!\nChandler: Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)\nRoss: Hi.\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: the bar, Chandler is playing pool, as Rachel enters.]\nChandler: I can’t believe you came back.\nRachel: Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna\nthink. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.\n(She hits the jukebox Fonzy style, and It’s That Time of Season starts to\nplay, as they start to kiss.)\nFriend No. 2: Rachel! Rachel! (stirs Rachel from her dream, she’s in her\ncar driving back from the city)\nRachel: What?\nFriend No. 2: You missed the exit!\nRachel: Oh, sorry.\nFriend No. 1: My God, what were you thinking about?\nRachel: Um, (shyly) Barry.\nHer Friends: Awwww!!\nEnd",
