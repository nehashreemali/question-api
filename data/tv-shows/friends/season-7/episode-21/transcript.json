Four weeks!!!\nChandler: Do you realize you get louder each week?\nMonica: There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?\nChandler: I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow.\n(Laughs)\nMonica: Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.\nChandler: Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?\nMonica: No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.\nChandler: Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?\nMonica: (handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Let’s just do it right now.\nOkay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. (She goes back, sits\ndown, and starts feverishly writing.)\nChandler: (watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me\nmore than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is getting help writing his vows from Joey and\nRoss.]\nChandler: (writing) Monica, there are no words… (To Joey and Ross) There\nare no words! This should not be this hard!\nJoey: All right, uh… (To Ross) Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross,\nwell what did you say when you made up your vows?\nRoss: Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I\ndie. She made no such promise.\nChandler: I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You\nshould’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica has hit a writer’s block as Rachel and\nPhoebe enter.]\nRachel: Monica what?\nPhoebe: What?!\nRachel: What is the emergency?!\nMonica: You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I\nhave is this!

(Points.)\nMonica: Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)\nPhoebe: Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)\n[Cut to the guys.]\nRoss: Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm,\nMonica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.\nChandler: Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.\n[Flashback to when Chandler was introduced to Monica in The One With The Thanksgiving\nFlashbacks.]\nRoss: ...everyone, this is Chandler!\nFat Monica: Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.\nChandler: (seeing her) Okay.\n[Cut to the girls.]\nRachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, \"Chandler, even\nthough we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.\"\n[Flashback to The One With The Jellyfish, Chandler and Monica are lying on the beach.]\nChandler: All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on\nEarth. Would you go out with me?\nMonica: Ennnh.\n[Cut back to the girls.]\nMonica: Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!\nPhoebe: Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you\njust say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like…\n(They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the things you\ntaught him.\n[Flashback to The One With Phoebe's Uterus, Monica is teaching Chandler how to turn a\nwoman on.

(Points to one) That’s one?\nMonica: It’s kind of an important one!\nChandler: Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.\nRachel: Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that\ncould’ve meant.)\nMonica: All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,\n5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,\n6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)!

Oh, cute, cute.\nMonica: No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?\nChandler: You'll get one.\nMonica: Oh yeah? When?\nChandler: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are\nmarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?\nMonica: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?\nChandler: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.\nMonica: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?\nChandler: No, no, no.\nMonica: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?\nChandler: (trapped) Uh, uh.\nMonica: Well?\nChandler: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!

(She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)\nChandler: This is not going to work.\nMonica: I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)\nChandler: You are so great! I love you!\n(Monica stops suddenly and turns around slowly.)\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Nothing!

Stop it!\n(Joey walks in and sees Monica. He freaks out and runs back into the hallway,\nscreaming.)\n[Cut to Chandler trying to hint to Monica that he wanted to move in with her in The One\nAfter Vegas.]\nChandler:  Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?\nMonica: Then all your stuff would be here.\nChandler: Well, what if all my stuff was here?\nMonica: Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it\ndoesn’t make any sense.\nChandler: Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m\nsaying?\n[Cut to Chandler entering his and Monica’s apartment alight with a thousand\ncandles in The One With The Proposal.]\n(He walks dejectedly into his apartment to find it lit with about a thousand candles\nand Monica standing in the living room.)\nMonica: You wanted it to be a surprise.\n(He turns to look at Joey who smiles slyly and closes the door leaving them alone.)\nChandler: Oh my God.\n(Monica gets down on one knee.)\nMonica: Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.\n(Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a\nreason why girls don’t do this!\nChandler: Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God,\nI thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I\nthought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing\nthat matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.\n(Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life\ntrying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you\nmarry me?\nMonica: Yes.\n(The crowd goes wild as he puts the ring on her finger.

How’s the Mrs.?\nRachel: I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.\nJoey: (shocked) Has it been that long?!\nRoss: Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.\n[Flashback to Joey interrupting a bath Monica and Chandler are sharing in The One With\nAll The Kissing.

I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.\n[This starts a series of flashbacks starting with Monica and Chandler forcing Joey to\nkeep his new found knowledge of their secret relationship in Monica’s bedroom in The\nOne With All the Kips.]\nJoey: (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!\nMonica: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!\nJoey: How?! When?!\nChandler: It happened in London.\nJoey: IN LONDON!!!\nChandler: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a\nbig deal out of it.\nJoey: But it is a big deal!!
