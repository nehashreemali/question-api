  "transcript": "The One With Rachel’s Book\nWritten by: Andrew Reich & Ted Cohen\nTranscribed by: Eric Aasen\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, everyone is there having breakfast and Joey\nenters carrying a loaf of bread.]\nJoey: Hey!\nRoss: Hi!\nJoey: Who wants French toast?\nRoss: Oh, I’ll have some!\nJoey: Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge.\nThanks.\nMonica: (entering from her room) Oww!\nChandler: What’s the matter honey?\nMonica: I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because,\nI’m engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?\nPhoebe: It starts?\nRachel: Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!\nMonica: Okay! (Runs off.)\nChandler: (incredulous) Already?!\nRachel: Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the\ncaterers, the music…\nChandler: Oh, I got some thoughts on that.\nRachel: Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…\nRoss: Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say\nthe right name.\nMonica: (returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3\" 3-ring binder on the table.)\nChandler: What in God’s name is that?!\nRoss: Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth\ngrade!\nMonica: This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance.\n(She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then\ngeographically, then by square footage.\nPhoebe: That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it\noff now.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: A Classroom, Ross is giving a lecture.]\nRoss: And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic\nPark first! Now let’s take a look at… (Phoebe rushes in.)\nPhoebe: Hey! Ross!\nRoss: Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?\nPhoebe: I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica\nand Chandler.\nRoss: Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please\nexcuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t\nyou… (Motions that they should learn everyone’s hometown.) (To Phoebe)\nWh-what’s going on?\nPhoebe: Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just\ngot engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I\njust move in with you for a couple days?\nRoss: Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?\nPhoebe: Nothing—Why?!\nRoss: Phoebe, you said it was urgent!\nPhoebe: Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five\nminutes.\nRoss: Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?\nPhoebe: (to the students) Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want\nto come to the movies?\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel and Monica are pretty much telling\nChandler what the wedding plans are.]\nMonica: All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but\ntell me how this is for music.\nRachel: Okay.\nMonica: All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.\nRachel: Aw.\nMonica: A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing.\nWait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.\nChandler: Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore\nand Derrick… (Off of Rachel and Monica’s looks) And Derrick is a name I\nshouldn’t know.\nJoey: (sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up\none.) Y’know, something a little snugglyer?\nChandler: Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?\nJoey: Well, the duck…\nRachel: What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!\nJoey: Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was\nimmediately found and properly cleaned up!\nChandler: Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are\nactually involved in the wedding?\nMonica: Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!\nChandler: Okay.\nMonica: Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?\nChandler: Centerpieces!\nMonica: Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)\nChandler: Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just\nthink they’re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.)\nBut Lilies are the clear choice.\nMonica: Oh my God! It’s like one mind.\nChandler: Uh-huh!\nJoey: (sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m\ngonna get cranky!\nRachel: Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!\nJoey: Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck\ngot sick!\nRachel: What?!\nJoey: All right, I’m gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)\nRachel: Now Joey, what did the duck do?!\nJoey: I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!\n[Cut to Joey and Rachel’s, Joey enters and heads for his bedroom. He pushes open\nthe door to find the duck.]\nJoey: Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does not get sick\nand Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream?\n(He’s about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachel’s room. He walks\ninto her room and feels the bed.) That’s so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.)\nPillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him\nand pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.)\n(In his head.) Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar…(Stops\nreading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) …wouldn’t be home\nfor hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and\ngrabbed his…(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a\ndirty book! (Continues to read.)\n[Scene: Ross’s apartment, Phoebe has moved in and has a massage client on her\ntable she’s set up in the living room. Ross enters and is shocked to see a naked man\nlying on the table.]\nRoss: Uh, Phoebe…\nPhoebe: Oh Ross, hi.\nRoss: Phoebe, what are you doing?\nPhoebe: I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now.\nRoss: Phoebe!\nPhoebe: Okay, let’s talk outside.\n(They go into the hall.)\nRoss: Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!\nPhoebe: What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!\nRoss: And they knew about it?\nPhoebe: (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?\nRoss: Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I\nwant!\nPhoebe: Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I\njust don’t know what the big deal is!\nRoss: The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment\nwhen I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer.\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is sweeping up as Rachel enters.]\nRachel: Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?\nJoey: Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?\nRachel: No.\nJoey: Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?\nRachel: Joey, did you my face cream?\n(She walks into her bedroom.)\nJoey: Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.\n(She comes back out.)\nRachel: Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?\nJoey: Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?\nRachel: (gasps) You found my book?!\nJoey: Yeah I did!\nRachel: Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!\nJoey: Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I\nshouldn’t have, but you got porn!\nRachel: Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my\nbook. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a\nhealthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She\ngoes into her room.)\nJoey: You got porn!\n[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is coming out of the living room carrying his salad and\na puzzle—beer! Cold beer. And he decides to fold up Phoebe’s massage table, but\nbeing Ross has trouble with it as there is a knock on the door. He sets the table back up\nand opens the door to reveal a beautiful woman.]\nRoss: Hello.\nWoman: Hi, is uh Phoebe here?\nRoss: Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night.\nWoman: Ohh great.\nRoss: Can I, can I help you with something?\nWoman: Well, I don’t know. Are you a masseur?\nRoss: (deadpan) Yes I am.\nWoman: Great! (Calls down the hall) Dad! (Her old father walks in.) Thank you so\nmuch, I’ll be back to pick him up in an hour. (She walks away.)\n(Ross isn’t happy and closes the door slowly.)\n[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are having dinner with her parents.]\nMrs. Geller: So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when\nyou told them you were engaged.\nChandler: Oh yeah, I should probably call them.\nMr. Geller: I remember when we first got engaged.\nChandler: Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.\nMonica: Oh dad, really you don’t need to…\nMr. Geller: (ignoring her) Well, I’d gotten Judy pregnant. I still\ndon’t know that happened.\nMrs. Geller: (incredulous) You don’t know how that happened?! Your dog\nthought my diaphragm was a chew toy!\nChandler: What a sweet story.\nMonica: Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your\nfifth grade Halloween party.\nMr. Geller: What?! They wanted a scary story!\nMonica: Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I\nguess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.\n(Chandler and her laugh, but her parents don’t.) What?\nMrs. Geller: You tell her Jack, I can’t do it.\nMonica: What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?\nMr. Geller: We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: A Restaurant, scene continued from before the break.]\nMonica: I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!\nMrs. Geller: We’re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married\nafter you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself.\nMonica: You bought the beach house when I was 23!\nMr. Geller: Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t put\na price on that sweetie.\nMrs. Geller: We really do feel bad about this though.\nMr. Geller: We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that\nwent to hell, so we redid the kitchen.\nMonica: What about when I started dating Chandler?\nMrs. Geller: Well it was Chandler! We didn’t think he’d ever\npropose!\nChandler: Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.\n(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)\nMonica: I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!\nMrs. Geller: We might still have some money, if your father didn’t\nthink it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.\nMr. Geller: It seemed like such a simple idea.\nMrs. Geller: Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.\nMr. Geller: All right, enough! I don’t want to hear about it anymore!\n(Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)\n[Scene: Ross's apartment, his massage client is on the table and Ross is reluctantly\nstarting his massage. He spreads some lotion in his hands, and doesn’t like it.]\nRoss: Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh,\nthat’s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage\nhim with those.)\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are returning from dinner,\nRachel is already there.]\nMonica: I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay\nfor it?\nChandler: I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth\nwedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he\nsaves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.\nRachel: Well what happened at dinner?\nMonica: My parents spent the money for our wedding!\nPhoebe: (gasps) My God! What did you order?!\nRachel: Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are\ngonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!\nChandler: Honey, it’s gonna be okay.\nMonica: No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing\nband! No lilies!\nRachel: No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t\nhave to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you\ndon’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off\nthe rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)\nChandler: Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love\neach other and that we’re gonna get married.\nRachel: Do you even understand what off the rack means?!\nPhoebe: Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?\nMonica: How? I don’t have any money.\nChandler: Well, I have some.\nMonica: How much?\nChandler: Well, close to… (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to\nwrite it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)\nMonica: Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!\nRachel: Well what?! How-how much is it?!\nMonica: It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.\nRachel: Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!\nMonica: (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the\namount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!\nRachel: (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.\nChandler: Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the\nwedding?\nRachel and Monica: Ah, yeah!\nChandler: Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I\nkinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.\nPhoebe: (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr.\nChandler.\nMonica: This is the most special day of our lives.\nChandler: No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the\nmoney on one party.\nMonica: Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a\nparty one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always\nearn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once.\nChandler: Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer\nis no.\nMonica: You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?\nChandler: Yes, I am!\nPhoebe: Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.\n[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are there as Rachel enters and sees Joey sitting\nthere.]\nJoey: Hey Rach.\nRachel: (quietly) Joey.\nJoey: Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?\nRachel: Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.\nJoey: No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on\nfire.\nRachel: Well no, I don’t smell anything.\nJoey: Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.\nRoss: (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?\nRachel: Nothing!\nRoss: (takes a drink) Damn, this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I\nheat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)\nRachel: Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!\nRoss: So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?\nRachel: Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with\nyou. (Exits.)\nRoss: (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons\nof porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) ‘Sup?\nPhoebe: (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!\nRoss: (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I’m sorry?\nPhoebe: My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy\nthat worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.\nRoss: (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!\nPhoebe: He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.\nRoss: Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him\naccu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a\nmop.\nPhoebe: Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars\na week!\nRoss: Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that\ndidn’t move his-his appointment.\nPhoebe: Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You\ncould’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down\nhis back!\nRoss: He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m\nsorry.\nJoey: Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?\nRoss: His daughter was hot.\nJoey: Gotcha.\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as\nMonica enters.]\nMonica: Hey.\nChandler: Hey.\nMonica: Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask\nyou to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for\nthat.\nChandler: Ehh.\nMonica: Eh, you work for that.\nChandler: Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should\nspend all of the money on the wedding.\nMonica: You do?!\nChandler: Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told\nyou that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes\nyou happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.\nMonica: Oh, you’re so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about\nour, what about the future and stuff?\nChandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,\ny’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.\nMonica: You thought about that?\nChandler: Yeah.\nMonica: How many kids were we gonna have?\nChandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.\nMonica: What else did you think about?\nChandler: Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place\noutside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know,\nwe could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it\nran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage\nwhere Joey could grow old.\nMonica: (laughs) Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding.\nChandler: Sure you do.\nMonica: No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.\nChandler: You sure?\nMonica: Uh-hmm.\nChandler: I love you so much.\nMonica: I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were\ntalkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.\nChandler: Oh yeah, totally!\nMonica: Oh good.\nEnding Credits\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is balancing her checkbook as Joey enters from his\nroom wearing a hockey helmet, gloves, and shin guards.]\nJoey: Hello, Zelda.\nRachel: Who are you supposed to be?\nJoey: The vicar!\nRachel: Do you even know what a vicar is?\nJoey: Like a goalie, right?\nRachel: (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keep\nmaking these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m\nnot—it’s just not funny anymore!\nJoey: All right, I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m\nsorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)\nRachel: All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?!\nLet’s do it!\nJoey: Huh?\nRachel: (starting to move closer to him) That’s right, I wanna do it with\nyou! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.\nJoey: (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)\nRachel: (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’\nso long to get on that body!\nJoey: This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)\nRachel: Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!\nJoey: Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife\nthere in-in chapter seven.\nRachel: Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But,\nI would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride! (He backs into\nthe door.)\nJoey: I don’t want to, I’m scared.\n(Rachel walks away, pleased with her self.)\nEnd",
