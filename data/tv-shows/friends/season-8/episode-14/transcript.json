We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they\ndon’t like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)\nChandler: Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks?\nMaybe we can take it back?\nMonica: No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?\nChandler: How about to the street say from the balcony?\nMonica: Why don’t we just find a place for it?\nChandler: Okay. How about in that cabinet?\nMonica: No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely\nforgotten everything you learned at orientation?\nChandler: How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the\nbathroom.)\nMonica: Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?\nChandler: Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and\nrelax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.)\nIt’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?\nMonica: No reason. I-I keep private things in there.\nChandler: Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never\nseen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?\nMonica: Feminine stuff.\nChandler: Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!\nMonica: Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me\nyou-you’ll let it go.\nChandler: Fine.\nMonica: Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)\nChandler: (walking casually away) Love you.\nPhoebe: (entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!\nChandler: Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like\nthree years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said,\n\"If it helps!\" (Goes to the bedroom.)\nPhoebe: Why won’t you let me massage you?\nMonica: Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be\nself-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.\nPhoebe: Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!\nMonica: That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!\nPhoebe: I’m curious about the human body.\nMonica: Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.\nPhoebe: But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if\nyou’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?\nMonica: Okay, if it means that much to you…\nPhoebe: It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking?\nOr-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.\nMonica: Dinosaurs.\nPhoebe: Potato, potaato.\n[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Rachel are there as Ross enters.]\nRoss: Hey!\nJoey: Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!\nRoss: What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into\ntrouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs\nRachel’s belly.)\nRachel: It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do\n(Mimics him) that again.\nRoss: Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?\nRachel: Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was\nsleeping…\nJoey: A dreamless sleep.\nRoss: My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda\nwish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.\nJoey: Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.\nRoss: Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here.\nHere’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it!\nI’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you\nwant is ice cream.\nJoey: Wow! Can I get a copy of that?\n[Scene: Phoebe's Apartment, Monica is lying on the massage table waiting for Phoebe.]\nPhoebe: (calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?\nMonica: Yes.\n(Phoebe turns on some music and grabs some oil.)\nPhoebe: (in a soothing voice) Great, let’s begin. (She starts the massage.)\nHow’s the pressure?\nMonica: Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!\nPhoebe: Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.\nMonica: No. Ooohh…\nPhoebe: That’s right, you just enjoy.\nMonica: (in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!\nPhoebe: (getting uncomfortable) Okay.\nMonica: Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh that’s it! That’s\nit! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh… (Covers both\nears and continues the massage with her elbows.)\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler has a box of keys and is trying them on the\nsecret closet when someone enters.]\nChandler: I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open\nyour closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)\nJoey: Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?\nChandler: Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s\nin it.\nJoey: Why not?\nChandler: I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I\ncan’t see?!\nJoey: I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard.\nChandler: Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?\nJoey: Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and\neating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!\nChandler: And here we go…\nJoey: I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was\nbehind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs\ncame pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to\nrespect your wife’s privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the\ndoor.) Stupid closet full of bugs!\nRachel: Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I\ndon’t—Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)\nJoey: Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant\nthey got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.\nRachel: Really?\nJoey: Absolutely. But, we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be\nsure, okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on.\nRachel: Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!\nJoey: Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything’s gonna be\nfine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing\nbones!\n[Scene: The Hospital, Joey is in the waiting room as Rachel comes back out with the\ndoctor.]\nJoey: Hey! So?\nDr. Long: She’s fine. She’s experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions,\nmild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.\nRachel: Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton\nthingies?\nJoey: So but everything is normal.\nDr. Long: Absolutely.\nJoey: And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?\nDr. Long: No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don’t know what they\nare, but she’s fine.\nRachel: Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so\nnice and calm.\nJoey: Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my\nlife!\nRachel: But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.\nJoey: Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!\nRachel: But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!\nJoey: You sure?!\nRachel: Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus\nthough. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?\nJoey: (seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!\nRoss: (rushes in) Is everything okay?\nRachel: Yeah, everything’s fine!\nRoss: Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?\nJoey: Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.\nRoss: Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.\nRachel: Okay, no uterus, no opinion.\nJoey: Hey uh, what’s with the candy?\nRoss: Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie\ntheater.\nRachel: Oh you went to the movies by yourself?\nRoss: No I—Mona!\nRachel: Oh, I gotta go back in there.\nRoss: What? Why? What’s wrong?\nRachel: No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…\nRoss: No really, you tell me what’s up.\nRachel: I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)\nRoss: (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.\nJoey: Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big\ndeal.\nRoss: Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.\nDr. Long: (To Joey) Uh, if you have any questions, here’s some information\non Braxton-Hicks. (Hands Joey a pamphlet.) Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by\nbringing her in. You’re gonna make a wonderful father.\nJoey: Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He\nbrought Twizlers!\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Joey and Chandler are still working on the door.]\nChandler: There has got to be a way!\nJoey: Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?\nChandler: Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-old\ngirl.\nJoey: Then why do you throw like one?\nChandler: Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.\nJoey: Sure. \"Monica.\"\nChandler: So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?\nJoey: Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any\nday now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found\nthat quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just—I wish I didn’t feel this way\nabout Rachel anymore, y’know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love\nliving with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think…I\nthink Ross feels left out. Y’know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the\ndoctor thought I was the father. God… You should’ve seen the look on Ross’s\nface. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m\njust locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?\nChandler: That’s a good idea.\nJoey: Yeah.\nChandler: Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh,\nRoss is kinda bummed huh?\nJoey: Oh, I just…I feel terrible.\nChandler: Well, it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to\nthe hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring\nan all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the\ndoor.) Richard? If-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?\n[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch as Monica enters.]\nMonica: Hey.\nPhoebe: Hey.\nMonica: I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!\nPhoebe: No-no, I got that.\nMonica: So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?\nPhoebe: Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200\nan hour.\nMonica: Okay.\nPhoebe: I mean $500.\nMonica: What?\nPhoebe: 600.\nMonica: What’s going on?\nPhoebe: Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!\nMonica: What? (Laughs.)\nPhoebe: Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to\nhurt you and it just spurred you on.\nMonica: What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I\nmake!\nPhoebe: Really? There’s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God!\nOhh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?!\n(Pause) I mean hi.\nMonica: Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get\nmassaged again!\nPhoebe: No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I\nhave, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!\nMonica: Really?!\nPhoebe: Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again.\nCome back and-and we’ll work through it.\nMonica: Are you sure?\nPhoebe: Yes.\nMonica: I guess.\nPhoebe: Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you\nhear something you liked?\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is balancing an aluminum can on her stomach as Ross\nenters.]\nRachel: Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!\nRoss: Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.\nRachel: Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the\nsandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?\nRoss: Well yeah!\nRachel: Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)\nRoss: What?! What?! Rach what?!\nJoey: What’s going on?\nRoss: I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.\nJoey: Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.\nRoss: (to Rachel) I-I’m sorry Rach, I didn’t know. Are you gonna be\nokay?\nRachel: Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that\nsandwich is gone when I get out there?\nJoey: I’m on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)\nRoss: I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw\nup!\nJoey: Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.\nRoss: Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it\nand I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.\nRachel: (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.\nJoey: Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: What’s up?\nJoey: Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.\nRachel: (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?\nJoey: The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lot\nof the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…\nRachel: Yeah?\nJoey: Maybe you two should live together.\nRachel: Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?\nJoey: Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if\nyou’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.\nRachel: But Joey, I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment\nand disrupt his life like that. I mean—(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—Or\nhe does.\nRoss: No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just\ntry it like on a temporary basis.\nRachel: But Ross, its you and me!\nRoss: So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And\nI’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour\nago! What is wrong with me?!\nJoey: All right now, so? What do you think?\nRachel: I don’t know. Is it crazy?\nRoss: No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.\nJoey: Well, I was due.\nRachel: Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in.\nRoss: Really?\nRachel: Yeah.\nRoss: Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. (They hug and Joey breathes\na sigh of relief.)\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is pounding out the hinge pins on the closet\ndoor to get it open.]\nChandler: Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’s\ntools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what’s behind the\ngreen door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!\nMonica: (entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!\nChandler: (laughs) You’re messy.\nMonica: Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!\nChandler: I married Fred Sanford!\nMonica: No Chandler, you don’t understand! (Chandler starts singing the\ntheme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay!\nFine! Now you know. Okay? I’m y’know…I’m sick.\nChandler: No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because\nyou’re organized, I love you in spite of that.\nMonica: Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?\nChandler: Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around\ncan we, can we share the closet.\nMonica: Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is drinking a gallon of orange juice as Chandler\nenters.]\nChandler: Hey.\nJoey: Hey.\nChandler: So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?\nJoey: Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because\nRachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice\nwith calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so\nit’s got a bit of a kick.\nChandler: Are you okay?\nJoey: Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m better\nthan great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff\naround here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around naked\nagain. Y’know?

All alone. Forever. What’s a\nwolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Phoebe's Apartment, Phoebe is giving Monica another massage.]\nMonica: Ohhh.\nPhoebe: That’s it. Just relax.\nMonica: Ohh. Oh!
