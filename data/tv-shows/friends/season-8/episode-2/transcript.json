(He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps?\nShampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?\nRoss: Why not? It’s built into the price of the room.\nChandler: Yeah but you don’t need—(Picks up something)—What is\nthis?\nRoss: Thread!\nChandler: Score! Where are the disposable cameras?\nRoss: What disposable cameras?\nChandler: The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?\nRoss: No you didn’t.\nChandler: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I\nsaid…\nRoss: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and\nmy Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, \"Why do\nthey call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?\" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did\nthat.\nChandler: So you don’t have the cameras?!\nRoss: No. Sorry man.\nChandler: So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!\nRoss: Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel.\nI’ll-I’ll help you look for them.\nChandler: Great.\nRoss: In-in three minutes.\n(Chandler goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and then opens it again right away.\nRoss looks up and hands him the toilet paper Ross already packed.)\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is entering to see Monica sitting in front of a\nmound of wedding gifts.]\nPhoebe: Hey!\nMonica: Hey!\nPhoebe: Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?\nMonica: No! (Pause) But, they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this little\nguy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t\nmind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?\nPhoebe: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old\nwoman.\n(Monica opens it anyways.)\nMonica: A tiny salt shaker!!!\nPhoebe: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!\nMonica: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.\nPhoebe: Oh yeah.\nMonica: Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of\nthem.\nPhoebe: Okay.\nMonica: Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I\nmean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?\nPhoebe: Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set.\nY’know, it’s probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)\nMonica: Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)\nRachel: (entering) Hi.\nMonica: Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?\nRachel: Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?\nMonica: No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks\nthat Phoebe’s pregnant.\nPhoebe: Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He\nhasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for\nthe woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.\nRachel: Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a\nfew more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.\nPhoebe: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first\nfloor?\nRachel: Ew! No!\nPhoebe: What?! I think he’s cute.\nRachel: Well then you have his baby.\nPhoebe: Believe me I’m trying.\nMonica: Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy\ntoday and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.\nPhoebe: Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life\nforever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual\nmagnetism.\nRachel: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.\nPhoebe: Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue!\nHe’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I\nrock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.\nRachel: Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not\ngonna ask him for anything.\nPhoebe: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s\nwalking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!\nMonica: What was that bam?\nPhoebe: I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.\nJoey: (entering) Hey!\nRachel: Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that\nshe was pregnant?\nJoey: (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have\nan accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that\nSunglass Hut!\nRachel: Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody\npregnant!\nJoey: Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.)\nIs somebody pregnant?\nPhoebe: Oh yeah. That’s me.\nJoey: Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?\nPhoebe: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe\nhug.)\nJoey: Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?\nPhoebe: You don’t know him.

Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down\nand kick his ass!\nPhoebe: David Lynn.\nJoey: David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits)\nMonica: Who’s David Lynn?\nPhoebe: Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.\n[Scene: The Banquet Room, Chandler is under one of the tables as Ross enters.]\nRoss: Chandler?\nChandler: Hey! Did you find the cameras?\nRoss: No. Did you?\nChandler: Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.\nRoss: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager,\nno-one’s turned them.\nChandler: Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing\nthat was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.\nRoss: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?\nChandler: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t\nbelieve I screwed this up!\nRoss: I’m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here’s\na thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of\ndressed up people.\nChandler: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?\nRoss: No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at\nthe gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make\nsure not to get anybody else’s faces.\nChandler: Are you serious?\nRoss: I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you\nreally want to start your life together by letting her down?\nChandler: Marriage advice? Really?!\nRoss: I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t\nthese the same flowers?\nChandler: I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.\nRoss: What about the chairs?\nChandler: She picked those out too.\nRoss: How about the place settings?\nChandler: That was her.\nRoss: What did you do?\nChandler: I was in charge of the cameras!

I haven’t told him yet and I\ndon’t think I can tell him at all now!\nPhoebe: Why not?\nRachel: I don’t know, let me think.

You kept saying how huge this all\nis!\nPhoebe: Well-well but it is huge.\nRachel: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I\ndidn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.\nPhoebe: You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it\nover with. It’s like, it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick\nand painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of…See?\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has now opened more of the wedding\ngifts.]\nJoey: (entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?\nMonica: No! No!

I know who the father is… (She walks into Monica\nand Chandler’s.)\nMonica: People have got to finish their stories!\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: The Banquet Room, Ross and Chandler are in their tuxes and have started to fake\nthe pictures.]\nChandler: (to another couple) Uh, excuse me?

Go!\nRachel: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?\nPhoebe: I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty\nblond girl with an ass that won’t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I\nbelieve this belongs to the father of your baby.\nRachel: Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?\nPhoebe: Uh-huh.

But y’know you do wear that\nsweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?\nTag: Y’know, I’m actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool\nand Rachel sits down.)

Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!\n(Throws them into his chest.)\nRoss: Huh, didn’t see that coming.\nChandler: Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture\nof my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure\nyou’ll remember. So we don’t need—(Rips the picture)—There’s no\nneed to have this picture.
