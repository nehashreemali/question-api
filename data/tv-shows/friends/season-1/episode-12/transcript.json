Uh, I just\nliked it better before it was better...\n(Phoebe scoots her chair over to Rachel and hugs her)\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is telling everyone how it went across the hall as\nthe foosball game continues.]\nPhoebe: I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now,\nso...\nMonica: We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching\nplaces with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game!\nCome on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)\nRoss: (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your\nbutts.\nJoey: No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there\nteam.\nRoss: Come on, two on one.\nChandler: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's\ntime for you to swoop in!\nRoss: What, now?\nJoey: Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out\nof there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's\nnot! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!\nChandler: My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her.\nYou pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off\ninto the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is throwing Paolo's clothes over the side.]\nPaolo: No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...\n[Cut to inside the apartment.]\nRoss: (entering) How's it going?\nMonica: Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony,\nnow there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in\nfront of her chest), Ok, that is either, \"How could you?\" or, \"Enormous\nbreasts!\" Here he comes!\nPhoebe: Ooh!\n(Paolo enters. Ross, Phoebe, and Monica scatter)\nPaolo: Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.\nPhoebe: Oh, ok bye-bye.\nMonica: Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a\nlasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.\nPaolo: Grazie.\nRoss: Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I\nsay... (shuts door in his face and walks away)\nPhoebe: Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)\nRoss: Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's\nnot overwhelmed...\nMonica: Oh, you're right.\nRoss: (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.\n[Cut to the balcony, Ross has just climbed through the window.]\nRoss: Hey.\nRachel: Hey.\nRoss: You all right?\nRachel: Ooh, I've been better...\nRoss: Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than\nhim...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he\nhas you.\nRachel: Oh, Ross...\nRoss: What?\nRachel: I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want\nto think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)\nRoss: Huh.\nRachel: Oh Ross, you're so great!\nRoss: Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)\n[Cut to inside the apartment, Rachel and Ross are entering.]\nMonica: Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?\nRachel: Oh...\nPhoebe: You ok?\nRachel: ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?\nPhoebe: Yep!\nRoss: See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the\nanswer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated\nscreening process.\nRachel: No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to\nfigure out what I want\nRoss: Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.\nRachel: No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up\nto be one.\nRoss: (astonished) What?\nRachel: What?\nRoss: I-I'm, I'm having a boy?\nRachel: Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.\nRoss: Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?\nGirls: Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)\nRoss: I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!\n(Joey and Chandler run in)\nChandler: Wha-\nJoey: Wha-\nJoey and Chandler: What is it?\nRoss: I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!\nJoey: Hey!\nChandler: Hey!\nJoey and Chandler: We already knew that! (they hug)\nRoss: I'm having a son. Um...\n(Ross looks scared)\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Monica is busy killing Chandle and Joey at foosball.]\nMonica: Yes! And that would be a shut-down!\nJoey and Chandler: Shut-out!! (They both start heading for\ntheir rooms.)\nMonica: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!\nJoey: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!\nChandler: Yeah, get out!\nMonica: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use\nmy left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I\ngotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.\nChandler: (to Joey) One more game?\nJoey: Oh yeah!\nEnd",
