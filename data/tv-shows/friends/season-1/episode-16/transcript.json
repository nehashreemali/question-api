  "transcript": "The One With Two Parts, part 1\nWritten by: Marta Kauffman & David Crane\nTranscribed by: Mindy Mattingly\nWith Minot Adjustments by: Tennant Stuart\n[Scene: Rift’s Restaurant, as seen in Mad About You, Joey and Chandler are\nthere.]\nChandler: This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a\ncartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now.\n(Ursula Buffay, Phoebe’s identical twin sister, is waiting on tables in her\ninimitable manner.)\nJoey: There’s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?\n(Ursula spins around looking puzzled, quite unable to tell where the sound is coming\nfrom.)\nChandler: It’s Phoebe! Hi!\n(Ursula notices Joey waving his hand, and comes over.)\nUrsula: Hi. Okay, will that be all?\nChandler: Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?\nUrsula: Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, \"Excuse me, hello\nMiss,\" so now I’m here.\nJoey: No, no... how come you are working here?\nUrsula: Right, yeah, ’cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are\nreally cute.\nChandler: Can we start over?\nUrsula: Yeah. Okay great. I’m gonna be over here. (She wanders away.)\nChandler and Joey: No, no, no!\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: A wintry February day in New York City, snowplows are clearing the streets.\nInside Central Perk, all three girls are paying court to Ross.]\nRoss: I don’t know whether he’s testing me, or just acting out, but my\nmonkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine,\n\"supposedly\" by accident.\nRachel: No, yeah, I’ve done that.\nRoss: And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and\npeed all over the crossword.\nRachel: I’ve never done that.\n(Outside in the street, Joey and Chandler arrive, to peer through the window at Phoebe,\nby bending down to look underneath the shop’s sign—a large steaming cup of\ncoffee.)\nChandler: All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like\nher sister.\nJoey: I’m sayin’ I see a difference.\nChandler: They’re twins!\nJoey: I don’t care. Phoebe’s Phoebe. Ursula’s... hot!\n(Joey and Chandler come indoors.)\nChandler: You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?\nJoey: Yeah.\nChandler: Let’s not do that any more.\n(They hang up their coats and scarves, then approach their friends on the main sofa.)\nAll: Hey guys! Hey!\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.\nPhoebe: Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.\nJoey: Nope.\nPhoebe: Morly Safer.\nJoey: Nope.\nPhoebe: The woman who cuts my hair!\nMonica: Okay, look, this could be a really long game.\nChandler: Your sister Ursula.\nPhoebe: (Her face dropping) Oh, really.\nChandler: Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...\nPhoebe: Rift’s. Yeah, I know.\nChandler: Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years.\nPhoebe: Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?\nJoey: Not from where I was standin’.\nPhoebe: (Turning to Chandler) where were you standing?\nRachel: Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don’t get along?\nPhoebe: It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone\nalways thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to\nstart walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it\nwas like \"yeah, right, well what else is new?\"\nRoss: Oh, Pheebs, I’m sorry, I’ve got to go. I’ve got Lamaze class.\nChandler: Oh, and I’ve got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.\nRachel: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?\nRoss: No, Susan’s gonna be there too. We’ve got dads, we’ve got\nlesbians, the whole parenting team.\nRachel: Well, isn’t, isn’t that gonna be weird?\nRoss: No, no. (Distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) I mean, it mighta been\nat first, but by now I, I think I’m pretty comfortable with the whole situation.\nMonica: Ross, that’s my jacket.\nRoss: I know.\n(Rachel grins as Ross removes the girlie jacket, grabs his own, and rushes out.)\n[Scene: The Lamaze class, several couples and one trio sit on the floor, introducing\nthemselves to the teacher, who’s got as far as a woman sitting next to Ross, Carol,\nand Susan.]\nWoman: Hi, we’re the Rostins. Err, I’m J.C., and he’s Michael, and\nwe’re having a boy, and a girl.\nTeacher: Good for you. Alrighty, next?\nRoss: Hi, um, I’m err, (has to clear his throat) I’m Ross Geller, and err\nah... (pats Carol’s bulge) ..that’s, that’s my boy in there, and uh,\n(points) this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol’s,\njust, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherent\nuntil) ..who’s next?\nTeacher: I’m sorry, I didn’t get... Susan is?\nRoss: Susan is Carol’s, Carol’s, Carol’s, friend...\nCarol: Life partner.\nRoss: Like buddies.\nSusan: Like lovers.\nRoss: You know how close women can get.\n(The teacher smiles, but her eyebrows go up. Susan and Carol pat each other\naffectionately.)\nCarol: Susan and I live together.\nRoss: Although I was married to her.\nSusan: Carol, not me.\nRoss: Err, right.\nCarol: It’s a little complicated.\nRoss: A little.\nSusan: But we’re fine.\nRoss: Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah!\nThat’s like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.\n[Scene : Chandler's Office, Chandler is working.]\n(Helen’s buzzer is heard on the intercom, so Chandler presses his button, too.)\nChandler: And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen.\nHelen: (Over the intercom) Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.\nChandler: Oh, okay. Send her in.\n(He hurriedly checks his hair in his computer screen, before taking a sporting trophy\nfrom a drawer to place ostentatiously on his desk. An attractive young woman opens the\ndoor.)\nNina: Hi.\nChandler: Hi, Nina. Come on in.\nNina: You wanted to see me?\nChandler: Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and little\nthing, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.\nNina: Which is bad, because?\nChandler: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.\nNina: Your... excuse me?\nChandler: WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...\nNina: Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won’t happen again. I\nwouldn’t want to do anything to hurt your... \"wenus.\"\n(Nina beams flirtatiously at Chandler, who catches her drift, but for once he’s\nlost for something to say &ndash; so she nods her head to tell him that he’s\nthinking correctly...)\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross, Chandler, and the girls are dividing some Chinese\ntakeout, while the sitcom Family Matters is playing on the TV.]\nChandler: It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that...\nshe’s really really cute.\nRoss: It doesn’t matter. You don’t dip your pen in the company ink.\n(Marcel scampers about, interfering with the neatness.)\nMonica: Ross, your little creature’s got the remote again.\nRoss: Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the\nremote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...\n(Marcel points the remote at Monica’s television, pressing a particular\ncombination of keys. The logo SAP appears on the screen, and suddenly the dialogue is\ndubbed into Spanish.)\nMonica: Great.\nRoss: Relax, I’ll fix it.\nRachel: (Looking at the television) Cool... \"Urkel\" in Spanish is\n\"Urkel.\"\nRoss: (looking at the remote) How did he do this?\nChandler: (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the\nChristmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?\n(Rachel slowly spins around, finally noticing that the lights have outstayed their\nwelcome.)\nMonica: Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New\nYear’s... but obviously someone forgot.\nRachel: Well, someone was supposed to write \"Rach, take down the\nlights\" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monica’s note\nstuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?\n(Joey enters, looking extremely pleased with himself.)\nChandler: Hey, where you been?\nJoey: I went back to Riff’s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was\ncoffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four\nplates of curly fries.\nChandler: Score.\nJoey: She is so hot!\nChandler: Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run\nit by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)\nJoey: Pheebs?\nPhoebe: (Jumping up) Yeah?\nJoey: You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?\nPhoebe: Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?\nJoey: So that if we went out on a date, she’d be there.\nPhoebe: Well, I mean, I’m not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and um...\nI mean, it’s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we’ve grown apart,\nso, um... I don’t know, why not? Okay.\nJoey: Cool, thanks.\n(He happily gestures at Chandler that there was nothing to worry about, then exits.\nRachel and Monica are concerned for poor Phoebe, who slides back down next to Ross.)\nRoss: You okay?\nPhoebe: Yeah I’m fine.\nRoss: You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?\n(The sitcom begins with its familiar refrain, yet with a Latin lilt. Rachel and Monica\ndo a little dance with their chopsticks, and Phoebe has to grin as Ross joins in the\nrhythm.)\n[Scene: Lamaze class. Susan is there. Each couple has a doll, for they have just\nfinished learning how to change a diaper. As Ross rushes in, stepping on the Rostins’\npretend baby, squashing its head flat. It bleats, in protest. He performs emergency\nsurgery, then hands the doll back to J.C.]\nRoss: Sorry.\nRoss: Hi. Sorry I’m late. Where’s, where’s Carol?\nSusan: Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I’ll get the\ninformation.\nRoss: No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know\nwhat’s going on.\nSusan: Oh, good. This’ll be fun.\nTeacher: Alrighty. We’re gonna start with some basic third stage breathing\nexercises, so Mummies, why don’t you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be\nsupporting Mummy’s head.\n(Ross and Susan each gesture for the other to lie down.)\nRoss and Susan: What? What? What?\nSusan: I am supposed to be the mommy?\nRoss: Okay, I’m gonna play my sperm card one more time.\nSusan: Look, I don’t see why I should have to miss out on the coaching\ntraining just because I’m a woman.\nRoss: I see. So what do you propose to do?\nSusan: I will flip you for it.\nRoss: Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!\nSusan: (Triumphantly) On your back... Mom.\n(Ross gets down like all the other mothers, cradled in Susan’s lap like all the\nother fathers.)\nTeacher: Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.\n(Forgetting herself, Susan does the \"Mommy\" action with Ross.)\nTeacher: Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.\n(Ross comes out of character to glare into the distance.)\n[Scene: Chandler's Office. Chandler is playing with a toy as his boss Mr. Douglas\nknocks and opens the door.]\nChandler: Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?\nMr. Douglas: Ohh, it’s been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.\nChandler: And?\nMr. Douglas: It’s pretty ugly. We haven’t seen an ANUS this bad since the\nseventies.\nChandler: So what does this mean?\nMr. Douglas: Well, we’re gonna be layin’ off people in every department.\nChandler: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my\nhair was very very &ndash;\nMr. Douglas: Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?\n[Scene: Chandler's Office, later that day, Nina is in his office.]\nChandler: Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In\npain) Nina.\n(She sympathetically reaches out to fondle the inner thigh of his left leg.)\nNina: Are you okay?\nChandler: (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I\ncalled you in here today was, err... please don’t hate me.\nNina: (Taking her hand away) What?\nChandler: (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?\n(Nina gasps in surprise and relief.)\n[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is at the counter, serving coffee to Phoebe.]\nRachel: So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?\nPhoebe: Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.\nRachel: Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?\nPhoebe: Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.\nRachel: Ooh, okay... good.\n(Jamie Buchman and Fran Devanow enter the coffee house. They look about them as Jamie\nremoves her coat and scarf.)\nJamie: What is this place?\nFran: Look, you’re cold, I have to pee, and... (indicating the sign)\n..there’s a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?\n(Jamie notices Phoebe sitting at the counter.)\nJamie: I think we have an answer.\nFran: What’s she doing here?\nJamie: This could be God’s way of telling us to eat at home.\nFran: Think she got fired at Riff’s?\nJamie: No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... (shuddering at the memory)\n..bringing swordfish. (Indicating the ladies’ bathroom) are you gonna go to the, um?\nFran: I’m gonna wait till after we order. It’s her, right.\nJamie: It looks like her.\n(Phoebe walks by, ignoring the two strangers.)\nJamie: Um, excuse me.\nPhoebe: Yeah?\nJamie: Hi, it’s us.\nPhoebe: (Smiling blankly) Right, and it’s me.\nJamie: So, so you’re here too?\nPhoebe: Much as you are.\nJamie: (Without moving her lips) Your turn.\nFran: Err... we know what we want.\nPhoebe: (Philosophically) Oh, that’s good.\nJamie: All we want is two Caffe Lattes.\nFran: And some biscottie cookies.\nPhoebe: Good choice.\n(Phoebe turns away so that the two weird women won’t see the face she pulls, and\nsits down.)\nJamie: Definitely her.\nFran: Yeah.\nCommercial break\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Phoebe is watching a Spanish version\nof The Waltons. At a nearby table sit Monica knitting, Rachel winding a ball of wool, and\nChandler supplying them both from a skein which is spread between his hands.]\n(Phoebe uses the remote to stop the Spanish by turning off the television.)\nMonica: I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl she\ndoesn’t have a job yet?\nChandler: Well, you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.\nMonica: Congratulations, I think you’ve found the world’s thinnest\nargument.\nChandler: I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?\nRachel: Oh, well, that shouldn’t be so hard, now that you’re dating.\n(Imitating men at their worst) \"Sweetheart, you’re fired, but how ’bout a\nquickie before I go to work?\"\n(Joey lets himself in, carrying a large paper shopping bag.)\nJoey: Hey.\nRachel and Chandler: Hey.\n(There is a loud knocking at the door through which Joey has just entered.)\nChandler: You know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any more.\nMonica: I’ll get it.\n(She rises, dragging Chandler along by the wool. Rachel has to leap over a chair to\nfollow them. Monica opens the door to find Mr. Heckles standing there.)\nMonica: Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.\nMr.Heckles: You’re doing it again.\nMonica: We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking,\nquietly.\nMr.Heckles: I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can’t sleep.\nRachel: You don’t even have cats.\nMr.Heckles: I could have cats.\nMonica: (Closing the door) Goodbye Mr.Heckles.\nRachel: We’ll try to keep it down.\n(The wool-bound trio returns to the table. Rachel has to rush ahead to avoid becoming\ntangled. Joey brings the shopping bag over to Phoebe, and takes out a nice cardigan.)\nJoey: Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make\nsure it fits.\nPhoebe: Ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the cardigan in\nher lap) ..oh, this is really...\nJoey: Oh, no no no. It’s for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.\nPhoebe: Ohhh... Sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back into the bag)\n..okay, it fits.\n(The others have been taking all this in.)\nRachel: Are you seein’ her again tonight?\nJoey: Yep. Ice Capades.\nChandler: Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind\nof capade.\nJoey: I don’t know. I like her, you know. She’s different. There’s\nuh, somethin’ about her.\nPhoebe: That you like, (snappily confronting Joey over the heads of the knitting\ncircle) we get it. You like her. Great!\n(The circle freezes in apprehension.)\nJoey: Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.\nPhoebe: Alright, well, maybe now it’s not okay.\nJoey: Okay... Well maybe now I’m not okay with it not being okay.\nPhoebe: Okay.\n(An embarrassed silence... finally broken by)\nChandler: Knit, good woman, knit, knit!\n(Monica frantically bursts into action as Rachel resumes winding, tangling\nChandler’s wool.)\n[Scene: Chandler's Office, Chandler & Nina are locked in a passionate embrace.\nSomeone knocks, so they hurriedly separate to stare out of the window. Chandler’s\nboss opens the door.]\nChandler: And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.\nMr. Douglas: Nina.\nNina: Mr.Douglas... (flirting defensively) ..cool tie.\n(She escapes, fortunately so distracting Mr. Douglas, that he misses Chandler’s\nexpression of alarm & guilt.)\nMr. Douglas: (Shutting the door, then pointing vaguely at Nina’s shapely\ndeparture) She’s still here.\nChandler: Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let her go,\nerr, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.\n(Thinking quickly, Chandler desperately tries to remember anything to do with\nschizophrenia....)\nChandler: And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact,\nhe uh, mentioned the word frenzy.\nMr. Douglas: You’re kidding? She seems so...\nChandler: Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is\nwhooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no\nrecollection of being fired at all, none at all.\nMr. Douglas: That’s unbelievable.\nChandler: And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be\nassured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.\nMr. Douglas: I see. I guess you never really know what’s goin’ on inside\na person’s head.\nChandler: Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir.\n(Mr. Douglas screws up his eyes, trying to credit what Bing has just said, but turning\nto follow Nina down the corridor, he realises Bing must be telling the truth, since he\nwould not have any personal interest in the girl, would he?)\n[Scene: Lamaze class, Ross is again on the floor, cradled in Susan’s lap, but now\nCarol is cradled in his lap, and she has a pretend baby, on her lap. The teacher is\nshowing her class a video, which is about to end.]\nSoothing male voice: ..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the\nmiracle of birth.\nTeacher: Lights please? And that’s having a baby. Next week is our final\nclass.\n(People start getting up. Ross grabs Carol’s doll to hold it upside down like a\nfootball, slapping it with his other hand.)\nRoss: Susan, go deep.\n(Susan just glares back, as Ross’s inappropriate joke falls flat. Meanwhile, a\nbubble is about to burst...)\nCarol: This is impossible. It’s just impossible.\nSusan: What is, honey?\nCarol: What that woman... did. I am not doin’ that. It’s just\ngonna have to stay in, that’s all, everything will be the same, it’ll just stay in.\nRoss: Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything’s gonna be alright.\nCarol: (screaming at Ross) Oh, what do you know?  No one's going up to you and\nsaying, \"Hi, is that your nostril?  Mind if we push this pot roast\nthrough it?\"\nSusan: Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.\n(Both women gulp in air. Ross looks at his \"football,\" then manipulates the\nhead & limbs back into place, until it resembles what it represents.)\nSusan: I know it’s frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one\nday, and when it’s over, we’re all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.\n(Ross is staring blankly into space.)\nSusan: I mean, that’s what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?\n[Scene 13: Central Perk, the gang is gathered around Monica comforting her brother, who\nin a slight state of shock is cuddling a cushion for security.]\nRoss: I’m gonna be a father.\nRachel: This is just occurring to you?\nRoss: I always knew I was havin’ a baby, I just never realised the baby was\nhaving me.\nRachel: (She comforts him too) Oh, you’re gonna be great!\nRoss: Aw, how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating the\nbath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?\nChandler: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and\nbabies are actually different.\n(Joey tires of this, so he gets up to leave.)\nPhoebe: Where’re you going?\nJoey: Out.\nPhoebe: With?\nJoey: (Spreading his arms wide) Yes.\nPhoebe: Alright, could I just ask you one question?\n(Joey nods his head.)\nPhoebe: Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?\nJoey: Well, not that it’s any of your business, but, no, we haven’t,\nokay?\n(Joey walks toward the door, then hesitates and turns back.)\nJoey: You meant sex, right?\n(Phoebe buttons her lip, while the rest of the gang pretend they’re not there.)\n[Scene: Chandler's Office, Chandler is working as Nina knocks, then opens the door.]\nNina: Do you have a sec?\nChandler: Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?\nNina: I don’t know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding\nme and giving me these really strange looks.\nChandler: Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, of\nus.\nNina: Maybe. But that doesn’t explain why they keep taking my scissors.\nChandler: Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.\nNina: I am?\nChandler: Sure, why not?\nNina: Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) You’re amazing!\nChandler: Oh, you don’t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure\nwe put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?\nHelen: (Over the intercom) So you still want me to send her psychological profile\nto Personnel?\nNina: What?\nChandler: Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?\n(Nina puts her hands on her hips, then gives Chandler a quizzical look.)\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Phoebe are sharing a bowl\nof popcorn, while Monica carefully reads the instruction manual for her television set.]\nChandler: Well, I ended up telling her everything.\nRachel: Oh, how’d she take it?\nChandler: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.)\nLittle tip: if you’re ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your\nhand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.\nMonica: Okay, I think I get how to do this.\n(Monica points the remote at her TV, and punches out a key combination from the book,\nbut the dreaded SAP logo remains and Spanish still comes forth.)\nPhoebe: Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go\naway? Because I can’t, I can’t watch.\nMonica: (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, they’re gone.\nPhoebe: Okay.\nMonica: Are you alright?\nPhoebe: Yeah. It’s just, you know, it’s this whole stupid Ursula\nthing, it’s...\nRachel: Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he’s going out with her. I mean, is it\nreally so terrible?\nPhoebe: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like evil or\nanything. She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff. When I was\neight, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the\nbus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a\nboyfriend who was like your best friend?\nMonica and Rachel: (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No.\nPhoebe: Well, but that’s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole\nhim away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn’t even talk to me\nany more. Because he said he didn’t wanna be around... anything that looked\nlike either one of us.\nRachel: Oh... Oh, Pheebs.\nPhoebe: I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...\nChandler: You’re not gonna lose him.\nMonica: Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.\nPhoebe: Yeah. Okay.\nRoss: No, come on, he doesn’t know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.\nPhoebe: But he’s falling in love with her.\nRachel: Oh please, they’ve been going out a week. They haven’t even slept\ntogether yet, I mean, that’s not serious.\nPhoebe: Okay... Okay.\n(Monica and Ross indicate that they mean right now.)\nPhoebe: Oh, okay, oh.\n(Phoebe gets up and walks across the hallway, but the door to Chandler and Joey’s\napartment is shut. She knocks, and anxiously waits for Joey to come, but instead her\nidentical twin sister emerges wearing one of Joey’s shirts.)\nUrsula: (Surprised) Oh.\n(Phoebe reels back in shock, while Ursula defiantly leans against the doorpost as\nthough she owns the place.)\nUrsula: Yeah, um, may we help you?\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, Rachel is taking down the Christmas lights. Monica\nsees her, so she leans out of the small side window.]\nMonica: Rachel, what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you come\nback inside?\nRachel: No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the\nrailing to reach the top of a pole) ..I’m takin’ ’em down. Okay? Whoa!\n(Screams.)\n(Rachel slips, loses her balance, and falls over the edge..)\nMonica: Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!\n(In the apartment below, Mr.Heckles is trying to relax and read his newspaper, but\nRachel is helplessly dangling upside-down with her ankle wrapped up in the Christmas\nlights.)\nRachel: (To Monica) I’m okay! I’m okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles's\nwindow.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?\nMr.Heckles: See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.\nEnd",
