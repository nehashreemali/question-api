This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.\nRachel: The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)\nFADE OUT\nRachel: Oh, God! Please, somebody  say something.\nRoss: So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?\nChandler: Or facing a bitch of a commute.\nRachel: I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away\nfrom you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already\ntalked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever\nwe need to make us feel comfortable.\nRoss: Okay.\nRachel: I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out...\nAnything we want.\nChandler: My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica\nlooks at him and can't really place what he just said)\nRoss: All right, we'll work it out.\nRachel: Thank you! Thank you!\nRoss: Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?\nRachel: I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe\nand Joey enter.)\nPhoebe: Ooh, what's going on?\nRachel: I got a really incredible job offer.\nJoey: Hey, great! All right!\nPhoebe: Good for you!\nRachel: It's in Paris.\nJoey: What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing,\nokay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to\nMonica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid\nsuburbs...\nMonica: Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...\nJoey: Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.\nRachel: Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means\na lot if you could try to get on board.\nPhoebe: Of course we can. Congratulations. (they hug, but Joey shakes his head.)\nYay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in) Joey...\nJoey: No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.\nRachel: (walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so...\nJoey: Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and\nRachel follows him)\nRachel: Joey...\nPhoebe: You okay with this?\nChandler: Well, it makes me feel sad, but...\nPhoebe: Talking to Ross.\nChandler: I see.\nRoss: Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every\nday. How can I be okay with this?\nMonica: I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.\nRoss: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back,\nshe would take it?\nMonica: How is that gonna happen?\nChandler: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?\nRoss: I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas\nparty. We really hit it off.\nMonica: You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?\nRoss: I didn't say we were brothers.\nOPENING CREDITS\n[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe's reading a newspaper. Chandler\nand Monica walk in.]\nMonica: Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next\ndoor to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna\ntake a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.\nChandler: We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse\nus, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.\nMonica: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?\nChandler: What do you think Pheebs?\nPhoebe: Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin\nRobbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?\nChandler: Yeah.\nPhoebe: She died.\nChandler: You're kidding!\nMonica: That's terrible!\nPhoebe: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across\nthe Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the\nwrong one.\nChandler: Oh yeah?\nPhoebe: Yeah, she was just an agent.\nMonica: Joey's gonna be *so* upset.\nChandler: I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the\nAtlantic.\nPhoebe: Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about\neverything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.\nMonica: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?\nPhoebe: Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get\nused to everything else.\nMonica: What if he reads it in the paper?\nChandler: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.\n[Scene: Ralph Lauren. Mr Zelner's office. Ross knocks on the\ndoor and enters.]\nMr Zelner: May I help you?\nRoss: Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas\nparty about two years ago.\nMr Zelner: Oh right, uhm, Don?\nRoss: Close. Ron. (shakes hands)\nMr Zelner: Uh... What can I do for you?\nRoss: Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.\nMr Zelner: Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?\nRoss: Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll\nsee if she wants to come back.\nMr Zelner: Wow, that is tempting.\nRoss: Look, she loved her job here. And let's face\nit: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that\ntrue?\nMr Zelner: She is good!\nRoss: (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.\nMr Zelner: But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah,\nit's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.\nRoss: I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his\nway out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one\nup.) Is this your son?\nMr Zelner: Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What?\nRoss: Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does\nlittle Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?\nMr Zelner: Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?\nRoss: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after\neveryone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.\n(Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s\nnot good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there\nwith us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!\nMr Zelner: You can really arrange that?\nRoss: You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.\nMr Zelner: Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn’t be the worst thing\nin the world.\nRoss: Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear,\nyour kid is going to have the time of his life.\nMr Zelner: That’s great. I worry about little Ross. He’s always\nreading, he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs.\nRoss: He’ll be fine.\n[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe’s reading, Joey has just entered\nthe room]\nJoey: Hey Phoebe.\nPhoebe: Hey. Everything ok?\nJoey: I’m just mad at my agent.\nPhoebe: Estelle? Why?\nJoey: There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I\ndidn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.\nPhoebe: I’m guessing she does.\nJoey: Well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I’m wanna hear it,\nbecause she keeps doing this.\nPhoebe: Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you\nwill wait a minute before you call her.\nJoey: Ok. Why?\nPhoebe: Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.\n(she leaves)\nJoey: I love that saying!\n(Phoebe is outside, taking her cell phone out of her bag and making a call.\nJoey is inside, and his mobile phone starts ringing).\nJoey: Hello?\nPhoebe (doing Estelle): Joey, it’s Estelle.\nJoey: I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.\nPhoebe-Estelle: It’s a little coincidental, but believable.\n(Joey nods in agreement). Listen, I’m sure you’re wondering why\nI didn’t get you an audition for that TV movie.\nJoey: Yeah, actually I am!\nPhoebe-Estelle: I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!\nJoey: That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.\nPhoebe-Estelle: Don’t take that tone with me. Who you\nthink you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?\nJoey: No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok?\nAnd you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.\nPhoebe-Estelle: What are you saying?\nJoey: I’m saying that… (pause). This isn't  working for me\nanymore, ok? Estelle, you’re fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).\nPhoebe: Man, tough week for Estelle!\n[Scene: Joey’s apartment. Rachel’s there and Ross\nenters the room with a stuffed dinosaur]\nRoss: Hi.\nRachel: Hi.\nRoss: Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep\nwithout it.\nRachel: Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.\nRoss: Ok.\nRachel: Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph\nLauren called, and gave me my job back!\nRoss: Nooo!\nRachel: Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out\nof nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling\napart without me.\nRoss: So, you’re not going to Paris.\nRachel: No, I’m still going.\nRoss: Wh… wh…what?\nRachel: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,\nthe offered me more money! Isn’t that great?\nRoss: Yeeeah! (They high-five)\n[Scene: house next to the one the Bings are moving into. Chandler\nand Monica knock, a lady opens the door.]\nMonica: Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we\ncould just take a look around.\nLady: Oh, sure. I’m showing it to someone else right now,\nbut please, look around.\nMonica: Thanks.\nChandler: It feels like we’re cheating on our house.\nAnd if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house,\nthat does stuff that our house won’t do?\nMonica: Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks\nlike a cave! What a hole!\nLady: So? What do you think?\nMonica: Love it!\nLady: Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady\nupstairs is goning to make another one.\nMonica: They could be our neighbors, what are they like?\nLady: Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids,\nhe's on Wall Street and she…\nJanice: Oh my God!\n(Chandler and Monica are speechless).\nChandler (to Monica): Sure.\n[Scene: Joey’s apartment. He’s there and Phoebe comes\nin.]\nPhoebe: Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?\nJoey: Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be\nkilling her.\nPhoebe: No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.\nJoey: I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like\nher only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing\nhe eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but\nshe did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.\nPhoebe: No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call\nyou (Joey considers it)\nJoey: Why?\nPhoebe: Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ...\nis the key... to a happy heart.\nJoey: (impressed) You blow me away.\nPhoebe: (picking up her bag) All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her\nto call you?\nJoey: I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. (Phoebe stops\nherself from laughing and leaves)\n[Scene: The house Monica and Chandler are viewing. Janice comes\ndown the stairs.]\nJanice: What a small world!\nChandler: And yet I never run into Beyonce!\nRealtor: You two know each other?\nJanice: Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man\nout of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! (does her irritating\nlaugh). So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna\nhave a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie (playfully punches Chandler,\nwho tries to get away from her)\nChandler: (at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)\nMonica: No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)\nChandler: (To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?\nMonica: (looks confused and scared) I don't know\nwhy.\nJanice: Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence.\nBut knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to\nget it! (Chandler and Monica are utterly shocked) Ellen, we're going to talk\nnumbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside)\nChandler: This can not be happening!\nMonica: Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.\nMaybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.\nChandler: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple\nare the Hitlers.\nMonica: (Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands)\nAll right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house\ninto a guest house.\nChandler: That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful,\nbut when did you start crapping money!?\nMonica: Okay, you come up with an idea.\nChandler: Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on\nour house. We can still get out.\nMonica: But we love our house.\nChandler: Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder\nout here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) \"Oh My God\"!\nMonica: Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever\nwe go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise.\nI mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls\njump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking\nit pushing something up)\nChandler: (looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we\nhave to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly\noutside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)\n[Scene: Mr. Zellner's office. There is a knock on the door.]\nr Zelner: Who is it?\nRoss: (enters) It's me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed)\nLook, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might\nbe able to get her to come back.\nMr Zelner: This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees,\nis not my main job.\nRoss: Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks\nhopeful)\nMr Zelner: (obviously amused) Not good, Ron.\nRoss: Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this (Takes\na huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.\nMr Zelner: (Takes a long look at the egg while he considers it) Wow, that's\npretty cool (Takes the egg from Ross)\nRoss: Huh? So? We have a deal?\nMr Zelner: Okay, you got it.\nRoss: Yes! yes!\nMr Zelner: This is gonna make me very popular.\nRoss: Oh, (grins) Believe me, the ladies, they love it!\nMr Zelner: (looks at Ross, for a long moment, confused) I meant with my son.\nRoss: Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. (shakes his head, give him a thumbs\nup and leaves)\n[Scene: Joey's apartment. He walks in reading his mail, and plays\nback his messages on the answering machine]\nAnswering machine: Joey, this is Al T. Booker, (Looks annoyed\nthat he called him) the guy who eats paper. I'm sure you've heard that Estelle\npassed away. (Looks shocked) I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her\nat the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.\nJoey: Oh my God. (Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) Hello?\nPhoebe: (on the other side of the line, still pretending to be Estelle) Joey,\nit's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)\nJoey: Estelle?\nPhoebe: Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for\nfiring me.\nJoey: (still scared) Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?\nPhoebe: Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...\nJoey: No, no, no! (Starts looking around the room, terrified) Don't drop by,\ndon't drop by!\nPhoebe: Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.\nJoey: Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?\nPhoebe: (Looks around) It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with\nthe career. You're gonna be huge.\nJoey: Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs up and reads the phone display)\n\"out of area\". Boy, I'll say.\n[Scene: The house next door to Chandler and Monica's new house.\nChandler is pacing worriedly through the living room when Janice enters.]\nJanice: Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on\nthe house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.\nChandler: The Hitlers will be so disappointed.\nJanice: All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see\nyou later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)\nChandler: Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to\nbe here.\nJanice: Oh, me too... (laughs)\nChandler: Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.\nJanice: Huh?\nChandler: I never stopped loving you.\nJanice: Oh... my...\nChandler: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice\nLitman Goralnik Neihosenstein.\nJanice: Chandler, what are you talking about?\nChandler: Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and\nMonica never have to know a thing.\nJanice: I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this...\nheat between us.\nChandler: (stunned) Obviously.\nJanice: But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't\nthink we should get this house now.\nChandler: Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.\nJanice: Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.\nChandler: I understand.\nJanice: Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... (she kisses\nChandler flat on the mouth. Chandler squirms. When she's finished, he looks\nat her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing. (She leaves)\nChandler: (speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.\n[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is working on his laptop when\nRachel enters with Emma.]\nRachel: Hi!\nRoss: Hey!\nRachel: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.\nRoss: What?\nRachel: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered\nme more money.\nRoss: They did?\nRachel: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll\ndo everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I\ndon't even know what department that guy's in.\nRoss: So, what are you gonna do?\nRachel: Well, I took it.\nRoss: That's great! So you're staying in New York!\nBoth: YAY! WHOO! YAY!\nRoss: You're excited, right?\nRachel: (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great.\nIt's certainly the easier choice...\nRoss: Right!\nRachel: Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to\nParis? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital\nof the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's\nfine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of\nthat I possibly can... (she sits down, and Ross who is stunned to hear all this\nfollows her example)\nRoss: Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.\nUhm, I mean, you said you were scared.\nRachel: Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when\nI-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared...\nBut this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)\nRoss: (after a long pause) You should go.\nRachel: What?\nRoss: It's what you want. You should go.\nRachel: You really think so?\nRoss: I really do.\nRachel: But I already told Zelner that I would come back...\nRoss: (picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in\nthe same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) I'm sure he'll\nunderstand.\nRachel: All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.\nRoss: Yeah...\nRachel: Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!\nRoss: Yeah, yeah, oh! (They hug)\nRachel: Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.\nRoss: Then I'm happy too. (They're still hugging - fade out)\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\n[Scene: Estelle's memorial service. Joey is giving a speech.\nNext to him is a blown op photograph of Estelle behind her desk and there's\na man standing next to him.]\nJoey: Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects\nto a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (Joey looks at the photograph)\n..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (Joey\nlooks for his notes. The man next to him is chewing something.) Dude, where's\nmy speech? (the man swallows something and looks at Joey.) That is\nentertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. (he applauds and Al shows that there's\nnothing left in his mouth.)\nTHE END",
