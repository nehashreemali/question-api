I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.\nALL: Who?\nJOEY: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.\nALL: Wow!\nJOEY: Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to\nkiss this guy.\nCHANDLER: 'Cause he was just so darn cute.\nJOEY: No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy\nkisses.\nROSS: Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. (Rachel looks at\nhim in disbelief) Or you just do it.\nJOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional.\nMONICA: Then what's the problem?\nJOEY: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'.\nCan you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good\nmother.\nPHOEBE: Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about\nkissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.\nOPENING CREDITS\n[Scene: continued from earlier]\nCHANDLER: Hey, what did your agent say?\nJOEY: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on\nMonday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over\nhere and kiss me.\nMONICA: What, forget it!\nRACHEL: Yeah, right.\nJOEY: Come on, I need your help here.\nPHOEBE: All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.\nJOEY: You see this, this is a friend.\nPHOEBE: Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss\nrather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.\nJOEY: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?\nMONICA: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up\na little, maybe that's what you need to work on.\nJOEY: Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross)\nROSS: Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler)\nCHANDLER: And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Richard are there]\nROSS: (entering from Rachel's bedroom) Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!\n(turns around, and under his breath, to the rest of the guys) Tell her she looks good,\ntell her she looks good.\n(Rachel enters in this hideous pink bride's maid dress, with a huge silver bow on her\nchest, and a big, huge skirt, kinda like the one's women wore in the 1800s, Monica and\nRichard both stare in shock)\nPHOEBE: (laughing) Oh my God, you look so good!\nRACHEL: I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking\nlike something you drink when your nauseous.\nROSS: So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your\nex-fiancee's wedding.\nRACHEL: Because I promised Mindy I would.\nMONICA: Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. (Rachel glares at her, and she\nretreats to safety between Richard's legs)\nRACHEL: Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I\njust need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.\n(Chandler enters, sees Rachel in the dress and starts laughing)\nPHOEBE: Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a\nlittle action?\nCHANDLER: I may have.\nMONICA: Woo-hoo, stuud!\nROSS: What's she look like?\nCHANDLER: Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the\ninternet.\nMONICA: Woo-hoo, geeek!\nCHANDLER: I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend\nget a little defended and quipy...\nROSS: Get out!\nRACHEL: Nooo!\nMONICA: Please!\nCHANDLER: Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I\ndid.\nRACHEL: Wow!

God, it is so nice for once to\nnot have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'\nRACHEL: Afraid to ask him?\nMONICA: Could not be more terrified.\nCHANDLER: Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel\nanother chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Richard and Monica are playing with Ben.]\nMONICA: (holding up a blanket) Where's Benny? (drops the blanket) There he is! (does it\nagain) Where's Benny, there he is.\nRICHARD: Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown\nups to cut it out.\nMONICA: Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.\nRICHARD: Okay.\nMONICA: Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?\nRICHARD: Sure I do.\nMONICA: Yeah, am I in it?\nRICHARD: Honey, you are in it.\nMONICA: Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.\nRICHARD: Oh, yeah!\nMONICA: Keep talkin'.\nRICHARD: Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France,\nmake French toast.\nMONICA: Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little\nbassinet in the corner?\nRICHARD: Like a hound?\nMONICA: Not a basset, a bassinet.\nRICHARD: You really need the bassinet?\nMONICA: Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you ,\ndo you not see kids in our future.\nRICHARD: Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our\nkids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.\nMONICA: Uh-huh.\nRICHARD: Look I want you, now.\nMONICA: That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this\nis, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the\nplanet.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are there, Chandler is talking to\nhis new friend on the internet.]\nJOEY: Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. (Chandler ignores him) Just one kiss,\nI won't tell anyone.\nCHANDLER: Joey, no means no!\n[Rachel, in her bridesmaid dress, complete with hat, which makes her look like Little Bo\nPeep, and Ross enter]\nRACHEL: Hey!\nCHANDLER: I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.\nJOEY: Aww, Rach, I think you look cute (kisses her on the cheek, then looks at Ross) And\nyou, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon (goes to kiss him).\nROSS: Get away from me I said no!\nMONICA: (entering) Richard buzzed.

It could be a guy.\nCHANDLER: Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.\nPHOEBE: It could be like a big giant guy.\nJOEY: (entering) Man, I got this close to him (holds up his fingers) and Monica kneed me\nin the back. What's going on?\nPHOEBE: We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.\nJOEY: Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.\nCHANDLER: How do you not fall down more?\nPHOEBE: Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'\nCHANDLER: All right. (reading her answer) \"My husband is sleeping with his\nsecretary.\" She's married!\nPHOEBE: Well at least we know she's a woman.\nCHANDLER: I can't believe she's married.\nJOEY: Aw, man I'm sorry (starts rubbing Chandler's shoulder). This must be very tough for\nya, huh (and starts comfroting him looking for a kiss).\n[Scene: Barry and Mindy's wedding, Monica and Richard are standing in the lobby]\nMONICA: So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed\nto throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.\nRICHARD: Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.(they both start laughing at\nRichard's poor joke) See, we're having fun.\nMONICA: Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're\nnot supposed to think about.\nRICHARD: Neither am I.\n[Scene: later the bridesmaids and ushers are getting ready to start, Ross is looking for\nRachel]\nROSS: Hey, there.\nRACHEL: Hi.\nROSS: Are you all right?\nRACHEL: Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my\nwedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't,\npeople are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.\nROSS: Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right.

What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is\nshowing!'\nRACHEL: Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was,\nwas, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the\nentire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my\nGod, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.\nROSS: Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.\nRACHEL: Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.\nMR.

I mean you\ndon't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be\nkicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.\nCHANDLER: Okay, I'll do it!\nPHOEBE: Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and\nmeet her! (Chandler runs and picks up his shoes) Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a\nshower, 'cause, eww. (Chandler runs to the bathroom, as the computer bing-bongs) No, you\nknow what you have to answer her, answer her first. (Chandler runs to the computer) No,\nno, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. (Chandler walks slowly into the\nkitchen)\n[Scene: at Barry and Mindy's reception, Monica and Richard are sitting at a table, and\nMonica is trying to throw a piece of candy into his mouth.]\nMONICA: Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.\nRICHARD: Okay, last chance. (Monica throws the candy and hits some woman in the back of\nthe head, Richard turns around and says) Again, I'm sorry.\nMONICA: You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I\ndo because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that\nI...(sees two little girls dancing together) I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I\njust do.\nBEST MAN: (standing up) Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast\nhere. Thank you. (clears throat, and starts reading his toast) I remember when Barry got\nhome from his first date with Rachel...\nALL: What?!\nBEST MAN: What, (to Barry) you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. (gets a\n'da-doom-chesh' from the drummer) Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both\na wonderful life together. And Rachel...\nRACHEL: What.\nBEST MAN: No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts\nto come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!\n(da-doom-chesh)\nROSS: (standing up) Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...\nRACHEL: Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?\nROSS: Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.\nRACHEL: Oh dear God.\nROSS: Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel\nto come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had\nsyphilis. (da-doom-chesh) (to drummer) What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she\nwalked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out\npretty well for me (looks for the da-doom-chesh, and doesn't get one) Cheers.\nRACHEL: (to Ross) She you in the parking lot.\nROSS: (runs after her) No, Rach!\nBARRY: And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?\nRACHEL: (after a pause with everyone staring at her, she goes up to the microphone) Ya,\nknow what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised\nmyself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings (da-doom-chesh). See\nnow, tonight, all I\nreally wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity.\nWell (laughing), I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really\nleft to say except....(starts singing) \"Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With\nyellow feathers (band joins in), feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She\nwould...\"\nROSS: Marenge,\nRACHEL: (singing) \"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she\nlike to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody..\"\nROSS: Everybody!\nRACHEL: At the Copa, Copa Cabana (everyone joins in) The hottest spot north of Havana. At\nthe Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....\n[Scene: later, Richard and Monica are dancing]\nRICHARD: Okay, I'll do it.\nMONICA: You'll do what?\nRICHARD: If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.\nMONICA: Oh my God!\nRICHARD: If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll\ngo to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.\nMONICA: Really?\nRICHARD: Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all\nover again, then I will.\nMONICA: You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like\nseventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'\nRICHARD: But you're not.\nMONICA: Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but\nI don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.\nRICHARD: God. I love you.\nMONICA: I know you do. Me too.

It's like a watched pot, you know if\nyou keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do\nis try not to...\n(Chandler's date walks in)\nCHANDLER: Oh my God! (it's Janice)\nJANICE: OH.....MY.....GAWD!! (Chandler rushes over and kisses her)\nALL: OH.....MY.....GOD!!\nCLOSING CREDITS\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is reading a script as Ross enters]\nROSS: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good\nfriend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses\nJoey).\nJOEY: Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get\nit. But that was a hell of a kiss.
