Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here\nwon't feel too competitive.\nRACHEL: Then what's gonna happen?\nROSS: Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.\nRACHEL: Uh-huh.\nROSS: Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we\ndon't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit\nwhenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau\ncounty but the school system's supposedly great.\nRACHEL: Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.\nROSS: Huh?\nRACHEL: I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am\ngonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok.

I mean I don't wanna be one of those people\nwho tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.\nPHOEBE: Sure.\nMONICA: It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know,\nand I don't know, what do I do?\nPHOEBE: Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow\nyour pets head off.\nRACHEL: [enters] Aghh.\nPHOEBE: Me too. [leaves]\nMONICA: I've got a question.

I spent my whole life like\nthat. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not\nknowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are\ngonna have to deal with that.\nROSS: Ok fine.\nRACHEL: Thank you.\nROSS: We're not done.\nRACHEL: I didn't know that.\nROSS: Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a\nguy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna\nend up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.\nRACHEL: Fine, I will.\nROSS: Good, 'cause I love you.\nRACHEL: Oh yeah.\nROSS: Yeah.\nRACHEL: Well I love you too.\nROSS: Well that's the first time we've said that.\nRACHEL: Yes it is.\nROSS: Well, I'm gonna kiss you.\nRACHEL: Well you better.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment.

It just kept\ngetting worse and worse, it should have been called, \"It's a sucky life and just when\nyou think it can't suck any more it does.\"\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment.
