Monica is\nwatching stock prices on a business channel.]\nJOEY: Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?\nMONICA: 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my\ninitials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it\ncomes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.\nRACHEL: Ok honey, you really need a job.\nROSS: Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.\nMONICA: Really.\nPHOEBE: Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right\nthere.\nROSS: On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.\nPHOEBE: No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I\nkeep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I\npassed a buffet...which is my father's last name.\nEVERYONE: Ahh.\nPHOEBE: And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And\nthere was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.\nMONICA: His indian name?\nPHOEBE: No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean\ncoincidences? I don't think so.\nROSS: Freakish.\nMONICA: Wow.\nJOEY: Freaky.\nMONICA: Weird, weird.\nRACHEL: Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?\nPHOEBE: Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.\nMONICA: Why?\nPHOEBE: Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.\nOPENING TITLES\n[Scene: Central Perk.

I mean, like the beast at\nthe threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for\nmy grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite\nwhat she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.\nI don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.\nRACHEL: Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.\nJOEY: Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?\nPHOEBE: Ok, thanks. Sorry, again\n[She starts the cab and pulls forward. We hear a squish and a dog yelp.]\nPHOEBE: [innocently] What was that?\nJOEY: Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey is eating breakfast, Rachel has just gotten\nup, and Monica is on the phone.]\nMONICA: I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon\ntime is money my friend. Thank you.

And ZXY becuase I think\nit sounds zexy.\nRACHEL: What happened to uh, MEG.?\nMONICA: MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is\nget out before they go down.\nJOEY: That is so not my motto.\nPHOEBE: [enters] Hey.\nRACHEL: Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?\nPHOEBE: Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the\nlittle fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.\nJOEY: Good.\nRACHEL: Oh, thank God.\nPHOEBE: Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he\nsaid that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.\nRACHEL: Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is\nok?\nPHOEBE: I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone.  What am I\ngonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your\ndog.'\nJOEY: Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.\nPHOEBE: Ok.

[hangs up]\nRACHEL: Why the voice.\nJOEY: [in the voice] Hard to say.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment.

Ya know, like a, like a right of\npassage or somethin'.\nCHANDLER: Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think\nactually mine's growing back.\n[Scene: Outside Monica and Rachel's apartment.
