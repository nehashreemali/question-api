  "transcript": "The One With the Two Parties\nOriginally written by Alexa Junge.\nTranscribed by Joshua Hodge.\n[Scene: Moondance Diner. Ross, Phoebe, Joey, and Chandler are sitting at\nthe counter, Monica is working. Monica is wearing her costume, including big fake\nbreasts.]\nMONICA: So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's\nbirthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.\nALL: Ohhh.\nMONICA: What?\nROSS: Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you\npoach things?\nMONICA: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?\nROSS: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?\nJOEY: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?\nROSS: Yeah.\nPHOEBE: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun\nif you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.\nMONICA: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of\nparty you want.\n[Joey is staring at Monica's breasts]\nMONICA: Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of\nthese things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.\nCHANDLER: Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.\nOPENING TITLES\n[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Ross, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are planning Rache's\nbirthday party.]\nROSS: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.\nMONICA: Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.\nJOEY: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.\nPHOEBE: Why not her?\nJOEY: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.\nCHANDLER: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called\nher back.\nMONICA: Joey that is horriable.\nJOEY: Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know\nI guess I just got scared.\nPHOEBE: I'm sorry, I didn't know.\nJOEY: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.\n[Rachel enters]\nROSS: Hi honey, how did it go?\nRACHEL: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.\nCHANDLER: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.\nRACHEL: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My\nsister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what\na girl from long island would do for a Celica.\nMONICA: So what happened?\nRACHEL: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile\nproudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the\nmiddle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But\nyou know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.\nPHOEBE: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.\nMONICA: Well, how bout just her mom?\nCHANDLER: Why her mom?\nMONICA: Cause I already invited her.\nPHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?\nJOEY: Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Phoebe are setting\nup for the party.]\nPHOEBE: Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?\nMONICA: Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.\nCHANDLER: Excuse me?\nMONICA: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.\nJOEY: Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.\n[knock at the door]\nMONICA: [answers the door] Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing\nhere?\nMR. GREENE: What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?\nMONICA: No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's\nnot here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.\nMR. GREENE: Ohhh, you're having a parteee.\nMONICA: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um,\nthis is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.\nMR. GREENE: I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal?\nRachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?\nCHANDLER: This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?\n[knock at the door, Monica answers to see Mrs. Greene]\nMRS. GREENE: Hi Monica.\n[Monica slams the door back shut]\nMONICA: Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.\nCHANDLER: So, basically just a Chinese guy.\nJOEY: Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's\nbed.\nMR. GREENE: Alright, that sounds like a two person job. [they walk into Rachel's bedroom]\nMRS. GREENE: Well, my goodness, what was that?\nMONICA: Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you\nyet.\nMRS. GREENE: You thought I was Rachel?\nCHANDLER: Yes because uh, you look so young.\nPHOEBE: And because you're both, you know, white women.\nMRS. GREENE: Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?\nCHANDLER: NO! No, I'll take that for ya.\nMRS. GREENE: Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. [Chandler takes the hot pink\ncoat and grimaces at it] Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons...\n[Chandler, remembering that Joey and Mr. Greene are in the bedroom, throws her coat in a\ncupboard] The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...[Joey peeks out]\nPHOEBE: [cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the\nrest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me.\nYeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun,\nc'mon. [they go in the bathroom]\nMONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.\nCHANDLER: Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?\nJOEY: [peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast\nis clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.\nMONICA: So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to\nyour place.\nCHANDLER: Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?\nMONICA: Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.\nJOEY: Right this is staging.\nCHANDLER: Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.\nJOEY: [as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday\nsign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment.

[sits down beside Rachel] Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger?\nOh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of\nchamps, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.\nRACHEL: This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna\nbe like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in\nsome condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through\nthis?\nCHANDLER: Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the\nbed.\nRACHEL: Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just\nlistening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of\nJuly.\nCHANDLER: Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?\nRACHEL: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the\nfireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill\nwould be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping\nand then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the\nfireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we\nwould all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring\nanother one. And now it's just...\nCHANDLER: I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.]\n[Scene: Monica's party. She is seeing off the last of the guests.]\nMONICA: Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.\nMRS. GREENE: Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on\nthe table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.\nMONICA: Ok will do. So glad you came.\nMRS. GREENE: I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.\nMONICA: Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.\nRACHEL: Oh ok.\nMRS. GREENE: Happy birthday sweetie.\nRACHEL: Ok.\n[Mr. Greene opens the door to Chandler and Joeys apartment. Ross sees him and runs to the\ndoor forcing him back in then holds onto the door knob.]\nJOEY: Ahh, you drive safe.\nMRS. GREENE: Ross, what're you doing.\nROSS: I'm getting ready for the water skiing. [Mr. Greene opens the door which pulls Ross\nin] How are you doing?\nCHANDLER: Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?\nMR. GREENE: To get my coat.\nGUYS: No no no.\nMR. GREENE:Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.\n[the guys form a wall between Mrs Geller and Mr Geller and dance across the hall as he\nwalks across]\nCHANDLER: Sorry, we're on a major flan high.\nPHOEBE: Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's\nall wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there]\nOr perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.\nMR. GREENE: I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.\nPHOEBE: Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.\nJOEY: Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. [grabs her and kisses her to distract her. She goes\nlimp in his arms. Mr. Greene leaves.] Well, ok, you take care.\nMRS.

[blows out the candles. Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the\nvolleyball lands in the flan] Wow, those things almost never come true.\nEND",
