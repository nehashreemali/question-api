(Pause) Okay.\n(Joey is stunned.)\n[Cut to Ross getting of an elevator carrying a bouquet of flowers and walking down the\nhall to Rachel’s room.]\n[Cut back into Rachel’s room.]\nRachel: So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?\nJoey: Uh… Look Rach…(Ross enters.) Hey Ross is here! Hey look!\nIt’s my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.\nRoss: Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.\nRachel: Hey you.\nJoey: Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I’m really more of\na candy guy. (Laughs.)\nRoss: You’re weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.)\n(To Rachel) Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.\nRachel: Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.\nRoss: Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?\nJoey: No.\nRoss: What?\nJoey: Oh, I’m sorry. I meant no.\nMonica: (entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look\nwho’s here!\nMr. Geller: Where’s my granddaughter? I’ve been practicing my magic\ntricks.\nChandler: He pulled a quarter out of my ear!\nRoss: Hey, where’s uh, where’s mom?\nMr. Geller: She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.\nMonica: Oh, Aunt Liddy’s coming? That means we get five dollars each!\nMr. Geller: So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this? (Pulls a bouquet of\nflowers out of his sleeve.)\nChandler: Okay. Wow.\nRoss: Uh Dad, Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want,\nbut (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you.\nRachel: I know, I still need to talk to you.\nJoey: Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and\nRoss, I need to talk to you.\nPhoebe: (To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.\nMonica: About what?\nPhoebe: To see if know what these guys are talking about.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Outside the Nursery, everyone but Rachel is standing and looking into the\nwindow.]\nMonica: Isn’t she beautiful?\nMr. Geller: Look at her, my first grandchild.\nRoss: What about Ben?\nMr. Geller: Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. (To Monica,\nmouths) Wow.\nPhoebe: (taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and\nRachel?\nRoss: Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came\nin the room.\nPhoebe: Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with us\nthere.\nRoss: Yeah right.\nPhoebe: Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t\ntalk to Rachel.\nRoss: What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?\nPhoebe: Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian\nfamily was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has\nmy Gameboy.\nJoey: (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?\nChandler: Sure.\nJoey: Dude I just did something terrible.\nChandler: That was you?! I thought it was Jack!\nJoey: No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!\nChandler: What?! Why does she think that?\nJoey: Because it kinda looked like I did.\nChandler: Again, what?!\nJoey: Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…\nChandler: As we all are at some point during the day.\nJoey: It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I\nknelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!\nChandler: Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?\nJoey: I guess.\nChandler: And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he\nloves to propose!\nJoey: I know! I know it’s awful.\nChandler: Well, what did she say?\nJoey: (happily) She said yes.\nChandler: Does Ross know?\nJoey: Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?\nChandler: Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.\nJoey: Oh, I like that. Yeah…\nChandler: If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out,\nbut you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!\nJoey: (laughs) Now let’s not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica\ncomes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)\nMonica: I want a baby.\nChandler: Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.\nMonica: Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of\ngetting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?\nChandler: I’m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no\nforeplay.\nMonica: Deal!\n[Back in front of the nursery window.]\nRoss: Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!\nMr. Geller: Noted.\nRoss: I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a\nbit?\nMr. Geller: Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.\nRoss: (noticing something) Actually umm… (He turns Mr. Geller’s head\nto look at Emma.)\n[Scene: Rachel’s Room, Phoebe is entering.]\nPhoebe: Hey!\nRachel: Hi.\nPhoebe: Are you all right?\nRachel: Uhh… I think I just got engaged.\nPhoebe: Oh my God! He did it?\nRachel: Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?\nPhoebe: Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to\nthink of myself as the puppet master of the group.\nRachel: And you really think this is a good idea?\nPhoebe: I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The\npuppet master gets tired people.\nRachel: I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.\nPhoebe: Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.\nRachel: Really?! Even Ross?\nPhoebe: Especially Ross!\nJoey: (entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll\ncome back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who’s entering.)\nRoss: Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess\njust…I’ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)\nPhoebe: There he goes, your fianc�e.\nRachel: I guess so.\nPhoebe: Although he does play with himself in his sleep.\nRachel: I can’t say that I’m surprised.\n[Scene: A hallway, Joey and Ross find Mr. Geller with his ear up against a\njanitor’s closet door.]\nRoss: Dad, what are you doing?\nMr. Geller: I think there are people in there having sex.\n(Ross turns to look at Joey.)\nJoey: It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.\nMr. Geller: Wanna peek?\nRoss: No!\nMr. Geller: Come on!\nRoss: Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on.\n(Walks away.)\nJoey: (To Ross) We’re not peeking? (Follows him.)\nMr. Geller: Well I’m peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!\nChandler: Hello sir, you know Monica.\n[Scene: Rachel’s Room, she is taking the ring out of Ross’s jacket, looks at\nit, and puts it on her finger as Joey enters.]\nJoey: Hey uh, is it okay to come in?\nRachel: Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!\nJoey: Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.\n(There’s a knock on the door and a nurse enters carrying Emma.)\nRachel: Hey!\nNurse: Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?\nRachel: Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?\nNurse: It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but\ndon’t worry. It’ll happen.\nJoey: (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)\nRachel: Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.\nJoey: Dear Lord.\nRachel: I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?\nJoey: Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…\nRachel: Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too\nbig for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn’t she look\nscared?\nJoey: Y’know, I don’t really know her.\nNurse: Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Does\nso.)\nJoey: (To God) Are you kidding me?!\nRachel: It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!\nJoey: I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! (Storms out.)\n[Scene: The Lobby, Ross is eating a sandwich as Phoebe rushes up to him.]\nPhoebe: Oh hey! Wait up!\nRoss: Hi!\nPhoebe: Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey\n‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.\nRoss: What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit,\nalthough, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.\nPhoebe: No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!\nRoss: What?\nPhoebe: Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret\nthing in a long time.\nRoss: Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.\nPhoebe: Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you\nwere a doctor?\nRoss: (pause) I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and\ntalk to Rachel myself.\nPhoebe: All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she’s\nsleeping.) Should we wake her up?\nRoss: No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.\nPhoebe: And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)\nRoss: What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she\nthinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!\nPhoebe: Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross\ndoctors are supposed to be smart.\nRoss: I didn’t give her that ring!\nPhoebe: Really?\nRoss: No!\nPhoebe: So whose ring is it?\nRoss: It’s mine.\nPhoebe: Is it an engagement ring?\nRoss: Yes!\nPhoebe: But you didn’t give it to her?\nRoss: No!\nPhoebe: But you were going to propose?\nRoss: No!!\nPhoebe: Huh, I might be losing interest in this.\nRoss: Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to\nRachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted\nah…start…things up again.\nPhoebe: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.\nRoss: Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she\ndidn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this\nhappened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose,\nthrow it on, and-and just start telling people?\nPhoebe: No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.\nRoss: Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause)\nDid I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would\ndo.\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: The Janitor’s Closet, Chandler and Monica are trying to figure out what to\ndo now.]\nChandler: Look, we can’t stay in here forever.\nMonica: Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t\nmake it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!\nChandler: This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be\nashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They\ndo so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)\nMonica: Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?\nMr. Geller: Of course. I’ll always be your dad.\nChandler: I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that\nwasn’t for fun.\nMonica: It wasn’t fun?!\nChandler: (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… (To Mr. Geller)\nLook, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we\nwant.\nMr. Geller: Oh, I don’t think that. Before today I never thought of you two\nhaving sex at all. It was a simpler time.\nMonica: The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying.\nMr. Geller: What?\nMonica: Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant.\nMr. Geller: Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points to\nthe closet) I’ll guard the door!\nMonica: Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.\nMr. Geller: Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t think so! Aren’t you ovulating?\nMonica: Daddy?!\nMr. Geller: Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were\ntrying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That’s how I got\nmy bad hip.\nChandler: That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole\nin my head.\nMr. Geller: This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she\nwas…\nMonica: Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions\nyou and mom had sex.\nMr. Geller: You’re right, you’re right. This is about your positions.\nNow, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although\nit might feel good.\nMonica: I don’t feel good right now.\nMr. Geller: But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the woman\nhas an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?\nChandler: Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.\n[Scene: Rachel’s Room, Monica is entering.]\nMonica: Hey.\nRachel: Hey. I need to tell you something.\nMonica: Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut\noff.\nRachel: Joey asked me marry him.\nMonica: What?\nRachel: Joey proposed to me.\nMonica: Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!\nRachel: Well, I-I said yes.\nMonica: What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’s\nso inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It is\nbigger than mine! (Rachel’s engagement ring.)\nRachel: I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.\nMonica: You can’t marry him!\nRachel: Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet\nguy and he loves me so much.\nMonica: Well do you love him?\nRachel: Sure.\nMonica: Sure?\nRachel: Yeah, I mean whatever.\nMonica: Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?\nRachel: No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?\n[Scene: A Hallway, Chandler is following Joey.]\nChandler: You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?\nJoey: No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her\nbreast out.\nChandler: Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look\nlike?!\nJoey: I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.\nChandler: Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.\nJoey: Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I\ndon’t want to hurt her.\nChandler: Okay, look, just do it gently.\nJoey: You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now before\nRoss finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the\nway. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if\nyou want to check that out.\n[Scene: Rachel’s Room, Ross is entering.]\nRoss: Hey.\nRachel: Hey.\nRoss: Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement.\nRachel: Surprised?\nRoss: And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.\nRachel: I know.\nRoss: I don’t think you do.\nRachel: You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.\nRoss: Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey\ndidn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you.\nRachel: Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to\nme, but Joey did.\n(Joey enters.)\nRoss: Joey proposed to you?\nJoey: I can come back.\nRoss: Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?\nJoey: No.\nRachel: Yes you did!\nJoey: Actually, technically, I didn’t.\nRachel: Well then why did you give me a ring?\nRoss: Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?\nJoey: No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!\nRachel: Yes, you did!\nJoey: No, I didn’t!\nRachel: Yes, you did!\nJoey: No, I didn’t!\nRachel: Yes, you did! And don’t you say, \"No, I didn’t!\"\nJoey: Ahhh!\nRachel: He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.\nRoss: Whoa! You were down on one knee?\nJoey: Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!\nRoss: Then what did happen?\nRachel: Yeah, what did happen?\nJoey: Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you\nthought I was proposing.\nRachel: Yeah, but you said, \"Will you marry me?\"\nJoey: No, I didn’t!\nRachel: Yes, you did!\nJoey: No, I didn’t!\nRachel: Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t! (Screams) Well then why\ndidn’t you tell me that before?!\nJoey: Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!\nRoss: Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!\nJoey: (To Ross) I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool.\nRachel: Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!\nJoey: It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I felt\nso bad Rach, because he was going to propose.\nRoss: What?!\nRachel: You were gonna propose to me?\nRoss: Uhh… No.\n(An awkward silence follows.)\nJoey: Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}\nRoss: But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again\nbut that—I mean that-that was all, Rach.\nJoey: Dude, step up! I proposed.\nRoss: No, you didn’t!\nJoey: Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate\nsome bad fruit earlier.\n(There’s a knock on the door and the Nurse enters carrying Emma.)\nNurse: Hey, she just woke up! She’s hungry. Why don’t we give this\nanother try?\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: (To Joey) I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!\nJoey: I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!\nRoss: Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!\nJoey: Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a\nwoman I like to slow things down!\nRachel: Oh my God!\nRoss: What?\nRachel: She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!\nJoey: (looking at the ceiling) Ah, it’s beautiful.\nNurse: I’ll come back for her later.\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Thank you. (The nurse exits.)\nRachel: Oh wow, this feels weird.\nRoss: Good weird?\nRachel: Wonderful weird.\nJoey: Y’know what you guys? I’m uh, I’m gonna go too. And uh,\nI’m sorry about everything.\nRachel: Honey don’t worry, it was my mistake.\nJoey: No, Rach, I should’ve told you sooner. It’s just that…Man!\nThat kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)\nRachel: She’s perfect.\nRoss: We’re so lucky.\nRachel: We really are.\nRoss: Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you\nare, but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been\nfeeling…\nRachel: I know. I know. I’ve feeling…\nRoss: Yeah?\nRachel: Yeah. (Laughs nervously)\nRoss: Okay, well, that… Wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least we\ncan, we can talk about us again.\nRachel: Yeah, maybe.\nRoss: Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y’know if we…if…\nYou’re wearing the ring.\n(Pause.)\nRachel: Wh-what’s that?\nRoss: And you told Phoebe you were engaged.\nRachel: I’m sorry, what?\nRoss: When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Outside the Janitor’s Closet, there are people having sex and Mr. Geller\nis trying to give them some pamphlets.]\nMr. Geller: Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get\npregnant. (He slides them under the door.)\nMonica: (walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!\nChandler: Hey.\nMr. Geller: (pause) Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets\nback? (They do so.) Thank you.\nEnd",
