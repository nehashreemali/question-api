Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our\nwedding china today?\nMonica: No, I think we should save our china for something\nreally special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.\nChandler: Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.\nMonica: What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.\nChandler: What is the point of having them if we never use\nthem?\nMonica: Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen\ncomes over..\nChandler: I will explain it to her.\nMonica: <laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you\ntalk to the queen.\nJoey: wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those\nhorses can crap.\nTV announcer: Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.\nChandler: Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa.

Stupid long sleeves.\nChandler: What are you going to do?\nJoey: I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really\ngood reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.\nThey sat us all down yesterday and said \"Everyone has to be there at 6:00\nAM sharp, that means you Tribbiani.\" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.\nChandler: Well you proved them wrong.\nJoey nods: Yeah.\n<Chandler nods and his eyes get big like he's saying 'what the hell'>\nOpening Credits\nRoss and Rachels Apartment\n<Ross and Rachel are putting baby stuff together like they're going to\nbe going somewhere.>\nRachel to Emma: Oh Emma.

Happy Thanksgiving!\nJoey: Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to\ncome over>\nPhoebe: Hey, what's going on Joe?\nJoey: I.. I.. I need a good lie.\nPhoebe: Oh okay.

You could see the strings people!\nJoey: No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't\nat a work thing today.\nPhoebe: Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.\nJoey: I do not.\nPhoebe: Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday\nat the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin\nwas gone-who took it?\nJoey: Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a\nraccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said \"Hey\ndon't eat that-that's Phoebe's\" and he said.. <pause> He said.. \"Joey\nyou stink at lying.\" What am I going to do?\nPhoebe: Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good\nlie. I'll help you practice it.\nJoey: Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.\nPhoebe: Sure, what.. what was the work thing?\nJoey: Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls\nup his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>\nPhoebe: \"Pick up grandma at the airport\"?\nJoey: Oh.. man..\nRoss and Rachel's Apartment.\nAmy with straight hair: Oh she's precious. Do you ever worry she's going to\nget your real nose?\nRachel: Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs\nRoss' hand for support>\n<Amy's cell phone rings>\nAmy: Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. <to Ross and Rachel> Can\nI take this upstairs?\nRoss: Sure, we don't live there but...\nAmy: Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? <moves hands\naround motioning 'just these rooms'> <To Ross> I thought you were\na doctor.\nRachel: Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.\nAmy: Ew. <walks into Rachel's room, I'm guessing>\nRachel: God she is unbelievable.\nRoss: I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.\nRachel: Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a\nrestaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.\nAmy storms out: Stupid Thanksgiving.\nRachel: What? What happened?\nAmy: My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find\na real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then\nhis wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married\nguys.\nRoss: Don't say that.\nAmy: Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to\nbe such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.\nRachel: Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk\nto you in private?\nRoss: Sure, you want to go upstairs?\n<Ross and Rachel go in the kitchen>\nRachel: Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I\nwould like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.\nRoss: You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like\nthe pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.\nRachel: Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has\nno where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I\nwould like them to bond.\nRoss: Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I\ndon't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.\nRachel: Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just\ngoing to have to make our peace with that!\n<Rachel grabs Ross' hand for support and starts to cry a little>\nMonica and Chandler's apartment\nRachel opens their door: Hi.\nEveryone there says: Hi, hey.\nRachel: Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is\nChandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.\nEveryone: Hi.\nAmy: Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives.\nJoey laughs: Yeah.\nAmy: wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.\nJoey looks rejected: Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.\n<Joey turns away and Chandler reassuringly pats him on the back>\nRoss to Monica: Hi.\nMonica to Ross: Hi.\n<they hug and kiss on check>\nMonica to Emma: Hey you.\nMonica to Amy: So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're\nseeing Emma?\nAmy with confused look on face: Yeah I.. I think so. <sticks her hand out\nto shake hands with Phoebe and says to her> It's nice to meet you Emma.\nPhoebe shakes her hand and says: Phoe-Be.\nAmy: Oh. That's a funny noise.\n<Monica and Amy turn away and walk into the living room towards the secret\ncloset>\nJoey: Pheebs, I still need some help here\nPhoebe: Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.\nbut its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when\nyou're talking, people know you're lying.\nJoey: Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..\nI mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.\nPhoebe looks down: You are a terrific actor.\n<Joey realizes what she's doing>\nAmy coming out of the bathroom: Hey. Hey where's the baby?\nRachel: Oh we just put her down for a nap.\nAmy: Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible?\nIf you guys died.\nRoss first has a look of 'huh' then changes it to sarcastic happy: Thank you\nAmy.\nAmy: no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it\nwould be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her,\nthen I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then\nI'd get married.\nPhoebe: Thats a great movie. <she claps>\n<Joey nods in agreement>\nAmy: Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything\ncause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just\nnot really a big fan of Emily. [Transcriber note: I'm surprised that Rachel\nand Ross didn't say they weren't either here]\nRoss: Emma.\nAmy turns around to Phoebe: Emma, Ross wants you.\nPhoebe: PHOE-BE.\nAmy turns to Ross and Rachel: Why does she keep making that\nnoise?\nRachel: Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,\nif something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock\non wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.\nAmy: Well who would?\nRoss: Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would\nwant Monica and Chandler.\nChandler: I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.\nMonica: yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.\nAmy: I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die\nand I don't get your baby?\nRachel: See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.\nWe see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected\nto the baby.\nAmy: Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's  a lump.\nChandler: You know, guys I got to say. This means so much\nto me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica\nand I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts\nabout my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts\nto cry>\nAmy: <points to Chandler> This guy? Seriously?\nLater in the day.\nMonica: Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using\nour fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.\nRoss starts playing with a plate: Woah. Woah... <nearly really drops the\nplate and more seriously> Woah.\nMonica: Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will\nnot be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>\nRoss makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.\nJoey: Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?\nDo you not trust me with a fancy plate?\nMonica: No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See\nits a game, whoever gets that plate wins.\nJoey: I can't believe I won.\nAmy: Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you\nwould give your baby to these strangers over me.\nRachel: Monica is Ross' sister.\nAmy: No, Ross' sister was really fat.\nMonica: That was me.\nAmy: No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that\nused to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.\nRachel: Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.\n<Amy gets pissed and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very harshly,\nyou can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate>\nMonica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you're having a little\nbit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I\nmean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.\n<Monica holds a turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat\noff with a knife>\nMonica: Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets\nface it you have fun.\nAmy: Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate\nlady dies, then do I get the baby?\nChandler: No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated\nat this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?\n<Ross and Rachel pause and ponder this>\nRachel: Well actually...\nChandler: Actually what?\nRoss: well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma\nwould go to my parents.\nChandler: What?\nAmy: Hurts, doesn't it?\n<Chandler gives a look that says \"Yeah!\">\nJoey raises his hand: Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?\n<Everyone is looking around and at Joey with looks of 'what?' on their\nfaces>\nCommercial Break.\nChandler: So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough\nto raise Emma?\nRoss looks down: No,  that that is not what we're saying.\nJoey: Yeah he's lying. He looked down.\n<Joey looks to Phoebe and she nods in agreement>\nChandler: Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?\nBecause I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!\nRachel: Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think\nyou're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.\nRoss: Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like\nMonica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.\nMonica: Thats not how you see me, is it?\nPhoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.\nChandler: Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do\nyou really think I'm not capable?\nRoss: No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're\nstrongest when.. when you're together.\nChandler: Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks\non table>  she'd have to give her up.\nRoss: Sure, Monica would have to give her up.\nJoey: I lie better then that, right?\nChandler: So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends\ndie, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left\nin my life gets taken away from me?\nPhoebe: There's your movie! <claps>\nLater on.\nMonica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.\nMonica: Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.\nChandler: Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise\npoorly?\nMonica: Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.\nI mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of\nMerlot and a five year old condom.\nChandler: Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong\nfather figure and I never will be.\nMonica: No you learn these things. You grow into it.\nChandler: Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said\nwas exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody\nknows it.\nMonica: I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because\nI think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard\nparts.\nChandler: Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \"Go\nto your room! You're grounded\"?\nMonica: Can you hear me say \"You're grounded\"?\nChandler: You said that to me last week.\nMonica: How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.\nBack to Monica and Chandler's apartment.\nAmy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad.\nJoey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message\non my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed\noff at me.. <whiny voice> And they all got to meet Santa!\nPhoebe: It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's\neasy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the\nparade because you had a family emergency.\nJoey: Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because\nI had a family emergency.\nPhoebe: Ooh, what happened?\nJoey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear: Oh.. My sister's\nraccoon.\nPhoebe: No! Nothing with a raccoon.\nJoey: Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands\nout in the air>\nMonica and Chandler come through the front door.\nMonica: Oh wait.. What are you doing?\nJoey: Setting the table.\nPhoebe: Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy\nchina for dessert too.\nMonica: Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses\non my wedding dress.\nRoss comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying\nthingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.\nRoss: Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.\nChandler: Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't\nknow anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I\nwant you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.\nRoss walks away with a face of yeah ok.\nAmy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch.  <pauses> Uchh <louder\nthis time> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.\nRachel: UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>\nAmy: You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.\nRachel: Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when\nI died and didn't give you my baby?\nAmy: This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I\nmean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.\nRachel: What? What carrer?\nAmy: Um.. I'm a decorator.\nRachel: Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a\ndecorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.\nAmy: Why can't you ever be supportive?\nRachel: Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even\ncome and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.\nAmy: Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in\nthe hospital when I was getting my lips done.\nRachel: I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks\ninto the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving\nEmily to you.\nRoss: Emma.\nRachel turns to Ross: Oh whose side are you on? <back\nto Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle\nthe responibility of a child.\nAmy: How hard could it be? You do it.\nJoey: ooh oooh..\nAmy: Do you want to know why you don't want  me to have\nthe baby?\nRachel: uh huh.\nAmy: Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have\nalways been jealous of me.\nRachel: Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You,\nyour immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?\nAmy: Uh.. To name a few.  You know.. You know.. You've\njust always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't\nhave anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do\nyou even realize how much that hurt me?\nRachel: Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!\nAmy: Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.\nRachel: I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here\ntoday.\nAmy: Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called\nsister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.\nRachel: ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's\nforty five.\nAmy: You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your\nnew baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns\nthrows the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something.\nYour baby isn't even that cute.\n<everyone sucks their breath in, in shock>\nRoss walks over: Too far, Amy. Too far.\nRachel: You take that back.\nAmy: No.\nRachel: Take it back!\nAmy: No! What are you going to do? Make me?\nRachel: Heey man, I work out.\n<Ross nods his head and points at her, in a yes manner>\nAmy: So do I.\nRachel: I do pilates.\nAmy: I do yoga.\nRachel: Bring it on!\n<Amy pushes Rachel and Monica goes berserk and runs around the table>\nMonica: Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the\nboxes!\nRachel: Did you just push me?\nAmy: Uh, yeah I think I did.\nRachel: Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>\nMonica screaming at Ross: Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't\ntime!\n<Rachel and Amy 'fighting'.. They're really just trying to slap each other\nand just keep slapping their hands>\nRachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!\n<They go back to fighting and then it really gets on>\nPhoebe: Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?\nJoey: What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello\non them.\n<Amy starts spitting on Rachel's hand and Rachel is saying ew and pushes\nher away>\nRachel: Ew! Gross.\n<Amy runs towards Rachel and Rachel puts her arm out, hand on Amy's head\nand Amy starts trying to hit her but is missing, Rachel is moving backwards\ntowards the table when her hand swipes the one plate left on the table on to\nthe floor>\n<Everyone is shocked and Monica faints and Ross catches her>\nChandler: Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and\nyou can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't\nbe here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones\nI picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize\nto her right now.\nAmy: I'm sorry.\nRachel: Mon, I'm so sorry.\nChandler: Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize\nto each other and mean it.\nAmy and Rachel at same time: Sorry.\nChandler: By the way, that fight was totally arousing.\nRoss: Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel\ndies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.\nChandler: Oh yeah? Well thanks.\nRoss: So, so now do I get Joey?\nChandler: Okay, but you should know he eats five times a\nday and shoves pennies up his nose.\n<Ross ponders that and walks away>\nRachel: Are you okay Mon?\nMonica: uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a\nplate. Its not like somebody died.\nPhoebe: It's all right. You can mourn.\nMonica starts crying: Thank you. It was so beautiful. <gets up and walks\ntowards the front door> I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.\nJoey: Actually its not pies, its just pie.\nMonica: I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my\ngod. I've lost the will to scold.\nRachel: Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm\nsorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..\nAmy: So you're going to give me the baby?\nRachel: Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren\ndiscount.\nAmy starting to cry: You are not going to regret this.\n<they hug and Rachel has this disgusted look on her face and then Emma\nstarts crying>\nRachel: She needs changing.\nChandler: Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent\nand totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there\nEmma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of\nchina> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\n[Scene: Chandler is packing the broken china in its box. He's taping up the\ntop of box so thoroughly, there isn't an inch of cardboard which isn't covered\nin tape. He is struggling with the tape dispenser.]\nPhoebe: Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?\nChandler: Nope...\nPhoebe: Broke them all, huh?\nChandler: Yep...\nPhoebe: You gonna tell her?\nChandler: Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna...\nput the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should\nuse these plates again for a looong time.\nMonica: Like only if the queen comes?\nChandler: Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)\nJoey: Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had\na family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie\nPheebs.\nPhoebe: No problem! Next week: stealing... (Chandler walks\naway to store the box of broken china.)\nMonica: Bye plates!\nJoey: Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (Chandler\nwalks back, looking angrily at Joey)\nMonica: What? Something happened with the plates?\nJoey: Uhm... (looks down) Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came\nin...",
