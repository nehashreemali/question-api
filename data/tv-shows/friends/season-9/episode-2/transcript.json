Ooh (laughs) you mean like a… Huh?\nJoey: (entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it’s Joey he\njust ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know you’re pissed at me, but we\nhave to talk about this.\nRoss: Ah actually we don’t. (Ross walks off)\nJoey:  Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I\ndidn’t even do anything wrong.\nRoss: (turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn’t do anything wrong?!\nJoey: I said I didn’t technically.\nRoss: Okay let’s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.)\n\"accidentally\" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again)\n\"accidentally\" proposed to Rachel.\nJoey: Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this\n(Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don’t really know what that means. (Ross just\nlooks at him) You were saying?\nRoss: And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel, but why\ncouldn’t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn’t.\nJoey: I know I should’ve. (Makes quote marks again.) \"I’m\nsorry.\"\nRoss: Not using it right, Joe.\n(He brings his hands in closer to his face then does it again.)\nRoss: I’m gonna go.\nJoey: No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he can’t leave) Look, Ross, we\nhave to get past this.\nRoss: Give me the bag.\nJoey: No, look, I don’t know what else to do.

Look!\n(He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn’t and Joey punches Ross.\nGunther is amused.)\nRoss: What is the matter with you?!?\nJoey: You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?\nRoss: Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?\nJoey: Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we’re there, they can\ncheck your reflexes.

You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a\npicnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?\nMonica: Oh yeah (smiles).\nChandler: Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of\nOklahoma?\nMonica: What? Who says that?\nChandler: People who’ve never ever been to Paris.\nMonica: What’s going on?\nChandler: We’re moving to Tulsa!

Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A\nFringe On Top.\nMonica: Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that\nyou’re gay?

I’ll get out of it.\nMonica: Thank you.\nChandler: (hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?\nMonica: Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.\n[Scene: Ms. McKenna’s Office, Chandler enters.]\nChandler: Umm ma’am, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in)\nI kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.\nMs. McKenna: What?\nChandler: It’s a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in\nthe meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really know\nwhat I was saying.\nMs. McKenna: You fell asleep?\nChandler: But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting,\nain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here’s the\nthing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love\nTulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go\nthere!\nMs. McKenna: Chandler, I…\nChandler: No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I\nwhen your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at\nhim.) That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. I\nlike a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa.

Ross I feel terrible.\nRoss: You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to\nhold the pen but can’t)\nJoey: You, you want me to help you with that?\nRoss: Why, does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He\nhands Joey the form)\nJoey: Name?

I mean, you’re gonna get\ntogether right?\nRoss: I don’t think that we are.\nJoey: But you two were supposed to be together.\nRoss: Well, I thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you.\nJoey: Come on, Ross, that didn’t mean anything! She just had the baby, she\nwas all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.\nRoss: Yeah that’s what she said.\nJoey: So?\nRoss: So I don’t wanna be just anybody.\nJoey: Wow.\nRoss: You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean I\ndon’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s just\nmuch easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.\nJoey: Really?\nRoss: Yeah.\nJoey: And you’re Okay with that?\nRoss: Yes. I mean, it’s what we always planned.  And if you have a\nplan, you should stick to it.  That’s why they call them plans.  Hello?\n(Pause) I’m fine.\nJoey: Hey, for what it’s worth, with Rachel I don’t think you’ll\never be just (Makes quote marks.) \"anybody.\"\nRoss: Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)\nJoey: (makes quote marks) \"Thanks.\"\n(Ross looks away, not bothering)\n[Scene: Ross and Rachel’s, Emma continues to cry.]\nRachel: Oh my God! How long has she been crying?\nMonica: About a week and a half.\nPhoebe: Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I’m\njust gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No!\nReally? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)\nMonica: Rach, try holding her a different way.\nRachel: You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.\nPhoebe: Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!\nRachel: Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)\nPhoebe: Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)\nRachel: Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my own\nbaby! I’m the worst mother ever!\nMonica: You’re just new at this, it’ll get better, think about your\nfirst day at work. I mean, that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out.\nRachel: Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here!\nOh my god just please take her.\nMonica: Okay I’ll take her, here. (Takes Emma)\nRachel: I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)\nPhoebe: I have to go scream into a pillow.

Rachel let’s give it six to eight months (she leaves).\nRachel: Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.\nMonica: What?\nRachel: You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be\nsleeping so… (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)\nChandler: (entering, loudly) Hey!\nMonica: Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep\nChandler: Oh so there can’t be any yelling.\nMonica: No.\nChandler: We’re moving to Tulsa\nMonica: (loudly) What!?\nChandler: Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh!
