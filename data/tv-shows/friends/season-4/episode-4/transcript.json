(Hands her the garbage.)\nRachel: Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door\nand stops.)\nMonica: Third door on the left.\nRachel: Right!\n[Scene: Garbage room: Mr. Treeger is unclogging the trash chute as Rachel enters.]\nRachel: Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.\nMr. Treeger:: Hey.\n(Rachel opens the trash chute, winces at the smell, and throws the garbage bag in.

She then turns around too see Mr. Treeger\nwatching her.)\nMr. Treeger:: What are you doing?\nRachel: Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.)\nIt’s a little old but…\nMr. Treeger:: No! You’re clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour\nunclogging!\nRachel: I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.\nMr. Treeger:: Oh yeah, of course you don’t!\nRachel: No.\nMr. Treeger:: ‘Cause you’re a little princess! \"Daddy, buy me a\npizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy\nBirthday to me…\"\nRachel: I didn’t… I never said that.\nMr. Treeger:: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will\ncome in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don’t think of someone else for a\nchange?\nRachel: (starting to cry) Okay, I’m sorry.

I think it’s best that we just\nforget about it.\nRachel: That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.\nJoey: All right that’s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the\ndoor.)\nMonica: (Picking up a card from Chandler’s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym\ncard?\nChandler: Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve\nmissed the last 1200 times.\nRoss: So why don’t you quit?\nChandler: You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having\n50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down\nthere! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they\nbring out Maria.\nRoss: Who is Maria?\nChandler: Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra\nspandex covered gym…treat.\nRoss: You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?\nChandler: No!\nRoss: So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?\nChandler: Oh no, you’ll have to come.\n[Scene: Treeger’s apartment, Joey knocks on the door and Treeger opens it.]\nMr. Treeger:: Tribbiani!

I’ll see you later.\n(Starts to leave)\nMonica: What a minute, what did he say?\nJoey: He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living\nhere illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see\nyou later.\nRachel: What?!
