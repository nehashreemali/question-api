  "transcript": "The One With Rachel’s Crush\nWritten by: Shana Goldberg-Meehan\nTranscribed by: Eric Aasen\n[Scene: A Theatre, Chandler and Ross are there to watch the premiere of Kathy’s\nplay.]\nChandler: Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I\nget to have sex with the star of the play!\nRoss: People can hear you.\nChandler: I know!!\n(The play starts.)\nChandler: Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?\nRoss: Yeah.\n(Onstage there’s a knock on the door and Kathy opens it. We don’t see\nwhat’s going on, only hear it.)\nKathy's Co-Star: Hi!\nKathy: Hi!\nRoss: That is one good looking man!\nChandler: Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!\nKathy's Co-Star: Sooo, you’ve been doing this long?\nKathy: No, you’re my first. Put the money on the table.\n(Ross and Chandler have stunned looks on their faces as Kathy and her co-star start\nmaking out.)\nKathy's Co-Star: Oh, yeah! Ooh, that’s nice. (They start making out\nharder.)\nRoss: Dude!\nKathy's Co-Star: Is that an expensive blouse?\nKathy: If you want it to be.\n(Kathy’s co-star rips her blouse off and buttons go flying into the audience, and\none hits Ross. Chandler’s mouth is on the floor.)\nRoss: Here’s your girlfriend’s button. (Holding the button.)\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica is still unpacking after\nthe move, and Phoebe is their also.]\nPhoebe: Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from\nhigh school?\nMonica: Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?\nPhoebe: Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.\n(Rachel enters)\nMonica: Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If\nyou could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at\nit.\nRachel: Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)\nMonica: Oh my God, are you out of a job?\nRachel: No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge\nstep down!\nPhoebe: Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty\nrich people and tell them what to buy?\nRachel: Uh-huh.\nPhoebe: That sounds great!\nJoey: (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)\nMonica: Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food\nanymore, that-that gravy train had ended.\nJoey: (Holding a turkey leg) There’s gravy?\nMonica: If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over\nall the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now.\n(She takes back the turkey leg)\n(Joey climbs up on the counter and starts looking at the top of the cabinets.)\nMonica: What are you doing?\nJoey: I think I left a donut up here.\n[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are entering after the play. Phoebe and Joey\nare already there.]\nRoss: Hey!\nPhoebe: Hey!\nJoey: Hey!\nPhoebe: Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?\nRoss: Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good\nlookin’ guy.\nChandler: Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst\nnightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!\nPhoebe: That’s a good idea for a business!\nChandler: I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on\nstage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s\ngonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, \"So where’s your\nboyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?\" And she’ll go, \"No-no-no,\nit’s Chandler.\" And he’ll go, \"Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!\"\nJoey: (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.\nChandler: All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?\nJoey: Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just\n‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean\njust ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean\nit’s gonna happen with them.\nRoss: Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.\nJoey: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.\nRoss: Yeah.\nPhoebe: Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.\nRoss: They’re not a couple!\nPhoebe: Oh-okay, I get the game now.\nJoey: Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on\nstage, was it like really hot?\nRoss: Oh yeah!\nJoey: Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are\nactually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long\nas it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes\naway, that’s when you’re in trouble.\nChandler: Really?\nJoey: Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever\nhad chemistry on stage?\nRoss: No.\nJoey: Noooo!!\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, the gang minus Monica and Rachel\nare eating breakfast. Ross and Chandler are sitting at the foosball table and eating.]\nChandler: So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?\nRoss: Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how\nhot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.\nChandler: Yeah, I know but…\nRoss: Oh no-no-no, I’m there.\nMonica: (entering) Hey!\nJoey: Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?\nMonica: You made pancakes?\nJoey: Yep! Grab a plate.\nMonica: Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her\npancakes.)\nJoey: No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which\nflies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin’ closer.\nChandler: Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals,\nmuffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain\nare the same thing.\nJoey: Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday\nnight, if people want to come over.\nRoss: Oh yeah!\nMonica: Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.\nJoey: Oh yeah, who’s playing?\nMonica: The players.\nRoss: Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.\nMonica: (laughs) Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.\nJoey: All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!\nPhoebe: Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her\nplate.)\n[Scene: Bloomingdale’s, Rachel’s new job.]\nRachel: (on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old\nwoman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you\nI’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I\nam! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you\nget this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah\nreally need to talk to you.\nMr. Waltham: In a moment, please, I’m in the middle of a task. And you have\na customer.\n(It’s a really good-looking man, Joshua, that Rachel has an instant crush on. Well\nactually it’s Tate Donovan, so it’s not like she’s really testing her\nacting skills.)\nRachel: Hi!\nJoshua: Hi, I’m Joshua.\nRachel: Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?\nJoshua: Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife…\nRachel: Oh, I’m so sorry.\n(He walks over to look and some clothes and Rachel quickly turns around and adjusts her\nbra, trying to show off her assets.)\nJoshua: Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This\nsuit and what turned out to be a skirt.\nRachel: Well, at least that’s a great suit.\nJoshua: Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in\nthe skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’re\nwilling, I’m all yours.\nRachel: Okay.\nMr. Waltham: Rachel, you needed to speak to me?\nRachel: No-no, that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let\nme show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.\n(He walks out and Rachel stares at his butt as he leaves. He makes a wrong turn.)\nRachel: Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (Motions to the\ncorrect way.)\nJoshua: It’s this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his\nbutt.)\n[Scene: Kathy’s play, Ross and Chandler are waiting for her in the lobby after the\nplay.]\nChandler: I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.\nBefore they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey\ntold us what this means!\nRoss: All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was\nsome sexual chemistry between them.\nChandler: Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!\nRoss: Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t\nbe…y'know you.\nKathy: Hey you guys!\nRoss: Hey!\nKathy: Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it\ntonight?\nRoss: Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)\nKathy: Wasn’t Nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit?\n(Chandler laughs without opening his mouth.)\nKathy: It’s a good play, isn’t it?\n(Chandler mumbles something, and Ross tells him to \"Come on.\")\nChandler: Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly\nyou’re having sex with him.\nRoss: Okay, I… (Walks away.)\nKathy: Clearly, I’m having sex with him?\nChandler: Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!\nKathy: Okay, so let me just get this straight. You’re accusing me of\ncheating on you, and insulting my performance?\nChandler: Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re\nup there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.\nKathy: Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I’m-I’m playing a part in a\nplay! How can you not trust me?!\nChandler: Well, you can understand, given how we started.\nKathy: Oh, wow. I can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face.\nChandler: Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying\nthis!\nKathy: I’ll tell you what, Chandler, why don’t you call me when you\ngrow up!\nChandler: Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Phoebe, and Ross are there\neating pizza as Rachel enters.]\nRachel: I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over\ntoday, and I got to dress him up all day!\nPhoebe: Rachel has a new doll.\nRachel: Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them\ntogether and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised\nit, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.\nRoss: Uh, hello!\nRachel: Hi-e!!\nPhoebe: Ooh, what do I smell?\nJoey: I don’t know, it smells good.\n(He goes over and opens the door to reveal Monica holding a plate of cookies and a fan\nto blow the smell across the hall.)\nMonica: Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!\nPhoebe: Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)\nMonica: Please, have some!\nRoss: Oh, yumm!\nMonica: Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious\ntreats for everyone.\nJoey: (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!\nMonica: Yeah, it’s just something I picked up.\nRoss: Cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever!!\n(Rachel laughs hysterically for no reason.)\nPhoebe: What? What?\nRachel: Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be\nthere.\nRoss: Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?\nRachel: It’s Joshua.\nRoss: Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his\napartment. Joey follows him)\nMonica: Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!\nPhoebe: (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but…\nMonica: No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!\nPhoebe: Yeah, I don’t need it.\nMonica: People are supposed to wanna hang out here!\nRachel: Why? Honey, what is the big deal?\nMonica: I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I\nmean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought\ntheir dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.\nPhoebe: Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone\nhas to hang out in the big apartment?\nMonica: ‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But\nI’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.\nPhoebe: If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out\nhere!\nRachel: Yeah, that’s true.\nMonica: All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be\nten times better than that place!\nPhoebe: Oh, are we gonna trash that place?\n(Chandler comes back, obviously drunk, and trips over the steps.)\nChandler: Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at\nthe new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind\ntheir backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy\nto hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!\nAll: What?!\nRoss: So you were right?\nChandler: I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t\nlive here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)\nRoss: Chandler!\nRachel: Chandler, what did she say?\nPhoebe: Wait a minute.\nJoey: Come here.\nMonica: Are you sure?\nChandler: Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak\nJulie’s…\nRachel: Beefsteak Charlie’s?\nChandler: Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think\nthe same.)\n[Scene: The hallway between the apartments, Monica is lugging one of those floor\npolishing machines through the hallway. Rachel comes up the steps and stops when she sees\nMonica.]\nRachel: Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh, hey, do you\nneed help with that?\nMonica: Nah, I got it.\nRachel: Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and\nJoey’s.)\n[Cut to inside the apartment.]\nRachel: Hi!\nAll: Hey!\nRachel: So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.\nIt’s just so frustrating!\nPhoebe: Why don’t you ask him out?\nJoey: Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!\nRachel: Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?\nJoey: Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.\nPhoebe: He just got a divorce right?\nRachel: Hmm-mmm.\nPhoebe: So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you\njust have to make the first move.\nRachel: Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.\nPhoebe: (shocked) You’ve never asked a guy out?!!\nRachel: No. Have you?\nPhoebe: Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?\nRachel: I don’t even know how I would go about it.\nJoey: Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,\n\"Hey, how you doin’?\"\nPhoebe: Oh, please!\nJoey: (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?\n(Phoebe looks at him, and then giggles and looks away.)\nRachel: You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and\nI’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’?\n(Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s.\n(Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store\ntoday? Well, we found a wallet, and we—(Listens) the license? Well, that is a\ngood idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh,\nbelongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll\nsee you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You’ve done that a thousand times?\nPhoebe: I’ve never done that.\nRachel: Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.\nJoey: Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh,\nKnicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say\nyes!\nRachel: Really?! You think that will work?\nJoey: Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?\n(We hear a noise coming from Monica and Rachel’s apartment.)\nJoey: What the heck is that?\n(They go open the door and reveal Monica being spun around on the floor polisher and\ngetting the cord wrapped around her legs.)\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Joey, and Phoebe are\nwatching a movie as Chandler comes in from his bedroom.]\nChandler: Did she call?\nPhoebe: No, sorry.\nChandler: All right, maybe I should call her.\nJoey: No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!\nRoss: He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.\nChandler: Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?\nRoss: How might you be wrong?\nChandler: Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?\nJoey: Dude, tell me she actually told you this.\nChandler: She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.\nBack me up here, Ross!\nRoss: That’s all you’re basing this on?\nChandler: That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and\nthe heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.\nJoey: Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories\nthat didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.\nChandler: Oh my God!!\n[Scene: Bloomingdale’s, Rachel’s new job, she is waiting for Joshua\nand practising how to ask him out.]\nRachel: Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You\nknow, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.)\nUmm, who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)\nJoshua: What do you think?\nRachel: Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!\nJoshua: Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the\nmirror.) Yeah?\nRachel: Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how\nthey would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like\nit?\nJoshua: I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I’m gonna wear it home.\nRachel: Great.\nJoshua: All right, thank you so much for all your help.\nRachel: Sure.\nJoshua: Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.\nRachel: Yeah-eah-ha!\nJoshua: Thanks. (He starts to leave) Maybe I’ll see in the spring, with the\nuh, y’know, for the uh, bathing suits.\nRachel: Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!\nJoshua: Ah, that’s okay, thanks.\nRachel: Okay.\nJoshua: Anyway, hopefully, I’ll see you around sometime. (He goes out the\ndoor.)\nRachel: Basketball!\nJoshua: (coming back in) I’m sorry.\nRachel: I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re\ninterested, just as a thank you for this week.\nJoshua: Wow! That would be great.\nRachel: Really?\nJoshua: Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks!\nThis is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr.\nWaltham returns.)\nMr. Waltham: Good morning.\nJoshua: Hi!\n(Mr. Waltham admires Joshua’s butt as he leaves.)\n[Scene: Kathy’s apartment, Chandler is knocking on the door.]\nKathy: (opening the door) Hey.\nChandler: Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry.\nY’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely\nunderstand why you were so upset.\nKathy: Oh wow. I really wish you’d call me.\nChandler: Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a\ngood thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on.\nY’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.)\nNick’s pants?\nKathy: Yeah.\nChandler: Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is debriefing Rachel on her\nrejection earlier that day and telling her what she should’ve done. Ross and Phoebe\nare watching.]\nJoey: Okay, for next time, what do you say?\nRachel: I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an\nextra ticket.\nRoss: So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?\nRachel: He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got\nthe date, I’m just not on it!\nMonica: (entering) Okay, it’s ready. Come on.\nJoey: What’s ready?\nMonica: Just come.\n(They all go over to her apartment.)\nRoss: Oh my God!\nRachel: Wow! Monica!\nPhoebe: Great!\nRoss: This is beautiful!\n(She has cleaned it, completely redecorated it, removed the carpet, and polished the\nfloor.)\nPhoebe: Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?\nMonica: Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?\nJoey: I don’t know, it looks the same.\nMonica: You used to have carpet.\nJoey: Oh yeah!\nMonica: So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest\nmy eyes just a little bit.\nRoss: Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?\nMonica: Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the\nhostess.\n(Chandler returns.)\nRoss: Hey!\nJoey: How’d it go?\nChandler: Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.\nPhoebe: Oh good!\nChandler: She is now.\nRoss: What are you saying?\nChandler: I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean\nyou think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with\nhis rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I\ndon’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.\nPhoebe: How? How is your fault?\nChandler: Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called\nher after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they\nwould’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!\nRachel: Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it\ndoes not justify her sleeping with someone.\nRoss: Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…\n(They all turn and glare at him.)\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Bloomingdale’s, Rachel is sitting at her desk as Mr. Waltham\ncomes in.]\nMr. Waltham: Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A\nJoshua Bergen.\nRachel: Really?\nMr. Waltham: Will you call him?\nRachel: Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and\nholds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs,\nand mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my\nwallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad.\nRachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?\nEnd",
