Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel\nwhat she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the\nbabies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?\nRachel: Little village people.\nMonica: Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (It’s a little pink\nand white dress for the girl baby.)\nRachel: Oh, that is so sweet!\nMonica: I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!\nRachel: Huh.

I’ll let you play with my duck.\n[Scene: Joey’s bedroom, it’s the middle of the night, he’s waking up and\ndiscovers he’s alone in bed.]\nJoey: Hey, (realises he doesn’t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that\nthe ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it’s empty and starts to panic.)\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, it’s continued from earlier. Joey is now waking\nChandler and telling him the news.]\nJoey: (running and banging on Chandler’s door) The stripper stole the\nring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper\nstole the ring!\nChandler: (opening the door) What?\nJoey: The ring is gone!\nChandler: Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!!\nYou lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!\nJoey: Dude, this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night,\neverything’s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is\ngone!\nChandler: You slept with the stripper?\nJoey: Of course!! (Shrugs.)\n[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is entering, Monica and Rachel are talking on the couch.]\nPhoebe: Hi, guys.\nRachel: Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.)\nMonica: Hi Phoebe.\nPhoebe: I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy\nyesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.\nRachel: No we…\nMonica: Hormones.\nRachel: …hormones, yeah.\nPhoebe: Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.\n(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)\nMonica: Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how\nare things going?\nPhoebe: Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like\neverything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?\nRachel: Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to\nRoss’s wedding.\nPhoebe: Oh!\nRachel: It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…\nPhoebe: Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street\nand this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.\nRachel: Well, h-how is this like that?\nPhoebe: Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see\nthat was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of\ny’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…\nRachel: (starting to cry) I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…\nPhoebe: Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is trying to figure out what to do.]\nJoey: Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company\nthat sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this\nisn’t an emergency, then what is?\nRoss: (entering) Hey guys!\nChandler: Hey!\nJoey: Hey…\nRoss: I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And\nthe guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor\nparty before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…\nJoey: So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!\nRoss: Yeah, right!\nJoey: I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for\nmyself, I might want to get one of those…\nRoss: That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and\nthe clothes on her back were all she had with her.\nChandler: So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little\nsqueeze.)\nRoss: Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride\nwho has worn it has had a long and happy life.\nChandler: So you might say, it’s a magic ring.\nJoey: (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.\nRoss: My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!\nH-how?! How could this all happen?!\nChandler: Well, I think it all started when you said, \"Hey Joey, why\ndon’t you be my best man.\"\nRoss: (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call the\ncops!\nJoey: Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!\nRoss: Not on you! On the stripper!\nJoey: Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into\nit right after they solved all the murders.\nRoss: Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!\nJoey: I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number.\nThey said, \"If I bothered them again they’d call the police.\" I said,\n\"If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!\"\nRoss: So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s\nnothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!\nJoey: Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…\nChandler: Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her\ncome to my office?\nJoey: Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are cautiously serving Phoebe some tea.]\nMonica: Here’s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a\nstep back.)\nPhoebe: (sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of\nrelief.) Oh, thanks.\nRachel: Good.\nMonica: I’m so glad you liked it.\nPhoebe: (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)\nMonica: What?!\nRachel: What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)\nPhoebe: Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.\nRachel: You what?\nMonica: Oh my God!\nPhoebe: Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that\nwas definitely one.\nMonica: Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t\nsterilised it since the guys moved out!\nRachel: Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what?\nIt’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just\nrip up some sheets!\nPhoebe: No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said\nthat, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.\nMonica: Rachel, get the book! The book!\nRachel: Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!\nMonica: The Bible?!\nRachel: I don’t know!\n[Scene: Chandler’s office, the guys are there waiting to ambush the stripper.]\nJoey: All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.\nAnd-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would\nshe? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll\nbe uh, Mr. Wong.\nRoss: Diverse.\n(There’s a knock on the door.)\nThe Stripper: Did anybody call for security?\nChandler: (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all\nturn there backs on her.)\nThe Stripper: Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.)\nHey, Joey?\nRoss: Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is\nit? Where is it?\nChandler: Way to be cool, man.\nThe Stripper: What’s he talking about?\nJoey: There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!\nThe Stripper: Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?\nThe Guys: Yeah!\nRoss: We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!\nThe Stripper: Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don’t need to\nsteal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys\nmake that?\nChandler: Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, the guys are now trying to figure out what next to do,\nsince their plan with the stripper backfired on them.]\nJoey: I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’t\ntake it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did?\n(The duck quacks.) Shh! We’re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the\nsame moment and stare at Joey, who doesn’t get it. After a short pause, with the duck\nstill quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is recovering from her false labour.]\nRachel: I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.\nPhoebe: Well, do you see any babies?\nMonica: How do you feel?\nPhoebe: Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I\nknow it’s going to be over soon.\nRachel: Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.\nPhoebe: I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when\nyou’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing.\nI’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.\nMonica: Some moms do that.\nPhoebe: Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself\ninto, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I\nknow them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little\nbabies have to go away.\nMonica: Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have\nanything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even\nbetter.\nPhoebe: Yeah, okay.\nRachel: No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying\nabout saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or\ndeciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?\nMonica: I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna\nrun away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.\nRachel: And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!\nPhoebe: Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!\nMonica: Yeah.\nRachel: And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.\nPhoebe: They are gonna love me.\nRachel: Oh!\nPhoebe: Thanks you guys! Again.\nMonica: Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)\nPhoebe: You’re the best. Thanks. Oh!\nMonica and Rachel: What?!\nPhoebe: Just kidding. Ahh!\nRachel: What?!\nMonica: Oh my God!\nPhoebe: Got cha again, you guys are so easy.\n[Scene: The Animal Hospital, the guys have taken the duck in to remove the ring. Joey\nis pacing around like an expectant father.]\nJoey: If anything should happen to him…\nRoss: Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.\nJoey: So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make\nit?!\nChandler: He will, Joe.\nJoey: Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck.\n(With that we go into a little flashback about the guys’ memories of the duck. The\nfirst one is Joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off. Then it’s\nChandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and Chandler\nreading to him in bed, and him watching Baywatch when all they had was the canoe\nand the duck was in a bucket of water. Then we see Ross eating some cereal and the duck\nwatching him. He takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. Then it’s Chandler\nshooing them out of the bathroom in the girls’ apartment, Joey revealing their disco\ncubby hole in the entertainment-center, then Chandler playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with them,\nand it’s concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping it’s wings. And\nthe guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.)\nJoey: I’m so worried about him, y’know?\nThe Doctor: (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?\nRoss: Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,\nand then does a double-take realising where it’s been.)\nJoey: H-h-h-how’s the duck?\nThe Doctor: He’s doing just fine, he’s resting now, but you can see\nhim in a little bit.\nJoey: Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.\nRoss: No, that’s all right.\nJoey: No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let\nyou down!\nChandler: Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.\nJoey: Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’know\nwhat, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.\nChandler: No, you should.\nJoey: Now, don’t argue with me…\nRoss: Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you\nguys.\nChandler: Really?\nJoey: Really?\nRoss: Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are\nmy… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting\nemotional.)\nChandler: Thanks man.\nJoey: (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so\nthat they can’t see him cry.)\nChandler: What a baby.\nRoss: Total wuss!\n(They both turn and wipe their eyes.)\nClosing Credits\n[There was no closing scene, only a preview of the wedding.]\nEnd",
