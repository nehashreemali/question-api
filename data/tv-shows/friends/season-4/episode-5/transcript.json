(He bangs his fists together.)\nRachel: What was that?\nRoss: Monica knows.\nMonica: It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our\nparents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I\ncried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was\nactually cooler than my older brother.\nRoss: Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date\ntonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.\nPhoebe: Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour.

Oh\nuh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime. (She leaves)\nRoss: Who wants to make some long distance calls?\n[Scene: A street, Chandler is buying a newspaper and notices Kathy running by.]\nChandler: Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps\nrunning, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to\nplay. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a\nhot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs,\nin desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the\nchase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to\nget up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth.

(Monica laughs)\n(Phoebe runs into the kitchen with wet hair, opens the window, and sticks her head\noutside.)\nRoss: Pheebs, what are you doing?\nPhoebe: Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be\neasy, supposedly they're pretty common.\nMonica: Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.\nChandler: (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.\nPhoebe: What?!\nRoss: Are you serious?\nPhoebe: Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!\nChandler: I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know?\nI mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he\nwaits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you\nChandler!\nMonica: (sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.\nPhoebe: You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth\nwhen you do that!\n(Joey and Kathy enter, laughing)\nJoey: Hey.\nKathy: (to Chandler) We were just talking about you.\nChandler: Really?!\nJoey: Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with\nyour head in the toilet.\nChandler: (laughs) Right in there!\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with the chick and\nthe duck.]\nChandler: 99...100!

So that's just gonna get me\nstraight through the week.\nJoey: Okay, I see what's going on here.\nChandler: You-you do?\nJoey: Yeah! You don't like Kathy.\nChandler: You got me.\nJoey: Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I\nmade an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an\neffort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?\nChandler: Yeah. Right.\nJoey: Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But\nthat's only because you're not eating anything, right?\nChandler: Okay.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning from a date with Josh, and when they\nget the door open, Rachel turns and passionately kisses Josh.]\nMonica: (lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.\nRachel: Oh.

(to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he\nlooks so yummy in your leather jacket.\nRachel: Ughh! (Storms out after him)\nPhoebe: (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And\nthere's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.\nMonica: Thank you so much Phoebe.\nPhoebe: (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.\nMonica: What are you doing with those?!\nPhoebe: But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.\nMonica: Sorry, Phoebe.\nPhoebe: It's okay. How's the soup?\nMonica: Umm. (nodding her head, \"Good.\")\n(Monica sets the soup down and Phoebe picks it up and licks the rim.)\nMonica: Ohhhh!!

Huh? What do you think?\nChandler: Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.\nKathy: Not your type?! She's gorgeous!\nChandler: Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know?\nWhenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet\nstockings.\nKathy: Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have\na friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!\nChandler: Uhh, no-no thanks.\nKathy: Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.\nChandler: Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)\nJoey: (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?\nChandler: What?\nJoey: Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a\ndeal.\nChandler: Hey, look, what do you want from me?\nJoey: I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then\nthe least you can do is pretend.\nChandler: I am pretending.\nJoey: Well then, do it better!\nChandler: Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?\n(Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking\nabout her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm\nso fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every\nminute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her\nfirst!!\nJoey: Well, that's pretty good.

And\nget me my cough drops!\nRoss: Fine.\nRachel: Sorry.\nRoss: Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks\nin my relationship.\nRachel: Y'know...\n(She does Ross's little gesture.
