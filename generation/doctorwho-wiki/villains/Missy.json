  "content": "After the Master regenerated into their first female incarnation, she took on the name Missy, short for the Mistress, and embarked on a scheme to rekindle her friendship with the Doctor. She guided Clara Oswald into becoming his eleventh incarnation's traveling companion in his TARDIS, and tried to convince him they were the same by offering him the power to end tyranny with an army of Weapons-grade Cybermen in his twelfth incarnation. However, the Doctor refused to submit to the temptation, and Missy went on to cause more chaos.\n\nEventually, Missy would be captured and imprisoned within a Quantum Fold Chamber that was moved into a vault at St Luke's University by the Doctor and Nardole, with the Doctor taking this opportunity to try and rehabilitate Missy and rekindle their friendship on his terms. She aided him in liberating Earth from the Monks, and even briefly became his companion in the TARDIS.\n\nJust as she was about to make a breakthrough, however, Missy met up and joined with her previous incarnation on the colony ship where the Cybermen were created. She then betrayed and mortally wound her younger self to join the Doctor in protecting the colonists, only for him to kill her himself before she could. Dying redeemed but without reward or witness, Missy managed to regenerate by artificial means into the Lumiat.\n\nDuring the Time War, the Union tested their degeneration weapon on the Master, (AUDIO: The Union) causing them to shift between their bodies. In an attempt to stabilise, they accidentally went too far forward in their life and became Missy even though they had yet to become this incarnation. Stable for a time, Missy occupied herself trying to recreate The War of the Worlds on Planetoid 50, creating a facsimile of Victorian London and populating it with kidnapped humans and the Paternoster Gang and with fake Martians to invade it. During this she kidnapped Jenny Flint and Vastra, hypnotising Jenny and keeping Vastra a prisoner. She lost control of the Martians however and was left stranded due to her TARDIS’ power being used up, so decided to exploit the arrival of the Doctor, in the midst of his own degeneration causing him to appear as the First Doctor. After using the same beam on him as herself, causing him to jump forward to the Tenth Doctor she sent Vastra to retrieve him. The Doctor modified her Tissue Compression Eliminator to shrink the fake Martians, after which she began to degenerate again. Leaving in her replenished TARDIS to degenerate alone, Missy gave the Doctor some hints about the weapon and told him to find the Union. (AUDIO: The Martian Invasion of Planetoid 50)\n\nFollowing the Year That Never Was, the Saxon Master was shot by Lucy Saxon and, despite the urging of the Tenth Doctor, refused to regenerate, choosing to die rather than live with the Doctor. The Doctor then cremated the Master's body on a pyre, (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) but was unaware that the Master had made arrangements for his resurrection by the Disciples of Saxon. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nAfter years trapped on a Mondasian colony ship that was experiencing time dilation due to pulling itself away from a black hole, the Saxon Master was fatally injured by a future incarnation of himself so that he could not interfere in the counterattack against the Cybermen, though he was able to kill the future incarnation before retreating to his TARDIS. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) After returning to his TARDIS, the Master regenerated into his nineteenth incarnation, (PROSE: Girl Power!) the same incarnation that had fatally wounded him. Due to the presence of his older self during the events surrounding his regeneration, she was left unable to recall the exact specifics of it due to their timelines being out of sync, (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) recalling only that she woke up in a female body, (AUDIO: The Bekdel Test) and also lost all knowledge of his time on the Mondasian colony ship, (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) save only that a \"very scary lady\" had advised to always carry a spare dematerialisation circuit. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nAs with her previous incarnations, the Master went to the Scoundrels Club to recover from the regeneration. After she was ousted from the Club by Harrison Mandeville for being a woman, she went on to systematically kill specific members for her revenge, and recruited an 18th century slave at the Mandeville sugar plantation named Saffron, who coined the name \"Missy\" for the Master's current incarnation.\n\nWhile Saffron infiltrated the Club through the kitchens, (PROSE: Dismemberment) Missy was brought to the Bekdel Institute, where she encountered River Song. After Missy taunted her, and killed a few of the other prisoners, River realised she could help her escape. To throw off the Director, she created two sets of solidograms, similar to him, one to be placed in the detention cells, while the other set to be caught in the sewers. It was around this time they figured out that the prisoners were in fact solidograms, generated by the main computer. While Missy and River meddled with the systems, they figured out that they were brought to the prison to check if the Eleventh Doctor was really dead after his assassination. They finally escaped after Missy tricked the computer into thinking that the inside was the outside and vice versa. Missy and River were transported to a planet, where Missy got back to her TARDIS. She told River that she knew something about her future, but that she couldn't tell. Missy also explained that she couldn't kill River because she was a complicated space-time event. Missy then teleported River back to Stormcage, just for the fun of it. (AUDIO: The Bekdel Test)\n\nWhile searching for a replacement power source for her TARDIS's Eye of Harmony, Missy was forced into working for the High Council by the General, with Yayani being assigned her \"companion\" in her mission to investigate time experiments at the Kyme Institute. At the Kyme Institute, Missy and Yayani found that Doctor Kalub was keeping a pregnant creature confined in a bubble of time energy, constantly shifting between life and death. Having paralysed Kalub with her sonic umbrella, Missy goaded Yayani into killing him, and then killed Yayani with the Tissue Compression Eliminator, sending her remains back to the General with a warning not to bother her again, as she had jettisoned her Eye of Harmony, replacing it with Kalub's creature. (PROSE: Lords and Masters)\n\nMissy was captured by the Wardens, who punished her for a crime she had yet to commit. Under the supervision of Mr Cosmo, she was exiled to 19th Century London and forbidden from harming anyone or using anachronistic technology. Following Cosmo's suggestion to get a job, Missy took a role as the governess of Oliver and Lucy Davis. Under the guise of field trips with the children, she investigated places of old power, awakening a Sphinx and stealing an ancient genie from the British Museum. Lucy became suspicious of her, but Oliver remained enthralled and helped Missy gain access to the opening of the Circle Line which their father had been working on. Missy used the circular shape and terror of the passengers on the out of control train, being accelerated by the genie, to charge up a ruby from the Sphinx with ancient power. She then turned on the children, attracting Cosmo's attention. The ruby interfered with his transmat, transporting him into the genie's vase. Stripped of his power, Cosmo was unable to stop Missy using her vortex manipulator to escape. (AUDIO: A Spoonful of Mayhem)\n\nPlotting to obtain control of the Master TARDIS, Missy sought the necessary components to reactivate it. (AUDIO: The Belly of the Beast) She travelled to 15th Century England to find a time traveller who was causing distortions by posing as Henry VIII, discovering they were actually the Monk, who had hidden from the Time War there and was now creating distortions in hopes of attracting the Time Lords' attention for rescue. Her plans were thrown into chaos by the arrival of the Gramoryans, who had been attracted by the Monk's meddling. She was forced to expose the Monk as an impostor to divert them, by revealing the real Henry. She and the Monk were sentenced to execution for treason, however she managed to hypnotise the executioner and they retreated back to the Monk's TARDIS. There Missy stole the component she needed and escaped by vortex manipulator, leaving the stranded Monk swearing vengeance against her. (AUDIO: Divorced, Beheaded, Regenerated) Missy then tracked down her Time War TARDIS, which had hidden from her in 2014 Manhattan. She accompanied Dick Zodiac in his investigation of deaths where the victims had seemingly aged to death. Dick found her TARDIS, which was traumatised from the War and now communicating by an avatar called Mark. Mark let her and Dick in, however a future version of Dick who had been relieving the events in simulations intervened and revealed her true identity to Mark, giving young Dick her vortex manipulator. Refusing to be her tool again, the TARDIS attempted to throw itself into a sun but Missy found the factory reset and regained control. (AUDIO: The Broken Clock) Locating the Master TARDIS in the belly of a dead space creature, Missy used processed clones as a slave army to excavate it. Growing bored, Missy and her own future self played a game where the future Missy attempted to cause a rebellion, to keep her occupied. When the TARDIS was found, Missy used a vortex manipulator to travel back in time to be the rebel leader whilst the older Missy claimed the TARDIS. She used the Monk's component to open its Eye of Harmony and threw her old TARDIS into it as fuel, activating the Master TARDIS. (AUDIO: The Belly of the Beast)\n\nFinding the Master TARDIS wasn't working properly, Missy embarked on a series of plots to attract the Doctor's attention, including kidnapping Bertram to be her companion. Instead she attracted the attention of the Lumiat, who she initially mistook for the Doctor. Eventually the Lumiat revealed her true identity as Missy's next incarnation, a distillation of goodness created by an Elysian field. Missy and the Lumiat went on a series of adventures together, during which Missy killed Bertram out of boredom. After Missy threatened to destroy a rare egg that was causing a truce in a civil war, the Lumiat snapped and threatened to kill her with her TCE. She missed and Missy shot her whilst throwing her the egg, smashing it and mortally wounding the Lumiat. Having grown bored of her, Missy dumped the Lumiat on a random planet mid-regeneration. (AUDIO: The Lumiat)\n\nStill wanting the Doctor's attention, Missy went to Earth and took over a boarding school in Scotland. Oliver Davis arrived at the school and managed to send word to his sister, who arrived with Strax. Fending off their interference, Missy decided to have the boys dig up an ancient mound in search of ancient power. However she was foiled by the arrival of Cosmo, who had been freed by Strax's comrades on the Davis' instruction. Missy escaped by vortex manipulator, (AUDIO: Brimstone and Terror) to 1605, however it was drained of power. Missy decided to meddle in the Gunpowder Plot to attract the attention of a time traveller and came into conflict with a rookie Time Agent. However Missy's meddling was undone and she was captured by the culprit - the Monk. (AUDIO: Treason and Plot) Before the Monk could exact his revenge, they were captured by the Ogrons who were seeking payment from the Master, and assumed the Monk was him. Missy eventually helped the Monk escaped, however revealed she'd programmed his TARDIS to only operate with both of them aboard. As he despaired, she proclaimed this to be the beginning of a \"horrible friendship\". (AUDIO: Too Many Masters)\n\nAfter reaching the conclusion that she could fly the Monk's TARDIS with only the Monk's brain, she removed it from his body. Missy and the Monk ended up in a war between the VAD and the Kalvor. Knowing it would end up in VAD hands, Missy threw the Monk's brain off a cliff as part of her scheme. The Prime VAD and his army located the Monk's TARDIS and inhabited his body. Missy used this as the perfect opportunity to use regeneration energy to destroy all VAD from the body and win the war for the Kalvor. Missy was surprised when the Kalvor treated her as a hero, causing her to momentarily question herself. Missy, seemingly in a kind mood, then returned the Monk's body to him. (AUDIO: Body and Soulless)\n\nApparently bent on proving the Monk she could be nice, Missy travelled to Earth, where a millionaire, Richard Morris Temple, was selling regeneration energy to mankind dispersed in different products. This was due to him exploiting a War Seed, a being created by the War Master during the Time War to turn the people of entire planets into a warrior race, the Cheetel, faithful to the Time Lords. Missy then lured Temple to the planet of the Cheetel promising to give him a personal army, and then left him there to die. The War Seed asked to be decomissioned, but Missy refused and left him on an unknown planet, revealing to the Monk that she actually wanted to retrieve her creation. (AUDIO: War Seed)\n\nMissy was contacted by the Nun, a future female incarnation of the Monk, to 16th century Italy, to strike a deal: she would give her the coordinates of her Master TARDIS, in exchange for the deliverance of his past self. The two couples met at the villa of Alfredo Borgia in Tuscany, where the Nun repeatedly try and eventually succeeded to inform his past self of who she was. Together, the two Monks were eventually able to escape together in the Nun's TARDIS, but the Monk still unwillingly gave Missy the coordinates of the Master TARDIS. (AUDIO: Two Monks, One Mistress)\n\nMissy decided to manoeuvre Clara Oswald into becoming the Doctor's companion, believing that Clara was just the right companion to attract the Doctor's interest and make it easier for Missy to emotionally manipulate him, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) showing him \"the friend inside the enemy, [and] the enemy inside the friend.\" (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Ashildr believed that Missy placed the two together so that that the Doctor and Clara in tandem would become the Hybrid of Gallifreyan myth. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) In 2013, Missy gave Clara the Doctor's phone number, claiming that it was a tech support line, leading Clara to meet the Eleventh Doctor. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She then kept the Doctor and Clara together into the Doctor's twelfth incarnation by placing an ad in a newspaper for Mancini's Family Restaurant. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nAfter killing Clara's boyfriend, Danny Pink, by running him over with a milk float, Missy returned to the Scoundrels Club to finalise her revenge by having Saffron poison the last remaining members with a temporary paralysing agent. After stranding the majority of the members in the past to act as slave labour, Missy taunted Mandeville a final time by permanently paralysing him and propping him up as furniture, while she made plans for Dr Skarosa. (PROSE: Dismemberment)\n\nTo create a new army of the Cybermen, (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) whom she called her \"Cyberdears\", (PROSE: Meet Missy!) Missy founded the 3W Institute, in order to create a Cyberman army of the dead. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Needing to collect matrix slices that she had acquired in her previous incarnation, Missy travelled to London to meet her former wife, Lucy Saxon, who had been sent to sell three matrix data slices to another incarnation of the Master. Missy spoke to Lucy about her husband and told her that one day she would have to kill him with a gun. Lucy listened to her story about what would happen to her, and how it would all work out, though she did not tell Lucy that these events would also result in her death. Lucy agreed to the terms and gave Missy the three matrix slices. (PROSE: The Unwanted Gift of Prophecy) Missy used the matrix data slices to create the Nethersphere, where she uploaded dying minds to. This reality changed and rewrote the minds, removing their emotions before re-downloading them into their Cyber-converted bodies. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nMissy went along the Doctor's timeline and greeted people who died in connection with him, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) such as the Half-Face Man (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and Gretchen Carlisle. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Finding this made her \"a bit busy\", (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Missy began to secretly monitor the Twelfth Doctor and Clara, (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) as she did when Earth was saved from a solar flare by a forest that grew overnight. (TV: In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nMissy finally met the Twelfth Doctor and Clara at one of 3W's mausoleums, which was hidden inside St Paul's Cathedral (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) with dimensional engineering. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Initially posing as an android, Missy revealed her true identity to him as the Cybermen marched out onto the streets of London. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Missy was quickly captured by UNIT, having anonymously tipped them off on the Cybermen's presence. She watched as Cybermen flew into the sky and exploded above major population centres, creating clouds that rained Cyber-pollen, turning the dead into Cybermen. Taken onto Boat One along with the Doctor, she sent out a signal to the Cybermen, to attack the plane before freeing herself, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and disintegrating the Zygon Osgood. (AUDIO: Narcissus) Missy then ordered the Cybermen to remove a piece of the fuselage, causing Kate Stewart and the Doctor to be sucked out before ordering the Cybermen to destroy the plane, and teleporting away. In the Nethersphere, Missy and Seb watched the Doctor free falling and saving himself by using his key to summon the TARDIS. When Seb got overexcited at this dramatic turn of events, Missy casually disintegrated him.\n\nAfter the Doctor found out from the Cyber-converted Danny Pink that she planned to have the Cyber-pollen fall again so that humanity would be reborn as Cybermen, Missy then arrived to give the Doctor control of the Cybermen, wanting him to use them as his army, in the hopes of proving the similarities between them. However, after pondering the idea, the Doctor proclaimed himself to be simply an \"idiot with a box\" rather than a general or any sort of leader. He turned control over to Danny, who ordered the army into the sky to destroy themselves, dispersing the threatening rain clouds.\n\nAfter the threat of the Cybermen had ended, Missy gave the Doctor coordinates to the current location of Gallifrey, lying to the Doctor that the planet had returned to its original location and that she and the Doctor could travel there together. However, Clara, using Missy's own weapon, decided to kill her. The Doctor wouldn't let Clara kill Missy, and decided to kill his old friend himself to \"save [Clara's] soul\". Before he could fire the weapon, however, Missy was shot by the late Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, who had been resurrected by the Cyber-pollen, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) but Missy used the energy from the blaster to recharge her vortex manipulator and escape undetected. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nDespite the Celestial Intervention Agency protocols attempting to stop her, Missy was able to hack and corrupt her file in the TARDIS databanks, adding in mocking remarks and ending with a veiled promise to kill whoever viewed the video file. (WC: Who Is The Master?)\n\nEnslaving a reality changing bear by the name of Teddy Sparkles, Missy arranged for herself to become governess at Queen Square, and used the innocence of the children to manipulate them and Teddy Sparkles into wishing for a future where they became influential entrepreneurs. When the time was right, Missy tried to threaten the children, having grown up to be very well connected, into handing her the means to dominate the Earth, but Teddy Sparkles was able to reverse the timeline to stop Missy, though he had to sacrifice his life to completely to fix the timeline afterwards. However, he was able to change reality enough to have Missy known throughout the world of 1925 as the nicest governess of all time, forcing her to leave in humiliation. (PROSE: Teddy Sparkles Must Die!)\n\nMissy went to face the tests to gain the power of Iarbus, but the wizard refused because she was a woman and drained her life essence into her power source. Missy was able to resist destruction and keep her identity, and used the power to send mental messages to five of the most evil and cruel conquerors in the universe. She didn't mind-secure them, though, and because of that, Daphne Nollis, housekeeper to one of the five warlords summoned, was instead brought there in his place. Missy led the men through Iarbus' trials, which only Daphne and another man, Dib the Magnificent, survived. When Iarbus came to give the winner his prize, Missy used the power of the source to regain physical form and killed Iarbus and Dib by absorbing them into the power. As she was gloating for her victory, Daphne took advantage and grabbed the power for herself, snatching it from Missy's hands. Realising Daphne had become too powerful for her to defeat, Missy withdrew. (PROSE: Missy's Magical Mystery Mission)\n\nAfter she was given the Doctor's confession dial from Ohila, Missy tried to find the Doctor to get answers, but was unable to locate him. Needing assistance, Missy got the attention of both Clara and UNIT by freezing all the airborne planes on Earth in time. Managing to arrange a treaty with Clara, Missy helped UNIT deduce that the Doctor was hiding in 1138 Essex, and used her vortex manipulator to transfer herself and Clara to the location, where the Doctor was throwing a party.\n\nWhen Colony Sarff arrived to capture the Doctor, having been led there by following Missy and Clara, Clara volunteered herself and Missy as prisoners, and were taken to Skaro. While the Doctor was taken to Davros, Missy and Clara escaped their cell, but were soon captured by a Dalek. They were taken to the other Daleks and seemingly exterminated. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice) However, Missy and Clara had survived by using the Dalek blasts to recharge Missy's vortex manipulator and the one she gave Clara, and teleporting from the Dalek city, burning them out in the process.\n\nMissy and Clara entered the Dalek sewers, composed of rotting Daleks, with Missy using Clara to lure a Dalek there. She cut through its case using her dwarf star alloy brooch, enabling the rotting Daleks to kill it. She put Clara inside the case and pretended to be her prisoner, enabling her to re-enter the Dalek control room and propose an alliance with them. When the Daleks began to gain Time Lord regeneration energy, Missy used their incapacitation to find the Doctor. She used a Dalek gun to shoot Colony Sarff, saving the Doctor. She then watched as the Doctor toyed with Davros about the revived Daleks in the sewers and even tapped Davros' Dalek eye as they made their escape.\n\nWith the city being destroyed by the regenerated sewer Daleks, Missy tried to trick the Doctor into killing Clara inside the Dalek. However, the Doctor realised the deception and told Missy to run. Trying to escape, she was surrounded by Daleks when the city crumbled in on itself, but purported that she had \"a really clever idea\". (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Missy spent some time on Skaro, even adopting a Slyther, which she named \"Doctor,\" and writing a postcard to the Doctor, promising she would see him soon. (PROSE: Postcards from the Universe) One Gallifreyan believed that, after she escaped the Daleks on Skaro, Missy went back to Gallifrey and told Rassilon that the Doctor knew about the Hybrid. (PROSE: A Brief History of Time Lords)\n\nAfter eluding the Daleks, Missy was forced into the Time Vortex, where her TARDIS collided with a Gryphon time ship. Caught in a temporal embrace, the Gryphons attacked Missy's TARDIS, and Missy was forced to land in St Mark's Square in Venice. With her dematerialisation circuit damaged from the attack, Missy walked through the market to get her bearings, and had the circuit stolen by pickpockets Mario and Antonia. Pursuing Mario, Missy saw him being absorbed by a temporal shift with her circuit, and later found it in a museum.\n\nKnowing she would need to venture into the temporal shift to retrieve her circuit, Missy met with a local museum curator to find out where the circuit was located, and then travelled through the temporal shift to 14th century Venice with Antonia, where they found the Gryphons attacking. Separating from Antonia, Missy found Mario's deceased body and retrieved her dematerialisation circuit. Telling Antonia that Mario had been sent back, Missy and Antonia returned to modern Venice, where Missy reverted the damages of the temporal shift by flooding Venice. (PROSE: The Liar, the Glitch and the War Zone)\n\nHearing that the Doctor and Clara had been forced to enter Battle of the Bands Beyond the Stars, Missy came up with a new plan for universal domination. Travelling through her time stream, she recruited her decaying thirteenth incarnation, the Master in the stolen body of Tremas, the Master in the stolen body of Bruce and the \"Harold Saxon\" Master, and formed a band to compete on the show. The group planned to use the popularity of the program to hypnotise the audiences across the galaxy. According to Missy, the five spent \"decades\" preparing for the performance. (COMIC: The Five Masters)\n\nThe group went on before Clara and the Doctor due to a shift in the program's schedule, and the five revealed themselves to the pair. (COMIC: The Abominable Showmen) Missy expected the Doctor to attempt to stop the five of them, or to at least inquire on their plans, but the Doctor refused to intervene or question their scheme. After much prying, the Doctor correctly predicted the group's plan, but still refused to intervene as they started their song. As she prepared to hypnotise her audience, her previous incarnations began to fight with her over her device, as each wanted to control the universe without the others. During the fight, viewers began to turn off their sets and the group were soon all disqualified and were thus blown up, although neither Clara nor the Doctor believed that they had truly been killed. (COMIC: The Five Masters)\n\nMissy became a headteacher for the school Saxon Heights after she had done away with the previous one. She implemented new and strange rules, such as a school uniform that was almost identical to her own clothing, and getting rid of everyone's mobile communication devices, with her excuse being that they were used too often. However, the real reason was because that she wanted to summon a Dæmon by hooking up her newly acquired devices to a transmitter. The Osgoods found this out and had UNIT stop her, although Missy managed to escape. (PROSE: Yes, Missy)\n\nMissy goaded the Doctor into following her through various time periods while she stole valuable items. The Doctor was too late to stop her each time. Finally catching up with her in the Stone Age, the Doctor revealed to her that he had discovered her true plan: to leave Cybermats behind where she stole each item. Missy expressed her desire to further reveal her plan to him. The Doctor instead refused to listen and boarded the TARDIS in search of some lunch. (PROSE: Dr. Twelfth)\n\nAt some point, Missy had a child. She gleefully presented the baby to the Master, the Tremas Master and the Saxon Master, all of whom reacted with shock. (POEM: Winning)\n\nIn 1963, Missy filled in as Coal Hill School's supply room teacher. She added a ladder to the supply room which allowed the First Doctor and Shivani Bajwa to escape a pack of alien wolves. Shivani later described the incident to Missy and thanked her for the ladder. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Horror of Coal Hill)\n\nResponding to a distress call from her secret base, Missy found that the \"War\" Master had had his TARDIS stolen by Liv Chenka. Working with her \"War\" and their \"Deathworm\" incarnations in a plan to use the Crucible of Souls to counter the plot of the Ravenous, Missy kidnapped Helen Sinclair to translate the Prophecy of Artron in the future of Earth. After taunting Helen in Artron's tower, Missy took Artron back to the \"War\" Master, and broadcasted a message to the Eleven for him to return to the Crucible, planning to use Artron as a bargaining chip.\n\nWith the Eleven distracted by the Eighth Doctor, Missy helped to remove the regeneration ability from the citizens of the universe, and called in the fleet of Battle TARDISes in orbit around the Crucible to destroy it. Escaping in the \"War\" Master's TARDIS, Missy joined her past incarnations in shooting the Eleven and left her vortex manipulator with the Twelve. Although the Time Lords requested Artron's Matrix print to give them the ability to grant new regeneration cycles to Time Lords, the Masters first used it to restore a past version of themselves to life with a new regeneration cycle. (AUDIO: Day of the Master)\n\nBored whilst the Doctor was enjoying life on Darillium, Missy stole the Scottish crown jewels in 1909 and then toyed with a detective fired for failing to guard them, Habitas Frond, in the hopes of some excitement. After manipulating Frond into nearly killing his former superintendent, Missy killed the superintendent herself and then turned on Frond, having become bored of him due to how easily he'd given in to her. (PROSE: Missing Habitas Frond)\n\nAfter she was captured by an unnamed species on an unnamed planet, (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Missy was put on trial for her \"crimes against the universe throughout all [her] lives\". However, she talked her way out of being sentenced for the events of The Year That Never Was by pointing out the Tenth Doctor's undoing of those events, and for the murder of Petronella Osgood by pointing out that two Osgoods were still working for UNIT. She then pointed out she had already been punished for her actions at Devil's End, and cleared up confusion about her involvement in the Death Zone by reminding everyone that Borusa was the culprit on that occasion. She was, however, eventually sentenced to death for pushing a girl into a volcano on Riga-Priam. (PROSE: Missy on Trial)\n\nIn accordance with their Fatality Index, the Doctor was chosen to carry out Missy's sentence. However, he sabotaged the execution machine so that she was knocked unconscious instead of being killed. After swearing an oath to guard Missy's \"body\" for a thousand years, the Doctor scared the executioners away and had Nardole place her inside a Quantum Fold Chamber. (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) The Doctor and Nardole transported the vault to St Luke's University, where they continued to guard it for several decades. (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Missy would occasionally ask Nardole to order items for her, and the Doctor would have to approve her requests. (PROSE: Girl Power!)\n\nWhile inside the Vault, Missy began reading up on how women were treated by history, and decided to help inspire a select group of women to rise against their male oppressors with a Spacebook group chat. However, the Doctor, thinking Missy was plotting an elaborate escape by messing with history, infiltrated the chat with the username \"Circe\" and dismantled Missy's leadership of the women. Missy then swore off ever trying to help the human race, and instead began a new campaign for the rats of Earth. (PROSE: Girl Power!)\n\nIn 2017, (TV: Knock Knock [+]Mike Bartlett, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) after the Doctor began travelling with Bill Potts, (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Missy began banging on the doors of the vault, only for Nardole to assert that he would stand guard and prevent her escape. (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) When he later double-checked the locks, she started playing Für Elise on a piano the Doctor had given her. Once Nardole was dismissed by the Doctor, Missy started playing Pop Goes The Weasel when the Doctor told her about his adventure at 11 Cardinal Road. (TV: Knock Knock [+]Mike Bartlett, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nAfter he received an email from a simulation of himself warning of an upcoming invasion, the Doctor became tempted to release Missy from the vault. (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) When the Monks later occupied the Earth, the Doctor was kept prisoner for six months. After Bill helped him escape, he decided to consult Missy on how to defeat the Monks. Missy revealed she had dealt with them before, and that the only way to weaken their grip on power was to kill the psychic lynchpin being beamed to the whole planet. After the Monks had been driven off-world, the Doctor visited Missy in the vault again. This time, she claimed to be in deep regret of all the people she had killed throughout her lifetimes. The Doctor assured her she was making good progress on her redemption. (TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nNardole later released Missy from the vault so that she could help him return the TARDIS to 1881 Mars after it unexpectedly departed and Nardole couldn't get it to return. After the Doctor and Bill entered the TARDIS, the Doctor was shocked to see Missy at the controls and reminded her that it was against their agreement and that he would have to return Missy to the Vault. To the Doctor's surprise, Missy easily agreed to return, and even questioned if he was alright with obvious concern. (TV: Empress of Mars [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nDeciding Missy was worth trusting, the Doctor released her from the Vault to perform maintenance work on the TARDIS while he took Bill and Nardole to find the lost Roman legion. Missy finished the work, and then took to watching the Doctor until he returned some days later. Nardole was frustrated that the Doctor had freed her, but he brushed him off, preferring to see if Missy had learned anything. Missy later cried as the Doctor watched on, both wondering if it was possible for them to be friends again and whether Missy was finally becoming the person the Doctor had desired to make her. (TV: The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nTo test Missy's goodness, the Doctor recruited Bill and Nardole to be her \"companions\" and followed a distress call to a colony ship while the Doctor monitored Missy's progress from the TARDIS. However, Missy was ill-prepared to handle a frightened crewmember, Jorj, who subsequently shot Bill; she was carried off by passengers from Floor 1056. Missy accompanied the Doctor and Nardole in the lift to Floor 1056, (TV: 'World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) where a time portal appeared. A humanoid hand reached out of the portal, and a voice asked to \"grab on\", before it disappeared. (COMIC: The Road To...) After reaching Floor 1056, the Doctor left Missy in charge of gleaning information from the computers. She discovered that the colony ship originated from Mondas while being pestered by a man called \"Razor\", who, upon confrontation, revealed himself to be her past self, who Missy appeared to join forces with for the \"Genesis of the Cybermen\". (TV: 'World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nHowever, when the Cybermen turned on them, Missy knocked the Master down and claimed to have been playing him while still on the Doctor's side, but then admitted to being unsure of her allegiance. Just as Nardole arrived with a stolen shuttlecraft, the Doctor was attacked by one of the Cybermen. Missy entered the shuttle after the Master, as her younger self attempted to convince Nardole to leave without him. However, their shuttle was stopped by the Cyber-converted Bill, who still retained her humanity. Crashing through the floors, the shuttlecraft gave out at one of the solar farms on Floor 0507. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThat night, while the Doctor recovered from their escape, Missy accompanied the Master in venturing to Floor 0508 to revert the Doctor's edits to the Cybermen back on Floor 1056 and regain control of the Cybermen, though they were followed by Alit and a patient that Missy named \"Topknot\". However, after an encounter with a patrol of CyberNeomorphs, Missy prevented them from attacking Floor 0507 with a swarm of Cybermats, before rescuing her previous self with Alit and assisting the Master in destroying the Cyberman patrol; the two Masters then returned to Floor 0507 and abandoned their plans to control the Cybermen. On their journey back to the farmhouse, Missy, still conflicted over whether to side with the Doctor or her previous self, hypothesised that the only way to finish her internal conflict would be to kill the Master. (PROSE: Alit in Underland)\n\nAfter two weeks of searching, the Master and Missy found disguised lifts, but Missy accidentally summoned the Cybermen in her attempt to escape. Unable to return to the Doctor's TARDIS due to how quickly time was moving on the floor of the Cybermen, the Doctor insisted that they had to prepare for a confrontation.\n\nAs the Doctor prepared to fight, the Master explained to Missy how he had blown the dematerialisation circuit in his TARDIS, which was surrounded by Cybermen on the bottom floor. Missy, recalling an instance where a very scary woman had pushed him up against a wall and insisted that he always keep a spare dematerialisation circuit, pushed the Master against the wall and insisted that he always keep a spare dematerialisation circuit, revealing the spare dematerialisation circuit she kept on her person. Before departing, however, the pair asked what the Doctor's plan was, knowing that he wouldn't be able to save everyone on the ship. As the Doctor explained that he wanted to save these people simply because it was the right thing to do and then implored the Master to stand with him, something the Master rejected, but Missy, speaking with the Doctor in private, admitted that she too wanted to stand with the Doctor as an ally, but still left with the Master. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nAs they prepared to depart, Missy offered to hug the Master and, after stating her enjoyment for being him, she stabbed the Master in the back, mortally wounding him in order to force his regeneration into her, but made the wound precise so that he would have time to reach his TARDIS before the regeneration occurred. Missy then helped the Master into the lift, explaining that she planned to stand with the Doctor and that it was the inevitable end that they had been leading towards their entire lives. However, the Master, declaring that he would never stand with the Doctor, shot Missy in the back with his laser screwdriver at full blast, claiming that he was mortally wounding her beyond the point of regeneration. With both of them laughing, the Master declared that their perfect ending was always going to be \"shoot[ing] [them]selves in the back.\" As the Master departed for his TARDIS, Missy collapsed to the ground and died, (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) but managed to regenerate by creating an Elysian field to \"kick start a new regeneration cycle\". The process of cryogenetic extraction destroyed her body, but retained a copy of her consciousness before regeneration, creating a new incarnation. (AUDIO: The Lumiat)\n\nAfter the Spy Master was imprisoned in the Toymaker's golden tooth for losing a game with him, Missy's laughter could be heard among her other incarnations when someone with red nails picked up the tooth after the Fourteenth Doctor and Fifteenth Doctor defeated the Toymaker in their own game. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nIn an aborted timeline, Missy learnt that the Saxon Master had unleashed a sentient entropy wave on the universe from Kiameth, and travelled there just in time to save Jo Grant from being killed by five of her previous incarnations. She exposed the Saxon Master's plan to use the Attornium to take their lives to save himself and used the time scoop to scatter them along the timeline of Kiameth, to see if any of the Masters would find a chance of redemption by either stopping the wave or salvaging something from its aftermath.\n\nAfter loaning her space yacht to a Master from an unbound universe, Missy explored the ruins of Kiameth with Jo, until the entropy wave killed Jo and the Unbound Master conceded defeat and returned to his own universe. When only the Decayed Master, the Reborn Master and the War Master managing to do as she had hoped, Missy convinced them to use the Saxon Master's Attornium to stop the entropy wave by feeding on it, but the War Master, having realised the wave was their own future, discreetly poisoned himself, Missy and the other Masters, and then turned off the Attornium before he died, leaving Missy to be devoured by the wave. The resulting paradox erased the Saxon Master's arrival on Kiameth, bringing the universe back to normal. (AUDIO: Masterful)\n\nThough he had previously preferred a male form, (PROSE: The Novel of the Film) the Master was indifferent when he learnt he would regenerate into a woman, (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and, fully embracing her new gender, the Master changed her title to \"Mistress\", shortening it to \"Missy\". Considering herself to be \"old fashioned\", she insisted on being addressed as a Time Lady, (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) while nicknaming herself the \"Queen of Evil\". (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She also adopted a Scottish accent, claiming she would keep it after taking a liking to the Twelfth Doctor's accent, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) occasionally utilising other accents when she felt the need. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhile she claimed that she had the \"body of a weak and feeble woman\", she maintained that she still possessed \"the heart, and stomach, of a homicidal maniac\" (AUDIO: The Bekdel Test) with \"absolutely zero morals\", (PROSE: Dismemberment) openly described herself as \"bananas\", but took offence when Danny Pink called her a \"lunatic\". (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She also displayed tendencies of being a show-off, such as when vastly enlarging her face on a UNIT monitor in a comical manner to show UNIT that she could, (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and enjoyed having information that others did not, such as having knowledge of the Doctor's past that others could not argue with. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) She was also something of a thrill-seeker, sometimes putting herself in danger simply for \"fun\". (PROSE: Lords and Masters)\n\nThough she adopted a bubblier personality with a welcoming and sociable façade, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and more choreographic movements, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Missy was more open about her loneliness, and willing to show when she was afraid and remorseful, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and would abandon all sense of showmanship when her safety was at risk. (PROSE: Lords and Masters) Jo Grant believed that Missy used her \"evil\" persona to hide how lonely she was. (AUDIO: Masterful)\n\nIn her own words, Missy was \"especially spiteful\", and proved her word when she began murdering some of the Scoundrels Club's members and enslaving the others after they refused to allow her to remain a member due to her change in gender. (PROSE: Dismemberment) Though she would admit that some retribution for her actions was justified, Missy still viewed the extremes of such action to be unfair towards her. (PROSE: Lords and Masters) She identified herself as a Slytherin, claiming to \"see a lot of Severus Snape in [herself]\". (PROSE: The Liar, the Glitch and the War Zone)\n\nBelieving that the Doctor's saving of Gallifrey was meant to rescue only her, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Missy's affection for the Doctor became more conspicuous, telling the Half-Face Man that, while the Doctor could be mean to others, he would not be with her because he \"loved [her] so much\". She openly referred to him as her \"boyfriend\", (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) tracked his movements across time and space, (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and mockingly professed that her hearts \"belonged to [the Doctor]\" after passionately kissing him. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Despite these implications of their relationship being romantic, Missy adamantly denied that she loved the Doctor, even showing disgust at the thought, insisting it to be a complicated friendship, though expressed jealous irritation when the Doctor called Davros his \"arch-enemy\", (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and would become upset and querulous when he did not show interest in her plans. (COMIC: The Five Masters; PROSE: Dr. Twelfth)\n\nViewing everything as being born to die, Missy held no regrets when it came to murder, describing her urge to kill as akin to a child wanting to pop a balloon, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and having a preference for killing \"clever-clogs\" because they \"[made] the best faces\". (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) When instructed not to kill, Missy would grow uninterested in the task given, (PROSE: Lords and Masters) and once killed a bird for no reason other than she was feeling annoyed. (PROSE: Teddy Sparkles Must Die!) When building up to a murder, Missy would insist that her victim \"say something nice\" to her, and would wait patiently for them to reply. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She also insisted that anyone aiming to kill her do the same with her, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and would take offence if a threat to kill her was not carried out. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nMissy retained her predecessors' sadistic tendencies, demonstrating cruel pleasure at taunting her victims before she killed them, such as telling Dr Chang she would miss him and promising to always keep a picture of him \"looking so sweet\" before she murdered him. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She also encouraged Osgood to have more self-confidence, while counting down to her death to torment her. However, she atomised Seb without a second glance for no reason other than that the AI was annoying her. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Missy also held no respect for the dead, using dead human bodies to create a Cyberman army, (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) as well as crushing Osgood's glasses under her heel while posthumously thanking her for being \"yummy\". (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nMissy could be needlessly cruel in her interactions with others, such as taunting Clara Oswald about her dead boyfriend, (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and pushing Clara down a hole to test its depth. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She let Jo hang off a cliff for sometime before rescuing her and later let her be caught by the entropy wave. (AUDIO: Masterful) She also ordered the death of Belgians for no reason, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) vaporised UNIT personnel to prove she had \"not gone good,\" (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and was believed by Ashildr to have united Clara and the Doctor together just to see what chaos would result from their clashing personalities. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She would sometimes act childish or ignorant so that others around her would drop their guard. (PROSE: Dismemberment) However, when Missy learnt that the Doctor had departed Darillium to leave River Song to her fate, she offered her sincere condolences for his loss. (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nMissy liked apricot jam, (PROSE: Dismemberment) but disliked birds and children. (PROSE: Teddy Sparkles Must Die!)\n\nMissy was looked down on by her previous incarnations, with the Young Master singling out her \"madness\" as a reason not to regenerate into her. (AUDIO: Masterful)\n\nDuring her imprisonment in the vault, Missy went \"cold turkey\" on being evil as the Doctor tried to rehabilitate her, which first worked to the extent that Missy offered information on how to defeat the Monks because she did want to change and save the Earth, though her immediate solution involved burning out Bill Potts' brain as it was the only way she knew of to stop the Monks, effectively sacrificing one to save the many. After he repelled the invasion without resorting to killing Bill, the Doctor found that Missy had secretly grown remorseful for all her past murders. (TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Nardole later trusted her to retrieve the Doctor and Bill from Mars, (TV: Empress of Mars) which in turn resulted in the Doctor trusting Missy enough to do \"maintenance\" on his TARDIS. (TV: The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThough she continued to show progress with her rehabilitation and made an effort to do good on the Mondasian colony ship, when she was approached by her past incarnation, she relapsed back to being evil by allying with him, (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) but continued to be conflicted with her allegiance, admitting to the Doctor that she was \"in two minds\" about what she wanted. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) After a brief adventure with the Master and Alit, Missy kept her past self from regaining control of the Cybermen and speculated that she would have to kill him to end the danger. (PROSE: Alit in Underland) After being moved by the Doctor's speech on kindness and request for her help, Missy stabbed her past incarnation so that he would regenerate into her and she could stand with the Doctor, only for the Master to shoot her beyond regeneration, leading to her death, though she shared the amusement in her \"perfect ending\" being shot in the back by her past incarnation. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) When she used an Elysian field to regenerate her body, Missy chose to regenerate into a distillation of all her goodness, having grown \"tired of being evil\". (AUDIO: The Lumiat)\n\nMissy enjoyed singing and quoting songs, substituting her name in the song \"Mickey\" while in UNIT custody, and singing part of \"Happy Birthday, Mr President\" when giving the Doctor control of a Cyberman army. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She later texted \"Mickey\" lyrics to UNIT to announce her presence after halting all aeroplane traffic. After being imprisoned by Colony Sarff, she passed the time by partaking in singing opera. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She quoted \"My Boy Lollipop\" after threatening to spear someone, (AUDIO: The Lumiat) and misquoted \"You're so Vain\" when trying to shoot Helen Sinclair. (AUDIO: Day of the Master) Missy was also good at playing the piano, and passed her time in the vault playing Für Elise, Pop Goes The Weasel, (TV: Knock Knock [+]Mike Bartlett, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and The Entertainer. (TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nShe would regularly threaten to bring pain to individuals by threatening their internal organs, (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).; PROSE: Dismemberment, Lords and Masters, Girl Power!; COMIC: The Road To...) even once considering eating Clara Oswald if she had to, (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and enjoying the idea of decorating a Christmas tree with intestines. (PROSE: Missy's Magical Mystery Mission) She occasionally fantasised about breaking the necks of those who annoyed her. (PROSE: The Liar, the Glitch and the War Zone)\n\nMissy was a devious planner and skilled manipulator, able to manoeuvre others into place with ease by exploiting their desires. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) While trapped on Skaro with Clara Oswald, Missy demonstrated fluid planning as her desires changed from wanting to ally with the Daleks, (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) to wanting to help the Doctor, to then wanting the Doctor to unintentionally kill Clara, (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and she was capable of long-term planning, as she worked out a long plan to gain entry into the Monk's TARDIS and steal a component after her Vortex Manipulator was damaged and she discovered the Monk was disguised as Henry VIII. (AUDIO: Divorced, Beheaded, Regenerated) After her past self unleashed an entropy wave on the universe, Missy manipulated her own past incarnations in an attempt to have them stop it or otherwise salvage something from the catastrophe, with three incarnations attempting to do as she had intended. (AUDIO: Masterful) She was also a convincing liar, especially when using her talent for manipulative reasons. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) However, Missy would often opt for one solitary scheme with virtually no contingencies or back-up plans in place to help steer events back towards her favour like her previous incarnations employed, instead opting to give the Doctor false hope of reaching Gallifrey after she was beaten, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and walking away with nothing but taunts to say when the Doctor didn't kill Clara. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nSharing the Doctor's observational skills, Missy could tell a man she had killed was a married father by the ring on his finger and the detection of \"baby leakage\" on his jacket, (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and pick up on people's personalities by the infliction of their voice. (PROSE: Lords and Masters)\n\nIn her nineteenth incarnation, (PROSE: Girl Power!) Missy looked like a mature woman with pronounced cheek bones, and light blue eyes. Her black hair was wild and free, but held in place in an up-do. She also adopted a Scottish accent similar to the Twelfth Doctor's. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nFashioning herself in Victorian-styled garb, Missy wore a wingtip collar blouse (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) with a cameo brooch made of Dark star alloy under her throat, (TV: the Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) along with a high-waisted skirt that cut to ankle length, and a croak lengthen jacket which puffed up at the shoulders and dark lapels, with a blouse in ivory (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) or olive green. (TV: the Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) She also wore black ankle boots with a sharp toe and tapered heels. Completing the ensemble was a black boater cap worn at a rakish angle, with an arrangement of black and crimson berries on the brim and a black veil over the top, held at the back with an Onyx black hatpin (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) which was a TCE with four petals over a glowing sphere design. (PROSE: Lords and Masters) For further accessories, Missy wore a spiked bracelet on her left wrist, carried around a black sonic umbrella, and wore a bar ring on her right middle finger, and a 3 coils ring on her left middle finger. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She later adopted a vortex manipulator on her left wrist instead of her spiked bracelet and replaced her rings with a black signet ring on her left middle finger and a silver one on her right one. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nMissy varied the colours of her clothes, with her usual outfit coming in ebony black, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) bottle green, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) burnt orange, (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) plum purple, (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Prussian blue, (COMIC: The Master Plan) or violet purple. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nBefore she was imprisoned in the Vault, Missy's up-do hair had grown in length, she had began wearing leather clothes, and she had replaced her brooch with a rust orange cravat tie. (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) After spending a number of years in the Vault, her hair grew out into a messier style. (TV: the Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nWhile pretending to be the Doctor, Missy wore an amber jabot with turquoise blue stripes. She also wore opposing gloves, with a turquoise one on her right hand and an amber one on her left. (COMIC: The Master Plan)\n\nSaffron believed Missy had a \"cruel look to her\", (PROSE: Dismemberment) while Missy thought herself as being attractive, openly admitting to admiring her reflection on occasion. (AUDIO: Day of the Master) The Thirteenth Doctor compared Missy's look to Mary Poppins. (PROSE: The Doctor vs the Master)\n\nPrior to her and Team TARDIS' encounter with the Spy Master, (TV: Spyfall) the Thirteenth Doctor became aware that the Gem of Niag was stolen by a Time Lord who she assumed to be Missy, but turned out to be the Sixth Corsair. Openly speaking of her to her companions, the Doctor noted that Missy was the name she had most recently gone by and glumly cited that she was doing \"so much better\" the last time she saw her. (COMIC: Old Friends)\n\nWhile the Thirteenth Doctor was mentally communicating with the Spy Master, she mentioned Missy and her attempt to turn good. The Master dismissed his time as her as a mistake which he refused to repeat. (PROSE: The Doctor vs the Master) After being trapped in the Matrix by the Master, the Doctor remembered, amongst many others, Missy in order to break out of the computer system.
