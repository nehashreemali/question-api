  "content": "Davros had a brilliant scientific mind and was constantly devising ways to give the Daleks greatness, overlooking the fact they saw him as beneath them. After one betrayal too many by his \"children\", Davros sought to create a race of Daleks loyal to him, which led to the Imperial-Renegade Dalek Civil War, where he served as Emperor Dalek of the Imperial Daleks. However, his relationship with the Daleks remained a tense one, with Davros always being hunted, maligned, or otherwise denigrated by at least portion of the Daleks. Eventually, he abandoned all thoughts of ruling the Daleks, admitting to the Twelfth Doctor that he could never really control them, content to ally with them at the least.\n\nThrough his creations, many came to consider Davros responsible for trillions of deaths and innumerable wars across the universe. Despite the fact that he was not unquestionably the ruler of the Daleks, he was one of the Doctor's greatest enemies, rivalling the Master in both intellect and madness. However, Davros considered the Doctor the closest thing that he had to a familiar, even as they served as foes.\n\nPrior to the 2nd century, (PROSE: Dalek Combat Training Manual [+]Richard Atkinson and Mike Tucker, BBC Books (2021).) Davros was born as the result of an adulterous relationship between Lady Calcula and Councillor Quested. He had an elder half-sister named Yarvell. His birth occurred in the latter part of the Thousand Year War between the Kaleds and the Thals on the planet Skaro, when it was considered a time where mercy and nobility were all but non-existent on Skaro and life was harsh and grim. The use of nuclear weapons and other agents of mutation produced Mutos, who resided in the Wastelands and were often used for slave labour by both the Kaleds and the Thals.\n\nAs a child, Davros claimed that only his mother believed in him. Others feared him and his determination. His stepfather, Colonel Nasgard, whom both believed to be his biological father, wanted him to become a soldier like his ancestors, but Davros was determined to become a scientist. (AUDIO: Innocence [+]Gary Hopkins, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nDuring his childhood, Davros watched the propaganda television series Captain Croag and the Highland Rangers, as did Yarvell. (AUDIO: Guilt [+]Scott Alan Woodard, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) He privately questioned the point of such propaganda given that they spoke of a pre-War Skaro that no one knew. (PROSE: Father of the Daleks [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) Davros often read the Book of Predictions, which was written in the extinct language of the Dals. Although the book was banned by the Council of Twelve, he kept it in his possession for decades. (AUDIO: Innocence [+]Gary Hopkins, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006)., Guilt [+]Scott Alan Woodard, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nActing on a dare from Yarvell, (PROSE: The Last of the Dals [+]Temi Oh, Origin Stories (BBC Books, 2022).) Davros ran onto a battlefield and got lost. A soldier named Kanzo tried to help when he wandered across ground covered in Handmines, but was sucked into the ground by one of them. The Twelfth Doctor heard Davros' cries for help and threw him his sonic screwdriver, which allowed them to hear each other over the Handmines. Although the Doctor had intended to help the child, when he learned that it was Davros, he returned to the TARDIS and departed. Shortly afterwards, Davros heard the rematerialisation of the Doctor's TARDIS, and, confused and frightened, witnessed the Doctor point a gunstick towards him, saying that he was trying to save his friend \"the only way\" he could. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) The Doctor then shot the Handmines surrounding Davros, allowing them to reach each other. When Davros asked if he was \"the enemy\", the Doctor told the boy that friends and enemies were irrelevant \"so long as there [was] mercy\" and then took his hand to help him get home. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nIn Davros's teenage years, he was found by the Dal Elwyn, who had received a vision that Davros would end the Thousand Year War. The two set out to the Dal capital city for the elder to give Davros a vision of his future. After the visit, an argument broke out between the two, the distraction from their precarious ledge causing Elwyn to fall to his death while traversing a perilous mountain range. (PROSE: The Last of the Dals [+]Temi Oh, Origin Stories (BBC Books, 2022).)\n\nDavros joined the Military Youth shortly after Nasgard's death. In Nasgard's will, the family finances were held in trust under Davros's name and his wife and daughter were forbidden access to it until Davros was married. Calcula initially attempted to set Davros up with the daughter of Matros, another member of the Council of Twelve who belonged to one of the most influential and wealthy Kaled families, but eventually managed to have the terms of the will overturned due to her connections with senior members of the Kaled judiciary.\n\nDavros later joined the Military Corps in his final year of college. (AUDIO: Purity [+]James Parsons and Andrew Stirling-Brown, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) Davros made many friends, having formed comradeships through the struggle of war, only for him to lose all of those friends in the fighting. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nHaving been inspired to reach for greatness by the inexplicable shock his name had produced on the Doctor's face when he rescued him from the Handmines, Davros grew up to become \"a brilliant scientist\". (PROSE: Davros, Dark Lord of Skaro [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nDavros vehemently disagreed with the ideas of Yarvell, who had become a peace activist, of a compromise with the Thals. As he approached his thirtieth birthday, Davros regarded the only satisfactory outcome of the war as being the extermination of the Thals and the complete dominance of the Kaleds over all of Skaro. He was forced into the Military Corps and put in charge of developing new weapons and gadgets to help Kaled soldiers. After Calcula killed Quested, Yarvell and his aunt Tashek, Davros no longer had anyone to impress. Davros took Yarvell's body for his genetic research, but told the public that her ashes would be housed in a statue commissioned by him and Calcula to honour Yarvell's death. (AUDIO: Purity [+]James Parsons and Andrew Stirling-Brown, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nDavros's first assignment in the Scientific Corps was in food processing. Consequently, he learned that the pills were made from not only waste vegetable matter but also the bodies of the dead. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nOne month after Calcula's passing, (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003)., Corruption [+]Lance Parkin, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) the idea of what would one day be realised as the Dalek casing were already starting to form in Davros's imagination, (AUDIO: From the Flames [+]Nicholas Briggs, Anti-Genesis (The War Master, Big Finish Productions, 2019).) only for him to be grievously wounded by a Thal bombardment of his laboratory in the Kaled Dome, (AUDIO: Corruption [+]Lance Parkin, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) which cost him his taste buds, left arm and entire lower body and left his eyes with severe damage to the point where using them would cause great pain. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003)., Corruption [+]Lance Parkin, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) Although the reinforced walls of the lab prevented the bombardment from killing him, (AUDIO: From the Flames [+]Nicholas Briggs, Anti-Genesis (The War Master, Big Finish Productions, 2019).) he was forced to spend the rest of his life confined to a mobile life support system attached to a wheelchair, with an eyestalk-bulb in his forehead that gave him partial eyesight without the use of his own eyes. Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) In his life-support system, Davros was identified as a mutant. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).)\n\nAfter he was crippled, the Scientific Corps gave Davros a projectile poison injector to allow him to kill himself should he decide the pain was too much for him, but refused to use it. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) However, thirty seconds without his life support would kill him, with the controls to the life support system being controlled by a switch on the panel of buttons on his system. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) His chair acted as an iron lung and pacemaker, and it monitored and maintained his body. (AUDIO: Davros) Davros did not require nourishment due to his life support system, although he did occasionally eat. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003)., Guilt [+]Scott Alan Woodard, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nAccording to one account, Davros's crippling had led to him being shunned and given small-scale scientific projects by the Kaled leadership. With half his body crippled, Davros began working on implanting organic brains into mechanical shells to serve as semi-autonomous attack drones, being assisted by Gharman. Witnessing the fear that his first malfunctioning prototype had instilled within General Ravon and Security Chief Nyder, Davros divested a significant amount of his delegated resources into his own life support, choosing to command respect through fear. When his first successful prototype instilled greater fear, Davros used it to acquire further political power. (PROSE: Davros Genesis [+]Terrance Dicks, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe, 2017).)\n\nMany other accounts, however, claimed that Davros became the de facto Kaled head of state after he assassinated the Supremo and the other members of the Council of Twelve, as their deaths left him as the most senior surviving civilian in the Kaled Dome. Davros began experimenting with organisms and teaching them to speak. In particular, he taught them to say his name. For his first experiment, he used the brain of a Thal spy named Baran. (AUDIO: Guilt [+]Scott Alan Woodard, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nWith his equally ruthless aide, Nyder, Davros ascended to a high rank in the Kaled Scientific Elite and ultimately presided over the creation of the Daleks. Having foreseen that over time the Kaleds would mutate and degenerate into mutants who could not live on their own, Davros set about accelerating this evolution, (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) leading the Daleks to come into existence earlier than they would have in the normal course of historical events, (PROSE: War of the Daleks [+]John Peel, adapted from War of the Daleks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) having decided that victory over the Thals was meaningless unless the future of the Kaleds was preserved. (PROSE: Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe [+]George Mann, Justin Richards and Cavan Scott, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Ebury Publishing, 2017).) He also made alterations of his own to the Dalek genome, filtering out qualities Davros deemed \"weak\" to make his creations the ultimate warriors. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) However, one account claimed that destroying conscience in the Kaleds had been the original purpose of his experiments, and the fact that his test subjects degenerated into mutants who needed machines to even survive was an unintended side effect. (PROSE: Davros, Dark Lord of Skaro [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt any rate, since the mutant creatures could not survive on their own, Davros created mobile casings for them, also making sure that they were equipped with fearsome weapons, as Davros's true ambition was to create the ultimate warrior lifeform, able to dominate Skaro forever. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) In their later history, the Daleks would claim the travel machines Davros built were based on designs stolen from other scientists, (PROSE: War of the Daleks [+]John Peel, adapted from War of the Daleks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) with the Dalek War Machine having been developed by the inventor Yarvelling in the early days of the war against the Thals, (COMIC: Genesis of Evil [+]unclear authorship, The Daleks comics (City Magazines, 1965).) but another account held that the Mark I Travel Machine was based on Davros's own chair. (AUDIO: Guilt [+]Scott Alan Woodard, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nIn an account that showed Davros still in a healthy body, he dismissed many of his assistant Castavillian's suggestions for the name of Kaled evolution that were all just poor anagrams of \"Kaled\". When Davros was called away by Nyder, the Fourteenth Doctor crashed onto his base of operation and accidentally damaged the multi-adaptable claw attachment Davros had originally built for the travel machine. After accidentally retroactively inspiring Castavillian to coin the terms \"Dalek\", \"exterminating\" and \"genesis of the Daleks\", the Doctor realised when and where he was, and, muttering frantically about \"the timelines and the canon rupturing\", hastily replaced the damaged prototype's claw with a sink plunger, then left just before Davros returned. Although initially taken aback by the sink plunger arm installed into his creation, Davros decided he \"like[d] it\". (TV: Destination: Skaro [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2023).)\n\nIn the event his creations would be destroyed, Davros designed the artificial moon of Falkus to act as a seed-vault from which the Dalek race could be rebuilt, designing the computer core to hold a digital copy of his brain so he could guide his rebuilding creations. (AUDIO: A Genius for War [+]Jonathan Morris, Once and Future (Big Finish Productions, 2023).)\n\nAt the age of 34, (PROSE; Dalek Combat Training Manual [+]Richard Atkinson and Mike Tucker, BBC Books (2021).) Davros was finally ready to unveil his Mark III Travel Machine to the Scientific Elite. However, on the orders of by the Time Lords, the Fourth Doctor had been sent to Skaro to interfere with the creation of the Daleks to make them less dangerous or destroy them completely with his companions Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan. With the presence of the Doctor contradicting his claim that only Skaro could support life in the galaxy, (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) Davros was enlightened to the wider universe and changed his ambitions from conquering Skaro to mastering the universe. (PROSE: A Brief History of Time Lords [+]Steve Tribe, BBC Books (2017).)\n\nDavros imprisoned the Doctor and used a lie detector to force the Doctor to reveal the details of the Daleks' future defeats, so that he could learn from them and so his creations, the Daleks, could avoid them, though the Doctor later had the recording destroyed. Davros refused to listen to the Doctor when he begged him to make the Daleks peaceful creatures of good, rather than the evil exterminators they would become.\n\nUpon activation, the Daleks began to overthrow Davros, even exterminating Nyder when he tried to stop them. Davros soon became their next victim, ironically because of the programming that he himself had given them to exterminate all those who were not Daleks. Davros begged them to have pity on him and his loyal followers, but they stated that were incapable of doing so as he had not programmed them to feel pity, and the First Dalek shot Davros, apparently killing him. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) However, unbeknownst to anyone, the Dalek had actually only damaged Davros' primary life support system. The secondary and backup circuits switched on immediately, placing Davros in suspended animation while his life support worked to regenerate him. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).) As understood by human historians, the remaining Kaleds were utterly eradicated by the fledgling Daleks, with only Davros himself being known to have survived. (PROSE: Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe [+]George Mann, Justin Richards and Cavan Scott, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Ebury Publishing, 2017).)\n\nIn his suspended animation, Davros hoped that his creations had not forgotten him, and that he would be found once more and would rule the Daleks as he had originally planned. As Davros \"slept\", he sensed that something \"wrong\" had happened to Skaro's timeline when Ace misused the omega device in a failed attempt to time lock Skaro shortly after the Thal-Dalek battle, but the timeline was soon corrected by Ace, Bernice Summerfield, and the Seventh Doctor. (AUDIO: The Lights of Skaro [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter a lengthy time had passed, the Daleks, now a major galactic power, sought to revive Davros so that he could offer them a way out of the impasse in their war with the Movellans. Both sides were in a stalemate because they were androids, (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).) the Daleks having elected to became \"quasi-robotic\" beings to better understand their foes, (PROSE: Dalek Combat Training Manual [+]Richard Atkinson and Mike Tucker, BBC Books (2021).) that relied solely on logical moves, so Davros's organic mind would be able to think of ways to circumvent the situation. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).) As the Daleks approached Skaro, Davros began to awaken, feeling the return of his \"children\" and noting to himself that he would ensure he became their emperor. (WC: Risen [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAs the Daleks searched for their creator, Davros's suspended body was eventually found in the underground remains of the crumbled bunker by the Doctor just as he was revived. Upon uniting with the Daleks, Davros opted to help the Daleks in their war against the Movellans. He devised a plan to destroy a Movellan ship. After this failed, he was captured by the Doctor and the escaped Dalek slaves and imprisoned in a cryogenic freezer as \"a block of ice\". As anticipated by Tyssan, Davros was to stand trial for \"crimes against the whole of sentient creation\". (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).)\n\nAs Davros was being transported to Earth, the ship he was on took on the Tenth Doctor and Anya Kingdom as passengers. When a Dalek fleet began closing in, the Doctor thawed Davros, hoping to use him as a bargaining chip. When the Daleks called the bluff, the ship crashed on Kembel, where the group was brought before the First Movellan, whom the Doctor recognised as Mark Seven. (AUDIO: The Dalek Defence [+]Matt Fitton, Dalek Universe (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nSpared for his genius, Davros was put to work developing weapons to be used against the Daleks, managing to secure the Doctor as his assistant, mocking him that, through Mark and the Movellans, the Doctor had also created a warrior race. As Davros began data mining the Movellan network, he saw an opportunity to destroy the Movellans from within. After connecting himself to the Dalek pathweb, Davros proposed a Dalek/Movellan alliance to destroy the human race, inviting the nearby Supreme Dalek to officiate the alliance. When the First Movellan's guard was lowered, Davros offered a handshake, spreading a virus throughout the Movellan network. However, as he basked in his victory, the Doctor managed to isolate the Movellan flagship from the rest, limiting the spread of the virus as human forces descended onto Kembel. Davros fled with the Daleks, only to be abandoned in the jungles, where the Earth forces recovered him and returned him to cryogenic suspension. Though Davros was content that it had taken hundreds of humans to counter a handful of Daleks, his viral attack had inspired the Movellans to develop a virus that would target and end the Daleks. (AUDIO: The Triumph of Davros [+]Matt Fitton, Dalek Universe (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nThe humans decreed an indefinite sentence of suspended animation while Davros retained full consciousness. After ninety years, the Daleks, (TV: Resurrection of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) having returned to being mutants instead of robots, (PROSE: Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe [+]George Mann, Justin Richards and Cavan Scott, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Ebury Publishing, 2017).) liberated Davros from his prison station in space, and revived him again. They believed he might help them to find a cure for the virus with which the Movellans defeated them with, as it was a virus that attacked only Dalek tissue. Pretending to research the cure, Davros experimented on Daleks to bring them under his control. The Fifth Doctor attempted to execute Davros to stop his plans, though he ultimately lacked the resolve to do so. When his treachery was discovered by the Dalek Supreme, Davros released the Movellan virus onto the prison ship, killing all the Daleks on board. However, the virus began affecting Davros too, and he tried to flee to an escape pod before Stien caused the station and the prison ship to explode. (TV: Resurrection of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) Whilst the Celestial Intervention Agency believed he had perished in the blast, (PROSE: The Dalek Problem [+]The Doctor Who Role Playing Game supplements (FASA, 1986).) Davros had in fact managed to survive, though without hope of rescue, sent drifting through space in a condition that made it seem like he was dead. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nDavros was somehow picked up by a different space station and imprisoned in a vault. Arnold Baynes and his wife, Lorraine, extracted him and helped in his restoration. At this very same moment, the Sixth Doctor arrived after being called in by some friends. He demanded Davros be immediately placed in suspended animation, but as Davros was fully conscious he goaded the Doctor into doing the job himself. The Doctor couldn't. Feeling Davros deserved a chance for redemption, Baynes offered him a job at his company, TAI. The Doctor also offered a working relationship with Davros. Davros gained a foothold and claimed to be working on a way to combat famine. He held great interest in the stock market and planned on closing it down by broadcasting a pattern he discovered, the results completely disrupting the galaxy and enabling Davros to gain a military foothold. However, Davros began to be haunted by his past, particularly the time before his accident when he had betrayed a female Kaled scientist named Shan whom he perhaps had loved. The Doctor halted his plan, but Davros escaped in a ship. The Doctor took control of the ship from the TAI control room and made it crash while Davros screamed Shan's name. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nWorking with the Daleks again, Davros genetically tested a group of humans to modify their brains and remove their emotions of compassion, love and pity, converting them into drones, which he also saw as his children. As the Daleks continued their 23rd century bombardment of the Earth colony of Phobos, Drone 77 and Drone 69, formerly a human male and female respectively, were questioned by Davros. When they behaved in a fashion indicating disgust for him, both moving away when he went to touch them, and demonstrated fear by seeking comfort in each other's arms, Davros ordered their extermination. As he left, he wondered if the same behaviour that he so despised also existed in the Daleks. (PROSE: An Incident Concerning the Continual Bombardment of the Phobos Colony [+]Paul Cornell, Brief Encounter (1990).)\n\nFinding his way to the planet Necros, Davros set himself up as \"the Great Healer\" by using the dead bodies of those who he deemed to be not intelligent enough for his plans converted into concentrated protein, becoming food for settlers in the rapidly expanding sector to combat famine, to mask how he was using the rich and powerful stored at Tranquil Repose to create a new race of Daleks with white and gold livery that were totally loyal to him. Kara hired Orcini, a knight of the Grand Order of Oberon, to assassinate Davros, but Davros subdued him. Davros then brought the Doctor to him, gleefully informing him that, while his allies, Natasha Stengos and Grigory, had destroyed the lab, they had been killed, and his main force of Daleks was elsewhere. As he was distracted by the Doctor's fury, Davros's hand was destroyed by Orcini's squire, Bostock. The Supreme Dalek's forces arrived on Necros after being called in by Takis, another Tranquil Repose worker, and captured Davros to put him on trial, with his army being destroyed by Orcini. (TV: Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).)\n\nEn route to Skaro, the ship carrying Davros crashed on the planet Lethe. Since the authorities on Earth had now branded him a fugitive and put a price on his head, Davros set himself up as \"Professor Vaso\", altering the perceptions of the humans on the colony so they would not recognise him as the \"Great Healer\". He attempted to create a new machine based on a Mechanoid design that he named a Juggernaut. Under his Vaso guise, he also \"befriended\" Melanie Bush, whom he saw as a skilled programmer. Lethe's atmosphere prevented the Supreme Dalek retrieving Davros directly, but its forces intercepted the Doctor's TARDIS, forcing him to serve as an agent of the Daleks and stop Davros's researches and manipulations. The Doctor discovered two of Davros's Necros Daleks had survived the crash, but were destroyed following Davros's final gambit on the colony and the Supreme Dalek's intervention. Davros himself was left badly injured by Mel after she reprogrammed several Juggernauts into attacking him, and his self-destruct system in his chair was activated, leading to the destruction of the colony. (AUDIO: The Juggernauts [+]Scott Alan Woodard, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).)\n\nDavros was time-scooped by the Tremas Master and forced to participate in deadly reality TV shows run by LudoSphere Incorporated as part of a revenge scheme against the Doctor. Davros decided to join forces with the Doctor, Peri Brown and Melanie Bush, who had been similarly abducted, but upon escaping, Davros was able to summon his Daleks and attempted to hijack the LudoSphere's broadcast system to turn its viewers into Robomen.  A battle then ensured between the Imperial Daleks and the Cybermen, which halted when Davros and the Cyber-Leader formed an alliance to eliminate both the Doctor and the Master. Ultimately, both Davros' forces and the Cyber-Leader's were defeated, and the Doctor and his companions, as well as the Master, escaped. (AUDIO: The Trials of a Time Lord)\n\nOnce again en route to Skaro, Davros encountered the Thal Lareen, who was using a stealth suit that made her invisible to Dalek scanners. Lareen attempted to find Davros's \"good side,\" and believed she had succeeded. She gave Davros a capsule containing an enhanced version of the Movellan virus and asked him to release it during his trial. This would destroy all Daleks on Skaro, and make Davros a hero. Upon arriving on Skaro, Davros found that the Supreme Dalek had a new casing created. The Supreme Dalek planned to be moved to the new casing and named Emperor of the Daleks after Davros's execution. During his trial, Davros told the Daleks of the Movellan virus, and proved his loyalty to the Dalek cause by refusing to release it. He then told them that Lareen was on Skaro and ordered them to exterminate her. The Daleks were impressed with this show of loyalty, and named Davros Emperor of the Daleks. (AUDIO: The Davros Mission [+]Nicholas Briggs, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2007).)\n\nDavros was put on trial by the ruling Dalek Emperor (COMIC: Emperor of the Daleks! [+]Paul Cornell, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1993).) and a jury of Daleks. (PROSE: The Shoreditch Incident [+]Alan Barnes, DWPM short stories (Marvel Comics, 1995).) The Time Lords would later question if several of the Daleks Davros had created on Necros were present on Skaro during this time, helping to explain how one portion of the Dalek race eventually accepted him as their leader after the trial. (PROSE: Dalek Combat Training Manual [+]Richard Atkinson and Mike Tucker, BBC Books (2021).)\n\nAccording to one account, before a sentence could be passed, however, the Doctor released a virus onto the Daleks and saved Davros, taking him on board his TARDIS. (COMIC: Emperor of the Daleks! [+]Paul Cornell, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1993).) By suggestion of the Doctor, (COMIC: Up Above the Gods [+]Richard Alan, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1995).) Davros hid himself on Spiridon, along with his empire of Daleks. The Daleks who had put him on trial before came to return him to Skaro, but his Daleks held them off. Davros detonated the planet, killing the Daleks. He woke highly injured, four days into a Dalek civil war, in a new casing as the Dalek Emperor. (COMIC: Emperor of the Daleks! [+]Paul Cornell, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1993).)\n\nA final account claimed there was no legal trial, but that the Daleks instead were \"trying out\" Davros as a solution to the schism that had appeared within the Dalek Empire, reluctantly asking him for direction. Davros found this pathetic and believed his creations were feeling fear, but he agreed, so he began to reflect on the past to try to uncover a new direction for the Daleks. (AUDIO: Innocence [+]Gary Hopkins, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nNo matter the case as to how, Davros was able to form a faction of \"Imperial Daleks\" and waged a civil war against the so-called \"Renegade Daleks\" loyal to the Black Dalek Leader and the Dalek Prime. (PROSE: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, adapted from Remembrance of the Daleks (Ben Aaronovitch), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1990)., War of the Daleks [+]John Peel, adapted from War of the Daleks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) However, the factionalism present in Dalek ranks since the end of the Dalek-Movellan War meant that not every renegade sect was at war with Davros. (PROSE: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, adapted from Remembrance of the Daleks (Ben Aaronovitch), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1990).)\n\nOne of Davros's earliest actions as the Imperial Emperor was to order the assassination of the First Doctor, but his plot was foiled by the Seventh Doctor during his hunt for the Key to Time. (COMIC: Time & Time Again [+]Paul Cornell, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics, 1993).) In addition to the war against the renegades, Davros' Imperial Daleks waged the \"liquidation war\" against the Thals, the \"war of vengeance\" against the Movellans and the \"time campaign\". (PROSE: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, adapted from Remembrance of the Daleks (Ben Aaronovitch), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1990).)\n\nAt some point while Emperor, Davros developed mind-transfer technology and formed an alliance with Napoléon Bonaparte in the hope of changing history by altering the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo, planning to replace Bonaparte's mind with that of a Dalek and use his mind for the Dalek battle computers. The Sixth Doctor found Davros in 1815 and transferred minds with him. Davros's mind was transferred back after the Doctor revealed the deception to Bonaparte, who deliberately lost the battle. (AUDIO: The Curse of Davros [+]Jonathan Morris, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2012).)\n\nDavros came to learn of an ancient Time Lord weapon known as the Hand of Omega that had been hidden by the First Doctor on Earth in November 1963. Completely encased within an Imperial Dalek-like shell, Davros personally led the Imperial mothership to 1963 Shoreditch to steal the weapon, intending to make his Daleks the new Lords of Time. However, the Seventh Doctor had preprogrammed the Hand of Omega to destroy the sun of Skaro upon activation and Davros, choosing to ignore the Doctor's warnings, found himself nearly killed when his ship was destroyed by the Hand returning to him on a collision course, but he survived once again in an escape pod. (TV: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988).)\n\nAccording to one account, Davros's escape pod fell straight down towards Shoreditch, where the Intrusion Counter-Measures Group were unable to locate it during the clean-up and cover-up of the Shoreditch Incident. (PROSE: The Shoreditch Incident [+]Alan Barnes, DWPM short stories (Marvel Comics, 1995).) Historians in the Post-Time War universe believed that Davros lost control of his newly formed Empire after the Shoreditch Incident, with his place being taken by the Dalek Emperor who orchestrated the Etra Prime Incident in an attempted invasion of Gallifrey. (PROSE: Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe [+]George Mann, Justin Richards and Cavan Scott, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Ebury Publishing, 2017).)\n\nDavros's pod spent an unknown amount of time drifting in space before being discovered by a garbage ship called the Quetzel. The Eighth Doctor and Sam Jones landed on the Quetzel. A Thal force later took control of the ship. They wanted Davros to alter their race so they could better fight the Daleks. A force of Daleks arrived and took Davros, the Doctor, Sam, the Thals, and the Quetzel engineer Chayn to Skaro, which Davros had believed destroyed by the Hand of Omega. The Dalek Prime claimed the planet that had been destroyed was actually a decoy world named Antalin, though Davros went on to reject this idea, theorising that Skaro really had been destroyed, and that the Dalek Prime's Daleks were too young to realise they were now on a replacement. The Dalek Prime wanted to remove any supporters of Davros from the Dalek race and a new trial was held. Those Daleks loyal to Davros turned on the Dalek Prime and a civil war broke out. In the end, the Doctor and his allies escaped from Skaro, Davros's forces were defeated, and Davros was apparently executed by matter dispersal, although the Spider Dalek responsible for Davros's sentence had actually been converted to his cause earlier and may have sabotaged the execution. (PROSE: War of the Daleks [+]John Peel, adapted from War of the Daleks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).)\n\nDavros eventually made his way to Azimuth and attempted to contact other Daleks in the universe. When he encountered the Seventh Doctor again, Will Arrowsmith told Davros about the Persuasion machine, and Davros made plans to reassert his control over the Daleks with it. Davros revealed that the main reason he had returned to Azimuth was to track down an old experiment he had carried out to clone himself, but learned that the clone had developed its own consciousness after it was activated by the remaining Daleks. The clone had assumed the identity of Falkus and now considered himself Davros's \"son\". Falkus attempted to torture the Doctor for information about his past victories and brainwashed Elizabeth Klein to power the Persuasion machine, but Klein was actually a duplicate of herself who used the machine to destroy the Daleks and Falkus. Davros was able to escape in a Dalek time machine, but was trapped again when the Doctor diverted his escape pod to a planet occupied by the Wraiths of Lamuria, a group of spirits dedicated to punishing criminals. (AUDIO: Daleks Among Us [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn an account that may have just been the Doctor using fictional energies for a cathartic simulation, (PROSE: Head Games [+]Steve Lyons, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).) Davros witnessed the human race advance their scientific knowledge to the point of becoming a threat by the year 2254. Ultimately, Davros decided that this problem needed to be rectified and so launched an invasion of Earth, intending to turn it into a Dalek production planet. He also stole a Time Ring from Gallifrey. Davros addressed the Battle Commander Daleks in the presence of the Emperor Dalek on Skaro, commencing the invasion of Earth. However, the Doctor led a resistance against the Daleks on Earth. Confronting Davros on Skaro, the Doctor informed Davros that his invasion of Earth had been foiled and that the Time Lords would ensure that he would never threaten the universe again. Davros was then frozen in time and sent adrift in space. (GAME: Dalek Attack [+]R.D. Hulley, Alternative Software (1992).)\n\nWhile drifting alone in space, Davros created a virus capable of killing all living things in remembrance of the hypothetical scenario the Doctor gave him during their first conflict on Skaro. He was found by a Nekkistani ship and they helped him, but he rewarded them by killing them. The ship with Davros on board was found drifting in the Time Vortex by the Eighth Doctor, Gemma Griffin and Samson Griffin. Davros took control of Gemma and Samson and operated on the TARDIS after Samson had rendered the Doctor unconscious. Davros established a link to the TARDIS. He sent Gemma and Samson home and left the TARDIS to be damaged by the self-destruct of the Nekkistani ship. Davros conquered Earth by causing mutations and creating new Daleks. By the time he met the Doctor again, (AUDIO: Terror Firma [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) after he had escaped the Divergent Universe with Charlotte Pollard and C'rizz, (AUDIO: The Next Life [+]Alan Barnes and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) Davros teetered on the edge of sanity, his mind split between two warring personalities — Davros and \"the Emperor\". The Emperor personality was completely Dalek-like, and regarded Davros with disdain, regarding him as nothing more than a \"fool\". Desperate to save his mind, Davros cloned himself a new body, intending to transfer his original personality into it. The Doctor struck a deal with the Daleks, who considered Davros an unreliable leader. They would leave Earth with their true Emperor if the Doctor did not release the virus. The Daleks then destroyed Davros' clone before his eyes, the shock of which seemingly causing his original personality to \"die\" and allow the Emperor's mind to become totally dominant. With Davros \"dead\", the Daleks accepted the Emperor as their leader and left Earth. (AUDIO: Terror Firma [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) Later accounts indicated that Davros's actual personality became dominant once again. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nDavros was recruited by the Dalek Empire to aid in an invasion of a rebel Krillitane outpost on Gryphon's Reach that was developing invisibility technology. When the invasion was foiled by the Eleventh Doctor, Davros was cast out of the Empire. To redeem himself, Davros developed the invisibility technology himself and incorporated it into the Daleks. Luring the Doctor to Alacracis IV for one of their many Christmas truces, Davros had the Daleks ambush the Doctor, only for him to offer his own life if the Daleks killed Davros as well. When the Daleks readied to fire on Davros as well, they triggered Davros's secret fail-safe within their casings and self-destructed. Returning to his ship, Davros briefly considered abandoning the Daleks, before they returned following the declaration of the Last Great Time War, and requested his assistance in the upcoming conflict, which Davros accepted. (PROSE: Father of the Daleks [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).)\n\nOne of the events in the Last Great Time War was known as the \"seven deaths of Davros\". (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nDuring the \"very first year\" of the Time War, (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Davros was promised his own legion and acceptance by the Dalek Emperor, who asked him to build a new creature to use against the Time Lords. Davros created the Nightmare Child, which was what he termed \"the perfect Dalek.\" The Nightmare Child quickly became hungry, wishing to consume everything in its path. Left with no choice but to kill it, Davros tried to send it into the Gates of Elysium. He sent a distress signal to the War Doctor, but instead of wanting to be rescued, he really only wished for the Doctor to see him die, helpless to save him. (PROSE: The Third Wise Man [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) Davros's command ship flew into the jaws of the Nightmare Child, (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and the Gates of Elysium closed behind them. (PROSE: The Third Wise Man [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) While Davros was believed to have been killed, he was actually saved when Dalek Caan broke the Time War's time-lock and took him to the Post-Time War universe. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nAfter Davros was rescued by Dalek Caan, he used cells from his own body to create a New Dalek Empire, leaving some of his internal organs and part of the skeleton exposed on his upper torso. At the epicentre of this new hidden empire was a planet-sized space station known as the Crucible, stationed within the Medusa Cascade in a pocket of time one second out of sync with the rest of the universe. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) However, the Daleks still refused to recognise Davros as their leader and installed a Supreme Dalek as their leader instead. They did not exterminate Davros, though, and he still considered them his \"children\". An \"arrangement\" was made to keep Davros under guard inside the vault room of the Crucible. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) In return, he helped them steal twenty-seven planets from across space and time to fuel a reality bomb, which would leave the Daleks the sole inhabitants in all existence. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nDavros posted a message to the conspiracy website Doctor Who? prior to the 2006 London UFO crash, ordering that the Ninth Doctor be brought to him should he be found. (PROSE: Rose sighting confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nAfter the Earth was taken and invaded by the Daleks, Davros constantly asked for information on the Doctor's whereabouts, and lambasted the Supreme Dalek for thinking them \"beyond the Doctor's reach\". When the Children of Time used the Earth's phone network to contact the Tenth Doctor with a Subwave network, Davros hacked into the call to speak to him directly and gloat over his survival. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) The Doctor was soon brought aboard the Crucible with Rose Tyler, and Davros kept them prisoner with him in the vault room, where Davros ignored the Doctor's insults on his low status amongst the Daleks, instead showing him a test of the reality bomb.\n\nWhen faced with threats from Jack Harkness with Sarah Jane Smith's warp star and Martha Jones with the Osterhagen key, Davros took the opportunity to taunt the Doctor on how he \"[took] ordinary people and you fashion[ed] them into weapons\", before the Doctor's companions were beamed into the vault room to neutralise their threat. As Davros and the Daleks prepared to detonate the reality bomb, the Meta-Crisis Doctor arrived to try and shoot Davros, but was dispatched with Donna Noble by an electric attack from Davros' hand. However, the attack awakened \"the DoctorDonna\", who shut down the bomb by closing off all of the Z-Neutrino energy relay loops of the reality bomb by using an internalised synchronous back-feed reversal loop, returning most of the stolen planets, followed by the Meta-Crisis Doctor maximising the Dalekanium power feeds and blasting them back, destroying the Crucible and the fleet, just as Caan revealed he had orchestrated the events due to coming to disagree with the Dalek philosophy. Before fleeing the carnage in the TARDIS, the Tenth Doctor offered to save Davros, but the creator of the Daleks refused, naming him \"the Destroyer of Worlds\" and choosing to stay aboard the exploding Crucible with Dalek Caan. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nHowever, Davros somehow managed to survive the destruction of the space station. (PROSE: The Whoniverse [+]George Mann and Justin Richards, BBC Books (2016).) The Daleks, meanwhile, also survived; whilst those made from Davros's DNA were declared impure by the New Dalek Paradigm they established, the New Paradigm managed to restore the Dalek race and empire. (PROSE: Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe [+]George Mann, Justin Richards and Cavan Scott, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Ebury Publishing, 2017).) The rebuilt Dalek Empire eventually restored Skaro and reunited with Davros. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nDavros eventually found himself on the brink of death and returned to Skaro, returning to the Dalek City to die. Remembering his encounter with the Twelfth Doctor in his childhood, he ordered Colony Sarff to bring the Doctor to him. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) In what one account described as \"the Last Night\" of Davros's life, (PROSE: Davros, Dark Lord of Skaro [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) he made a gambit to steal regeneration energy from the Doctor to both heal himself and channel the energy into his Daleks to fulfil the Gallifreyan legend of the Hybrid. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhen Sarff brought the Doctor before him, Davros told him he was dying as they reminisced on their history, though the Doctor refused to believe he was on death's door. Undeterred, Davros tried to justify his creation of the Daleks as Missy and Clara Oswald were captured by a Skaro City Dalek model. Despite the Doctor's pleas, Davros admitted that he had given up trying to control the Daleks and couldn't stop them from exterminating the Doctor's friends. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) In revenge, the Doctor pulled Davros from his chair to use it to infiltrate the Daleks' base, but he was captured again by Colony Sarff and Davros was returned to his life-support machine.\n\nAs he continued to make the Doctor feel compassion for him to manoeuvre him towards the cables that connected him to the life force of every Dalek in his plan to steal regenerative energy, Davros learned that the Doctor had saved Gallifrey from destruction at the end of the Time War, and congratulated the Doctor on saving his people, referring to his own failure to save the Kaled race from extinction. Shutting down his eye implant to address the Doctor with his true eyes, Davros finally convinced the Doctor that he was dying and the two enemies shared a laugh at the Doctor's poor medical examination. As he told the Doctor that he wanted to see one last sunrise, the Doctor finally released regenerative energy into the cables in an apparent act of compassion, and Davros was quick to act, using Colony Sarff to secure the Doctor and siphon the regenerative energy from the Time Lord, transmitting it into every Dalek across Skaro, while also using some of it to renew himself and remove his reliance on the life support for survival. However, after being saved by Missy, who had escaped extermination with Clara, the Doctor revealed that he had known of Davros's plan the whole time, and had let him take the energy as part of his own plan to stop the Daleks. He then revealed that Davros's transmission of the energy into every Dalek on Skaro had included the decaying Daleks in the sewers beneath the Dalek City, who attacked and destroyed it in revenge for being left to suffer, with Davros still inside when the roof of the infirmary collapsed on him. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nHowever, Davros managed to survive and recorded a \"whole and true study\" of Dalek history and science to ensure their purity and survival in case he ever truly did die. In his study, he wrote that he was still connected to the life force of every Dalek, but that he had the stolen regeneration energy, making him question what may be possible in the future. He concluded his discussion by once again stating that his children were the ultimate form of life and that all other lifeforms needed to be exterminated. (PROSE: Secrets of the Dalek Laboratory [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Sixth Doctor objected to Jack Harkness marrying Callista while posing as him, likening the situation to a marriage with the Dalek Emperor. Jack countered by pointing out that the Doctor was still fighting the Daleks, and used a hypothetical romance with Davros to taunt him. (AUDIO: Piece of Mind [+]James Goss, The Lives of Captain Jack: Volume Two (The Lives of Captain Jack, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nIn the video game Happy Deathday, played by Izzy Sinclair on the Time-Space Visualiser, Davros was among a host of \"every single enemy\" that the Doctor had ever defeated, who were assembled by the Beige Guardian and pitted against the Doctor's first eight incarnations. (COMIC: Happy Deathday [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 1998).)\n\nFrom the Matrix's projection of the Security Drone Incident, it came much to the concern of the Time Lords that the Reconnaissance Dalek was able to create a whole new mutant strain of the Dalek race without the advanced skills of either Davros, the Dalek Emperor or the Cult of Skaro. As such, they began research into the genetic make-up of the reconnaissance scouts to further understand the extent of their abilities. (PROSE: Dalek Combat Training Manual [+]Richard Atkinson and Mike Tucker, BBC Books (2021).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor told Henry van Statten that the Daleks were created by a \"genius\" who \"was king of his own little world\", and commented that van Statten would like him. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Following his transformation into a Human-Dalek, Dalek Sec said that Davros was wrong to believe that removing emotions made the Daleks stronger, to the surprise of the Tenth Doctor. (TV: Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor claimed that the TARDIS had a GPS with Davros's voice. (AUDIO: Trouble in Paradise [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He also once jokingly mentioned Davros as someone to go to if one needed a reality bomb. (COMIC: What He Wants... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) When the Eleventh Doctor and Ian Chesterton were forced to bear witness to the Doctor's memories by the Prometheans, the face of Davros was one of the many foes the two saw. (COMIC: Hunters of the Burning Stone [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2013).)\n\nDavros was included in the Perils of the Constant Division, a series of vid-briefings on dangerous beings. (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) The Testimony Foundation also knew of Davros and the Daleks. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nA Dalek traitor voiced its belief that the Daleks should be destroyed since, while they were originally created to ensure the survival of the Kaleds, their mission had deviated and eroded Kaled identity, with the Thirteenth Doctor remarking that Davros would be both impressed and horrified by the revelation  (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nDuring the 1966 Dalek invasion of Earth, the Fourteenth Doctor nicknamed the Supreme Dalek \"Diana Ross\" as a pun on Davros' name, comparing \"Di Ross\" to \"Davros\". (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).)\n\nDavros was malevolent and sadistic, and it was his ability to command and delegate that was most forceful and cold. Davros believed different species could not peacefully co-exist, so thought the utter extermination of all other races was the only way the Daleks could succeed at bringing peace. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) Brilliant and driven, Davros relentlessly experimented to find the final form of the Kaled people. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) However, by creating the Daleks, he paradoxically believed that he had saved his own kind despite him not considering the Daleks to be Kaleds, (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) thinking that comparing the Daleks to the Kaleds was like saying a pearl was the heir to the stone that formed it. (PROSE: Father of the Daleks [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) The Movellans' analysis of Davros noted that he prioritised his own survival above all else. (AUDIO: The Triumph of Davros [+]Matt Fitton, Dalek Universe (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nWhile he was of sound mind in his youth, Davros was already cold and indifferent to those around him at a young age, even to his own family, though he held a soft spot for his mother, Lady Calcula, from whom he inherited a lot of his fanaticism and ruthlessness. (AUDIO: Innocence [+]Gary Hopkins, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006)., Corruption [+]Lance Parkin, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006)., Guilt [+]Scott Alan Woodard, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) However, he had no qualms about experimenting on the corpses of his mother and sister, (AUDIO: Purity [+]James Parsons and Andrew Stirling-Brown, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006)., Corruption [+]Lance Parkin, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) and was perfectly willing to betray others simply to build and secure his own political position. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nEncouraged by his mother, Davros grew increasingly obsessed with his scientific experiments and personal ambitions. Already a feared and power-obsessed individual, (AUDIO: Innocence [+]Gary Hopkins, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006)., Purity [+]James Parsons and Andrew Stirling-Brown, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006)., Corruption [+]Lance Parkin, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006)., Guilt [+]Scott Alan Woodard, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) the incident that crippled him and his overall experiences in the Thal-Kaled war left Davros a depraved and insane megalomaniac. He became tyrannical and more ruthless than before, tolerating no opposition to his will and dismissing fairness and democracy as \"the creeds of cowards\". However, when the Daleks turned on him, he begged them to show pity on him and his loyal scientists, only attempting to destroy them when they refused to obey him. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).)\n\nFollowing his reawakening from the extermination attempt, Davros instantly tried to ally himself with Daleks, (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).) though he was still bitter on how easily they betrayed and used him. (TV: Resurrection of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) This led him to making the Imperial Daleks. (TV: Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).)\n\nFollowing his failure to use the Hand of Omega, Davros developed a completely Dalek personality that identified itself as \"the Emperor\". The Emperor was highly critical of Davros, berating him for being a fool and allowing himself to be defeated so many times by both the Doctor and the Daleks. After the Davros personality was seemingly destroyed, the Emperor seized full control, (AUDIO: Terror Firma [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) though later accounts attain that Davros was able to reclaim his identity. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nAfter his rescue from the Time War, Davros remained as narcissistic as ever, referring to the reality bomb as \"the apotheosis of [his] genius\", (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) but he also showed a dislike of pride and vanity, admonishing the Dalek Supreme for displaying pride and distastefully noting the \"arrogance\" in the Tenth Doctor's voice. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) He also seemed to have been driven more insane than before, having been consumed by a desire to completely destroy all of creation under Dalek Caan's manipulations. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhile Davros had made the Daleks into a race that could only hate, he himself had always tried to get them to love him as their father. (PROSE: The Third Wise Man [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) However, he also maintained that, if the Daleks were to return the love he had for them, they would no longer be his children. (PROSE: Father of the Daleks [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) When challenged by the Fourth Doctor, Davros refused to accept the idea that the Daleks were evil, instead believing they would bring peace by becoming the sole life-forms of the universe. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) Even years later, he maintained to the Twelfth Doctor that the Daleks existed \"for the ultimate good of the universe\". (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nDuring the lead up to the Last Great Time War, Davros felt the pride of a father when the Daleks told him they had declared war on the Time Lords. (PROSE: Father of the Daleks [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) Davros had joy in his voice when he saved the Daleks from the Nightmare Child, yet the Daleks would never care about his sacrifice. (PROSE: The Third Wise Man [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) He had many moments of parental pride and fondness for the Daleks, being eager to talk about, and learn of, their accomplishments (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979)., The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) yet paradoxically thought little of their intelligence and abilities, believing that they could not progress without him. (AUDIO: The Triumph of Davros [+]Matt Fitton, Dalek Universe (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nFor all his desire to rule the Daleks before and throughout the Imperial-Renegade Dalek Civil War, (TV: Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) he eventually accepted arrangements that kept him alive and involved in their affairs. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) He claimed the Daleks had a genetic fault that made them respect him and showcase mercy towards him. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Instead of ruling over them, he wanted his \"children\" to love him as their father and sought to simply to be involved in their empire. (PROSE: Father of the Daleks [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).)\n\nAlthough he respected the Fourth Doctor as a fellow scientist, he refused to give in to his request to make the Daleks into less vicious creatures. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) He also told the Sixth Doctor that he was the closest thing he had left to a friend, reflecting that \"in some strange dream of history\" they may have actually been friends. Even though the Doctor insisted that the two of them were not friends, Davros nonetheless noted they were both scientists who had \"been through a lot\" together. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) Over the years, Davros and the Doctor had several truces where they met with each other on Christmas. During one meeting on the Red Moon of Xhe, Davros found himself enjoying their Christmas truce, but he claimed it was only because of the low oxygen affecting him. (PROSE: Father of the Daleks [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) Davros once joked that the Doctor \"slaughter[ing]\" Daleks and him \"slaughter[ing]\" Time Lords was the \"conventional means of communication\" in their dynamic. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nDuring the war in the Medusa Cascade, though he proclaimed the Doctor to be arrogant (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and took a sadistic pleasure in reminding the Doctor of how many people had died for him, Davros still sought a moment to catch up with him \"after so very long\". (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) During his scheme to trick the Twelfth Doctor into giving his regeneration energy, Davros stated that he had always admired the Doctor and claimed to wish that they, at least once, could be on the same side. While it later appeared that Davros had been putting on an act, he also displayed joy when the Doctor told him Gallifrey had been saved, as it meant the Doctor had saved his own kind, as opposed to Davros' attempt to save the Kaleds. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Even after he betrayed him, Davros believed he and the Doctor could have created \"a true hybrid\" if they had worked together. (PROSE: Secrets of the Dalek Laboratory [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nDavros did possess a sense of humour, however rarely it was expressed, such as when he coldly quipped that informing the beneficiaries of his Necros-produced protein that they would be eating their own relatives would have created \"consumer resistance\". (TV: Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) When the Doctor admitted his doubt that Davros was honestly dying despite seeing his failing health, Davros humorously told him that he was \"not a good doctor\", at which both men laughed at in a moment of union. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nAs a child, Davros had the skin tone similar to a Caucasian human, brown hair and two functioning blue eyes. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) However, his body was mangled by a Thal bombardment. (AUDIO: Davros [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003)., Corruption [+]Lance Parkin, I, Davros (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) By the Movellans' definition, Davros became a humanoid mutant (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).) after he had taken on a cyborg form and life-support system.\n\nHis skin was discoloured and his body crippled by the bombardment, leaving him without the use his legs or his left arm. His Kaled body was humanoid, though a blue lens in his forehead replaced his lost vision, allowing him a semblance of sight. He had only his right hand, which he used to operate controls on his chariot that could perform functions for controlling doors, the Mark III travel machines, or his own life support system. He had a helmet-like arrangement of wires and plastic tubes suspended over his head, (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) and was rendered more machine than man, with his lungs, heart, speech, hearing and sight being mechanically or electronically aided. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from Destiny of the Daleks (Terry Nation), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1979).)\n\nAs Davros's life-support system maintained the function of his vital organs and revivified necrotising tissue, his appearance underwent subtle changes over time. (PROSE: Dalek Combat Training Manual [+]Richard Atkinson and Mike Tucker, BBC Books (2021).) Following his cryogenic imprisonment, Davros's face gained a yellowish, sagging appearance, (TV: Resurrection of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) while, after the Time War, a darker colour had returned to his face. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) During a meeting the Eighth Doctor, Davros claimed that he had been \"clinging\" onto his physical form but regretted the decision, deciding that he did not need his withered body to remain himself. (AUDIO: Terror Firma [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) However, Davros always made sure his repairs kept him with a similar image whenever he needed to be \"reconstructed\". Upon meeting the Eleventh Doctor, he questioned why he did so instead of changing himself into a younger form. (PROSE: Father of the Daleks [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).)\n\nAfter Bostock fired a gun which destroyed most of his right hand, (TV: Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) Davros had his hand replaced with a claw (COMIC: Emperor of the Daleks! [+]Paul Cornell, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1993).) or a prosthetic substitute (AUDIO: The Juggernauts [+]Scott Alan Woodard, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) which eventually came to be a metallic replica of his lost appendage. TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) He was capable of projecting electric shocks from both his mechanical hand, (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) as well as his eye. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhile tricking the Twelfth Doctor into using his regeneration energy to rejuvenate his dying body, it was revealed that while Davros could still open and use his real eyes, but it required him to shut down the artificial eye in the middle of his forehead. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nDavros was originally seen by the Fourth Doctor sitting upright in a life-support chariot resembling the base of a Dalek. Davros's blue eye appendage mirrored the look of a Dalek's eyestalk lens. A metal brace was attached to his head, and wires were plugged into his skull. Davros also had a throat microphone implant to enhance his damaged voice. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) By the Necros Incident, Davros's chair had anti-gravity gravitors that enabled him to hover. (TV: Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).)\n\nBy the time that Davros had risen to become the Emperor of the Imperial Dalek faction during the Imperial-Renegade Dalek Civil War, his life-support chariot no longer featured a button with which he could deactivate his life support, (AUDIO: The Curse of Davros [+]Jonathan Morris, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2012).) as it had when he had first met the Doctor on Skaro. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) During the Imperial-Renegade Dalek Civil War, Davros sat in a bloated dome. His head was cradled by metal braces from which wires trailed down into the hidden body of the Dalek shell. His eyes were hollow scars and the skin of his cheeks was withered and cracked. (PROSE: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, adapted from Remembrance of the Daleks (Ben Aaronovitch), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1990).)\n\nDavros later dispensed with his skull wires and throat microphone. However, he retained his head brace. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) His artificial eye was evidently connected to his nervous system and susceptible to pain, as he visibly winced after Missy jabbed him in the mechanical eye. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nTerry Nation saw Davros as a voice for the Daleks. In DWM #250, he commented:\n\nIn Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988)., only Davros's head was seen inside the Imperial Casing, poking out of a tangle of wire. As Ben Aaronovitch revealed in DWM 147, his intention was that Davros's head was all that was left of his body, having decided to upgrade himself into a Dalek to protect his life after being threatened at gunpoint by the Doctor in Resurrection of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).. Aaronovitch suspected that he had even only kept his face so that he could use it \"to sneer at the Doctor\" during what he thought would be their final meeting, and was planning to have it removed also in the long run. This intent is alluded to in the story when the Seventh Doctor notes that Davros had \"discarded the last vestiges of a human form\".\n\nHowever, in the filmed episode, the visible movements of Terry Molloy's shoulders underneath the mass of wires obscured Aaronovitch's intent, which would been followed inconsistently in later stories. The comic story Emperor of the Daleks! [+]Paul Cornell, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1993)., a prequel to Remembrance of the Daleks, depicted Davros being incorporated into the Imperial Casing to sustain his life after he was grievously injured in an explosion, lending weight to the idea that his head was all that was left of his original body. However, War of the Daleks [+]John Peel, adapted from War of the Daleks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997)., which featured Davros immediately following the events of Remembrance of the Daleks, featured Davros back in his original chair, complete with his torso and arm.\n\nAccordingly, when Davros returned on television in The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., his organic torso and arm were intact, with his organic body serving as a critical plot point in how he was able to build his New Dalek Empire.\n\nDavros would have appeared in the cancelled BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures novel Enemy of the Daleks [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., having degenerated further from a disembodied head in Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988). into a digitised artificial intelligence.\n\nWhen concerned about using CGI in his episodes, Russell T Davies considered using Davros as a substitute for the Emperor Dalek in The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005). and the Beast in The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)..\n\nSteven Moffat considered having Davros appear in the Vault during Series 10 until he settled on Missy being the prisoner.",
