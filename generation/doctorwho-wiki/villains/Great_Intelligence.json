  "content": "The Great Intelligence was a mysterious entity. Few sources could agree exactly what the Intelligence was. The Second Doctor described it as \"a sort of formless, shapeless thing floating about in space like a cloud of mist, only with a mind and will.\" The Intelligence was capable of possessing deceased bodies, controlling mechanised Robot Yeti, forming fear-dependent snow creatures, and was often prone to choosing individuals to do its bidding from a distance.\n\nThe Great Intelligence was an aspect of Sunyata, (PROSE: Night of the Intelligence [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2017).) an \"inter-dimensional being\" that resided within the Void, existing in many realities, but always ending up as the \"Great Intelligence\" and sharing the same basic attributes, although the Intelligences originated in various ways, including an immortal soul, and various Great Old Ones. (PROSE: Legacies [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAccording to one account, the Intelligence had been exiled from another dimension, and was forced to wander the universe to find a body to possess. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Web of Fear [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from The Web of Fear (Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1976).) Indeed, according to its distorted memories, the Intelligence had been in existence for centuries without a form. It nonetheless sought to collect other minds into its consciousness. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).)\n\nAccording to another account, the Intelligence was originally the being known as Yog-Sothoth, from the universe before the Doctor's; (PROSE: Millennial Rites [+]Craig Hinton, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).) he and his brethren survived the end of their universe by passing through a parallel universe that ended one second after theirs. Shifting again allowed them to enter the current universe shortly after it began expanding. (PROSE: All-Consuming Fire [+]Andy Lane, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994)., Millennial Rites [+]Craig Hinton, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).) Another account agreed that the Great Intelligence was a Great Old One; (AUDIO: The Roof of the World [+]Adrian Rigelsford, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) another account stated that the Great Old Ones all lost their physical bodies running from the Fendahl, explaining the Intelligence's disembodied nature and perpetual quest for incarnation. (PROSE: White Darkness [+]David A. McIntee, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1993).) According to the accounts where it was originally Yog-Sothoth, the Intelligence was the military strategist of the Great Old Ones, who were the equivalent of the Time Lords in a previous universe to the one the Doctor resided. They shunted themselves into a parallel universe to pass into the next universe. Yog-Sothoth discovered it had gained god-like powers and decided to try the various gambits and games it had only played on computers. Over the billennia, it mounted millions of campaigns against inhabited planets. It used the Hisk version of koalas on Hiskith and domestic animals equivalent to dogs on Danos. (PROSE: Millennial Rites [+]Craig Hinton, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).)\n\nAnother account claimed that the Great Intelligence was the ascended immortal soul which began life as James Lethbridge-Stewart and ended millennia later as Mahasamatman. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).)\n\nAfter the War, the Superiors sent Chris Cwej to investigate a disturbance on the surface of the devastated planet Nibo. Cwej found that a group of abandoned, deteriorating Time Engines — weapons designed to emanate harmful temporal waves — had generated a swarm of Shadow-Mantises. After fighting his way into the Engines, Cwej realised that their waves had generated a life form, a cosmic fungus which metabolised time. Cwej defeated the entity in a psychic battle, but later worried that a surviving spore retained an imprint of his mind, and might grow into \"a great intelligence\". (PROSE: The Mushroom at the End of the Universe [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt some point in the 18th century, it possessed the Tibetan lama Padmasambhava while it was travelling the astral plane and forced him to build its Robot Yeti over the next two centuries. (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967).) According to one account, it was Padmasambhava that called it a \"great intelligence\", a name it used from that point on. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).)\n\nAt the Det-Sen Monastery in 1935, the Second Doctor and Edward Travers, a westerner determined to find the Yeti, intervened with the Intelligence's plans to take the mountain the Monastery stood on, the Lama realising that it would want to cover the world as slime. The Intelligence knew of the Doctor, and described him as \"a man of great knowledge and intelligence.\" They destroyed the pyramids that controlled its Yeti and Padmasambhava's physical body died as the Intelligence melted away. (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967).)\n\nAccounts that claimed the Great Intelligence to be a Great Old One held that the London Event was launched when the being was placed under pressure from the other Old Ones, who themselves embarked on similar campaigns and conquered other planets. The Intelligence was forced to use the Yeti in London, an environment to which they were not well suited. (PROSE: Millennial Rites [+]Craig Hinton, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).)\n\nNo matter the case, approximately forty years after the events at the Det-Sen Monastery, the Yeti re-activated and the Intelligence manifested as webbing. It ensnared the Doctor's TARDIS in space and forced it to land in the London Underground. Reunited with Travers, the Doctor assisted British military in their battles with the Yeti. The Intelligence re-animated and possessed the corpse of Staff Sergeant Arnold, using him to track the Doctor's actions. The Intelligence captured the Doctor and tried to use a conversion headset to absorb the Doctor's knowledge and intellect into its own. The Doctor attempted to reverse the process, allowing him to absorb the Intelligence and destroy it. When the control spheres that formed the focus of the Intelligence were smashed by Jamie McCrimmon, the Intelligence vanished, (TV: The Web of Fear [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1968).) powerless but still alive, though blinded in unending darkness. (HOMEVID: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 1995).)\n\nIn the following October, the Intelligence followed Lethbridge-Stewart, Sally Wright, and Owain Vine to New York City, where it attempted to use Yeti and infected rats to turn the population of the city into a vast computer. Aided by Edward Travers and Adrienne Kramer, the three successfully repelled the invasion. (PROSE: Times Squared [+]Rick Cross, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2016).)\n\nThe Intelligence was still around a couple of years after the London Event and controlled Norma Vine. It was trapped on Earth because of his link to Toby Kinsella and Travers. It sent Norma around London to find pieces of equipment for a machine. Travers tried to communicate with it and it overtook his mind. It decided to destroy his lab. Kinsella found a door to its base through a temporal tear in Hyde Park. It didn't realise that his thoughts had been broadcast over the TV and Radio. It wanted to control everyone on Earth. Creating the domain for Vine took a lot of its energy. It hoped to call the Doctor to Earth for it to free him. The combined wills of Travers and Kinsella overwrote the connection to Vine and it fled this plane. Still bound to the Earth it vowed to try again. (AUDIO: Time of the Intelligence [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, The New Counter-Measures: Series Two (The New Counter-Measures, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nIn the 1980s while millions of miles away in deep space, the Intelligence again used the Yeti in Tibet in another attempt at world conquest. Possessing the dead body of Shiro Sugimoto, the Intelligence tried to drain knowledge from Bruce Healy, only to be attacked by the Lama Gampo and the real Tibetan Yeti. It was defeated when Gampo destroyed the power-transfuser, draining the power from the Intelligence's base.  (COMIC: Yonder... The Yeti [+]Steve Moore, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1980).)\n\nThe Seventh Doctor, Lysandra Aristedes and Sally Morgan encountered the Great Intelligence during their travels in the black TARDIS. (AUDIO: Black and White [+]Matt Fitton, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2012).)\n\nThe Intelligence — possessing the mind of the now deceased Professor Travers — later contacted the Doctor's former companion Victoria Waterfield and manipulated her into using computers to return to physical existence in 1995, attempting to cover the Earth in web. When the generators to the New World University were destroyed, the main bulk of the Intelligence faded away. (HOMEVID: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 1995).)\n\nIn 1999, Anne Travers, who had been left traumatised by the Intelligence's first attempts to enter the universe, believed millionaire Ashley Chapel would try to use a special program, the Millennium Codex, to summon the Intelligence to Earth. She prepared a counterspell to force it back into its own reality. However, this had destructive effects, including dragging the Intelligence back to Earth and merging it with the benevolent god Saraquazel into a single malevolent being.\n\nIt altered reality around London to form the Great Kingdom, a realm partly obeying the laws of the Intelligence's universe, N-Space, and Saraquazel's universe; here, the Doctor's TARDIS was worshipped as \"the Lady TARDIS\" and the Intelligence was worshipped as \"the key and the guardian of the gate,\" forming the triad of gods with Saraquazel. Anne sacrificed herself to fix reality, but instead of destroying the Intelligence, she banished it. The Intelligence became stranded on the edge of the universe, riding the blue shift outwards into infinity. (PROSE: Millennial Rites [+]Craig Hinton, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).)\n\nWith its memory gone, the Intelligence soon found itself on Earth in the year 1842, (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).) where it manifested as living snow, and used Walter Simeon as a tool in its scheme. Simeon's dark thoughts powered it; Simeon had, as the Doctor put it, \"poured [his] darkest dreams into a snowman.\" Simeon established the Great Intelligence Institute as the snow slowly swarmed to Earth.\n\nIn 1892, its presence was sufficient enough to consume mankind. Having erased Simeon's mind and memories from after meeting the Intelligence, the Eleventh Doctor was surprised to see the Intelligence survived. He had thought that it had been created by the host Simeon, but discovered that it had learned to survive beyond physical form, becoming the \"dream [that] outlive[d] the dreamer\". Controlling the now-mindless Simeon, the Intelligence attacked the Doctor, but was stopped in the last minutes of Christmas Eve when the snow changed to \"rain\", mimicking the form of the tears of Captain Latimer's family after Clara Oswin Oswald's death. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) The Intelligence did not totally perish, and in fact learned to survive beyond physical form, using Simeon as an avatar, (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) lingering for a hundred years in search of minds to use for its own. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).)\n\nAt some point in the late 20th century, while Rosemary Kizlet was still a young girl, the Great Intelligence began to \"whisper in her ear,\" leading her to eventually found her company. By 2013, the Great Intelligence had influenced Miss Kizlet to establish an organisation based on the 65th floor of the Shard, which used the Wi-Fi and servants nicknamed Spoonheads to capture human minds. The Great Intelligence used the internet as its \"web.\"(TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) During this time, the Great Intelligence accessed information hidden by governments and militaries and learned about the many times that it had been encountered by humans and defeated by various incarnations of the Doctor, learning everything that it could about the Time Lord and rediscovering the extent of its own influence on the corporeal plane. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).)\n\nIts operation fell apart when the Eleventh Doctor used a captured Spoonhead to trick Miss Kizlet into being trapped in the Wi-Fi after she refused to release the uploaded Clara Oswald, who was under the Doctor's protection. The workers downloaded Clara, Kizlet and others captured in the server, returning them to their bodies. When UNIT arrived at the Shard, the Great Intelligence ordered Kizlet to restore their employees to their \"factory settings\", effectively erasing everyone's memories to avoid detection. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAfter the Siege of Trenzalore in a later averted timeline, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) the Intelligence used the Whisper Men to kidnap Madame Vastra, Strax and Jenny Flint from 1893 to Trenzalore. It spoke through their \"conference call\" link with Clara and River Song to take the Doctor from 2013 London to Trenzalore.\n\nThe Whisper Men brought the Paternoster Gang to the Doctor's tomb on Trenzalore so the Intelligence could have its ultimate revenge by turning all of the Doctor's victories into defeats. It did so by directly entering the Doctor's time stream, which appeared as an open wound in reality inside the tomb. However, this plan was foiled by Clara, who followed the Intelligence through the wound. Just as he was, she was ripped into countless versions of herself throughout history, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) including the one that had helped the Doctor defeat the Intelligence and Simeon in 1892, (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) and saved the Doctor countless times, undoing the damage the Intelligence had done to his timeline. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Each defeat weakened the Great Intelligence further and further with the entity finding Clara thwarting its plans wherever it went. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).)\n\nAfter interfering with countless points in the Doctor's timeline, the Intelligence returned to the London Event, where another encounter with Clara, and the Second Doctor's attempt to destroy the younger Intelligence, severely damaged it, forcing the Intelligence to leave the Doctor's timestream. Realising that Clara would be waiting at every turn to defeat it, the weakened Intelligence travelled down the timeline of Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart instead, intending to kill the Doctor's greatest ally. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).)\n\nAfter one failed attempt in 1957, (PROSE: A Funny Turn [+]Alyson Leeds, Lethbridge-Stewart short stories (Candy Jar Books, 2018).) the Intelligence arrived in 1937 and found itself drawn instead to Alistair's brother, James, who carried the original soul which would, centuries later, be reincarnated as the being who would become the Great Intelligence. Its curiosity drew itself to join with James, but it then found that it could not remove itself from its own soul. After manipulating James into killing himself, the Intelligence became trapped inside Remington Manor in Cornwall, weakened further by its attempt to coexist with its younger self. As Gordon's brother and mother left, the Intelligence managed to rob them of their memories of Gordon as a kind of victory and leaving a trace of itself with Mary.\n\nWeeks after the original London Event, in 1969, the Intelligence used Owain Vine, another reincarnation of the Intelligence's immortal soul. During a final showdown in Remington Manor between the Intelligence and Lethbridge-Stewart, Owain helped Lethbridge-Stewart understand that the Intelligence, severely weakened and dying, was relying on the trace of its younger self left inside of the resurrected Staff Sergeant Albert Arnold for survival and restoration. Lethbridge-Stewart shot Arnold through the head, killing him and destroying that remnant of the Intelligence. The Intelligence's avatar fell apart, its control spheres and Robot Yeti exploded, and the Great Intelligence faded away, finally dying. In death, the Intelligence finally found the true peace that it had spent centuries seeking through the unity of consciousness. Before the Intelligence was killed, Lethbridge-Stewart got a brief glimpse of his future, leaving him with the knowledge that there were still other threats out there and that while the Great Intelligence from the future had met its final end, its younger self that had attacked London was still out there and would one day return. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).)\n\nIn an alternative timeline the London Event succeeded, and both Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart and the Doctor were killed in the new timeline. Without them to stand against it, the Intelligence spread its influence throughout Southern England, bringing thousands of minds into its own. The TARDIS, taking on human form, revealed the truth of the Intelligence's being, that it was the imprint of a multi-dimensional being, and a stalemate was called. The Intelligence could never win as long as the TARDIS existed, and the TARDIS could never restore time unless the Intelligence was cast out. Not wishing to continue the stalemate, the Intelligence allowed the TARDIS to cast it out into the void, and time was restored. (PROSE: Legacies [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn a parallel Earth, the Great Intelligence launched an attack on the Republic of Great Britain. Koschei, here having not become the Master, saved the world from the Intelligence but was then captured, tortured, and pumped for information for years by the Republican Security Forces. (PROSE: The Face of the Enemy [+]David A. McIntee, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).)\n\nThe Great Intelligence was arrogant and thought very highly of itself, informing the Doctor that his brain was too small to grasp its purpose. (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967).) It sometimes spoke in the plural, i.e. referring to itself as \"we\", although this habit had worn off by the time of the London Event. (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967)., The Web of Fear [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1968)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) Without a body, it became obsessed with having physical form, craving symmetry of light, colour, and shape. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) Eventually, it grew tired of living as \"a mind without a body\" and went into the Doctor's timestream in order to die. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nDespite once describing revenge as a petty emotion of which it had no need for, (TV: The Web of Fear [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1968).) the Intelligence took its defeats by the Doctor as unforgivable wounds to its pride and after several encounters with him, it had developed such a burning hatred that it went into his timestream in order to take revenge on him in the most painful way imaginable. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) It was also a malevolent and sadistic being, (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) and was also extremely callous and self-absorbed, seeing as how it was unfazed by the fact that undoing all of the Doctor's victories would in turn cause the destruction of the universe. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nIt was the unseen but generous Chancellor of New World University, with Victoria as Vice-Chancellor. It designed invasions based on a \"Great Plan\" it had, having been the military strategist of the Old Ones, and when it thought resistance was useless for humanity, it asked Brigadier Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart which part of its brilliant plan he found most effective. (HOMEVID: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 1995).) When horribly bound to Saraquazel, it did not care about him or crave his assistance, thinking it possessed enough power and intellect to find its own escape. The Intelligence, however, did warn Saraquazel of the duplicity of human beings. (PROSE: Millennial Rites [+]Craig Hinton, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).)\n\nRosemary Kizlet believed that the Intelligence loved humanity in the same vein that Burger King loved cattle. The Intelligence was unconcerned about feasting on people's minds to grow stronger, and showed little concern for its servants, reverting them back to their original state of mind, although it did take the time to say goodbye to Kizlet before doing so. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Great Intelligence had no physical existence and thus relied on possession of living creatures, (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967)., The Web of Fear [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1968).) taking on other shapes, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) or manipulating allies in order to manipulate its environment. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nExisting on the astral plane, the Intelligence could enter the people it encountered, filling itself in every cell and having control of their every movement. It also increased Padmasambhava's lifespan, and reanimated the dead body of Staff Sergeant Arnold. (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967)., The Web of Fear [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1968).) At full strength it could even save a human from fatal illness, or death by extreme age, if only to possess their bodies. (PROSE: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 1995).)\n\nIn addition, it could possess animals, like rats and ants, by extending its will, as well as inhabiting machinery like computer terminals. It resided in the New World University network while reaching out into the Internet. However, the majority of its consciousness was still trapped in the campus mainframe. (HOMEVID: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 1995).) It also inhabited a computer system with a video monitor linked to the firm run by Miss Kizlet in the Shard. The peripheral units linked to this system could edit or absorb the mental traits of users, enabling Kizlet to feed the Intelligence. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nIt could also exert a mental control similar to hypnosis without completely possessing a human, as it had with the monks in Tibet, Victoria Waterfield, Walter Simeon and Miss Kizlet. (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) It also had considerable mental powers, namely telekinesis. (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967).) It was able to make a Eurotrain rear up like a snake and launched missiles, playing with them and engineering near-misses before letting them fall. (PROSE: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 1995).) While merged with Saraquazel, it telekinetically constructed robot Yetis from its surroundings to defend itself. (PROSE: Millennial Rites [+]Craig Hinton, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).)\n\nWhen the Paternoster Gang encountered the Intelligence on Trenzalore, it displayed considerable knowledge of the Doctor's past and future, listing people he had killed, as well as names he'd have by the end of his life, including the Valeyard. When Madame Vastra asked how it had come by this information, it merely replied that it was information. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) It also tracked the Second Doctor and followed him through time and space, having built a machine that could drain his mind of knowledge and experience for the Intelligence. (TV: The Web of Fear [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1968).)\n\nThe Second Doctor thought the best way to describe the Great Intelligence was as a \"formless, shapeless thing, floating out in space like a cloud of mist, only with a mind and will.\" (TV: The Web of Fear [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1968).) Both Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart and the Eleventh Doctor identified it as a mind parasite, whereas the Intelligence considered itself a mass of thoughts with a single thought. (HOMEVID: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 1995).; TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) It once reflected on whether or not it remembered what its original body was. (PROSE: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Downtime (Marc Platt), Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).)\n\nIn all realities, the Intelligence constantly sought physical existence to replace being a shapeless, formless cloud hanging in space, (PROSE: Legacies [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) eventually adopting Walter Simeon as a recurring avatar, speaking in that guise through a large wall-mounted video screen, (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) modelling the Whisper Men on Simeon's appearance, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and appearing as Simeon to James Lethbridge-Stewart and Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).)\n\nWhen not using a living being, the Intelligence maintained a basic manifestation as a three-sided pyramid composed of control spheres (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967).) or ivory. (HOMEVID: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 1995).) When forcibly summoned to Earth by Anne Travers, and being combined with three sets of physical laws in the Great Kingdom, the Intelligence was an emerald tetrahedron and, because of Travers' meddling, was merged with the god Saraquazel. (PROSE: Millennial Rites [+]Craig Hinton, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor commented that the Intelligence was a hive mind, (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) which accounted for the \"mass of thoughts\" theory, (HOMEVID: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 1995).) while the Intelligence claimed itself as an embodiment of information, and Jenny Flint described it as \"a mind without a body\". (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Great Intelligence possessed some amount of artron energy, (PROSE: Millennial Rites [+]Craig Hinton, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).) and could consume the mental energy of humans to grow stronger. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nIn its many attempts to achieve form, the Intelligence tried to manifest as ice people based on the human form, (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) and a slime that glowed brightly with a piercing light. (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967).) It also manifested as a dense fog that consumed anything entering it, (PROSE: Rebellion on Treasure Island [+]Bali Rai, Puffin Classics crossovers (BBC Children's Books, 2023).) and a poisonous fungus which spread through the London Underground. (TV: The Web of Fear [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1968).) A fourth invasion of Earth had it trying to perpetuate itself in every machine and being, with the whole planet cocooned in web. (PROSE: Downtime [+]Marc Platt, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 1995).)\n\nAt the end of its life, the Intelligence had never found substance, but rather used the Whisper Men, who appeared as faceless humanoids dressed just as Walter Simeon was when he died, to manifest in empty bodies. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) The Whisper Men told Clarence DeMarco that they were a manifestation of the Intelligence when they revealed the location of the Doctor's tomb to him.
