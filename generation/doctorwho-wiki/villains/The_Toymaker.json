  "content": "According to the Sixth Doctor, \"nobody [knew]\" who the Toymaker really was. (AUDIO: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009).) Not even the Doctor's TARDIS knew where the Toymaker originated from and what his species was. (PROSE: TARDIS Data File: The Toymaker [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Toymaker was said to be \"old beyond imagining\" and to predate \"Time Lord records\". A team of modern Gallifreyan researchers who attempted to \"chart his path through time\" gave up, bored with all the games he played with his own past. The Doctor speculated that they didn't try any harder than that because they couldn't find a way to control him. (AUDIO: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009).) Indeed, one account showed the Toymaker acknowledging different origins in separate conversations with Adric and the Fifth Doctor, once even altering the details of his story mid-conversation. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nThe Toymaker's family included his sister, Hecuba, who was known as the Queen of Time, (AUDIO: The Queen of Time [+]Brian Hayles and Catherine Harvey, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2013).) and his child, Maestro, who was considered as the essence of music itself. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nAs the Time Lords' data banks on the Toymaker during the Doctor's early life described him only as a vague legend, with some reports implying that there existed several Toymakers rather than just one, (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) the First Doctor saw the Toymaker he encountered as a native to the same universe as himself, and that he had \"lasted\" for \"thousands of years\" by the time of their first encounter. He told Steven Taylor and Dodo Chaplet that \"this Toymaker\" was \"immortal, like all toymakers\", explaining that \"the urge to create toys that are ultimately destructive [was] unfortunately part of [their] universe\", such that the world was metaphorically full of \"destructive toymakers\" like him. (PROSE: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Gerry Davis and Alison Bingeman, adapted from The Celestial Toymaker (Brian Hayles), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1986).)\n\nThough disagreeing on the details, a number of accounts attributed the Toymaker's powers to him being a native of a different universe than the Doctor's own.\n\nWhile facing the Toymaker in Blackpool, the Sixth Doctor came to believe that he had finally cracked the riddle of the Toymaker's origins, deducing that the Toymaker originated in another universe and was \"hurled\" into the Doctor's universe by some kind of \"catastrophe\", believing his theory explained the Toymaker's longevity and immunity to the usual laws of physics. The Toymaker did not confirm or deny the theory, but did corroborate the Doctor's conclusion that he had lived for \"millions of years\", and then told the Doctor that he used his powers to build and assist civilisations for the first few \"thousands of millennia\" he spent in the Doctor's universe until he eventually got bored and only mindless destruction could give him any satisfaction; after an equal length of time spent destroying everything he had previously built up, he discovered games as his final and lasting distraction, as they allowed him to embrace nihilism without falling into inactive apathy, surrendering all to the whims of chance. (AUDIO: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009).)\n\nSome accounts claimed that the Toymaker was the crystal-coloured Guardian of Dreams, counterbalancing the other five Guardians of Time, the most powerful Great Old Ones who had survived from a destroyed universe in which they had been an earlier race of Time Lords. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., The Quantum Archangel [+]Craig Hinton, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) Six Guardians were stated in one account as having been in attendance for the creation of the universe. (PROSE: The Whoniverse [+]George Mann and Justin Richards, BBC Books (2016).) While trying to win Adric to his side, the Toymaker tried to broker comradery with the E-Space native by saying he was also \"from another universe\", having been \"born elsewhere and forced to live out [his] life in a place not [his] own\", until he seemingly changed his story by claiming to be a voluntary exile in the manner of the Doctor, though he specified that he was not a Time Lord. However, this same account also saw the Toymaker identifying himself as a Great Old One and the Guardian of Dreams to the Doctor and Stefan. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nWhen the Sixth Doctor was drawn to Blackpool by the Toymaker, he believed he was detecting the presence of \"the Nexus of the Primeval Cauldron of Space-Time itself\" before he realised that he had been detecting the Toymaker upon coming face-to-face with him, with the Toymaker claiming to be the Space-Time Vortex. (PROSE: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, Target Missing Episodes (Target Books, 1989).)\n\nAccording to the Eighth Doctor, the Toymaker originated in \"the Dark Places\", (COMIC: Endgame [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1996).) with the Twelfth Doctor similarly claiming that the Toymaker was spawned in the chaos before time. (COMIC: Relative Dimensions [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) Likewise, the Seventh Doctor described the Toymaker as an Elder God originating from the Old Times at the beginning of the universe. (AUDIO: The Magic Mousetrap [+]Matthew Sweet, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2009)., Black and White [+]Matt Fitton, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2012).) In fact, one account equated him with the Chinese trickster-god No Cha, depicting him as one of the magical entities from the chaotic \"time before this\" who had survived the Time Lords' imposition of rationality upon the universe. Only when rationality's foothold on the universe lessened, such as during the reign of the Carnival Queen, was the Toymaker able to descend from his realm outside time and space, and interfere in the physical world once again. (PROSE: Christmas on a Rational Planet [+]Lawrence Miles, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).)\n\nIn contrast, one account mentioned the \"chap\" who became \"obsessed with games\" and took to dressing like a Chinese mandarin as a member of one of the elder races from the original palimpsest universe; in this account, this original state of reality before the Great Houses' interference was one of perfect linearity, and it was only after the introduction of time travel to the universe that various members of the elder races went mad and turned their powers to evil or mischief. (PROSE: Mr Saldaamir [+]Lance Parkin, Faction Paradox (BBV Productions, 2021).)\n\nAuteur believed that the being Mortimus had once described as \"a being of vast mental powers, who could build and destroy entire realms with his mind\", had originally been a fellow Archon from the early history of their people, specifically Urizen's game-master. When Urizen and the other early Archons began to plan the anchoring of the universe along the rules of logic, the game-master dissented, wanting to use the rules of play as the organising principle instead. In the moment of anchoring, (PROSE: The Two Auteurs [+]Aristide Twain, The Book of the Snowstorm (Arcbeatle Press, 2023).) although he successfully \"wove\" his \"urge to build destructive toys\" into \"the very fabric of the universe itself\", ensuring his own immortality, (PROSE: The Book of the Snowstorm [+]Aristide Twain, The Book of the Snowstorm (Arcbeatle Press, 2023).) he realised that the other founders' insistence on the rules of logic were diluting his own vision. As a result, still infused with the power of the caldera, he \"packed his bag and stomped off to the cosmic basement to make his own universe\". He was subsequently forgotten, with the records of his existence becoming \"muddled up, just how he like[d] them\". (PROSE: The Two Auteurs [+]Aristide Twain, The Book of the Snowstorm (Arcbeatle Press, 2023).)\n\nIn an account that saw him aligned with the Pantheon of Discord, (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) the Fourteenth Doctor described the Toymaker as an \"elemental force\" like order and chaos, but one that embodied the force of \"play\" and existed \"beyond the rules of the universe\" with \"the power of a god\", and suggested that he originated outside the universe, describing the Toymaker's domain as \"a hollow beneath the Under-Universe\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) The Fifteenth Doctor likewised described the Toymaker as a \"living game\", indicating that the elemental nature of the Toymaker was as a manifestation of games themselves, (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) with Harriet Arbinger also calling the Toymaker the \"God of Games\". (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) In this account, the Toymaker and the Doctor both suggested that the Toymaker had never properly \"entered\" the Doctor's universe before the Giggle. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAccording to the First Doctor, the Toymaker succeeded in creating a universe of \"entirely in his own vision\" called the Celestial Toyroom, where he would \"manipulate people and turn them into his playthings\". The Toymaker and his games became \"notorious throughout the universe\" as he spread his influence to attract people into his world and try to make them part of it. (PROSE: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Gerry Davis and Alison Bingeman, adapted from The Celestial Toymaker (Brian Hayles), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1986).)\n\nOut of boredom, (COMIC: The Greatest Gamble [+]John Peel, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1981).) the Toymaker began spending centuries of his time wandering the Earth and sampling its various games, (PROSE: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, Target Missing Episodes (Target Books, 1989).) frequently challenging humans from across history. He lured people from a variety of cultures to the Toyroom, turning them into toys when they lost his games. (COMIC: The Greatest Gamble [+]John Peel, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1981).)\n\nWhile the Toymaker was in a dormant and disembodied state, the First Doctor, Rallon and Millennia arrived in the Toyroom in a stolen TARDIS to investigate the legend of the Toymaker. After he managed to possess Rallon, the Toymaker made Millennia one of his living toys, with the Doctor able to best him with the help of the Dymova. Knowing that he would become an even more worthy opponent given time to mature, the Toymaker allowed the Doctor to leave the Toyroom. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nWhen initially meeting what their old \"handsome\" school-mate had become, Auteur did not actually realise that he had merged with the ancient being of the same name, believing him to have simply taken on a renegade's title as several other members of their generation had done. At that time, having become \"sole supplier of toys to all of Fairyland\", he was calling himself \"the Wonderful Toymaker\" and claiming to himself be a fairy. The next time he and Auteur met prior to Auteur's twelfth regeneration, he had started claiming to be a Great Old One, (PROSE: The Two Auteurs [+]Aristide Twain, The Book of the Snowstorm (Arcbeatle Press, 2023).) as he would still maintain when meeting the Sixth Doctor. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) The Goddess of Gendar, Auteur's twelfth incarnation, found both claims ridiculous. However, she was later told by her future self about the relationship between the \"old egomaniac needy game-player, and [the] young egomaniac needy game-player\". According to the future Auteur, it had not been a straightforward possession; in fact, the two elementals had merged outright, leaving \"just the one schizoid liar\"; as Auteur put it, \"Pinocchio [had] become Gepetto\". (PROSE: The Two Auteurs [+]Aristide Twain, The Book of the Snowstorm (Arcbeatle Press, 2023).)\n\nIndeed, although Rallon's individuality would later reassert itself in full — much to the distress of what remained the original \"pure\" Toymaker — their consciousnesses had substantially merged, with the Toymaker's personality and behaviour being influenced by Rallon's own. His servant Stefan would go on to observe broad aspects of the Toymaker's personality which were actually part of Rallon's, including \"a sense of morality, of good and evil\"; without him the Toymaker was \"cold and harsh\". (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nOn one of many occasions when he tricked game-players from across human history into playing games with him, the Toymaker lured a professional gambler from the Old West named Gaylord Lefevre from his steamboat in the Mississippi, challenging him to a game of cards. After Gaylord attempted to mark the cards to \"even the score\" when his luck began to sour, the Toymaker proclaimed that the game was forfeit and transformed him into one of his many toys after playing along briefly to his cheating attempt. The Toymaker later challenged a Roman soldier, leading him past the toy version of Gaylord. (COMIC: The Greatest Gamble [+]John Peel, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1981).)\n\nThe Toymaker would have further encounters with the Doctor, becoming familiar with his quirks and how his personality was \"so insatiably curious\", (TV: \"The Celestial Toyroom\" [+]Part of The Celestial Toymaker, Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) with the Doctor also learning more about the Toyroom. (TV: \"The Hall of Dolls\" [+]Part of The Celestial Toymaker, Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nIn the 18th century, Hsen Ling told stories of his own abduction by the trickster-god No Cha, who he beat in an unearthly game of cards. (PROSE: Christmas on a Rational Planet [+]Lawrence Miles, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) Mortimus also had an encounter with the Toymaker, with the Toymaker coming to like him. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nThe Toymaker drew the Doctor back into the Toyroom again, with the goal that he would \"stay long enough for a game\", but the Doctor was able to leave the Toyroom with \"hardly [any] time to turn around\". (TV: \"The Celestial Toyroom\" [+]Part of The Celestial Toymaker, Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nAfter compiling a list of games to play, (PROSE: The Traveller From Beyond Time [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013). Page 21.) the Toymaker drew the Doctor's TARDIS to his realm, so he could make the Doctor play the Trilogic Game against him, while his companions, Steven Taylor and Dodo Chaplet, were used as his players, but the Toymaker arranged things so that the Toyroom would vanish completely at their moment of victory, leaving him the only survivor and the Doctor and his companions his subjects forever. (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) However, Rallon was able to keep the Toymaker's powers in check and ensured that he abided by the rules of his games to help the Doctor to escape. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) The Doctor soon outwitted the Toymaker again and escaped, leaving his realm in chaos, and the Doctor believing that the Toyroom no longer existed, (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) but the Toymaker later stated that he had actually been banished to the ether for millennia after his defeat. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1996).)\n\nHaving been banished to the ether in his defeat, the Toymaker spent millennia searching for a way to best the Doctor, eventually finding that the Imagineum would be able to create a version of the Doctor under his bidding that was more powerful than the original. As the Imagineum had been in a spacecraft that crashed on Earth and looted by the Knights Templar, the Toymaker played and won a game of canasta with a descendant of the Templar living in the 1990s named Marwood, placing him under his bidding and the Imagineum in his possession. However, Marwood's adjutant, Felix, stole a component of the Imagineum called the Focus, and entrusted it with Maxwell Edison and Izzy Sinclair, before he was killed by Marwood in a mirror version of Stockbridge the Toymaker made, while keeping the real village in a Macro-Dimensional Linkage Device that resembled a snowglobe.\n\nWhen the Eighth Doctor arrived in the fake Stockbridge, the Toymaker confronted him when he, Max and Izzy tried to retreat to his TARDIS. While the Doctor and Izzy were able to escape from his clutches, Max was captured, and taken to the Macro-Dimensional Linkage Device that the Toymaker had sealed the real Stockbridge in. When the Doctor and Izzy mounted a rescue from the Toyroom, the Toymaker had Marwood and his dolls capture them, and forced them to play games of snakes and ladders and hangman before the Toymaker unveiled his possession of the Imagineum. The Toymaker placed Izzy and Max in a game of mousetrap and created his duplicate of the Doctor, placing them in a game of gladiatorial chess.\n\nDespite his duplicate being physically superior to him, the Doctor was able to convince his duplicate not to fight by explaining that he was merely just another one of the Toymaker's playthings. After seeing the Toymaker murder Marwood after growing bored of him, the duplicate of the Doctor was left with no doubt that he too would eventually befall the same fate, so he turned on the Toymaker, going to kill him, but the Doctor instead used the Imaginuem to create a duplicate of the Toymaker, sending him and his duplicate to compete in a perpetual stalemate in the Dark Places where the Toymaker originated. As the Toyroom began to dissipate, the Doctor, Izzy, and Max fled, while the Doctor's duplicate remained so he could destroy the Imagineum, and the Doctor restored Stockbridge after Max took the \"snowglobe\" with him from the Toyroom. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1996).)\n\nCalling himself \"the Mandarin\", he began tracking someone he referred to only as \"the Entity\" through the Arabian plains, intending to challenge him to a game, but was unable to as the Entity was \"hurled\" into a non-world, and so he had to travel to the non-world to challenge him there instead. After agreeing on the stakes — the Mandarin would relinquish his body to the Entity if he lost or the Entity would become the Mandarin's toy if he were to lose instead — the Entity chose four dimensional chess as the game of choice. After playing for an unknowable duration of time, the advantage swaying between them, the Mandarin realised, towards the endgame, that he was going to lose, so, for the first time, he was able to comprehend the concept of a stalemate. After such an event happened, the Entity demanded a rematch, but the Mandarin declined, explaining they were equally matched, rendering a rematch pointless, and thus left the non-world, thanking the Entity for teaching him that \"perhaps winning [wasn't] everything after all.\" (PROSE: Games [+]Warwick Gray, Brief Encounters (Marvel Comics UK, 1992).)\n\n\"Stirred up\" by Fenric as part of a game among the Elder Gods, (AUDIO: Gods and Monsters [+]Mike Maddox and Alan Barnes, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2012).) the Toymaker lured several people into his domain, including the Seventh Doctor and his companions Ace and Hex. Working under the Doctor's leadership, the group of victims were apparently successful in defeating the Toymaker and imprisoning his essence in a doll. Each of them ate a piece of the doll, dividing the Toymaker so that he would no longer be capable of using his powers. The Doctor concocted an elaborate plan to keep control over the fragments of the Toymaker in the minds of each member of the group until the Toymaker withered away forever. As this plan involved the Doctor forgetting having made the plan in the first place, he wound up short-circuiting it. In the end, it was revealed that the Toymaker had been in control all along, allowing himself to be absorbed into humanity so that he could \"feel what it was like to lose\". Finally, one of the people involved, the chess master Swapnil Khan, managed to trap the Toymaker in a seemingly-perpetual stalemate in his own dimension, but not before the Toymaker had reduced everyone except the Doctor, Ace, Hex, and Khan's daughter, Queenie Glasscock, to wooden dolls. (AUDIO: The Magic Mousetrap [+]Matthew Sweet, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2009).)\n\nThe Toymaker attempted to persuade a victim to play the Trilogic Game, while speaking about his toys and their sadness, as he toyed with the Tenth Doctor, the TARDIS, a Cybusman, an Adipose, and some Bronze Daleks. (POEM: The Toymaker [+]James Goss, Now We Are Six Hundred (Harper Design, 2017). Pages 32-33.)\n\nWhen the Toyroom began to break down due its ancient age, the Toymaker feared that he would be \"loose in a wild, unforgiving universe\", thus luring the Twelfth Doctor and Clara Oswald on the pretence of a party hosted by Susan, wanting to steal the Doctor's TARDIS to keep the Toyroom contained. After the toy replicas of some of the Doctor's previous companions failed to capture him, the Toymaker flew a toy biplane towards him and Clara, but, as the Toymaker's power over the Toyroom was waning, the Doctor was able to take some control, causing the biplane to crash by hitting it with a giant bauble.\n\nThe Doctor and the Toymaker then battled with toy armies until the Doctor realised they were equally matched, deciding to propose a game of Truth or Dare, during which the Toymaker revealed his fears about the Toyroom's collapse and, thinking he was outsmarting the Doctor, dared him to give the TARDIS to him, which the Doctor did. As the TARDIS materialised around the Toyroom, the Doctor and Clara travelled to the control room, rebuilding the Toyroom with the Zero Room and ejecting it into space, where the Toymaker could play in solitude. (COMIC: Relative Dimensions [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nWhen the Toymaker discovered that Rallon's body was dying after centuries of existence, he set out to ensnare the Doctor again and hatched a complex plot to turn his companions against him and absorb the Fifth Doctor as a new host, but was thwarted when Rallon forced himself to undergo multiple regenerations consecutively, with the trauma expelling the Toymaker from his body. A projection of Rallon's potential future self then merged with the Toymaker to ensure that his full powers continued to be kept under control. While waiting for his Toyroom to repair itself, the Toymaker decided to take his servant Stefan to Earth to seek amusement, deciding to go to Blackpool from an idea he had seen in Tegan Jovanka's mind. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nBy one account, although the Toymaker had meaningfully regenerated, in a way which altered his personality, he kept the same face as before, (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) wich tallied with one account of the Sixth Doctor's encounter with the Toymaker in Blackpool, (PROSE: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, Target Missing Episodes (Target Books, 1989).) while another, otherwise-similar account of the Blackpool event showed that the Toymaker had adopted a different physical appearance and voice altogether, (AUDIO: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009).) which he would retain during an encounter with the Eighth Doctor. (AUDIO: Solitaire [+]John Dorney, The Companion Chronicles (2010).)\n\nThe Toymaker began operating in late 20th-century Blackpool, indulging in the same impulse that had led to his wanderings. Using the Space Mountain thrill-ride as his base-of-operations, he instructed Stefan, as well as Yatsumoto and others, to begin the development of arcade cabinets with video games that killed the players that failed with an electronic monster projected from the video screen. The Toymaker goaded the Sixth Doctor and Peri Brown into a series of traps and games while they were on holiday in Blackpool. However, when the Doctor recognised his infinite loneliness, the Toymaker was agitated enough to cheat the Doctor of his game and use the video game's murderous monster to kill him, but he was thwarted by the combined intervention of Peri and his other surviving prisoners. To ensure his video games could never be released to harm the people of Earth, the Doctor turned one of the neural relays the Toymaker had built to passively redirect his telekinetic energy against its creator, using it to trap the Toymaker in an endless mental time loop sustained by his own mental energy. The Doctor believed that the Toymaker could not escape from such a fate until his body finally died of old age after uncountable millions of years. (AUDIO: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009).)\n\nThe Toymaker later captured the Doctor's TARDIS and took it to his Toyshop, where he transformed the Eighth Doctor into a puppet and the Doctor's companion, Charley Pollard, was forced to take part in his riddle, but was tricked by the Toyshop, which shrunk to 0% of its original size and the body the Toymaker was using was destroyed within it. The Toymaker swore that when his new body had formed, he would take his revenge upon the Doctor and Charley, who had escaped before the Toyshop's destruction. (AUDIO: Solitaire [+]John Dorney, The Companion Chronicles (2010).)\n\nAfter the Fourteenth Doctor called upon the superstition of salt warding off evil to hold back the Not-things while at the edge of the universe, where \"the walls [were] thin\", (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) the fact that he had \"played a game\" resulted in the Toymaker being \"let in\", entering the Doctor's universe with \"delight\".\n\nRunning amok, the Toymaker played games with players across the universe, including the Guardians of Time and Space, whom he turned into voodoo dolls, and \"God\", whom he turned into a jack-in-the-box. He would go on to claim to have \"made a jigsaw out of [the Doctor's] history\", a claim which shocked the Fourteenth Doctor, (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) who was still distraught over what he had learned about apparently being the Timeless Child. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He encountered the Spy Master, who was \"dying\", (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) his body \"failing\" due his botched plan to hijack the Doctor's body through a forced regeneration. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) The Master \"begged for his life with one final game\", but he lost, whereupon the Toymaker imprisoned him inside his gold tooth \"for all eternity\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) The only being the Toymaker avoided playing against was Sutekh, (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) who was waiting on the Doctor's TARDIS for the right time to enact his revenge plot, (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and the Toymaker elected to just run away from him. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Toymaker settled on Earth due to believing it and humanity were the \"ultimate playground\". In 1925, he set up a toy store and manipulated events which resulted in one of his dolls, Stooky Bill, becoming the first image viewed on a television screen. He also trapped Charles Banerjee in his domain after the latter lost a game with him, turning him partially into a doll. The Toymaker animated and immortalised the sound of Stooky Bill's laugh to spread insanity in the 21st century, as by then technology and communication had reached a point where the Giggle of Stooky Bill could be heard subliminally across all screens across the planet.\n\nThe Toymaker soon met the Fourteenth Doctor and Donna Noble, luring them into his domain. He taunted the Doctor with the number of people who had died because of him over the years, which enraged the Doctor enough to challenge him to a game of Cut with his personal cards. The Toymaker won, however, he was stopped from claiming his prize when the Doctor pointed out that, as he had beaten the Toymaker once before, this only counted as one-all in a best of three match. The Toymaker then swiftly disappeared to 2023, crumpling his toyshop into a box, with the Doctor and Donna in hot pursuit. As he danced in the streets of 2023 London, enjoying the chaos the Giggle had unleashed, the Toymaker briefly crossed paths with early versions of the Doctor and Donna, but they failed to recognise him as he watched them be taken to the local UNIT HQ.\n\nThe Toymaker soon arrived at UNIT HQ, entirely unthreatened by UNIT as he danced and lip-synced whilst slaughtering anybody who attempted to stop him. He took control of the galvanic beam UNIT had used to destroy the satellite broadcasting the Giggle, and fired on the Doctor and his friends. When the Doctor attempted to persuade him to leave Earth and take his games elsewhere, the Toymaker refused, and then shot the Doctor with the beam, stating that the rules of the game state that he should play the final round with the next Doctor. The Toymaker watched in glee as the Doctor began to regenerate, but was dumbfounded when he instead bi-generated.\n\nAfter causing the Fourteenth Doctor's bi-generation, the Toymaker engaged in an intense game of catch with the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Doctors. Finally, the Toymaker failed to catch a throw from the Fifteenth Doctor, and he was defeated. As his prize, the Fourteenth Doctor banished the Toymaker from existence forever. The Toymaker folded up into a suit that was contained in the box that had been his toyshop after Mel Bush pushed at him. As he was trapped, the Toymaker warned that \"[his] legions [we]re coming.\" Kate Lethbridge-Stewart took the box and ordered it to be taken to the deepest vault and bound in salt, (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) while the Toymaker awaited within to start his next game. (PROSE: The Giggle [+]James Goss, adapted from The Giggle (Russell T Davies), 60th Anniversary Novels (Target Books, 2023).) The Toymaker's domain lingered for a short time afterwards, which allowed the Fifteenth Doctor to cause a bi-generation of the TARDIS itself by claiming it as his own prize for defeating the Toymaker. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Elders, recording the First Doctor's voyages using their instruments and charts, included how the Celestial Toymaker showed the Doctor how gods were most dangerous when they were bored. (PROSE: The Traveller From Beyond Time [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013). Pages 20-21.)\n\nOn Siralos, the Tremas Master used \"what was once the Celestial Toymaker's favourite toy\" to trap the Graak. (GAME: Destiny of the Doctors [+]Hannah Redler, Gary Russell, Terrance Dicks and Andy Russell, BBC Multimedia (1997).)\n\nDuring the Eighth Doctor's supposed regeneration into a new incarnation, (COMIC: The Final Chapter [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1998).) secretly the shapeshifting construct Shayde who had switched places with the real Doctor, (COMIC: Wormwood [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1998).) an image of the Celestial Toymaker was seen. (COMIC: The Final Chapter [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1998).)\n\nUpon Izzy's return to Stockbridge on 19 December 1996, her adoptive parents asked her about her day and she reminisced to herself about her adventures with the Doctor, including her battle with the Toymaker. (COMIC: Oblivion [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 2002-2003).)\n\nIn mid-December 2008, upon being reunited with Maxwell Edison in Stockbridge, the Tenth Doctor reminisced about several of his adventures with Max, including how they defeated the Celestial Toymaker together. (COMIC: The Stockbridge Child [+]Dan McDaid, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2008-2009). Page 24.)\n\nWhen the Trylonians attempted to use their Brain Drain machine on the Eleventh Doctor to gain intel on his many enemies, the Celestial Toymaker was one of the individuals in the resulting mental projection who asked the Doctor for his help. (COMIC: The Birthday Boy [+]Matthew Dow Smith, 50th Anniversary Blu-ray Special (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nWhile trapping the Thirteenth Doctor aboard his space platform, Zellin told the Doctor that her dimension was like a board game for him of which \"the Toymaker would approve\". (TV: Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor, after he and Ruby Sunday escaped from the Goblin ship, explained to her how the arrival of the Goblins was part of the Toymaker's legacy, as they were part of the legions he brought with him into the universe. (PROSE: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, adapted from The Church on Ruby Road (Russell T Davies), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2024). Chapter Thirteen; Page 100.) When visiting 1963, the Fifteenth Doctor encountered Maestro, a elemental force of music claiming to be a descendent from the Toymaker. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\nLux Imperator later referred to the Doctor as the \" the enemy of the toymaker .\" (TV: Lux [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nIn Earth-33⅓, the Celestial Toymaker was a Doctor Who villain. Early in his career, he received an influential birthday present in the form of a Paul Daniel's Magic Set, which he liked to an extent. (COMIC: Doctor Who? 196 [+]Tim Quinn, Doctor Who? (Marvel Comics, 1993).)\n\nIn one of the infinite parallel universes of \"possible space\", (COMIC: Fire and Brimstone [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1997).) the Doctor once encountered \"the Toymaker\", described as an \"evil force dominating a fantasy world\", in 2525. Barusa later discovered that the Toymaker was actually under the control of the Master. (PROSE: The Chronicles of Doctor Who? [+]John Leekley, Doctor Who: Regeneration (HarperCollins Publishers, 2000).)\n\nAs the Toymaker was immortal, he would otherwise be incredibly bored if it weren't for his games. (COMIC: The Greatest Gamble [+]John Peel, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1981). Page 41.; PROSE: The Traveller From Beyond Time [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013). Page 21.) He lived for \"times of chance\", when both his skill and fortune were challenged, as it made eternity bearable. (PROSE: Games [+]Warwick Gray, Brief Encounters (Marvel Comics UK, 1992). Page 22.) By one account, as he was isolated for so long, he had become insane; (PROSE: Doctor Who Character Encyclopedia: Updated Edition [+]Jason Loborik, Annabel Gibson, Moray Laing and Emma Grange, Doctor Who Character Encyclopedias (Dorling Kindersley, 2014). Page 35.) indeed, the Twelfth Doctor was aware that people believed the Toymaker was insane, expressing that they were probably correct. (COMIC: Relative Dimensions [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) According to the Sixth Doctor, games were the Toymaker's \"meat and drink\". (PROSE: Trick or Treat [+]Jacqueline Rayner, Tales of Terror (Puffin Books, 2017). Page 91.) Holding that \"good\" and \"bad\" were \"nothing\" to a being of his scale, the Toymaker lived by the mantra that \"all that exist[ed] [was] to win or to lose\", (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) losing all mirth if someone, even one of his servants, tried to plead or cheat their way out of suffering the consequences of \"losing\", (AUDIO: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009).) though he himself was not averse to trying to talk his way out of a fair loss. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) His child, Maestro, described him as \"tough\" and \"mean\", claiming that he was \"very bad\" to them. They even expressed that they \"should thank\" the Doctor for trapping him. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nSeveral accounts showed that he had developed a particular affection for Earth and humanity due to their interest in games, (AUDIO: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009).; TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) once declaring that he had \"fallen in love with humanity\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) The Sixth Doctor believed that he had a specific \"interest in matters Eastern\", accounting for his habit of dressing up as a Chinese mandarin, (AUDIO: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009).) although another account suggested that the Toymaker made a habit of dressing up in outlandish costumes on a whim, occasionally playing up stereotypes associated with the costume he had appropriated to a cartoonish degree, such as fliting between various fake accents. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Toymaker once described himself as the \"pan-dimensional\" equivalent of Walt Disney, Charles Darrow, and Hiroshi Yamauchi. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) The First Doctor berated him for his \"childish behaviour\", (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) and he was prone to flitting rapidly between moods and ideas as the whim took him. (AUDIO: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009).; TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Occasionally the Toymaker would show a more serious side, such as how he seemed truly disturbed by the notion of facing the \"One Who Waits\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThough \"wily\" (COMIC: The Greatest Gamble [+]John Peel, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1981). Page 41.) he denied that he would cheat in his games, seeming genuinely offended by the suggestion. While the Fourteenth Doctor confirmed it was \"the one thing he won't do\" as \"the rules of the game\" were the only rules he would follow, the Toymaker would try to work outside the rules, such as trying to best the Doctor in a game of catch by throwing the ball without warning to catch the Doctor off-guard. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) By the time of his encounter with the Fifth Doctor, he took a dim view of the way the First Doctor tricked his way out of the Trilogic Game, lightly chiding the Doctor for cheating — though not so dim as to try to invalidate the outcome of that game. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) However, the Toymaker did not object to others cheating on his behalf, showing awareness of Cyril's willingness to cheat when deploying him against Dodo and Steven. (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nThe Toymaker also only wanted the Doctor's help if he could best him in a game, seemingly too proud to ask him directly. According to this account, the Toymaker was deathly afraid of the universe and could barely conceive the idea of being forced to leave the Toyroom. (COMIC: Relative Dimensions [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) However, other accounts indicated he visited the outside universe without such fear. (COMIC: The Greatest Gamble [+]John Peel, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1981).; PROSE: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, Target Missing Episodes (Target Books, 1989).)\n\nWithin the Celestial Toyroom, the Toymaker commanded immense powers, but they were limited by the rules he or his opponents set for any particular game. (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) The Fourteenth Doctor stated the Toymaker was bound by the rules, so much so that he could not cheat to win, even if he wanted to. He also had to follow new rules he brought into the game, even if the new rule did not gain him the result he was expecting, like how his desire to face the Fifteenth Doctor accidentally meant he also had to face the Fourteenth Doctor at the same time. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) The Toymaker's pawns, such as Joey and Cyril, had no such limitation, however. (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) The Toymaker was also not above cheating if his opponent did so first; on one occasion, he tauntingly claimed that he was just following a \"new rule\" his opponent had unwittingly introduced by cheating. (COMIC: The Greatest Gamble [+]John Peel, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1981). Page 42.)\n\nThe Toymaker was immortal and invulnerable, and appeared capable of space and time travel at will. (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) The Toymaker could control the gravity of the Toyroom (COMIC: The Greatest Gamble [+]John Peel, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1981). Page 42.) was able to fly, (COMIC: Relative Dimensions [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) animate toys and render people invisible, (PROSE: Doctor Who Character Encyclopedia: Updated Edition [+]Jason Loborik, Annabel Gibson, Moray Laing and Emma Grange, Doctor Who Character Encyclopedias (Dorling Kindersley, 2014). Page 35.) and teleport across space and time. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He seemed to be able to travel from the Toyroom to other locations, and back, with ease. (COMIC: The Greatest Gamble [+]John Peel, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1981).; PROSE: Games [+]Warwick Gray, Brief Encounters (Marvel Comics UK, 1992). Page 22.) Further more, he could change his clothes exceptionally fast, changing outfits when teleporting. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nDuring the course of a game, the Toymaker would gain total control over his player's lives and personalities, perpetually, if they lost the game or died outright. (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) Apart from these children's games, the Toymaker sometimes played in person against his \"guests\", playing games such as cards, able to conjure his own deck and his own juggling balls. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) The Toymaker would be aware if his opponent cheated and would reverse their actions before declaring the game forfeit and would have to pay a hefty price: becoming another one of his many toys within the Toyroom. (COMIC: The Greatest Gamble [+]John Peel, DWM backup comic stories (Marvel Comics, 1981).) The Toymaker also threatened the Doctors with \"[his] legions\", who would supposedly come for him after he was beaten in a game of catch by the Doctors. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nHe could manipulate reality at will, having been seen to convert ammunition into rose petals and humanoids into balls, puppets, and dolls. However, if he lost a game, his powers to control reality were briefly granted to the opponent who beat him, meaning the winner could grant themselves a prize. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) This meant the First Doctor used his powers to destroy the Toymaker's domain, (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) the Fourteenth Doctor outright banished him from existence and the Fifteenth Doctor granted himself a new version of his TARDIS so he could travel and enable the Fourteenth Doctor to retire concurrently in the same timeline. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAccording to one account, before his first match with the Doctor, the Toymaker possessed countless less malleable bodies, which wore out quickly under the strain. After three members of the Deca stumbled into his domain, he merged with the Time Lord Rallon. After stabilising in Rallon's body, the Toymaker was able to transform at will into other appearances. When he first greeted the First Doctor, he had taken the appearance of a red dragon, appearing as \"a scaly, reptilian creature on four stumpy legs\", \"flame red all over\" with \"a big wide mouth, a scaly mane\", \"huge rolling eyes\", and \"a wisp of smoke curled out through one nostril\". He then revealed his humanoid appearance, dressed in the later-typical Chinese outfit. Notwithstanding when he was calling on his full power, when his head would blur into a starry \"ball of energy\", he initially had the face of the incarnation of Rallon with whom he had merged, handsome and youthful with olive skin and dark hair. However, after making the situation clear to the Doctor, he decided to alter it to better match his personality.\n\nThis new face was \"lined, but seemingly through years of smiling rather than age\" and \"not unpleasant\" — (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) the same form he wore during his encounter with the First Doctor, Steven Taylor and Dodo Chaplet. (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) This definitive Toymaker was a tall and imposing man with deep-set, glittering eyes. (PROSE: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Gerry Davis and Alison Bingeman, adapted from The Celestial Toymaker (Brian Hayles), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1986).) He dressed as a Chinese mandarin, wearing a round black hat with gold thread and a silver, red and blue collar over a dragon-patterned black robe encrusted with rubies, emeralds, diamonds and pearls. Within the accounts of this particular encounter, the Toymaker was dressed in the theatrical Chinese outfit in the context of being the Doctor's opponent in the Trilogic Game, much as his other living toys changed their outfits to match the theme of a given game. (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nAfter Rallon managed to separate himself from the Toymaker, the Toymaker merged with the Observer, Rallon's semi-independent Watcher, allowing him to effectively regenerate into a new physical body to replace Rallon's original one, with Rallon's mind no longer part of him, though his new body's personality would be influenced by the personality of Rallon's possible incarnations. The Fifth Doctor expected that the Toymaker would \"look the same\" despite the minor changes in demeanour; (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) by one account, he was proved correct when the Sixth Doctor met the Toymaker in Blackpool, with him still possessing the same \"aristocratic before\". (PROSE: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, Target Missing Episodes (Target Books, 1989).) Another telling of the same encounter, however, depicted the Toymaker as now having a distinctly different voice and appearance, with a greying beard and soulful, melancholy eyes. (AUDIO: The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009).)\n\nIn the form encountered by the Fourteenth Doctor, the Toymaker appeared as a blond man. He wore a number of different outfits based on his whims and the current situation, such as wearing a black top hat, tailcoat and trousers with an alabaster bow tie and waistcoat as well as a plain white shirt when he danced in the streets of 21st century London. His outfit as a shop proprietor in 1925 was made up of a caramel brown leather apron, a single-breasted waistcoat of plum and sapphire tartan with a fob watch, a white and ebony pinstripe shirt, tan trousers, and white and brown spectator shoes. He also wore a shako and frock coat in scarlet and ivory with gold trims, beige breeches and ebony black boots with crimson laces when he terrorized UNIT, and then a black leather jacket with a khaki uniform and an ivory scarf as well as goggles when he took control of the galvanic beam. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAccording to Donald Tosh, the commissioning script editor and (uncredited) co-author of The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., the intention was that the Toymaker was, like the Monk who had predated him, a member of the Doctor's own race. (BBC DVD: The Time Meddler [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) In the novelisation of The Celestial Toymaker, which was based in part on concepts for the original TV story which had to be abandoned due to a rushed production, the Doctor describes the Celestial Toymaker as native to the universe and several thousands of years old. Additionally, the Toymaker wields a sapphire ring reminiscent of the Doctor's signet ring, which he uses when altering elements of his realm, such as shrinking toys to human size or making a wall vanish.\n\nDivided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., a novel by Gary Russell, retconned the Toymaker into being a Great Old One and Guardian of Time, a notion originating in Craig Hinton's extensive cosmology of the Doctor Who universe. However, it followed Hinton's notion that the Guardians, like the other Great Old Ones, were survivors of an \"earlier race of Time Lords\", having been the \"upper echelons\" of the Time Lords who ruled the previous universe.\n\nNotes explaining Hinton's view of the matter were written as part of the preparatory work for The Quantum Archangel [+]Craig Hinton, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001)., and later printed in the charity anthology Shelf Life. Therein, the Crystal Guardian, dubbed \"the Guardian of Thought in Time, the Guardian of Dreams, He Who Walks in Dreams\", was stated to have been the Keeper of the Matrix in his former life. Hinton also explained that in his theory:\n\nDivided Loyalties also claimed at that during the events of The Celestial Toymaker, the Toymaker was inhabiting the body of a conventional Time Lord, the Doctor's former classmate Rallon.\n\nIn the behind-the-scenes features for Big Finish Productions' version of The Nightmare Fair [+]Graham Williams, adapted from The Nightmare Fair, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2009)., John Ainsworth, who adapted Graham Williams's script, reflected:\n\nThe audio story Faustian [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW. later described the Time Lords as \"a celestial race\". Subsequently, \"Celestials\" was cited in the short stories The Cactus and the Corpse [+]Aristide Twain, Horrors of Arcbeatle (Auteur, Coloth, Arcbeatle Press, 2023)., The Two Auteurs [+]Aristide Twain, The Book of the Snowstorm (Arcbeatle Press, 2023). and Presents [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW. as an alias for the species.\n\nEventually, two stories in the Coloth anthology The Book of the Snowstorm, The Two Auteurs [+]Aristide Twain, The Book of the Snowstorm (Arcbeatle Press, 2023). and the eponymous linking story, suggested that the original Toymaker had indeed been an ancient Archon, specifically Urizen's game-master; he is suggested to have participated in the anchoring of the thread, thus implicitly equating his connection in The Nightmare Fair to \"the Primeval Cauldron of Space-Time itself\" with the power of Faction Paradox's caldera, the centre of the Web of Time created by the anchoring. His role in the anchoring was suggested to be the reason behind the First Doctor's claim in the Celestial Toymaker novelisation that \"the urge to create toys that are ultimately destructive is unfortunately part of [his] universe\".\n\nAs it did not have the license to the character of the Toymaker, the character did not actually appear in person in The Book of the Snowstorm, and he was not referenced directly by name. Instead, Book connected Urizen's game-master to the Toymaker indirectly by tying back to Mortimus's description of the Toymaker in Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999). — Mortimus being a character to whom Book did have the license. One line in The Two Auteurs also equated him with the public-domain character of the Wonderful Toymaker, a benevolent fairy character in the Victorian children's book All the Way to Fairyland, though claiming that he was not actually a fairy and that both this and the Divided Loyalties claim of being a Great Old One were frivolous lies on his part.",
