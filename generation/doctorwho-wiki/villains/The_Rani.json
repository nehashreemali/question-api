  "content": "The Rani was, regardless of incarnation, a brilliant scientific genius whose villainy came not from the usual variety of lust for power and suchlike, but from a mindset that treated everything (including morality) as secondary to her research. As Mel would state, she viewed the whole universe as nothing but an experiment. She was highly intelligent but extremely arrogant, narcissistic, ruthless, powerful and intensely cruel.\n\nThe First Rani was a cruel woman whose evil deeds and notoriety had made her the second most wanted criminal in the galaxy, after the Master. (AUDIO: Requiem for the Rocket Men) Much like the Doctor, she had a considerable presence on Earth. This presence, however, rested not in a fondness for the planet but as a focal point for her research projects. (TV: The Mark of the Rani, Time and the Rani)\n\nJust as amoral as her previous incarnation, the Second Rani always believed that the end always justified the means. Not above making jokes at the expense of others, she held a great disdain and disinterest in the Doctor's antics. Unlike her previous incarnation, she had a certain level of anxiety in breaking the Laws of Time. (AUDIO: The Rani Elite)\n\nFollowing the end of the Last Great Time War, the Ninth Doctor believed all the Time Lords bar himself to be dead, (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and so did not expect to see the Rani again, (AUDIO: Flatpack) though the Tenth Doctor would encounter the First Rani. (COMIC: Untitled) Nevertheless, the Eleventh Doctor believed that the Rani was \"dead\", at least according to River Song. (AUDIO: The Bekdel Test)\n\nDespite the Spy Master seemingly wiping out all of the Time Lords, (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).), an incarnation of the Rani survived, (TV: The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) supposedly the last living Time Lady. (TV: Wish World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) Constructing the persona of Mrs Flood to search for the Doctor, (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) she was a neighbour of the Fifteenth Doctor's companions Ruby Sunday (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., 73 Yards [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and Belinda Chandra. (TV: The Robot Revolution [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025)., The Story & the Engine [+]Inua Ellams, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) Following the defeat of Sutekh, (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) Mrs Flood took to stalking the Doctor and Belinda in their travels through time and space. (TV: Lux [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025)., The Well [+]Russell T Davies and Sharma Angel-Walfall, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025)., Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) Eventually, she was fatally injured in 2925 on the space station Harmony Arena and bi-generated into a new incarnation. (TV: The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) Although her new incarnation was consumed by Omega, this incarnation of the Rani survived and used a Time Ring to escape. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe next Rani was a younger bossier incarnation than Mrs Flood who was determined to bring \"absolute terror\" to the Doctor (TV: The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) and release Omega to save the Time Lords. (TV: Wish World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) She was later consumed by Omega after successfully releasing him. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nIn the War in Heaven, the Lord President reintegrated several barely-reformed renegades into Gallifreyan society. One former renegade Time Lady, who was known for her engineered creatures, became a tutor to newly-loomed soldiers. Holsred remembered a lecture in which she connected an artron energy generator to a white rat's brain and then let the rat use the energy to kill a hungry Gallifreyan cat. (PROSE: The Taking of Planet 5)\n\nFather Kreiner had the heads of the Rani and the Master as trophies; however, at least one of them was a clone created in the High Council's hatchling projects. (PROSE: Interference)\n\nAccording to the Seventh Doctor, the Rani was \"up to her old tricks\" during his last adventure with Ace. (TV: The Curse of Fenric)\n\nFollowing her last live-action appearance in the controversial TV special, Dimensions in Time, the possibility of the return of the Rani in the post-2005 revival of Doctor Who has become a subject of widespread fan speculation, as the preeminent renegade Time Lord antagonist in the \"classic\" series aside from the Master, who made his return in Series 3. The matter was discussed or joked about on several occasions by the showrunner.\n\nRussell T. Davies once stated that if he had brought back the Rani, he would have cast actress Ruthie Henshall in the role.[1] In the commentary for Last of the Time Lords, Davies jokingly termed the hand seen removing the Master's ring from the ashes of his funeral pyre \"the hand of the Rani\". He would later write it being the hand of a human Disciple of Saxon in The End of Time. In a email reprinted to Benjamin Cook reprinted in Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale - The Final Chapter, Davies choosing to deliberately leave the identity of the Woman (in the same story, The End of Time) ambiguous, anticipated that fans might believe her to be, amongst other possibilities, \"even the Rani\", \"but of course it's meant to be the Doctor's mother\".\n\nIn August 2012, Davies' successor Steven Moffat stated that \"he had no reason to bring back the Rani\",[2] thus putting an end to the rumours of her return to the television series.[3]\n\nIn 2025, it was revealed in The Interstellar Song Contest, that the mysterious Mrs Flood who had appeared in Series 14 and Series 15 was actually the Rani, marking Flood's first appearance in The Church on Ruby Road as the return of the Rani in the television series.\n\nMe & My Ghost, a 2021 Dionus's War audio play written and produced by Bill Baggs, featured a character called \"Nari\", who was an alternative personality crafted for herself by an infamous renegade of the Great Houses to evade the authorities of her people. She was noted as a talented chemist, and it was suggested that the name \"Nari\" was somehow a play on her usual appellation. The clear implication was thus that Nari's true self was \"the Rani\". However, this was not made explicit due to BBV Productions no longer having the rights to the character of the Rani by that point, aside from further exploitation of their original licensed The Rani Reaps the Whirlwind spin-off story.\n\nIn an episode of the Big Finish Podcast on 19 December 2021, a listener asked Nicholas Briggs and Benji when would the Rani return in a Time War series. Nicholas Briggs responded that it would be difficult since both Pip and Jane Baker had passed away, and a possible complication with getting in touch with the estate.",
