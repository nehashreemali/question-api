  "content": "The Sontarans were a humanoid race of belligerent and militaristic clones from the planet Sontar, created by the Kaveetch. They waged an eternal war throughout Mutter's Spiral against the Rutans, though they made no effort to change this nor did they want peace.\n\nThe Sontarans were humanoids with large, bulbous heads and short stocky bodies; humans who met them, such as Sarah Jane Smith, Clyde Langer and Bea Nelson-Stanley, often compared them to \"huge potatoes with ray guns\". (TV: Eye of the Gorgon, The Last Sontaran) Alternatively, Mickey Smith described one as a \"dumpling with a gun\". (TV: The End of Time) They had grey-brown skin and deep set features. Sontarans generally had three digits on each hand (two fingers and a thumb), (TV: The Time Warrior, et al) though some had five fingers on each hand. (TV: The Sontaran Experiment) Some Sontarans also had vestigial hair, generally in the form of beards, which grew white with age. (TV: The Two Doctors; PROSE: Shakedown; COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar, Supremacy of the Cybermen) Sontaran blood was mostly green, (TV: The Two Doctors, A Fix with Sontarans, The Last Sontaran) although it was occasionally red. (HOMEVID: Battlefield)\n\nValethske considered Sontaran flesh to be \"notoriously tough\" and tasteless. Ruvis developed cancer after being forced to subsist on Sontaran meat while stranded on board a derelict ship. (PROSE: Superior Beings [+]Nick Walters, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nAccording to Strax, Sontarans' heights were \"to precise warrior specifications\". (AUDIO: A Photograph to Remember) Group Marshal Stike and Major Varl were noticeably taller than their Androgum associates Shockeye and Chessene. (TV: The Two Doctors)\n\nThe Sontarans reproduced by cloning, meaning every Sontaran was nearly identical to each other. There were some variations over time, such as the number of fingers, (TV: The Sontaran Experiment) height, (TV: The Two Doctors) or skin colour. (PROSE: Shakedown) Variation was typical across Sontaran generations of clone replication. This sometimes led to \"throwbacks\" to past Sontarans. (AUDIO: A Photograph to Remember)\n\nAt least one Sontaran had been gene-spliced for nursing purposes, such as the ability to produce breast milk. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War) They used mass cloning techniques that allowed their hatcheries to produce up to a million Sontarans in four minutes. (PROSE: Lords of the Storm)\n\nOccasionally, genetic defects would crop up and the afflicted Sontarans would perform menial labour. (COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar)\n\nDue to the high gravity of the moon of Sontar that they were first created on, the Sontarans had great strength and resilience in lower gravity environments like Earth or Gallifrey. (TV: The Two Doctors, AUDIO: The First Sontarans) However, Sontaran muscles were designed for load bearing rather than leverage, (TV: The Time Warrior) which could lead to unwieldiness. (TV: The Sontaran Experiment)\n\nThe Sontaran cardiovascular system was 210% more efficient than the human normal. (AUDIO: The Shadow Play)\n\nThey were vulnerable to coronic acid. (TV: The Two Doctors) If severely wounded, a Sontaran would enter an anabolic coma. They would usually die, but sometimes they would later wake. (PROSE: Shakedown)\n\nSontarans fed on pure energy through a probic vent in the back of the neck, (TV: The Sontaran Experiment) which was also used as an access point to refill their armour with the chemicals of their native atmosphere. (TV: War of the Sontarans) This vent was also their crucial weakness, as any sudden blow to the vent would stun them. The penetration of a sharp object into the vent would kill them. (TV: The Time Warrior, The Invasion of Time, et al.) Tampering with the energy source could also lead to a reversal effect that could destroy a Sontaran from the inside out. (TV: The Sontaran Experiment)\n\nSontarans needed 7.5 minutes of sleep every 27 Earth hours. (TV: War of the Sontarans) While it was unknown if the rest cycle was a biological necessity, (PROSE: Shakedown) when they were occupying planets with a significantly different atmospheric composition to their homeworld the Sontarans would use the rest period as an opportunity to refill their suits with the chemicals and nutrients of Sontar's atmosphere. (TV: War of the Sontarans)\n\nSontarans could live into their eighties, but this was uncommon due to their military culture. (AUDIO: Old Soldiers, Rearguard) In an alternate universe, all Sontarans appeared, roughly, the same age, with the exception of the older General Sontar. (PROSE: The Infinity Doctors)\n\nMembers of the Great Houses regarded the Sontarans as \"goblins\"; Larissa remembered the Sontaran invasion of Gallifrey as a \"goblin infestation\", (PROSE: Newtons Sleep) and in Mujun: The Ghost Kingdom the Seventy-Ninth Sontaran Assault Corps was represented by a \"goblin-hoarde\". (PROSE: The Book of the War, AUDIO: The Eleven Day Empire)\n\nSontarans were biologically both male and female, but the high levels of testosterone produced for combat caused them all to be born male. If a Sontaran was allowed to age, they would steadily turn female. (AUDIO: Salvation Nine)\n\nThe Sontarans were a martial species obsessed with war. They hated the idea of a great war being fought without them. (TV: The Time Warrior, The Sontaran Stratagem) Sontaran civilisation relied on war, and the continuing war effort of the Sontaran Empire relied upon its civilisation. (AUDIO: Old Soldiers) Sontarans trained for war in the Sontaran Greater Military Academy. (PROSE: Devil in the Smoke) Jingo Linx claimed that hatchings of a million cadets occurred at each Academy muster parade. (TV: The Time Warrior) The body of power in the empire was the Grand Strategic Council. (AUDIO: Conduct Unbecoming)\n\nThe Sontaran Subliminal Education Matrix's entry on the Daleks acknowledged that the two species shared a bloodlust and a will to bend all opposition to their \"iron rule\". However, it maintained that the Sontarans were motivated by honour and their own \"superiority\" whilst the Daleks were motivated by their hatred for all other life forms which was characterised as a dishonourable \"weakness\" and \"sickness\" that dwarfed the Sontarans' own animosity for the Rutans. It did observe that the Daleks were \"the right height\". (PROSE: A Soldier's Education)\n\nThe highest honour for a Sontaran was to serve in the Imperial Sontaran Fleet; conversely, to be disallowed soldiering was the most dishonourable fate for a Sontaran. (COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar) They believed in the glory of dying in combat, trying and sometimes executing soldiers who did not. (AUDIO: Rearguard) Caring for the sick and wounded was a humiliating concept, (TV: A Good Man Goes to War) as was fighting for other species. (TV: Enemy of the Bane) Sontarans did not fear death, and they would rather be court-martialled than show pain. They considered it honourable to face battle \"open skinned\", without a helmet on. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky)\n\nThe Sontaran Subliminal Education Matrix claimed that each drop-pod was painted a bright and reflective silver so that they could be clearly seen against the sky, refusing to adopt the \"cowardice\" of camouflage. At the same time, however, Mark VII Battle Armour could be modified for the inclusion of a perception-camouflage matrix. (PROSE: A Soldier's Education) The Sontarans were known to have used an invisibility cloak during the Siege of Trenzalore. (TV: The Time of the Doctor)\n\nThough they would ally with other species (PROSE: Shakedown, TV: The Pandorica Opens), they felt no need to keep these alliances, (PROSE: Shakedown) with Stike insisting that the Sontarans did not need allies. (TV: The Two Doctors) Sontarans would only ally themselves with other species, take prisoners, or allow enemies to live, if it served the greater good of the empire. (AUDIO: Old Soldiers) The Sixth Doctor claimed that the Sontarans lacked allies because they were untrustworthy, whilst the Second Doctor made the observation that, like the Androgums, treachery was as natural to the Sontarans as breathing. (TV: The Two Doctors) Indeed, General Staal deceived Luke Rattigan and his academy into assisting the Sontaran invasion of Earth while intending to kill them when their usefulness was at an end. (TV: The Poison Sky) The Thirteenth Doctor noted that she had seen a lot of species make alliances with Sontarans, warning the Grand Serpent that it never ended well. (TV: The Vanquishers) During the Last Great Time War, both the Time Lords and the Daleks refused to ally with the Sontarans, (AUDIO: The Eternity Cage) excluding them from the conflict. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem)\n\nSontarans who possessed five digits on their hands were generally placed as intelligence operatives. However, these agents had a tendency to be paranoid. (PROSE: Lords of the Storm)\n\nThe Sontarans marched to a tune titled the Sontaran Anthem. (PROSE: The Eight Doctors)\n\nDespite being a clone race, the Sontarans still retained the concept of betrothal, which was roughly analogous to ending hostilities by killing one's enemy. (COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar) Within their society, there was a rigid clan structure, with clans having different genetic markers. (PROSE: Lords of the Storm) The clans vied for power. Some had great influence, such as the Gunnar Clan. (PROSE: Shakedown) Sontarans were known for Quicksand Wrestling. (TV: Enemy of the Bane)\n\nSontarans used a Base-6 counting system. (TV: The Last Sontaran)\n\nSontarans generally held a chauvinistic attitude towards females, considering them unfit for warfare. They would sometimes insult their enemies by comparing them to women. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem) They also considered their reproductive systems inferior. (TV: The Time Warrior) Some Sontarans, however, had trouble figuring out which gender humans were. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War, The Snowmen) They referred to Earth-born children as \"half forms\". (TV: The Last Sontaran, Enemy of the Bane)\n\nSome Sontarans bore eponyms, relating to past victories and events that had occurred in their lives. Sontarans would often introduce themselves by their full name ' rank ' and/or title. The Tenth Doctor pointed out that a title such as Staal's (\"General Staal the Undefeated\") would no longer be accurate if he did get defeated, joking, that, that would make him \"General Staal the Not-Quite-So-Undefeated-But-Never-Mind.\" (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky, The Last Sontaran)\n\nIf a Sontaran opposed the decision of their commanding officer, they could duel to the death to decide which would be the leader. (PROSE: The Taking of Chelsea 426)\n\nSontarans considered informing a person that they looked forward to someday killing them on the battlefield a compliment. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War)\n\nDue to their dedication to warfare and short lifespan, Strax considered a twelve-year life to be a long one amongst his species. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War) Even if they were following orders from superiors, those who lived longer, such as Trooper Stron, were considered to have abandoned the Sontaran cause. (AUDIO: Rearguard) Incinerators were kept on Sontaran ships to dispose of dead soldiers, (AUDIO: The Sontaran Ordeal) with others having facilities to send the genetic material of deceased soldiers back to Sontar to be reconstituted into new soldiers. (AUDIO: Rearguard)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor believed that the word \"overkill\" was made for the Sontarans. (AUDIO: The Sontaran Ordeal)\n\nCommander Kaagh followed the Laws of Battle. (TV: The Last Sontaran)\n\nFollowing the Battle of Demons Run, Madame Vastra claimed that Strax was the only Sontaran who had \"fought bravely in the best of causes.\" (TV: The Battle of Demons Run: Two Days Later [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe ranks of individual Sontarans were generally not prominently displayed on the uniform. The Marshal above Styre sported two large spiky disks on the front of his collar. (TV: The Sontaran Experiment) Commander Stor wore a larger collar than his troops and had a white, three-pointed, crown imprinted on his helmet. (TV: The Invasion of Time) Group Marshal Stike had white braiding on his shoulders, akin to epaulettes. (TV: The Two Doctors)\n\nIn the early 21st century, badges of rank were more clearly visible and consisted of various symbols set into the right-hand side of the front of the collar. General Staal wore five diamonds in a crown-shaped pattern, and also had a crest made up of four diamond shapes on his helmet, a little similar in design to the crown on Stor's helmet. Commanders, such as Skorr and Kaagh, sported three diamonds in a similar pattern. The lowest rank of this badge design was Lieutenant, displayed by a single diamond in the middle of the badge, shown on Lieutenant Skree, an operations officer. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky, The Last Sontaran, Enemy of the Bane) In the 24th century, Commander Steg wore a gold helmet while his troops wore red ones. (HOMEVID: Return of the Sontarans)\n\nThe Sontaran military was divided into several different units, regiments, and fleets. These included the Fifth Sontaran Army Space Fleet, (TV: The Time Warrior) the G3 Military Assessment Survey, (TV: The Sontaran Experiment) the Sontaran Special Space Service, (TV: The Invasion of Time) the Eighth Battle Fleet, (COMIC: The Instruments of War) the Ninth Sontaran Battle Group, (TV: The Two Doctors) the Tenth Sontaran Battle Fleet, (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky) the Twelfth Sontaran Battle Fleet, (PROSE: The Sontaran Games) the Special Assault Squad attached to other units including the Tenth Sontaran Battle Fleet, (TV: The Last Sontaran) the Koda, (PROSE: Lords of the Storm) the First Assault Battalion, (HOMEVID: Mindgame) the Imperial Sontaran Fleet, (COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar) the Fourth Sontaran Intelligence Division, (PROSE: The Taking of Chelsea 426) the Seventy-Ninth Sontaran Assault Corps, (AUDIO: The Eleven Day Empire) and, in one universe, the Three Millionth Fleet. (PROSE: The Infinity Doctors) In an alternate timeline, the Last Great Sontaran War Fleet was the last surviving Sontaran fleet following the near-complete eradication of the Sontaran Empire by the Cybermen. (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen)\n\nSontaran units identified themselves using holo-standards. (COMIC: The Judas Goatee)\n\nEarly Sontarans believed in the Furies. (AUDIO: The Furies)\n\nA school of Sontaran painters specialised in apocalyptic landscapes. They were executed for artistic tendencies. (COMIC: The Weeping Angels of Mons)\n\nHistorically, they had a clan structure and the clan background continued to be unofficially important into the 26th century. (PROSE: Shakedown)\n\nSontarans were known to enjoy beverages, including a particularly potent Sontaran alcohol known as Vragg. (PROSE: Shakedown)\n\nThe Sontarans were reasonably advanced, though all their technology was designed for use in the war with the Rutans. They often used spherical spaceships and could make advanced robots for various purposes.\n\nThe Sontarans could use and make a wide variety of hand-held weapons, though they usually used the rheon carbine, a swagger stick used for energy projection and hypnotism; as well as repairing technology. (TV: The Time Warrior, The Invasion of Time, The Two Doctors, The Sontaran Stratagem|The Poison Sky; PROSE: Shakedown, Lords of the Storm) The Sontarans also utilised laser rifles that could kill a human without any exterior damage. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky, War of the Sontarans, Survivors of the Flux|The Vanquishers) They also had Stenk 11 pistols, (PROSE: The Undertaker's Gift) and heavy energy-blasters with blades known as Meson Blasters. (TV: The Two Doctors; HOMEVID: A Fix with Sontarans)\n\nThey also used melee weapons such as swords (PROSE: What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow) including cutlasses, (COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar) machetes, (TV: The Sontaran Experiment) spears, (COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar) axes, (GAME: Legacy) and staffs. (PROSE: The Taking of Chelsea 426)\n\nThey also made use of fragmentation grenades, which could destroy everything in a certain area. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Terror of the Autons, Legacy)\n\nThey bought weapons designed by the Vess, who also supplied the Cybermen and Daleks. (AUDIO: The Light at the End)\n\nThe Sontarans utilised battle computers. (AUDIO: The Sontaran Ordeal)\n\nIn an alternate universe, the Sontarans began plans to develop a device capable of snuffing out entire stars in response to the development by the Rutans to create a planet-killing weapon that was able to destroy a world by converting it from matter to anti-matter. (PROSE: The Infinity Doctors)\n\nThe Sontarans used spherical vessels, which were covered in square plates. They were generally only large enough for one Sontaran. (TV: The Time Warrior, et al.) Some had cloaking capabilities. (TV: The Last Sontaran) The Sontaran motherships were similar in shape to the scoutship, but had four claw like appendages coming out of the top and bottom. The scout ships were attached to the mothership and could be released when needed. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem / The Poison Sky)\n\nWar-Wheels were combat vessels shaped roughly like a bow tie, with two rotating 'wheels' either side of a central spherical core. They were capable of planetary landings. (PROSE: Shakedown, COMIC: Unnatural Born Killers) Assault ships were also used for planetary invasions. Sontaran fleets had a typical arrow formation, with ships composing the head and the shaft. (TV: The Invasion of Time)\n\nWhen on a planet, the Sontarans would travel by the means of aircraft. These aircraft looked like the bottom half of a Sontaran ship, with seats and controls on the top half. (COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar)\n\nIn the 13th century, (TV: The Sontaran Experiment) Sontarans utilised an osmic projector for time travel. (TV: The Time Warrior) Thousands of years earlier, their time travel technology, which was developed by the Kaveetch, was only capable of sending individuals into the future. (AUDIO: The First Sontarans) In the 20th century, they made other attempts to obtain more effective time travel technology such as the Kartz-Reimer module developed by Kartz and Reimer. (TV: The Two Doctors)\n\nSontarans adapted teleportation technology using generators situated at the area of materialisation. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky)\n\nSontarans wore distinctive battle armour, identified by Jingo Linx as Sontaran space armour, which resembled a thick and bulky grey space suit. Their helmets were dome-shaped and almost featureless except for two eye holes and a small, flat crest running from the forehead to the back of the neck. They generally carried around their rod-like weapon and a translating device. (TV: The Time Warrior)\n\nDuring a period in the early 17th and early 21st century Sontarans had blue, less flexible, armour in a similar design (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky, GAME: The Gunpowder Plot) although those Sontarans may have been solely ship crews, since crew armour was blue. Sontarans of the medical and environmental divisions wore green armour, (PROSE: Lords of the Storm) though in 4037, the nurse Strax wore an outfit similar to that of the blue 17th/21st century armour. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War)\n\nSontarans used two methods of controlling other individuals. They could take over their minds through hypnosis, (TV: The Time Warrior, The Sontaran Stratagem) or control them with devices attached to the neck. (TV: The Last Sontaran) They also used psy-snares for the same purpose. (COMIC: Black Sun Rising)\n\nSontaran clones were fed using the probic vent, which was the Sontaran's only weak spot. These clones were grown in vats and were nourished by Caesofine gas. (TV: The Poison Sky) Some clones were composed of genetic material recycled from soldiers who had died in combat. (AUDIO: Rearguard)\n\nThe Sontarans could heal their wounds with a device called a tissue rectifier, which was a stubby, tubular device. (PROSE: Blind Terror)\n\nStyre used a miniature camera and a force field while studying humans. (TV: The Sontaran Experiment)\n\nDuring the mission to make Earth a breeding planet, the Sontarans made a Cordolaine field around themselves that caused metallic copper to expand; when the copper was in the jacket of a bullet, it became jammed in the gun's barrel, rendering it useless. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky)\n\nThe Kaveetch were the original natives of Sontar, and also considered themselves \"Sontarans\" (just like Humans could be called \"Earthlings\"). They appeared more like humans. (AUDIO: The First Sontarans)\n\nThe Sontaran colony that became the home of the Pureblood Sontarans was settled at some point before the Rutan-Sontaran War. (COMIC: Pureblood)\n\nAfter a war with the Rutans had reached a stalemate, Meredith Roath proposed the creation of a clone army, namely the Sontaran clones. Within weeks, the clones were not only fighting on the front lines but had turned the tide of the war firmly in the Kaveetch's favour. (AUDIO: The First Sontarans) However, the Sontarans turned on their creators due to their supposedly inferior nature and unique knowledge of Sontaran physiology. (AUDIO: The First Sontarans, COMIC: Pureblood)\n\nEven the existence of the Kaveetch was eventually erased from the Sontarans' official history. (AUDIO: The First Sontarans) According to the Sontarans themselves, before encountering the Rutans, they were split into clans, which would fight amongst themselves. The survivors of these civil wars joined forces and set their aggression on aliens instead. (PROSE: Shakedown)\n\nThe cloned Sontarans were engaged in a war with the Rutans. During the Millennium War, though, Sontarans and Rutans briefly joined forces. (PROSE: The Quantum Archangel)\n\nAccording to one source, a lone Sontaran was present during a \"terrible war\" found on the Hyffons home world, these events taking place during the Dark Times. (COMIC: The Continuity Cap)\n\nDuring the dying days of the Fifty-first Star Fall Campaign, the Sontarans suffered heavy losses against the Rutans. Sontaran scientists created the world engine weapon Warsong to change the course of the war. The Sontarans were unable to deploy the weapon, and the \"brave warrior\" Surnat Gaq escaped the Rutans, and while mortally wounded, he took the Warsong to primitive Earth, where it lay dormant and undetected. (COMIC: The Instruments of War)\n\nIn Earth's prehistory, a Sontaran went to Egypt, where he was worshipped as a god. Eventually, the humans learned of his plan to destroy Earth for the war, and they buried him alive inside a pyramid. (COMIC: The Gods Walk Among Us)\n\nIn 102, the Sontarans were among the races who joined the Pandorica Alliance. They came to Stonehenge and helped imprison the Eleventh Doctor in the Pandorica in order to save the universe. (TV: The Pandorica Opens)\n\nIn the 13th century, (TV: The Sontaran Experiment) Linx, a scout, was forced to perform an emergency landing in England after being attacked by a squadron of Rutan fighters. He claimed Earth and \"its moons and satellites\" for the Sontaran Empire. He proceeded to make an alliance with Irongron, a local warlord, and to transport scientists from the late 20th century into the past using his osmic projection. He would then hypnotise them in order to make them work on his ship. He was killed when his repaired ship began taking off. (TV: The Time Warrior)\n\nLinx was remembered with honour by his fellow Sontarans, who viewed him as a great commander. The rest of the Sontaran Empire sought to fulfil his claim over Earth. (TV: War of the Sontarans)\n\nLater, in the year 1522 AD, a Sontaran scoutship crash landed on Earth in China. As a result of the incident, their hyperspace transmitter was damaged and they required a replacement crystal in order to summon reinforcements as well as to take over the planet. There, they formed a partnership with the Abbot Hsiang and Yueh who knew them as the \"bronze men\" where they used their hypnotic technology to enhance his fighting abilities.\n\nThe Emperor of China learnt of the enhanced fighting skills of the monks and came for a demonstration. This was all part of a plan by the Sontarans to kill the Chinese Emperor as he possessed a quartz crystal sufficient to power the hyperspace transmitter and thus placed a hypnotic suggestion designed to turn the monks against the Emperor in order to kill him.\n\nHowever, the Fourth Doctor intervened and had K9 record the trigger words and broke the spell but not before Chang went into a berserker attack that killed the Sontarans as a result of him hearing the command phrase once. (COMIC: Dragon's Claw)\n\nIn 1605, a group of Sontarans came searching for a crashed Rutan ship buried under the Houses of Parliament that contained two doomsday weapons capable of wiping out an entire species. Both the Sontarans and the Rutans raced to retrieve them but the Eleventh Doctor reached them first, modified them and gave one to each party and told them they could use it on the other but faced a risk of killing their own species instead. (GAME: The Gunpowder Plot)\n\nIn 1609, along with the Rutans, the Sontarans participated in the summit of military powers throughout Mutter's Spiral in the Armageddon Convention, which convened in Laputa, a floating island in the sky near Venice. (PROSE: The Empire of Glass)\n\nAfter being resurrected in the aftermath of the Battle of Demons Run, Commander Strax worked with Madame Vastra and Jenny Flint on Paternoster Row in 1888 London. (WC: The Battle of Demons Run: Two Days Later, TV: The Snowmen)\n\nIn 1892, after the Eleventh Doctor was brought out of \"retirement\", Strax defended Captain Latimer's house from snowmen controlled by the Great Intelligence. He tried and failed to save the life of Clara Oswin Oswald after she fell off the Doctor's cloud. Said failure was shown to affect him somewhat. (TV: The Snowmen)\n\nIn 1893, Strax worked with the Doctor, the Paternoster Gang and Clara Oswald to defeat Mr Sweet and Winifred Gillyflower's plans to wipe out humanity except for their chosen few. Along the way he befriended a young urchin named Thomas Thomas and saved his friends from Mrs Gillyflower by shooting at her, causing her to fall to her death. (TV: The Crimson Horror) At some point after this, Strax, along with Vastra, Jenny and Clara, assisted the Twelfth Doctor in foiling the plans of the Half-Face Man, although at one point when defeat appeared inevitable, Strax briefly considered suicide. (TV: Deep Breath)\n\nAt some point during his time in Victorian England, Strax became separated from Vastra and Jenny and assisted investigators Henry Gordon Jago and George Litefoot on a case. (AUDIO: The Haunting)\n\nSontaran soldier Brak visited Earth in 1916 and witnessed the Battle of the Somme. He was captured by British soldiers and imprisoned for eighty years, during which he created powerful weapons for humanity in the hope that they would tear each other apart. (AUDIO: Old Soldiers) Elsewhere in the 20th century, it was believed that a Sontaran scout ship crashed in Tunguska. Some of this wreckage was obtained by UNIT and kept in the Vault. (AUDIO: Tales from the Vault)\n\nIn 1941, a small retinue of the Eighth Battle Fleet arrived in the Sahara Desert after they had discovered the world engine the Warsong had begun to activate after being lost for millennia. They hid among the Tuareg tribe so as not to alert the Rutans to their presence. After the Rutan Heinz Bruckner had claimed the world engine with a device which controlled the Warsong's movements. The Twelfth Doctor tricked Kygon Brox into believing he would seize the Warsong for the Sontarans. As a result, Kygon gave the Doctor an osmic projector to send the control device through time, stopping Bruckner's plans. However, instead of allowing the Sontarans to strike at the Rutans with the Warsong, the Doctor blew the weapon up with his sonic screwdriver. (COMIC: The Instruments of War)\n\nIn 1945, the Sontarans were one of 23 races that came to Dusseldorf in search of the persuasion machine. (AUDIO: Persuasion) At some point during the 20th century, Edgar Nelson-Stanley met with the Sontarans. He believed they were \"the silliest race in the galaxy\". (TV: Eye of the Gorgon) In 1965, three hundred Sontarans were killed by Captain Gol Clutha when he and his squad hijacked a Sontaran timeship. (COMIC: Hunters of the Burning Stone)\n\nIn the 1980s, Group Marshal Stike claimed that the war with the Rutans was \"on the contrary\" to going badly. The Ninth Sontaran Battle Group attempted to gain unlimited access to time travel through Kartz and Reimer's experiments. This failed when Chessene betrayed Stike and Major Varl, and the Sixth Doctor sabotaged the Kartz-Reimer module. At the same point in time, the Sontarans were involved in a battle with the Rutans in the Madillon Cluster. (TV: The Two Doctors)\n\nOn 23 February 1985, (PROSE: Fixing a Hole) Group Marshal Nathan and his subordinate of the Tenth Sontaran Battle Brigade were inside the Sixth Doctor's TARDIS, planning to destroy it with a vitrox bomb. With the help of Tegan and Gareth Jenkins — whom the duo of Sontarans believed was the leader of the Earth Defence Force that thwarted the Sontarans' future invasion of Earth in 2001 — the Doctor gassed the Sontarans, killing them bloodily. To their shock, the TARDIS scanner shows them the rest of the Battle Brigade outside, (HOMEVID: A Fix with Sontarans) however, seemingly in a few hours, the ordeal was sorted. (PROSE: Fixing a Hole)\n\nIn England in the 1990s, one Sontaran confronted a woman who resembled Sarah Jane Smith and a little girl she was walking with. After capturing the older woman, the Sontaran held the child at gunpoint. (TV: Untitled 3)\n\nIn the 2000s, Major Kreg of the Ninth Sontaran Battle Brigade was sent to survey Earth for the empire. He was intercepted by Torchwood and forcibly resettled at Mumbles Bay Caravan Park. He eventually came to appreciate his life there, after clashing with the park's owner Mr Higgins and summoning Rutan mercenaries for a battle, and took over running of the park. (AUDIO: The Great Sontaran War)\n\nIn 2001, the Sontarans invaded Earth, but were defeated by the Earth Defence Force led by Gareth Jenkins.

(HOMEVID: A Fix with Sontarans)\n\nIn 2009, the Sontarans appeared as though they were losing the war against the Rutans. To counter this, the Tenth Sontaran Battle Fleet, led by the supposedly undefeated General Staal, made plans to convert Earth into a cloning world, and carried them out with the help of a young human genius named Luke Rattigan.\n\nThe Sontarans used a form of hypnosis on the workers of the ATMOS factory, forcing them to start shipping out devices that contained gases poisonous to humans, contained inside plates attached to the SatNavs they sold. When the Tenth Doctor attempted to meddle, the Sontarans activated all the devices already deployed in cars, releasing the poison gas and choking people nearby.\n\nThe gas was burnt away by the Doctor's use of an atmospheric converter and Rattigan, having been betrayed, sacrificed his life by using the converter to destroy the fleet.

(PROSE: What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow)\n\nThe Sontarans grew interested in the Flux, with Psychic Surveyor Kragar assessing its impact. He reported back to Commander Ritskaw that the cataclysm was imminent and and forecast \"conflict that will dwarf all that has come before\", to the Commander's excitement. Ritskaw subsequently ordered an attack (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse) against 2021 Earth. The Sontarans invaded Earth just before the shield of Lupari ships sealed to protect the planet from the oncoming Flux, occupying Liverpool where they began construction of a fleet of timeships to invade Earth throughout time. A pilot temporal invasion was conducted in the Crimean War led by Skaak.\n\nThe Sontarans in the Crimea came into conflict with British forces and encountered the Thirteenth Doctor, who sabotaged their supplies to force them to retreat. As their ships began to lift off, a British commander used gunpowder to detonate them. In 21st century Liverpool, the Doctor's companion Dan Lewis infiltrated the fleet and was rescued from Sontarans by his assigned Lupar Karvanista who had taken the blame from his people for the Sontaran incursion. Karvanista rammed one of the Sontaran timeships into the rest of the fleet, creating a temporal shockwave which removed the Sontarans from Earth. (TV: War of the Sontarans)\n\nIn revenge for their defeat, the Sontarans invaded Earth again later in the Flux crisis with the aid of the Grand Serpent, attacking the Lupari ships still shielding the planet and breaking into the Williamson Tunnels. (TV: Survivors of the Flux) They wiped out the Lupari and occupied Earth, though were resisted by a resistance led by Kate Stewart. Exploiting Earth's psychics to identify the origin point of the next Flux event, the Sontarans planned to take advantage of it by luring the Dalek War Fleet and Cybermen forces there under the pretex of forming an alliance at that location, planning to protect themselves using the Lupari ships they now controlled. Their plan was sabotaged by the Doctor who changed the formation of the Lupari ships to expose the Sontaran fleet to the Flux as well, destroying it.

(PROSE: Shakedown)\n\nSome time later, an expedition was made to go to Sentarion and take advantage of the wormhole connecting it and Ruta III to kill the Rutan Queen. Though the Sontarans tried to keep this information classified, a Rutan spy known as Karne was able to learn that the information had leaked out and tried to return to the Rutans.\n\nCommander Steg was sent in to redeem himself and kill Karne. He was able to track it to the space yacht Tiger Moth, where it had hidden in the ship. During the course of his investigations, his soldiers were whittled down by Karne and the human crew. Eventually, Karne was killed and all the Sontarans were believed to be killed. In reality, Karne was able to clone himself before his death and Steg was able to pull through. (HOMEVID: Return of the Sontarans, PROSE: Shakedown)\n\nThe second Karne was able escape to Sentarion, followed by the Seventh Doctor, his companions and the survivors from the Tiger Moth. Commander Steg was able to follow them with a War-Wheel and forced the Doctor to open the wormhole to Ruta III. The War-Wheel was sent through, but the Doctor was able to reverse the polarity of the wormhole, meaning the War-Wheel would never get to Ruta III. When Steg tried to kill the Doctor in revenge, a fight began, leading to the death of Karne and the Sontaran forces. (PROSE: Shakedown)\n\nAlso at some point during the 26th century, the Sontarans and Rutans took their war to the colony Chelsea 426. The Fourth Sontaran Intelligence Division, led by General Kade, were given the mission of hunting down Rutans that were at the time taking over human bodies. The Tenth Doctor was present during the event and while he did not side with either warring party, he did stop the Rutans, after which the Sontarans left. However, there was evidence that the Sontaran Division's trouble with the Rutans was not fully over after their ship left the colony. (PROSE: The Taking of Chelsea 426)\n\nDuring either the 25th or 26th century, the Rutans destroyed the Sontaran homeworld, Sontar, with photonic bombs, though some escaped with the Sontaran racepool.

The Grand Strategic Council planned to invade the galaxy, but they had to abandon that plan when a scout, Field Major Styre, was killed while trying to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the humans. After this, the Fourth Doctor bluffed, telling the Sontarans that their battle plans had been captured, so they would have to call off their invasion.

When the Tenth Doctor arrived, Snathe forced him to find the Thanatos - but when Snathe tried to control it, the Thanatos decided that the Sontarans were stagnant and Sontar needed to be destroyed.
