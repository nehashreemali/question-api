  "content": "The Doctor also liked to share his wisdom with those who had open minds, but his patience would quickly dissolve if something annoyed him. Those who got on his good side found him to be a friendly fellow, while those who were against him soon found that the Doctor would get physical if pressed, often holding his own in a fight with use of Venusian aikido.\n\nForced into an exile on Earth in the 20th century by the Time Lords, (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) with his TARDIS rendered inoperable, the Doctor allied himself with UNIT under Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, working as their scientific advisor, initially alongside Dr. Liz Shaw, (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) until she decided to return to the University of Cambridge to pursue her own work. (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) The Doctor often took exception to the Brigadier's military approach, especially concerning the outcome of the Wenley Moor Affair, just as the Brigadier was frequently irritated by the Doctor's air of superiority and seeming disregard for authority, (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) but they ultimately developed an easy mutual trust and strong friendship. (TV: Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).)\n\nFollowing Liz's departure, the Doctor was given a new assistant named Jo Grant, who was as bubbly as she was unscientifically trained, (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) but he developed a great fondness for her. (TV: Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) No sooner had Jo arrived that the Doctor became entangled in an ongoing battle of wits against the Master, who also became stranded on Earth when the Doctor stole the dematerialisation circuit from the Master's TARDIS in an attempt to fix his own, (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) until he was forced to return it during the Stangmoor Incident. (TV: The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) However, the Master's attempt to ally with Axos forced him to ally with the Doctor, allowing him to trick his two foes into partially repairing his TARDIS, though with him stuck as a \"galactic yo-yo\" that would always have to return to his exile. (TV: The Claws of Axos [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).)\n\nAfter the Master was finally arrested by UNIT following his failure to ally with the Dæmon Azal at Devil's End, (TV: The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) the Doctor found himself pushing the limits of exile as he travelled to an alternate future ruled by Daleks, (TV: Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) visited Peladon for the first time, (TV: The Curse of Peladon [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) and was even recruited by the Time Lords for a mission on 30th century Solos. (TV: The Mutants [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) After the Master escaped his imprisonment with aid from the Sea Devils, (TV: The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) the Doctor and Jo ended up chasing him to Ancient Atlantis, where they stopped him harnessing the power of Kronos the Chronovore, though the Doctor allowed him to escape. (TV: The Time Monster [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).)\n\nThe Doctor's exile finally came to an end when the Time Lords united him with his first and second incarnations in the First Omega Crisis, with the Doctors' defeat of Omega in the anti-matter universe being rewarded with the Time Lords restoring the TARDIS to full working order. (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973).) The Doctor tried to celebrate his new freedom by taking Jo to Metebelis III, but they ended up getting side-tracked by misadventures (TV: Carnival of Monsters [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) like the Daleks' Spiridon campaign. (TV: Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973)., Planet of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) Eventually, Jo became homesick, (TV: Planet of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) and a return trip to Earth saw her leave the TARDIS to marry scientist Clifford Jones after meeting him at Llanfairfach while the Doctor was on Metebelis III. The Doctor gave her a Metebelis crystal as a wedding gift. (TV: The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).)\n\nThe Doctor would then adventure alone, until he met journalist Sarah Jane Smith while saving UNIT associated scientists kidnapped to the 13th century by the Sontaran Linx. (TV: The Time Warrior [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1973-1974).) While she first tried to leave his company due to initially being an accidental stowaway, her aid to him during Operation Golden Age, which saw Yates betray UNIT due to his political beliefs, encouraged them to continue to travel together, (TV: Invasion of the Dinosaurs [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) visiting planets such as Exxilon, (TV: Death to the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) Florana (PROSE: The Hungry Bomb [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Yearbooks (1994).) and Peladon. (TV: The Monster of Peladon [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).)\n\nHowever, the Doctor's adventures came to an end when the Metebelis crystal was returned to him, heralding an invasion by the Eight Legs of Metebelis III to reclaim the crystal. With the aid of Sarah and a repentant Yates, the Doctor was encouraged by his childhood mentor to face the Eight Legs' Great One in the caves of Metebelis III to thwart their invasion, where he received a lethal dose of radiation as he escaped the cave's destruction in the TARDIS. The Doctor would be stuck wandering around the Time Vortex until the TARDIS \"brought [him] home\" to UNIT, where he managed to regenerate into a younger body. (TV: Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).)\n\nTravelling through the caves of the Death Zone to save Borusa from the Dark Tower, the War Doctor and Cinder found various cave paintings which the Doctor speculated were depictions of himself throughout his lives, some of which he failed to recognise. One of the paintings depicted a figure \"with bouffant white hair and a cape being chased by a silver robot\". (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nA champion for peace and justice, (TV: Colony in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) who \"hardly ever\" lied, (TV: The Time Warrior [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1973-1974).) the Third Doctor valued his freedom, (TV: Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) believing \"the collection of the simplest animal lifeforms [to be] a dubious enough pursuit in itself\", but that \"the collection of civilised [and] intelligent beings [was] a positive crime\", (TV: Carnival of Monsters [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) sympathising with such caged creatures due to his experience as an exile on Earth. (AUDIO: Walls of Confinement [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Though he wished to avoid a fight when he could, the Doctor would not stand for bullying when he saw \"good people of any species or planet\" suffering, vowing to put a stop to any \"bully\" that he came across. (WC: The Third Doctor Adventures [+]The Third Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, YouTube and Twitter, 2025).) He was also more of a show-off than his predecessors, often putting himself at the centre of attention when his plans and contraptions worked accordingly. (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) Liz Shaw believed he only really required an assistant to \"pass [him] [his] test tubes and to tell [him] how brilliant [he was].\" (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).)\n\nHaving \"an air of natural authority\", (AUDIO: A True Gentleman [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) he was far more assertive than his preceding incarnations, (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) with less patience for protocols such as visitor's passes, (TV: The Ambassadors of Death [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) and strove to maintain his independence while working for UNIT, such as by ignoring the Brigadier's summonings. (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) He also disliked having to answer to the Time Lords, maintaining that he worked only for himself. (TV: Colony in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) However, he could be more passive when it came to rescues, not questioning the falsehoods his allies would give when coming to his aid, (TV: The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) and, while he disliked having to work for them, he would use his association with UNIT as a means of getting his way. (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).)\n\nAuthoritative, yet rebellious, the Third Doctor always favoured peace and diplomacy above violence and aggression, though this lead him to clash with stalwart military-minded individuals who chose rules over morality, with figures such as the Brigadier often being a thorn in his side, especially when a particularly aggressive influential had a greater majority of imprudent people on their side. The Doctor held a strong disgust towards these people, who were any combination of stubborn, selfishly goal-driven or close-minded, and would be further outraged if they refused to listen to him, ignored his protests or went to absurd lengths just to dodge the risk of being proven wrong, especially when they acted antagonistic and undiplomatic. (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Claws of Axos [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973)., The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) If unsatisfied with someone's handling of a situation, however, the Doctor would step in forcefully and take charge, (TV: Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) but, if diplomacy outright failed, he reacted in a subdued manner, giving a scathing and virulent dressing down to the foolhardy individuals that destroyed a bid for peace and order. (TV: The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).)\n\nFeeling akin to \"a shipwrecked mariner\" while stranded on Earth without a working TARDIS, (TV: Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) the Third Doctor spent a lot of his time trying to escape his exile, either by tricking others into helping him unlock his TARDIS' capabilities, (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Claws of Axos [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) by trying to repair the circuits himself, (TV: The Ambassadors of Death [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Colony in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., The Mutants [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) or by stealing parts from other TARDISes. (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) His desire to escape would cause him to become overconfident at the first sign of liberation, though he was often forced to humble himself once he realised he was still trapped. (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Claws of Axos [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) After he threatened his eighth incarnation with the Master's TCE for a working TARDIS, the Doctor decided to remain in his exile of his own free will, (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) eventually coming to see UNIT as a \"new-found family\", which he continued to visit after his exile was lifted. (PROSE: The Shadows of Avalon [+]Paul Cornell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nHaving a distain for bureaucracy, (TV: The Ambassadors of Death [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Colony in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) especially when it interrupted him while he was working, (WC: The Third Doctor Adventures [+]The Third Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, YouTube and Twitter, 2025).) the Doctor was rebellious against authorities that were openly hostile towards him, (TV: Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Invasion of the Dinosaurs [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) with anything resembling nationalism provoking a self-righteous response from him. (TV: The Claws of Axos [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).)\n\nWhile he was very hospitable with fellow intellects of his calibre, (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) the Doctor would get rude and dismissive with those he saw as beneath his intellectual prowess, particularly when they interfered in his work. (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Curse of Peladon [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973).) However, he could not bring himself to be dismissive of them in the face of their kindness, (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) and would not dismiss someone who others looked down upon for their poor intelligence. (TV: Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) At times, however, the Doctor could become argumentative and needed to be defused in order to establish fluid communication with people. (TV: The Ambassadors of Death [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).)\n\nNever judging by appearance, (TV: Carnival of Monsters [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) the Doctor would eagerly extend the hand of friendship to any new species he encountered, (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Colony in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) attempt to embrace the customs of the cultures he visited, (TV: The Time Warrior [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1973-1974).) and would reserve his judgement on people until he had all the facts, (TV: Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) though his opinions on species as a whole could be clouded by past experiences with specific members. (TV: The Curse of Peladon [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., Death to the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).)\n\nWhile he would chide others for having a \"childish attitude\", (TV: Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) the Doctor himself admitted a liking for \"being childish\", such as by enjoying the prospect of battling villains, (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) even prolonging a swordfight with the Master out of sheer enjoyment. (TV: The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) He also had no problem interrupting lecturers when he disagreed with what was being said. (TV: The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) By his own admittance, it was \"impossible\" for him to admit when he was wrong. (TV: Carnival of Monsters [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).)\n\nThe Third Doctor had a passion for science and gadgets that caused him to drown out other people when he was invested in his work. (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Time Monster [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973)., Invasion of the Dinosaurs [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974)., Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) He also loved his vintage car, Bessie, almost as much as he loved his TARDIS, fixing it up and giving encouraging pats and kisses, (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) and even preventing the Brigadier from shooting when Bessie was in the line of fire. (TV: The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).)\n\nIn moments of leisure, the Third Doctor could be found tinkering away at his car, (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) undergoing a scientific experiment, (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) visiting events to indulge his \"scientific curiosity\", (TV: The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) or building a new gadgetry contraption. (TV: The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).)\n\nThough he desired a \"quiet life\", (TV: The Monster of Peladon [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) the Doctor craved in seeing the wonders of the universe (TV: Colony in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) no matter where he found himself, (WC: The Third Doctor Adventures [+]The Third Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, YouTube and Twitter, 2025).) with his favourite planets being Metebelis III, (TV: Carnival of Monsters [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) and Florana. (TV: Invasion of the Dinosaurs [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).)\n\nHe enjoyed gorgonzola cheese, wine, (TV: Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) and ice cream. (PROSE: Dr. Third [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) His liking of tea was so great that he allowed the UNIT tea lady unrestricted access to his private laboratory, (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) while also preferring lime to lemon in his drinks. (PROSE: Verdigris [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nAlways trying to find the \"good in everyone\", the Third Doctor was an eternal optimist with a belief that life would always continue in some form, (TV: The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Mutants [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) often comforting people when all hope seemed lost to them, (TV: The Time Monster [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973)., Planet of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973)., Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) believing that \"nothing [was] impossible\" as long as there was an answer to find. (TV: Carnival of Monsters [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) He considered the greatest virtues in humanity as being \"kindness, compassion, humour, friendship, [and] generosity\". (WC: U.N.I.T. On Call [+]Emily Cook and Jon Culshaw, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nA strong believer in fairness, the Doctor was reluctant to release the Master back into the cosmos, (TV: The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) but argued against executing him at his trial due to his the belief that the Master was capable of redemption, (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Sea-Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, adapted from The Sea Devils (Malcolm Hulke), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1974).) and also bargained for him to be spared \"an eternity of torment\" from Kronos. (TV: The Time Monster [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) He was also saddened by the fate of Omega. (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973).) He strove to find a peaceful alternative to the more violent methods that others' held in resolving a crisis. (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).)\n\nNot believing in the supernatural, the Doctor put his faith in science, believing that a scientific explanation could be found to anything unexplainable. (TV: The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) He saw \"absolute power\" as \"evil\", (TV: Colony in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) and would turn away supreme powers when they were offered to him, (TV: The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) instead focusing on obtaining the \"power of friendship\", which he considered to be \"real power\". (COMIC: The Kingdom Builders [+]Alan Fennell, Polystyle comic stories (Polystyle, 1970-1971).) He thought that \"superior intelligence and senseless cruelty just [did] not go together\", (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973).) and once voiced the belief that \"rules were made for breaking\". (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).)\n\nWhile the place where he felt \"most at home in the whole universe\" was in his TARDIS, (AUDIO: Terror of the Master [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor also saw \"time and space\" as being his \"home\", (TV: The Shrink [+]BBC One (1989).) but also held a similar sentiment for his UNIT laboratory. (TV: Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).)\n\nWhile very little managed to scare him, (TV: Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) the Doctor had a fear of seeing a planet being overwhelmed by fire and destruction (TV: The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) after seeing the Inferno Earth being destroyed in volcanic ash. (TV: Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).)\n\nWhile he was unafraid to use deadly force if it was \"the only way\" to end a fight, (COMIC: The Labyrinth [+]Dick O'Neill, TVA comic stories (Polystyle, 1973).) the Doctor was reluctant to destroy something if it had a trace of intelligence, likening it to murder, (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) though he would end a life if it \"had to be done\". (COMIC: The Hungry Planet [+]Stories in Countdown/TVA specials (Polystyle, 1974).) He felt nervous about his capabilities with a gun, (TV: The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) even when he proved effective with one. (TV: Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).)\n\nWhile he had a dislike for machines, (TV: The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) he held a particular distain for computers, (TV: The Ambassadors of Death [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) believing them to be \"stupid\", (TV: Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) but noted that they could be useful tools. (TV: Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).)\n\nThe Third Doctor owned a country house thirty miles from Thisis, that he had bought with his UNIT wages. He decorated the dining room with French windows, robin's egg blue décor, a red wood dining table, and portraits of his past incarnations. There was also a room decorated in deep underwater blue, with a collection of blue Chinese ginger jars containing holograms of planets and creatures, including a Stranovitican. He had a laboratory in the house, which, though messier, was better equipped than the UNIT lab. He had the drive lined with marble statues of various mythical beasts, including a faun and a Minotaur. He also kept a pet ginger cat in the house, and had a huge yellow teapot in the kitchen. (PROSE: Verdigris [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nThe Third Doctor had a noticeably antagonistic relationship with the Second Doctor, their personalities so different that they seemed incapable of working together amicably without the authoritative presence of their first incarnation. (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973)., The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) He also disliked the Eighth Doctor, as he blamed him for the advice he gave the Second Doctor that resulted in his forced regeneration and exile. (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).)\n\nThe Fourth Doctor considered his immediate predecessor to be \"an incorrigible show-off\", (PROSE: Categorical Imperative [+]Simon Guerrier, Short Trips: Monsters (Short Trips short stories, 2004).) while the Fifth Doctor described the Third Doctor's behaviour as \"arrogant\" and \"overbearing\", although he admitted that he matured over time. (PROSE: Deep Blue [+]Mark Morris, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nWhile the Sixth Doctor told Peri Brown that his third incarnation was \"more interested in axle grease and looking in the mirror\" than in reading great literature, (AUDIO: Year of the Pig [+]Matthew Sweet, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) he was willing to acknowledge the Third Doctor's superior skill with a sword, even if he dismissed him as having an \"unusual dress sense\". (PROSE: State of Change [+]Christopher Bulis, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).) The Seventh Doctor also acknowledged that the Third Doctor's technical skill outstripped his other incarnations, (PROSE: Timewyrm: Genesys [+]John Peel, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1991).) and considered his third incarnation to be a \"real dandy of a fellow\". (COMIC: Under Pressure [+]Dan Abnett, Doctor Who Yearbook comic stories (Marvel Comics UK, 1991).)\n\nWhile the Eighth Doctor looked down on his third incarnation, (COMIC: The Pictures of Josephine Day [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) he still acknowledged him as an \"elegant dandy struggling bitterly against the chains of his exile but unable to resist defending the planet that had become his prison\". (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).)\n\nDuring to his exile on Earth, the Third Doctor was often frustrated about his mistreatment and became disrespectful from time-to-time, often bickering with Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart due to not agreeing with his military methods. (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Claws of Axos [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) However, the Doctor also held a great respect for the Brigadier, despite his \"military mind\", (TV: Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) and often found himself telling his assistants to show him due respect. (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).)\n\nDespite his occasional rudeness, the Doctor grew very fond of his friends, often taking on the role of a teacher turning them into young scientists, (TV: The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) though he also enjoyed a professional relationship with his scientific equal, Liz Shaw. (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) At first, he was fearful of Jo Grant due to her bumbling nature, (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) but soon became fond enough of her to feel that meeting her made his exile worthwhile, (TV: Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) becoming upset when she decided to leave his company in pursuit of marrying Professor Clifford Jones. (TV: The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).)\n\nWhile the Third Doctor initially only saw the \"UNIT era\" Master as an \"unimaginative plodder\" that only caused trouble, (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) he eventually came to see him as the \"personification of evil.\" However, he still visited him in prison due to their old friendship. When he and the Master broke out into a sword fight, the Doctor duelled him light-heartedly, being courteous to let the Master retrieve his weapon, and throw banter with him. He even stole a sandwich from a platter in the Master's cell and began eating it while he had his sword pinned on the Master's neck, for no reason other than a playful show of spite. (TV: The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) However, the Doctor distrusted him greatly, such as when he met the Tremas Master in the Death Zone, and, despite him carrying the Seal of the High Council as proof, the Doctor refused to believe the Master had been sent to aid him, instead assuming him to be behind the predicament and having stolen his credentials, and held no qualms about leaving him stranded in an attack. (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).)\n\nResentful at them for exiling him, the Doctor thought the Time Lords to be a \"mean, despicable, [and] underhanded lot\" (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) who \"delighted in deviousness\". (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).)\n\nHe was afraid of the Daleks, (TV: The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) viewing them as \"the most evil [and] ruthless life form[s] in the cosmos\", (TV: Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) and took \"great satisfaction\" in destroying them. (TV: Planet of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) Because they were inherently violent and lacked the intelligence to reason with properly, the Doctor did not show restraint against Ogrons, immediately resorting to fatal action if they were given orders to kill. (TV: Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).)\n\nSarah Jane Smith once described the Third Doctor as being like a \"favourite teacher\". (PROSE: Still Need a Title! [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (2013).) Ron Winters told Tony Clare that the Third Doctor was \"super smart\" and \"[had] a thing for fancy equipment, fast cars, and smart gear\", feeling that the Doctor and Tony would like each other due to their similar dress sense. (AUDIO: UNIT Dating [+]Roy Gill, Stranded 2 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Stranded, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart considered him \"a thoroughly splendid fellow\". (WC: The Third Doctor Adventures [+]The Third Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, YouTube and Twitter, 2025).)\n\nCharles Lawrence called the Third Doctor \"insolent, [and] impertinent\", and criticised him for \"showing no respect for [his] authority\", (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) while King Dalios recognised him as a philosopher. (TV: The Time Monster [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) Florrie Cooper considered the Third Doctor to be \"a proper toff\". (AUDIO: The Three Companions [+]Marc Platt, The Companion Chronicles: The Specials (Big Finish Productions, 2009-2010).) When the Eighth Doctor had a tarot card reading, the Third Doctor was identified as \"the Emperor\". (PROSE: The City of the Dead [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nWhile the Twelfth Master described the Third Doctor as a \"bouffanted buffoon\", (COMIC: Doorway to Hell [+]Mark Wright, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2017).) the Tremas Master remembered him as a \"worthy foe\" with \"such cunning [and] such ingenuity\" that was \"all wasted through [his] stubborn streak of goodness\". (GAME: Destiny of the Doctors [+]Hannah Redler, Gary Russell, Terrance Dicks and Andy Russell, BBC Multimedia (1997).)\n\nAfter confronting the Great One on Metebelis III to redeem himself for causing her incursion on Earth after stealing a Metebelis crystal, the Doctor returned to his UNIT lab on Earth, claiming to Sarah Jane that \"the TARDIS [had] brought [him] home\". Telling a saddened Sarah that facing his fears was more important than \"just going on living\", he wiped away her tears and tried to comfort her as he succumbed to the radiation poisoning of the crystal. (TV: Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).)\n\nThe Third Doctor developed a habit of uttering, \"good grief\", when he was annoyed, (TV: The Ambassadors of Death [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Dæmons [+]Guy Leopold, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Curse of Peladon [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973)., The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) surprised (TV: Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973)., Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973)., Invasion of the Dinosaurs [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) or alarmed.

(TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) Upon first seeing him, Morgan thought that the Doctor was wearing \"fancy dress\".

Audio from Pertwee's scene was later used for Zagreus [+]Alan Barnes and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003)., and parts of the film (including the regeneration scene) were included in the form of a trailer of sorts on the DVD release of The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).. However, this wiki deems Devious to be invalid, partially under the factor of it being fan-made, and additionally for being unreleased in full.",
