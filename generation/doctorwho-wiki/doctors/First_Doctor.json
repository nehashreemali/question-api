  "content": "Beginning after he fled his home world in a stolen TARDIS with his granddaughter Susan Foreman, the Doctor's travels through time and space were mostly random due to faulty components in a TARDIS that required six pilots and which he barely knew how to fly. After a period of hiding at 76 Totter's Lane on Earth in 1963, the Doctor was forced to abruptly depart when Susan's teachers from Coal Hill School, Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, followed her back to Totter's Lane to investigate their unusual pupil, kidnapping them to stop them alerting others to his presence or sharing the secrets of the TARDIS. However, despite the hostile start, he came to form a strong friendship with Ian and Barbara, teaching them about the wonders of the universe while learning how to better himself from their example. It was during one of their early adventures that the Doctor first came into conflict with the Daleks, a species that would quickly become one of his greatest enemies.\n\nEventually, the Doctor bade Susan farewell to allow her to live a happier life with a man with whom she had fallen in love with, and then invited an orphaned girl named Vicki to join him, Ian and Barbara in the TARDIS after they found her on the planet Dido, seeing her a surrogate to fill Susan's spot in his travels. During a confrontation with the Daleks, the Doctor used one of the Dalek time machines to return Ian and Barbara to their proper time, only to quickly find their place in the TARDIS taken by stowaway Steven Taylor, with whom the Doctor had a relatively uneasy relationship.\n\nVicki eventually left the Doctor's company after falling in love with a man she met in Ancient Troy, with her place in the TARDIS being occupied by handmaid Katarina, though her travels proved brief due to her being killed early in the Time Destructor Incident that saw the Doctor stopping the Daleks' master plan to use a Time Destructor to conqueror Earth's solar system, though his victory came at the cost of Sara Kingdom, another of his brief companions. Steven was bitter towards the Doctor for the deaths of Katarina and Sara, and even briefly walked out the TARDIS after another falling out, but returned when Dodo Chaplet forced her way in the TARDIS. Ultimately, Steven decided to stay to help a civilisation they had encountered, while Dodo was later injured in an adventure and decided to remain home in her own time, with the Doctor finding himself inadvertently joined by Ben Jackson and Polly Wright when the TARDIS dematerlised with them still inside.\n\nThe First Doctor met his end after his battle with the Mondasian Cybermen in 1986 Antarctica caused him to lose the strength needed to maintain his body, due to the planet Mondas draining a large portion of his life force. However, having come to fear the impending regeneration and the uncertainty of what kind of person he would ultimately become from it, the Doctor would decide not to change, resisting the regeneration and endangering his life in the process as he left Ben and Polly to return to the TARDIS. Initially, he remained steadfast in his decision and refused to go through with the change until an encounter with a future incarnation also refusing to regenerate caused the Doctor to witness the type of person he would eventually soon become. As a result, his fear of the change was turned to reassurance for his future, causing him to accept his regeneration into his next body.\n\nDue to the various alterations the Doctor made to their timeline while travelling through time, what really transpired to the Doctor during his time on Gallifrey was hard to decipher.\n\nAccording to reports found by Maris, the Doctor was involved in a riot and become wanted by the Celestial Intervention Agency for \"interfering in non-time-travel-capable species' development\". He left Gallifrey two days afterwards. (PROSE: Celestial Intervention - A Gallifreyan Noir [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (BBC Children's Books, 2018).)\n\nFor many pressing reasons, (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) the Doctor stole a TARDIS (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) and fled his home planet with his granddaughter, who would later take the name \"Susan Foreman\". Though he intended for them to someday return, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) the Doctor knew that they could not. (TV: The Massacre [+]John Lucarotti and Donald Tosh, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) Immediately after their escape from Gallifrey, the Doctor and Susan encountered Humans, either on Iwa (PROSE: Frayed [+]Tara Samms, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).) or the Earth's Moon. (AUDIO: The Beginning [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor was drawn to Earth and humanity because he retained unconscious memories of people he met there while working for the Division as the Fugitive Doctor. (COMIC: Untitled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nSometime after their first meeting with humans, the Doctor and Susan began to study Earth and humans more closely, with their first visit to Earth being a trip to the French Revolution (PROSE: Just War [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) in 1791, where the Doctor and Susan had several conversations with Maximilien Robespierre's disguised agents. After some hours in Paris, the Doctor and Susan escaped from a Parisian military post using explosives from an artillery shell that had \"accidentally\" been left in a dark corner of the building. (PROSE: Christmas on a Rational Planet [+]Lawrence Miles, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) Sometime after visiting the French Revolution, the Doctor met Iris Wildthyme, another renegade time traveller. (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) Stealing her diary, he and Susan were \"inspired\". (PROSE: First Meetings [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt the bazaar on Garazone on their \"third or fourth\" stop since leaving Gallifrey, the Doctor learnt how many stories there were in the galaxy when he heard the story of the Nightjar, and was later gifted with a model of the spaceship by Susan. (AUDIO: Pursuit of the Nightjar [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Susan then went to ancient Rome, Mexico, Antioch, Jerusalem, and visited planets such as Mondas, (PROSE: Byzantium! [+]Keith Topping, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) Venus, (TV: \"The Singing Sands\" [+]Part of Marco Polo, John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) Esto, (TV: \"The Unwilling Warriors\" [+]Part of The Sensorites, Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) Dido, (TV: \"The Powerful Enemy\" [+]Part of The Rescue, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) Venessia, Enlandia, Sava, (PROSE: The Ark [+]Paul Erickson, adapted from The Ark (Paul Erickson and Lesley Scott), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1987).) and Tiaanamat, (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) where Susan bought a Five Hundred Year Diary to record her adventures in the TARDIS. (PROSE: Susan's Diary [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013).)\n\nOn further adventures, they met Pyrrho, (TV: \"The Keys of Marinus\" [+]Part of The Keys of Marinus, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).) Hans Christian Andersen, (TV: \"Conspiracy\" [+]Part of The Romans, Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) Christopher Columbus, (PROSE: Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, adapted from The Daleks (Terry Nation), Target novelisations (Frederick Muller Ltd, 1964).) Noël Coward, (AUDIO: The Sleeping City [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and Hieronymus Bosch. (AUDIO: Tick-Tock World [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor also received fashion advice from Beau Brummell, (TV: \"Kidnap\" [+]Part of The Sensorites, Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) helped James Watt develop steam power, (TV: \"The Dimensions of Time\" [+]Part of The Space Museum, Glyn Jones, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) and befriended Thomas Huxley. (COMIC: Unnatural Selection [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor and Susan observed a Zeppelin air raid during World War I, (TV: \"Crisis\" [+]Part of Planet of Giants, Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).) encountered a Vortex rupture, (PROSE: GodEngine [+]Craig Hinton, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) sailed around the Caribbean on board a pirate galleon, witnessed the assassination of US President William McKinley, travelled to Cassuragi, (PROSE: Byzantium! [+]Keith Topping, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) used smoke bombs to escape Peking during the Boxer Rebellion, (AUDIO: The Flames of Cadiz [+]Marc Platt, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2013).) visited London during the Blitz in 1941, (AUDIO: The Alchemists [+]Ian Potter, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2013).) and thwarted a Megrati invasion on Lemaria. (PROSE: The Constant Doctor [+]Andrew Smith, The Scientific Secrets of Doctor Who (2015).)\n\nThe Doctor took a holiday to Lake Rhonda, where he was eaten and regurgitated twice by a blarph whale, (PROSE: A Big Hand for the Doctor [+]Eoin Colfer, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).) and also attended the funeral of Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart with his other incarnations. (PROSE: The Gift [+]Robert Dick, Short Trips: The History of Christmas (Short Trips, 2005).)\n\nVisiting India during the Indian Mutiny, the Doctor became David Warblington's guardian after having his life saved by David's father. (PROSE: The Duke's Folly [+]Gareth Wigmore, Short Trips: Seven Deadly Sins (Short Trips, 2005).) During a meeting with the Xing surgeon Aldridge, the Doctor was forced to part with of litres of TL-positive blood to build up plasma for the \"Inscrutable Doppelganger fiasco\". (PROSE: A Big Hand for the Doctor [+]Eoin Colfer, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor and Susan fought \"homicidal earthworms\" that excreted laughing gas with Aldridge, (PROSE: A Big Hand for the Doctor [+]Eoin Colfer, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).) and visited Jabalhabad, India, in 1843, whilst they were touring India by elephant, and met Siger Holmes. (PROSE: All-Consuming Fire [+]Andy Lane, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).)\n\nAfter discovering the tyranny of a dictator, the Doctor travelled back in time to kill the dictator as a baby. However, whilst waiting in the queue to see the baby at their christening, he accidentally dropped the silver knife he planned to use to kill them. Grumbling at his clumsiness, the Doctor left with Susan. (PROSE: Categorical Imperative [+]Simon Guerrier, Short Trips: Monsters (Short Trips short stories, 2004).)\n\nWhen visiting a planet with two suns, the Doctor cut himself with a strange plant and fell ill as a result of the infection that followed. Susan had to venture outside, in an abandoned research centre on Rua to find some cure; she managed to do so and was able to cure the Doctor. When he recovered, he noticed Susan crying over a video, and asked her what had happened; she then told him about her encounter with the terrorist known as the Butcher and the security team sent to deal with him, about the part she played in his demise and how she then found out what his real motives were. The Doctor comforted her by saying she did her best by saving his life, and nothing else mattered, even more so because they must not interfere in other people's business. When Susan pointed out he didn't used to think this way, the Doctor replied that now they were travelling, and couldn't use their abilities to manipulate others, especially as this could not end up in a good way. Susan, however, could see he wasn't really sure on the matter. (AUDIO: The Sleeping Blood [+]Martin Day, The First Doctor: Volume One (The Companion Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2015).)\n\nVacationing at a bed and breakfast called \"Bide-a-Wee\" in the British coastal town of Keelmouth in 1933, the Doctor discovered that another guest named Prentice was a time traveller. He had used his technology to displace Keelmouth in time; the village was in 1933, but the surrounding world was in 1999. The Doctor and Susan had to convince Prentice to reverse the effect, because his retirement fantasy wasn't fair to the people he had trapped alongside him. (PROSE: Bide-a-Wee [+]Anthony Keetch, Short Trips: Past Tense (Short Trips, 2004).)\n\nNot long afterwards, the Doctor and Susan accidentally landed at the BBC's Paris studios in 1955, because transmissions there had disabled their dematerialisation circuit. They met a radio comedian named Max Wheeler, whose recordings were plagued by a distinctive background \"hum\" caused by ghostly aliens recruited into the French resistance in World War II known as the Shakers, unaware that the war had ended and unable to clearly understand who their enemies were. Though he and Susan tried to explain the current reality to them, the Shakers continued to kill indiscriminately, with the only course of action left being for the Doctor to alter the harmonics of canned laughter and kill them with it. (PROSE: Losing the Audience [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAided by his other incarnations and their companions, the First Doctor and Susan helped Dan Dare to fight off the Mekon and his army of Treens, Daleks, Ice Warriors, Cybermen, Sontarans and Draconians in 1991. After the Mekon was subdued by a barrage of Red Noses, the First Doctor helped collect donations from the defeated army. (COMIC: The Totally Stonking, Surprisingly Educational And Utterly Mindboggling Comic Relief Comic [+]Dan Abnett, et al., Fleetway Publications (1991).)\n\nThe Doctor and Susan visited the planet Olleril, where the Doctor helped cure the radiation poisoning that had been blighting the residents and their crops. Before leaving, the Doctor took a red glass, believing it to have caused all the trouble. (PROSE: Tragedy Day [+]Gareth Roberts, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).)\n\nThe Doctor met Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart at Christmas when he and his wife, Doris, saved Susan from drowning. The Doctor told Doris that he knew how his future friend would die and that he and his succeeding incarnations had already attended his funeral. (PROSE: The Gift [+]Robert Dick, Short Trips: The History of Christmas (Short Trips, 2005).)\n\nVisiting Earth again in 1979, the dematerialisation circuit was fried while the TARDIS was orbiting Earth. The TARDIS was taken on board a Slarvian transport, and the Doctor and Susan learned that the snail-like species planned to conquer Earth by hatching their eggs all over the planet. Their plan failed because the Slarvian ship crashed into the English Channel, making the threat localised to England. With the help of the humans Linda Grainger and her grandfather, Edward Grainger, the Doctor and Susan stopped the Slarvian eggs from hatching. (PROSE: Childhood Living [+]Samantha Baker, Short Trips: The Centenarian (Short Trips, 2006).)\n\nAfter being given an Ulster coat by Gilbert and Sullivan, (TV: \"The Brink of Disaster\" [+]Part of The Edge of Destruction, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) the Doctor was taken by the Entity and tested to open a door, but the Doctor outsmarted it. (AUDIO: Seven to One [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor began pursuing the Soul Pirates after they stole his hand in a sword fight. Whilst following them, he and Susan arrived in 1900 London, where Susan and a group of children were kidnapped by the Soul Pirates to harvest their body parts for profit. However, the Doctor foiled their plan, rescued Susan and the children, and received a brand-new hand, indistinguishable from the original, from Aldridge. (PROSE: A Big Hand for the Doctor [+]Eoin Colfer, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor accepted an invitation to be a guest speaker at a Time Conference on Refkeet Nine and raged against the local authorities when he discovered he had been lured into a trap so that they could use an abused Nuppino horse to attack him. (COMIC: Time Trick [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Susan arrived on an unnamed jungle planet, where they discovered a crashed colony spaceship with a row of graves, one of which was freshly dug. They then met Bethan Finch, a salvage operative waiting for her partner Tino Driscoll. After some searching, the group found Tino, who had been reduced to a primitive state due to the planet's ecology. The Doctor and Susan quickly made their departure after saying goodbye. (PROSE: The Arboreals [+]Marc Platt, The Scientific Secrets of Doctor Who (2015).)\n\nThe Doctor was forced to land the TARDIS on Earth in the 1960s to make some repairs. After fixing the TARDIS, he went to look for Susan, who had gone exploring, and encountered the Cybermen. After finding Susan, the Doctor defeated the Cybermen by blasting them with sound waves of music. (PROSE: Dr. First [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nNeeding to retrieve the TARDIS from the Tower of London, the Doctor argued with Henry VIII and was sent to the Tower, where he could escape in the TARDIS. (TV: \"Strangers in Space\" [+]Part of The Sensorites, Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) The Doctor later wrote a letter to apologise for his actions. (PROSE: \"Taken to the Tower\" [+]Part of The Time Lord Letters, Justin Richards, BBC Books (2015). The Doctor and Susan then visited Nostradamus and his wife in 1555, with Madame Nostradamus giving Susan an embroidered handkerchief and the Doctor a long scarf. (PROSE: \"Unpredictable Tastes\" [+]Part of The Time Lord Letters, Justin Richards, BBC Books (2015).)\n\nThe Doctor and Susan were present in London during the coronation of Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953, where they were pursued by a creature with lasers spewing out of its one eye. They were saved when the creature was subdued by Eva De Ville. (COMIC: Where's the Doctor? [+]Doctor Who The Official Annual 2019 (Doctor Who annual, BBC Children's Books, 2018).)\n\nAfter landing in Germany in the 16th century, the Doctor and Susan teamed up with magistrate Rudolf von Slesinger and an inquisitor, Johann Eck, to protect Martin Luther from two assassins ahead of his trial. Instantly suspicious of Slesinger's odd behaviour, the Doctor sent Susan undercover as a servant girl and discovered that Slesinger had deployed the assassins in a plot to kill Luther in secret. Before he could kill anyone, Slesinger was apprehended by Eck. Afterwards, the Doctor and Susan decided to remain in Germany for the trial of Martin Luther. (PROSE: The Price of Conviction [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Susan unwittingly travelled to 2134 Paris, where they became embroiled in political intrigue in the run-up to an election in the city of Urrozdinee. (PROSE: Urrozdinee [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who Yearbooks (1994).)\n\nArriving at central Europe in the 16th century, Susan noticed what looked like a meteorite and tossed it out, thinking it unimportant, but soon came to realise that it was a part of a Liciax ship. When she tried to find what she had carelessly discarded, it was gone. With the help of a man named Lovey, she and the Doctor traced it to Prague, where they found it had been shaped into a golem that had developed sentience and was also on a murderous rampage. The Doctor and Susan trapped it in the attic of a Jewish synagogue, placing it under a security system, to which only they knew the access codes. (PROSE: Life from Lifelessness [+]Keith R.A. DeCandido, Short Trips: Destination Prague (Short Trips short stories, 2007).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS landed in Berlin in November 1932, the Doctor decided to go and visit a convention of scientists at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, wanting especially to meet the director of the Institute, Fritz Haber. However, he made the mistake of exchanging Ancient Roman gold coins for banknotes at a local jewellery shop. This brought suspicions on him and Susan because Haber was believed to be studying a way to extract gold from seawater. As a consequence, he was apprehended for interrogation by German secret service, together with Haber, and kept in an unused lab in the Institute. He was eventually freed when Susan tricked Pollitt, a British agent, into showing him the secret of their gold. (AUDIO: The Alchemists [+]Ian Potter, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor and Susan travelled to Bridgetown on the planet Quinnis in the fourth universe. They nearly lost the TARDIS when it was washed away during a severe flood. They recovered it with the assistance of a huntsman named Evalihi Parch IV, who possessed an ornithopter. (AUDIO: Quinnis [+]Marc Platt, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) Whilst on Quinnis, the Doctor was trained to be a ninja. (PROSE: The Devil Goblins from Neptune [+]Martin Day and Keith Topping, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) Around this time, the Doctor realised that he and Susan had been losing their memory since they began travelling in the TARDIS due to the telepathic circuits attacking their minds. This prompted their search for somewhere to take residence and recover from the memory loss. (PROSE: Echoes of Future Past [+]John Summerfield, Brief Encounter (1991).)\n\nThe Doctor took a brief trip to St Albans on 17 December 1997 to ensure that the United Kingdom would remain safe during the 1960s, and had a near-miss encounter with the Fourth Doctor, Romana II and K9. (PROSE: The Little Things [+]Paul Beardsley, Short Trips: A Christmas Treasury (Short Trips short stories, 2004).)\n\nAccording to one account, the TARDIS initially landed on Barnes Common, where Susan took on the surname \"English\" and the Doctor had Barbara Wright tutor her in history at twenty pounds a week while he busied himself with research. (PROSE: Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, adapted from The Daleks (Terry Nation), Target novelisations (Frederick Muller Ltd, 1964).)\n\nAccording to another account, while the TARDIS was in flight in deep space during 1963, the Father of Time materialised inside the TARDIS control room, having resolved to test the Doctor. He forced the TARDIS to land on a radioactive planet that had begun to be torn apart from the inside, with the \"Test of Time\" being to escape from the apocalypse. The Doctor and Susan took refuge down a mineshaft, and \"rode out the storm\" safe at the very heart of the planet. Satisfied with their quick thinking, the Father of Time transported them back into the TARDIS, which he deposited at 76 Totter's Lane, London in the 1960s, foretelling that they would find \"a new life\" there. (COMIC: The Test of Time [+]Tim Quinn and Dicky Howett, The Doctor Who Fun Book stories (Target Books, 1987).)\n\nAccording to a third account, while making a short trip to the planet Tacunda, the Doctor and Susan uncovered a \"Blessing Star\", a crystal that altered the laws of probability around the holder, essentially making their dreams come true. The Doctor tried the device, wishing that he could pilot the TARDIS to 20th century Earth. He was successful at piloting the ship, though it completely fried the navigational system, stranding the Doctor and Susan in I.M. Foreman's junkyard in Totter's Lane, London in 1963. (PROSE: The Rag & Bone Man's Story [+]Colin Brake, Short Trips: Repercussions (Short Trips, 2004).)\n\nUpon their arrival, Susan questioned whether her grandfather had truly intended to land there, or if the TARDIS had made another mistake. The Doctor confirmed it was no mistake, believing that it would be a \"fine place to keep the TARDIS hidden from prying eyes\". When Susan questioned what made Earth so special, the Doctor told her that he just had a \"good feeling\". (COMIC:  Untitled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Susan took up residence in a Totter's Lane junkyard in Shoreditch, London to allow Susan to complete her education, and so the Doctor could affect repairs and build missing components for the TARDIS. According to this account, Susan's admission to Coal Hill School was in late March. (PROSE: Time and Relative [+]Kim Newman, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2001).) According to another account, Susan and the Doctor arrived in Shoreditch in June 1963. (AUDIO: Hunters of Earth [+]Nigel Robinson, Destiny of the Doctor (Big Finish Productions, 2013).) While the Third Doctor claimed that Susan gave herself the surname \"Foreman\" from I.M. Foreman, (PROSE: Interference - Book Two [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) Susan recalled that it was the Doctor who gave her the surname \"Foreman\". (PROSE: Legacy of the Daleks [+]John Peel, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) After arriving in 20th century England, the Doctor spent months stealing parts to repair his TARDIS, even though he had access to the appropriate currency, (AUDIO: Hunters of Earth [+]Nigel Robinson, Destiny of the Doctor (Big Finish Productions, 2013).) and sold a few \"harmless\" alien artefacts to Fyodor, a frightening alien disguised as an old man, in order to pay for Susan's school lunches. (AUDIO: The Shoreditch Intervention [+]Alan Barnes, Susan's War (Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nAlthough the Doctor did not venture out very often, (TV: \"An Unearthly Child\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) he had visited a library, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) was familiar with the owner of the local café, (TV: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988).) and spent many \"happy hours\" taking the Hand of Omega for \"walks\". (PROSE: Alien Bodies [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) The Doctor first encountered River Song when he caught her sneaking around the junkyard where his TARDIS was located, but he was unaware of her identity, and River fled when she heard Susan calling for him. (GAME: The Eternity Clock [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAccording to one account, the Doctor did not have the Hand of Omega when he left Gallifrey. While walking one evening to pick up Susan from school, he encountered his seventh incarnation lurking in a dark street. The Seventh Doctor revealed that he had brought the Hand of Omega, and, claiming that the Hand knew what to do, left without revealing any details of his life to his bewildered younger self. (PROSE: Echoes of Future Past [+]John Summerfield, Brief Encounter (1991).)\n\nOn one cold evening, (PROSE: Ash [+]Trevor Baxendale, Short Trips: A Universe of Terrors (Short Trips, 2003).) the Doctor and Susan went to the Ritz Theatre on Totter's Lane, where the Doctor continually and rudely pointed out inaccuracies in a film about the fall of Rome. After an usherette named Smith told them to leave, (PROSE: Have You Seen This Man? [+]various authors, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) the Doctor and Susan got lost in the dense fog, eventually meeting a girl named Joan Calder and sheltered at her home, where they met her mother and grandfather. During the visit, the house burst into flames and, on the Doctor's instruction, Susan broke a mirror in the house. The elder Calder crumbled into ash and the fire abated. Although the Doctor was never able to adequately explain the event, it was related to the fact that the house had been levelled during the London Blitz two decades earlier. The Doctor postulated that Susan's action likely freed Joan and her mother from their \"nightmarish existence\", but he wasn't sure. (PROSE: Ash [+]Trevor Baxendale, Short Trips: A Universe of Terrors (Short Trips, 2003).)\n\nOn 1 and 2 April 1963 while Susan was attending Coal Hill School, London was consumed by winter weather in the middle of spring, as a result of an extra-dimensional called the Cold awakening. After being coerced by Susan, the Doctor reluctantly decided to interfere in events, and defeated the Cold by depositing it on Pluto in the far future, taking five trips to get there. He then embarked on his journey back to Susan in 1963. (PROSE: Time and Relative [+]Kim Newman, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2001).)\n\nThe Doctor arrived on Wengrol in the Crab Nebula, the furthest the TARDIS had ever travelled at that point. He was captured by Yend scientists looking for a way to stabilise their constant shapeshifting. Fomal, the Chief Yend, asked him to take a case of unmutated Yend embryos to a new system, but when the Doctor took the case into the TARDIS, he discovered that the embryos were all dead. (PROSE: The Sons of the Crab [+]The Dr Who Annual 1966 (Doctor Who annual, 1965).)\n\nLanding on Vortis, the Doctor was captured by the Menoptera, who believed that he was a member of the race attacking them. He escaped, only to encounter a group of Atlanteans whose spacecraft had crashed on Vortis a year earlier. The Atlanteans mistook the Doctor for a human scientist and asked for his help in repairing their ship. The Doctor, claiming that the necessary parts were in his ship, returned to the TARDIS, where he watched as the Atlanteans were caught in a battle between the Menoptera and the Zarbi and killed. (PROSE: The Lost Ones [+]The Dr Who Annual 1966 (Doctor Who annual, 1965).)\n\nThe Doctor landed on Earth in 1966. While leaving the TARDIS unattended, two children, Tony and Amy Barker, and their dog, Butch, entered the ship and accidentally locked themselves inside. When the Doctor returned, he dematerialised the TARDIS and arrived on the Sense Sphere, where he was forced to kill a Zilgan to save his life. The Sensorites captured him and planned to execute him for his crime, but he was rescued by Tony and Amy. The three made their way back to the TARDIS and the Doctor returned the children to their own time. (PROSE: The Monsters from Earth [+]The Dr Who Annual 1966 (Doctor Who annual, 1965).)\n\nThe Doctor visited Vortis again, at a time in which the Zarbi Supremo had moved the planet to the solar system. With the aid of Gordon Hamilton, he freed the crew of the Solar Queen from the Supremo's control, allowing them to turn on and kill the Zarbi leader. (PROSE: The Lair of Zarbi Supremo [+]David Whitaker, The Dr Who Annual 1966 (World Distributors, 1965).)\n\nThe Doctor landed in London during the Great Fire of 1666, where he reluctantly rescued the Mortimer family: farmer George, his wife Helen and their children, Ida and Alan. Much to his annoyance, they believed he was a warlock and the TARDIS was powered by magic. The TARDIS arrived on a spacecraft leading an Andromedan armada, where they encountered androids called Aalas and met the One, the intelligence controlling the ship. When the Doctor refused to help the One invade the Milky Way, this disobedience caused it to malfunction, and it self-destructed when Ida threw a bowl at one of its screens. The Doctor and the Mortimers departed, leaving the armada drifting aimlessly in space. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Invasion from Space [+]J. L. Morrissey, World Distributors and Ltd (1966).)\n\nThe Doctor eventually arrived back in 1963 at the exact instant he had departed. He claimed to have had an eventful trip, but upon inspecting the TARDIS logs, Susan noted that he'd taken five trips to reach Pluto, and more than a dozen to get back to Foreman's Yard. On his return, the Doctor told Susan that the TARDIS had been damaged taking the Cold to Pluto, but he insisted that he'd \"have it fixed in no time\". (PROSE: Time and Relative [+]Kim Newman, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2001).)\n\nOut for a walk while thinking of where to hide the Hand of Omega, the Doctor's seventh incarnation appeared in his past self's life on a mission from the White Guardian to steal the TARDIS Instruction Manual. Unbeknownst to the First Doctor, the Seventh Doctor saved him from an Imperial Dalek and made off with the instruction manual in the confusion. (COMIC: Time & Time Again [+]Paul Cornell, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics, 1993).) On 7 August 1963, (AUDIO: The Shoreditch Intervention [+]Alan Barnes, Susan's War (Big Finish Productions, 2020).) the Doctor hid the Hand of Omega at an undertaker's. (TV: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988).)\n\nThe Doctor was placed on trial for murder after he killed the werewolf Roberta Sampson with a silver bullet in self-defence, but was acquitted by the jury, which was made up partly of his second, third, fifth and eighth incarnations. (PROSE: The Juror's Story [+]Eddie Robson, Short Trips: Repercussions (Short Trips, 2004).)\n\nAfter witnessing a man explode into a protoplasmic mass at a beat poetry reading, the Doctor and Susan traced the unusual death to a British government project, Operation Proteus. They discovered the project was being run by an alien named Raldonn, who was mutating humans to turn one into his own species so that he would have a co-pilot to help him fly his ship back home. Unfortunately, his efforts relied on a lethal virus that threatened all London. After reversing the effects of the virus, the Doctor and Susan returned to the TARDIS in Totter's Lane. (COMIC: Operation Proteus [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1995).)\n\nIn October 1963, after legally purchasing parts to repair the TARDIS from Magpie Electricals, the Doctor was threatened by a group of teenagers, before they stopped and apologised. When the Doctor arrived at a warehouse to collect the parts, Colonel Rook revealed that he had tricked the Doctor into meeting him, as Rook wanted the Doctor to fight in a war and Susan to help in Britain's ESP experiments. When Susan and Cedric Chivers arrived after being chased by gangs chanting \"aliens out\", the Doctor deduced they were being influenced by a hypersonic weapon transmitted over radio waves that made young people attack anyone who was \"alien\", or different, including the Doctor and Susan. The Doctor devised a means of using Susan's radio and other pieces in the warehouse to transmit a blocking signal that negated the effect of the weapon. After his life was saved, Rook decided against coercing the Doctor and Susan to fight in the war and told them that their \"secret\" would be safe. (AUDIO: Hunters of Earth [+]Nigel Robinson, Destiny of the Doctor (Big Finish Productions, 2013).)\n\nWhen Susan was accompanied back to the 76 Totter's Lane by her new history teacher, Dr. River Song, the Doctor dismissed her quite brusquely, inviting her to \"mind [her] own business\". (AUDIO: An Unearthly Woman [+]Matt Fitton, The Diary of River Song: Series Six (The Diary of River Song, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nWhen a thick fog engulfed Shoreditch, the Doctor decided to pick Susan up from Coal Hill personally, but, when he arrived, the school came under attack from humanoid figures with blood covered faces. With the aid of Shivani Bajwa, the Doctor was able to figure out that the wolf-like figures were aliens and that the fog was turning humans into Space wolves. After Shivani was transformed into a wolf, the Doctor restored her and, using his signet ring, he transmitted a message through the fog to get the wolves to retreat. However, his manipulations to the fog caused Shivani's flower garden to die out, so he promised to deliver roses to help the garden regrow. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Horror of Coal Hill [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter investigating an alien insect that he planned to return home, (PROSE: Those Left Behind [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor returned to the junkyard to find that two of Susan's teachers, Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, had followed her home. The Doctor tried to encourage them to leave, but they confronted him and forced themselves into the TARDIS. Against Susan's wishes, he launched the TARDIS, kidnapping them so they couldn't tell anyone about them. (TV: \"An Unearthly Child\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) According to another account, the Doctor first met Ian when Susan was injured by a car crash on Barnes Common, with Ian helping Barbara take Susan back to the TARDIS, and then forcing himself in to return her TARDIS key. In a panic, the Doctor launched the TARDIS. (PROSE: Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, adapted from The Daleks (Terry Nation), Target novelisations (Frederick Muller Ltd, 1964).)\n\nIn the first account, they travelled to prehistoric times. Kidnapped by a tribesman named Kal, the Doctor was brought to the Tribe of Gum. Susan, Ian and Barbara followed to save him, but Za caught them and placed them all in the Cave of Skulls. (TV: \"The Cave of Skulls\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) The group was freed by Old Mother, but Za and Hur chased them through the Forest of Fear. When a pursuing Za was wounded by a tiger, the Doctor initially refused to help him. He picked up a rock and was prepared to kill Za, until Ian stopped him, (TV: \"The Forest of Fear\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) and a meeting with his eighth incarnation in a time bubble convinced him not to continue his murderous plan. (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) Recaptured and placed back in the cave, the Doctor tricked Kal into revealing he had killed the Old Mother. After Ian and Susan had the idea to set fire to skulls to distract the Tribe and allow them to escape, (TV: \"The Firemaker\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) Barbara told the Doctor the story of Godfather Death by the Brothers Grimm. (PROSE: The Knight, The Fool and The Dead [+]Steve Cole, Time Lord Victorious (BBC Books, 2020).) When the Tribe was distracted, the travellers fled back to the TARDIS, with the Doctor quickly taking off. (TV: \"The Firemaker\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) In the second account, the TARDIS instead landed on Skaro after leaving 1963. (PROSE: Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, adapted from The Daleks (Terry Nation), Target novelisations (Frederick Muller Ltd, 1964).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS landed on Skaro (TV: \"The Firemaker\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) in early 2064, (PROSE: Peaceful Thals Ambushed! [+]TV Century 21 short stories (City Magazines, 1965).) the Doctor claimed that the fluid link needed more mercury, (TV: (TV: \"The Dead Planet\" [+]Part of The Daleks, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) despite there being nothing wrong, (TV: \"The Survivors\" [+]Part of The Daleks, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) so that he could explore a nearby city despite his companion' concerns. The Doctor had planned to explore the city a day after their arrival, but a knock from one of the Thals on the door frightened the other travellers, and they forced the Doctor to take off. The Doctor, still desiring to see the city, removed the fluid link and caused the TARDIS to stall and claim the fluid link's mercury had run out, and that the only likely place to find more was the city itself. \"The Dead Planet\" [+]Part of The Daleks, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) In the city, the Doctor and his friends were captured by the Daleks, confiscating the fluid link they brought along. (TV: \"The Survivors\" [+]Part of The Daleks, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) When they escaped, (TV: \"The Ambush\" [+]Part of The Daleks, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) they struck an alliance with the Dalek's enemy, the Thals, (TV: \"The Expedition\" [+]Part of The Daleks, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) and them assisted in an attack on the Daleks city. (TV: \"The Ordeal\" [+]Part of The Daleks, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) The Daleks' power supply was damaged in the attack. The Daleks died and their plans to flood the atmosphere with radiation failed. (TV: \"The Rescue\" [+]Part of The Daleks, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) However, the Doctor had seen the evil of the Daleks and made it his mission in life to combat threats similar to them. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nWith the fluid link retrieved, the Doctor left Skaro for Earth, using the fast return switch. The spring in the switch was damaged, causing it to be stuck. The TARDIS was sent to the beginning of a solar system (TV: \"The Brink of Disaster\" [+]Part of The Edge of Destruction, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) and everyone was knocked out on the trip. The TARDIS tried warning the crew about the atoms forming around them when they came to, but the Doctor assumed that this was Ian and Barbara sabotaging the ship. (TV: \"The Edge of Destruction\" [+]Part of The Edge of Destruction, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) Once Barbara figured out what was going on, the Doctor fixed the spring, ending the fault, and apologised to his companions. (TV: \"The Brink of Disaster\" [+]Part of The Edge of Destruction, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) After this incident, the Doctor's relationship with Ian and Barbara became warmer, and he began to learn about and respect their humanity. (COMIC: Hunters of the Burning Stone [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2013).)\n\nWith the TARDIS still recovering from leaving Skaro, the Doctor landed on Mechanistria and met the Korad named Drako alone. After a narrow escape from the Mechanistrians, the Doctor took Drake back in time ten million years, where Drako hoped to prevent his world from becoming overly mechanised. (PROSE: Peril in Mechanistria [+]The Dr Who Annual 1966 (Doctor Who annual, 1965).)\n\nStill heavily damaged and malfunctioning, the TARDIS found its way to Earth, but did not make it to 1963. Instead, it landed in the Plain of Pamir in 1289. There, the Doctor and his companions met Marco Polo. Polo took the TARDIS and its keys on his caravan to the breadth of Cathay to hand to Kublai Khan as part of a bargain for his return to Venice. (TV: \"The Roof of the World\" [+]Part of Marco Polo, John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) Along the way, the Mongol warlord, Tegana, also part of Polo's caravan, tried to take the TARDIS for Nogai as part of his plan to assassinate Kublai. In the chaos of Tegana and Polo's duel in Peking, the Doctor and his companions escaped in the repaired TARDIS. (TV: \"Assassin at Peking\" [+]Part of Marco Polo, John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).)\n\nFinding themselves in what appeared to be an English forest, the TARDIS crew discovered a medieval camp, a crashed spaceship, and were attacked by a dragon before being rescued by a knight. Taken to a nearby castle, they learned of a current conflict against the sorcerer Marton Dhal, who sought further power by acquiring Merlin's old artefacts. Participating in a quest to gain Merlin's Helm, the Doctor and Ian learned that the \"magic\" was the result of a complex nanobot network that allowed those skilled in its use to manipulate the world around them. With tutoring from the leprechaun Kilvenny Odoyle, the Doctor was able to learn how to use the world's magic himself, joining Odoyle and witch Anni Glassfeather in a final duel against Gramling, Dahl's former master, who had manipulated Dahl in the name of his own dreams of power. With Dahl defeated, the Doctor was able to arrange for the nanobot network to be disabled, leaving the people to learn how to cope without magic. (PROSE: The Sorcerer's Apprentice [+]Christopher Bulis, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).)\n\nThe Doctor arrived in Greenland in 1002 due to a leak in the TARDIS' plutonium battery. He enlisted the aid of Eric the Red and his Viking crew to take him and his companions to Newfoundland to get the materials he needed for his ship. They were nearly left behind in Nova Scotia, but the Doctor convinced the Vikings to take them back. (PROSE: Who Discovered America? [+]John Lucarotti, DWM short stories (1992).)\n\nThe TARDIS landed on an island on Marinus, where Arbitan asked the Doctor and his friends to search for the keys to the reprogrammed Conscience of Marinus to regain control over the Voord, as all of his other followers and family members failed to retrieve them. When the Doctor refused his aid, Arbitan trapped the TARDIS in a forcefield, preventing the Doctor and his companions' escape. They used Arbitan's travel dials to reach Morphoton. (TV: \"The Sea of Death\" [+]Part of The Keys of Marinus, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).) Barbara released Arbitan's daughter, Sabetha, and the rest of the city from the Morpho's mind control, and retrieved the first key. The Doctor jumped ahead to Millennius, the location of the final key, to find Eprin. (TV: \"The Velvet Web\" [+]Part of The Keys of Marinus, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).) Once Ian had found two more keys, he was knocked out and framed for Eprin's murder. (TV: \"The Snows of Terror\" [+]Part of The Keys of Marinus, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).) The Doctor stood as defence at Ian's trial, but Ian was sentenced to death. (TV: \"Sentence of Death\" [+]Part of The Keys of Marinus, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).) The Doctor learnt that one of the conspirators in the murder, the prosecutor, Eyesen, was ready to collect one of the keys and Ian was spared execution. The guards captured Eyesen and the last key was found in the mace that killed Eprin. The Doctor and his companions returned to Arbitan's island, where Arbitan had been murdered. Ian handed the Voord leader, Yartek, a fake key, which destroyed the Conscience, along with the Voord. (TV: \"The Keys of Marinus\" [+]Part of The Keys of Marinus, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).)\n\nArriving inside the tomb of Menkaure in Egypt in 26th century BC, the Doctor, Susan, Ian and Barbara were arrested and taken to the palace. Itennu planned to assassinate Pharaoh Menkaure with a poison dart and then blame the travellers. However, the Doctor inadvertently foiled the attempt with his walking stick and, when a more open attack began, the TARDIS crew fled back to the TARDIS. (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).)\n\nSoon after, the Doctor rescued Joseph Rennigan, the sole survivor of an American space mission that crashed on Mars. (PROSE: Rennigan's Record [+]David Whitaker, DWM short stories (1993).)\n\nOn a \"night\" in the TARDIS, the Doctor caught Susan trying to dissuade Ian and Barbara from exploring the TARDIS due to the \"dangers\" aboard the ship, and decided to give them a brief tour of the TARDIS to show them the so-called dangers were nothing more than what would encountered by \"a zookeeper or a science teacher\". Once he had convinced Susan she had been underestimating Ian and Barbara, the Doctor decided to retire to bed. (COMIC: In-Between Times [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nLanding on an unnamed planet, the Doctor, Susan, Ian and Barbara found a path of skulls laid to honour the dead. (COMIC: The Path of Skulls [+]Richard Dinnick, The Many Lives of Doctor Who (Titan Publishing Group, 2018).)\n\nThe Doctor and his companions arrived in an Aztec temple in Mexico. They went through a one-way passage that prevented access to the TARDIS. Barbara posed as the Aztec god, Yetaxa, with the others as her servants, to find a way back. Barbara tried and failed to change the Aztecs' history of human sacrifice for the better, which the Doctor strongly advised her against. (TV: \"The Temple of Evil\" [+]Part of The Aztecs, John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) Susan was to be punished for denying marriage to the Perfect Victim of the Aztecs' sacrifice (TV: \"The Bride of Sacrifice\" [+]Part of The Aztecs, John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) and Ian to be executed when he was framed by the High Priest of Sacrifice, Tlotoxl, for attacking the High Priest of Knowledge, Autloc. Autloc's faith in Yetaxa was shattered, and he left for the wilderness. The Doctor and Ian distracted Ian and Susan's guard to escape. They worked on a pulley system to open the doorway back to the TARDIS. (TV: \"The Day of Darkness\" [+]Part of The Aztecs, John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).)\n\nAfter the TARDIS sustained some damage, the crew stayed on the planet Fragrance for a while, with the particular atmosphere of the planet caused them to create a strong friendship with a family of locals, to the degree that the Doctor gave the parents of the family, Iamb and Rhyme, a guided tour of the TARDIS when it was repaired. However, when Barbara refused to requite the love of their eldest son, Rhythm, and condemned him to death in doing so according to the usages of the planet, the Doctor sided with Ian and stopped Barbara from changing her mind. He then watched with the others as the young man went across the yellow arc of the planet, walking towards his fate. (AUDIO: The Fragile Yellow Arc of Fragrance [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter leaving Fragrance, the TARDIS landed in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon in 323 BC, where the crew were welcomed by Alexander the Great to his court. They watched as the closest friends of Alexander died as victims of a plot to eventually kill Alexander himself. In the end, when Alexander was poisoned and started to grow weak, the Doctor offered to keep him alive through a rudimentary artificial lung. However, Alexander refused and accepted his fate, but not before asking the Doctor what his legacy would be. The Doctor told him that, though his empire was not to survive without him, Alexander's fame would live forever. (AUDIO: Farewell, Great Macedon [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nShortly afterwards, the Doctor announced to Ian and Barbara that he had found a way to take them home. However, as he was about to do so, the TARDIS was drawn to a nearby dying planet, landing near a giant crystal pyramid. The crew were greeted by the robots living in the pyramid and brought to their leader, the Perfect One, a robot infused with an extraordinary similarity to human brain, to the point that he wished to actually become one. The Perfect One thought that the TARDIS crew belonged to the race of its creators, the Masters of Luxor, and required them to help him become human. When the Doctor claimed that that was impossible, the Perfect One decided to imprison them, but the Doctor and Ian managed to escape. In a nearby canyon under the ground, they found a crypt where Luxor, the creator of the robot, froze himself in a cybercoma. The Doctor and Ian woke him up and brought him back to the pyramid, with the intention of having him confront the Perfect One and prove to him he was just a machine. This resulted in the Perfect One losing control and destroying the pyramid and the other robots out of rage and despair. The TARDIS crew managed to escape in the mayhem. (AUDIO: The Masters of Luxor [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn an attempt to make Ian and Barbara happier, the Doctor spent days searching for a tea plant so he could make the food machine produce tea, though kept them in the dark as to what he was looking for. He eventually found one on a planet that had once been a human colony, though the TARDIS crew had to escape a tribe devoted to guarding the plant. (AUDIO: A Small Semblance of Home [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and his friends next arrived inside a spaceship in the 28th century, where two crewmembers were suspended in a state resembling death and another, John, had had his mind opened and turned insane, following an attack on their minds by the Sensorites. (TV: \"Strangers in Space\" [+]Part of The Sensorites, Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) The Sense Sphere, which the ship had been trapped around, had its aqueducts' water supply poisoned with atropine by survivors of a previous human expedition whose ship had been destroyed. (TV: \"A Desperate Venture\" [+]Part of The Sensorites, Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) The TARDIS' lock was taken by the Sensorites, leaving the Doctor and his companions trapped on the spaceship. (TV: \"Strangers in Space\" [+]Part of The Sensorites, Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) After the Doctor and his companions resisted the Sensorites, (TV: \"The Unwilling Warriors\" [+]Part of The Sensorites, Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) the Doctor, Ian and Susan agreed to go down to the Sense Sphere, (TV: \"Hidden Danger\" [+]Part of The Sensorites, Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) where the Doctor worked out the cure for this \"disease\", which had also afflicted Ian, while the Sensorite scientists treated John. (TV: \"A Race Against Death\" [+]Part of The Sensorites, Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) The Doctor and Ian, followed by Barbara, went to the aqueducts where Atropa belladonna had been growing. They found the human expedition and pretended to be a welcoming party for them and that the \"war\" against the Sensorites was won. The expedition was taken into custody on Maitland's ship. Maitland's ship was free to leave, and the TARDIS crew regained their lock.\n\nGreatly agitated by Ian and Barbara's remarks on his piloting, (TV: \"A Desperate Venture\" [+]Part of The Sensorites, Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) the Doctor landed the TARDIS on board the Endeavour sailing ship in 1770. There, he and Ian met Captain James Cook, but, before Susan and Barbara could exit the ship, it was tossed overboard in a violent storm. Greatly saddened by the loss of the girls, the Doctor and Ian continued on the Endeavour's voyage for several months towards Australia observing the transit of Venus along the way. Their time on the Endeavour ended when they discovered Susan had managed to swim out and attach a line to the sailing ship from the TARDIS and so be pulled along behind it. The travellers' joy at being reunited was short lived when the Doctor became disgruntled again because the TARDIS floor was now covered in patches of water. (AUDIO: The Transit of Venus [+]Jacqueline Rayner, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2009).)\n\nThe TARDIS then landed in France in July 1794 in the middle of their revolution. They were immediately caught in the depth of the war, (TV: \"A Land of Fear\" [+]Part of The Reign of Terror, Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) and Ian, Barbara and Susan were all sentenced to death. (TV: \"Guests of Madame Guillotine\" [+]Part of The Reign of Terror, Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) The Doctor helped find an English spy named James Stirling who could help them to escape. (TV: \"A Bargain of Necessity\" [+]Part of The Reign of Terror, Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) Escaping their jail cells, they made their way through the French and back to the TARDIS, where they made a narrow escape. (TV: \"Prisoners of Conciergerie\" [+]Part of The Reign of Terror, Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).)\n\nAfter escaping from France, the Doctor wanted to relax, but found himself on a planet with a fast time rate, and discovered that the entire civilisation of the planet had been based around him, Ian, and the TARDIS. He and Ian then watched the rise and fall of the civilisation in a matter of minutes. (AUDIO: Rise and Fall [+]George Mann, Short Trips - Volume I (Short Trips, Big Finish Productions, 2010).)\n\nThe TARDIS crew decided to spend some time on holiday in 5th Century Alexandria around the time where the famous Library would be destroyed. The Doctor greatly enjoyed reading the books contained in the rich collection of the place, but was greatly displeased when Ian started forming a close relationship with the philosopher Hypatia, because he feared that would lead her to discover their secret. He then decided to depart, but stopped when Ian brought him a book, which the Doctor immediately recognised as belonging to the Mims and containing a detailed plan of invasion for Earth. He wanted to take it away, but Hypatia stopped him, moments before the Mims attack the Library to retrieve the book. In the following confrontation, the book was destroyed, and the Doctor, using a rudimentary megaphone, was able to talk to the Mims and persuade them they had nothing to fear anymore. The crew then departed, but not before the Doctor managed to sneak onboard some books he saved from the destruction of the Library. (AUDIO: The Library of Alexandria [+]Simon Guerrier, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2013).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS was drawn out of the vortex by a mysterious noise, the Doctor, Susan, Ian and Barbara landed on EBV Nevermore. Here they encountered the ship's captain, Rostrum, who was a plant. The Doctor was appalled that Earth was making holes in the universe for navigational purposes, but they ended up being navigational hazards. Susan told her grandfather about the First Mate and they both worked out that this was why Rostrum's leaves were dying as he was sabotaging the ship to save his universe. (AUDIO: Here There Be Monsters [+]Andy Lane, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2008).)\n\nThe TARDIS landed in Seville, where the Doctor asked Barbara to show him around, as she had once been there on holiday. He pretended to be a cardinal from Rome with Susan in order to try and release Ian from the Spanish Inquisition, but he was found out and sentenced to death before Susan and Barbara saved him. When he heard from Barbara that Ian went to Cadiz to help Esteban Aribi on his mission, the Doctor thought he was trying to change history, so attempted to stop him. But quickly found out that Ian was part of history, and his intervention would not change anything. (AUDIO: The Flames of Cadiz [+]Marc Platt, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2013).)\n\nThe TARDIS landed on Destination, where the Doctor encountered the Inventor Master for the first time since leaving Gallifrey. The Doctor was at first willing to sit and watch the city people and the Dalmari resolve their war before deciding that, as a member of the Master's race, it was his responsibility to do all he could. Spending two years ruling the planet, the Doctor brought peace to Destination before Ian and Barbara, having overpowered the Master, returned with the TARDIS whereupon the Doctor locked the Master away, saying that one day he might come back. (AUDIO: The Destination Wars [+]Matt Fitton, The First Doctor Adventures: Volume One (The First Doctor Adventures, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nThe TARDIS then landed in New York City in the year 1888, shortly before the Great White Hurricane where they were caught in a gang scuffle. While Ian was injured and taken to hospital, Susan had been taken away by Patrick Ellis with the Doctor's outrage at the police over this resulting in him being arrested for a night. Befriending Patrick's brother, Daniel Ellis, the Doctor found himself caught in the gang war between the Alley Dogs and the Wild Boars as he tried to reunite with Susan, brokering a temporary peace between the gangs and the police to rescue her and Patrick from the ice. Upon returning to the TARDIS, the Doctor attempted to use a temporal slingshot to return Ian and Barbara to their time. (AUDIO: The Great White Hurricane [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe slingshot took them to the planet Ashtallah, home of the Ashtallans, an immortal race with prodigious healing abilities. After witnessing their cells quickly healing Barbara, the Doctor discussed many scientific concepts with Brenna before a mysterious plague began killing the aliens. After the Doctor had helped Brenna create a method via which the Ashtallans could reproduce, Susan found that Sharlan had been killing their people, via a sample of Barbara's blood. Once the spread had been halted, the group left the planet, pondering the impact they'd had on the Ashtallans. (AUDIO: The Invention of Death [+]John Dorney, The First Doctor Adventures: Volume Two (The First Doctor Adventures, Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS landed in 19th century Japan before it was opened to Westerners, the Doctor and Barbara were taken prisoner at the orders of the daimyo Takagi Mamoru, while Ian and Susan managed to escape, as Mamoru suspected the two of being spies from England, sent to spy on his preparation for a revolt against the Emperor, who was about to open the country to strangers. The Doctor and Barbara tried to escape, but ended up being involved, together with Ian and Susan, in a battle between Mamoru's samurais and the Emperor's forces. As a defeated Mamoru sat in sadness, the Doctor comforted him, telling him that it would not be the end for Japan, and sharing in their common feeling of loneliness due to old age. The crew then departed after Susan retrieved the TARDIS from a nearby swap, where it had fallen into the water. (AUDIO: The Barbarians and the Samurai [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nSoon afterwards, the TARDIS landed in Tyre, where they won the favour of Princess Elissa and the ire of King Pygmalion. The group attempted to flee on the king's prized ship but the Doctor failed to board in time. Left behind, the Doctor was imprisoned before he befriended Aiyaruc who freed him and brought him to the site of the future Carthage. Reunited with his friends, the Doctor helped defeat Pygmalion's invasion fleet, before using the TARDIS to paint him and his friends as emissaries of the gods, allowing them to go free. Shortly after take off however, the TARDIS wound up in a hostile region of space-time, crash landing on a temporally unstable planet. (AUDIO: The Phoenicians [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThrown clear of the crash, the Doctor mourned for the loss of his ship, snapping at his companions, especially when Susan claimed that the planet was inhabited by Xesto. When the group had met Horl and Katta, the Doctor theorised about the planet's unusual properties before the group was taken to see Nocta, who'd survived so long by hiding in a Zero Cabinet. When exploring the ship that held the Cabinet however, the Doctor was devoured by a Xesto. The nature of death on this world left him trapped outside of time with alternate versions of himself and a mysterious woman. Though the woman showed him how to reach out to Susan, he quickly butted heads with her over his treatment of Susan before realising that she was a future version of his granddaughter. When both Susans met, the Doctor encouraged them to touch and exploit the Blinovitch Limitation Effect. Thrown back to the moment of the crash, the elder Susan encouraged the Doctor to listen to Susan's plan to redirect power from the TARDIS force field, allowing him to avert the crash. (AUDIO: Tick-Tock World [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nA later attempt to use the fast return switch to get Ian and Barbara home, resulted in the group's return to Skaro, fifty cycles after their last visit. Brought to the Thal City, the Doctor was introduced to Tryana before the two, along with Ian, returned to the Dalek City to find the missing Susan and Jyden. Finding that power still thrummed in the city, the Doctor grew increasingly suspicious of Tryana before they reunited with the children and Tryana revealed herself to be in league with the Dalek Supreme who claimed to want peace. Remaining to validate this claim, the Doctor found a secret tunnel leading out of the City and was quickly taken prisoner as Ian escaped and Tryana was killed. Kept alive for the secret of the TARDIS, the Doctor was marched back to the Thal City where he was rescued. Free, the Doctor reprogrammed the ionising towers to attack the Daleks, after which Ian overloaded the power to the Dalek City, before the group left Skaro again. (AUDIO: Return to Skaro [+]Andrew Smith, The First Doctor Adventures: Volume Four (The First Doctor Adventures, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nThe TARDIS then landed in Ekaterinburg, shortly before the Russian Civil War, where Ian and the Doctor were quickly taken prisoner, befriending Makerenkov, a fellow prisoner. After the Doctor had confirmed the health of Nicholas II, Yakov Yurovsky took him to a forest where the Romanovs would be buried after their execution where the Doctor realised Makenrenkov to be part of the conspiracy. Racing back to the house, the Doctor gathered his companions only for Nicholas II to have already accepted death, urging the travellers to flee. Racing back to the TARDIS before they could be executed, the Doctor pondered the Laws of Time and whether or not he had a moral imperative to intervene, even with a fixed point in time. Before he could muse further, the TARDIS unexpectedly lost all power. (AUDIO: Last of the Romanovs [+]Jonathan Barnes, The First Doctor Adventures: Volume Four (The First Doctor Adventures, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nFollowing the TARDIS suddenly losing power, Susan helped her grandfather force a system reboot that forced the ship to land in a sewer in the human settlement of Urth. Given the humans' xenophobia, the travellers were forced to submit to a genetic scan. Having only time to program one false reading into the machine, the Doctor insisted Susan go first, intending for Ian and Barbara to look after her, only for the genetic drift of humanity making Susan the only one of the four who actually read as human. Thrown into a cell, the Doctor befriended the gestalt being Brooskin whom he engaged in a medical and scientific discussion before Susan, in the good graces of Mummy Martial managed to free him and Brooskin. Freed, the Doctor liberated the settlement from Daddy Dominus before representatives from the larger group of human colonies arrived. Convinced that the problems would sort themselves, the Doctor led his companions back to the updated TARDIS and took off again, annoyed to find that his ship was still not working properly. (AUDIO: For the Glory of Urth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen Susan pulled a Golithan Spiney Back Beetle out of the console, the Doctor was convinced that she'd reparied the TARDIS and made another attempt to return Ian and Barbara to their time only to wind up in 1601. When the four sought to see a play by William Shakespeare, they found the Globe Theatre shuttered and a volatile political climate. Rescued by Judith Shakespeare, the four were brought to Shakespeare's home. When Susan and Judith ran off, becoming involved in Lady Penelope Rich's plot to dethrone Elizabeth I, the Doctor confronted his granddaughter at the Globe but she refused to listen. After this had resulted in Shakespeare's arrest, Susan and the Doctor attempted to free him only for the Doctor to be arrested upon identifying himself. Speaking with Shakespeare again, the Doctor was soon freed by Queen Elizabeth, who had befriended Susan and brought a quick end to the conflict. When the time came to leave, Susan, Barbara and Ian expressed a desire to stay and see a play before an outside source activated the TARDIS and sent it flying away from England. (AUDIO: The Hollow Crown [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor then visited Kandalinga alone, where he freed the Fishmen from the clutches of the Voord and stopped their leader from stealing his TARDIS. (PROSE: The Fishmen of Kandalinga [+]The Dr Who Annual 1966 (Doctor Who annual, 1965).)\n\nAfter they were separated from Ian and Barbara at the walls of Masada in 73 AD, the Doctor and Susan worked with Flavius Silva as military advisors, and they were able to persuade him to spare Ian and Barbara by convincing him they were their spies. (PROSE: The Last Days [+]Rebecca Levene, Short Trips (BBC Short Trips, 1998).)\n\nWhile visiting a dying world, Barbara was infected by an alien parasite which distorted her memories until the Doctor saved her. (PROSE: Nothing at the End of the Lane [+]Daniel O'Mahony, Short Trips and Side Steps (BBC Short Trips, 2000).)\n\nArriving in Afghanistan in 1842 during the First Afghan War, the Doctor lost Ian when he was kidnapped by a brutal Gilzia chieftain called Gul Zaheer. Unable to track them down, the Doctor spent a month gathering Afghan allies to help him rescue Ian and another British prisoner, Symonds. But he was too late to stop Zaheer killing Symonds, so an enraged Ian killed Zaheer by throwing him into a pit. (PROSE: Mire and Clay [+]Gareth Wigmore, Short Trips: A Universe of Terrors (Short Trips, 2003).)\n\nDuring a visit to Chicago in 2006, the Doctor lost the TARDIS in a bet with a businessman named Buchanan, who intended to auction off the time machine. Hiring a 60s Oldsmobile 88, the Doctor and his friends travelled to Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Missouri, and the Doctor finally won the TARDIS back in Santa Monica. (PROSE: The Mother Road [+]Gareth Wigmore, Short Trips: Farewells (Short Trips, 2006).)\n\nShortly after, the Doctor and Ian stopped a Blue plague in 2908 Prague. (PROSE: Room for Improvement [+]James A. Moore, Short Trips: Destination Prague (Short Trips, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor next travelled to London during World War II and discovered the Bansharai, alien shapeshifters who survived on emotions, had been posing as dead people to make the wishes of their loved ones come true. (PROSE: Tell Me You Love Me [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor stopped a suicidal crew leader, Provost Rowd, from wiping out the last remnants of the dying Metraxis, and he later assisted a new leader, Egrabil, to find a new home for the Metraxi. (AUDIO: A Star is Born [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nArriving in 20th century Russia in pursuit of an alien artifact, the TARDIS crew met Grigori Rasputin and learnt that the artifact had driven some hunters from a nearby village mad. As they progressed to the hut where the object was kept, the influence of the artifact affected both the Doctor, who grew weaker to the point of almost dying, and Susan, who seemingly was driven mad and fled into the forest. The Doctor got better when Rasputin grabbed the object and absorbed its knowledge of the future. With Ian's help, the Doctor was able to drain almost all knowledge out of Rasputin's mind, only leaving some traces of it. (AUDIO: The Wanderer [+]Richard Dinnick, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2012).)\n\nThe Doctor, Susan, Ian and Barbara also visited Bob Dovie at 59A Barnsfield Crescent in Totton, Hampshire on 23 November 1963. (AUDIO: The Light at the End [+]Nicholas Briggs, Big Finish Doctor Who Special Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2013).)\n\nThe First Doctor teamed up with all of his other incarnations to save Gallifrey from destruction at the end of the Last Great Time War, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) even joining them on the surface of the planet to save people from natural disasters that were occurring as a result of their attempt to shift it into another dimension. Shortly after meeting for tea with his other incarnations to celebrate in the Under Gallery, (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) the First Doctor lost all memory of the events due to the timelines not being synchronised. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS landed on Hydra, the crew became caught in the war between the refugees and the Voord, and the Doctor and Barbara first risked drowning and then were captured by the Voord. The Doctor healed himself thanks to a self-induced coma, but the Voord thought he was dead and disposed of him. The Doctor became the leader of Hydra resistance, and was eventually able to think of a plan to destroy the Voord's main central power station. The Voord leader, Nebrin, attempted to stop him by threatening Susan's life, but she was saved by another Voord, Tarlak, and the attack was eventually a success. Hydra was thus released, and the travellers could depart once again. (AUDIO: Domain of the Voord [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn the ship Endurance, the TARDIS crew were caught in the middle of a fight between the Last Borns, led by the scientist Myla, and their enemies, the Shifts, a lizard-like species also created by the scientist Myla. The Doctor and Ian were captured by the Shift's leader, Arran, and from him learned the whole story. Later, they were freed by the intervention of Myla and other soldiers and brought to the other ship of the Last Borns, the Resistance, but the Doctor was severely injured in the process and brought to the infirmary. As he laid there, the ship was attacked and the infirmary was cut off from the rest of the ship, trapping inside the Doctor and a young physician, Olivan. By that time, though, the Doctor had recovered, and together he and Olivan worked out a way to get out and contact the main deck, so that the Doctor was able to join the others for the final fight against Arran. When all was ended, he gave precious advice to the new leaders of the Last Borns before departing. (AUDIO: The Age of Endurance [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn the planet Malkus, the Doctor, Ian and Barbara got separated from Susan following an accident. Searching, they found her at the ruins of an empty military facility outside the city, where she and another man, Virgil Winters, had destroyed an evil plan of exploiting \"gifted\" people as weapons, as Susan's latent telepathic powers had been ignited by the atmosphere of Malkus. (AUDIO: E is for... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nArriving on the planet Sarath in the city of Arkhaven, facing destruction as its moon descended towards the planet, the TARDIS crew were separated when a meteor strike hit the building the ship had landed on, resulting in the Doctor and Ian being taken to an NC2 camp while Susan was sent to hospital and Barbara was lost in the sewers. Although he lost his key to the TARDIS during a fight in the camp, the Doctor was able to tell his story to Captain Benadik Lant, who passed it on to Mayor Brantus Draad, who asked the Doctor to help them complete work on the ship that would take the survivors to Mirath in exchange for the facilities to build a new key. During his time working on the Ship, the Doctor realised that it was a monstrous deception, but despite being distracted by the twisted actions of Monitor, the city's supervisory A.I., who had created android duplicates of Susan and several others, the Doctor was able to help the citizens of Arkhaven leave their dying world in a landing module that had been upgraded with a life capsule from the TARDIS, giving the ship more interior space without increasing its mass. (PROSE: City at World's End [+]Christopher Bulis, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nAfter the TARDIS materialised in 12th century Nottingham, the Doctor, Susan Ian and Barbara found themselves meeting the Sheriff of Nottingham and Robin Hood, who looked identical to Ian. After Robin was killed during an attack on Nottingham's castle to rescue Susan and Maid Marion from the Sheriff, Ian handed out gold to the villagers, creating the legend of Robin Hood. (PROSE: The Thief of Sherwood [+]Jonathan Morris, Short Trips: Past Tense (Short Trips, 2004).)\n\nIn another attempt to return Ian and Barbara home, the TARDIS malfunctioned, and they landed in a place filled with giant bugs and long, winding paths. Ian and Susan found a gigantic matchbox, while the Doctor and Barbara found a worm. Ian was trapped in the matchbox, which was taken by a man named Farrow, just as the Doctor realised that they were on Earth, but they had been shrunk down to the size of an inch. Farrow met with Mark Forester to tell him that his insecticide had been rejected, and was killed by Forester. The crew, looking for Ian, heard the gunshot and ran to the scene, where they were menaced by a cat. (TV: \"Planet of Giants\" [+]Part of Planet of Giants, Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).) Entering the house, Barbara began to die when she touched the insecticide. (TV: \"Dangerous Journey\" [+]Part of Planet of Giants, Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).) She proceeded to contact someone through a telephone and reached Hilda Rowse and her husband Bert. They managed to grow back to size, and Barbara recovered. Forester and his accomplice, Smithers, were handed over to the police. (TV: \"Crisis\" [+]Part of Planet of Giants, Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).)\n\nWhen the group arrived in the ruined 22nd century London, (TV: \"World's End\" [+]Part of The Dalek Invasion of Earth, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).) Ian and the Doctor found that the Daleks had invaded. After learning about the invasion, (TV: \"The Daleks\" [+]Part of The Dalek Invasion of Earth, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).) the Doctor and Ian were rescued from the Dalek Earthforce and brought to the resistance. Heading south to Bedfordshire, (TV: \"Day of Reckoning\" [+]Part of The Dalek Invasion of Earth, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).) the resistance discovered that Daleks intended to turn Earth into a warship. (TV: \"The Waking Ally\" [+]Part of The Dalek Invasion of Earth, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).) Turning this plan against the Daleks, the Doctor triggered a volcanic eruption that defeated them. Recognising that Susan had fallen in love with resistance fighter David Campbell, (TV: \"Flashpoint\" [+]Part of The Dalek Invasion of Earth, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).)) and that she \"needed to make [her] own way\", (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).) the Doctor reluctantly left her behind, promising to return. (TV: \"Flashpoint\" [+]Part of The Dalek Invasion of Earth, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).))\n\nHe continued to question his decision for centuries to come, The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).) and even slept through a materialisation because of his sorrow. (TV: \"The Powerful Enemy\" [+]Part of The Rescue, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).} Ian believed that locking Susan out of the TARDIS was the bravest thing that he ever saw the Doctor do. (AUDIO: The Revenants [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nShortly after leaving Susan in the 22nd century, the Doctor travelled to Venus to attend the funeral of Dharkhig, an old friend of his. There, the Doctor, Ian and Barbara became embroiled in the Venusians' conflict with their would-be saviours, the Sou(ou)shi. (PROSE: Venusian Lullaby [+]Paul Leonard, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).) The Doctor had another encounter with River Song during his travels with Ian and Barbara. Because he spent his time \"hanging out with the two teachers\", River considered the First Doctor to be \"boring\". River wiped his memory with mnemosine recall-wipe vapour so the timeline would remain intact. (GAME: The Eternity Clock [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIntending to give Susan a wedding ring, the Doctor, Ian and Barbara visited the mines of Alexandria. However, Ian was separated from the Doctor and Barbara, and Barbara accidentally created an alternative timeline after being sent nine years into the past. In the alternate world, King Ptolemy and his warriors went to war with the alien Rhakotis, and Barbara soon fell in love with Ptolemy and married him, becoming Queen. After nine years of war, the Doctor used a book from Gallifrey to repair time, erasing the alternative history and costing Barbara her husband. (PROSE: The Book of Shadows [+]Jim Mortimore, Decalog (Virgin Decalogs, 1994).)\n\nThe Doctor almost lost Ian and Barbara as companions when they considered settling down in 1950s Shoreditch, and he spent four months investigating the Stone of Scone in Scotland. Shortly after this, Ian and Barbara decided life in the 1950s would be too difficult and rejoined the Doctor aboard the TARDIS. (PROSE: Set in Stone [+]Charles Auchterlonie and John Isles, Short Trips: The History of Christmas (Short Trips, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor landed in the Orkney isles in 1956 thinking he could get Barbara and Ian back home.

(COMIC: The Secrets of the Tardis [+]GASPS comics (Kenner, 1965).)\n\nThe Doctor and his companions hid from a group of Daleks that were searching for them. The Daleks tried to find them with their new Earthmen Detector, but believed it to be faulty when a cat ran past the Doctor's hiding spot. As the Daleks left, the Doctor chuckled at being saved by a cat. (COMIC: The Daleks Are Foiled [+]GASPS comics (Kenner, 1965).)\n\nWhen the Doctor was paralysed by the Daleks' Nerve Machine, Ian used the telepathic helmet to reach the Doctor, who explained the situation to him. Working with the information, Ian discovered the Machine and disabled it, freeing the Doctor. (COMIC: Dr. Who and the Nerve Machine [+]GASPS comics (Kenner, 1965).)\n\nThe Doctor arrived on Earth during the Ice Age, causing the TARDIS' controls to freeze.

[+]James Goss, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nStill struggling to adapt to life without Susan, the Doctor, Ian and Barbara ended up on Dido, where they met two survivors of a crashed spaceship, Vicki Pallister and Bennett, and learnt a being called Koquillion had embarked on a reign of terror, leaving those who survived his wraith greatly fearful of him. (TV: \"The Powerful Enemy\" [+]Part of The Rescue, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) However, the Doctor soon discovered Bennett was actually Koquillion after he caused the crash when he was unmasked as a killer to prevent the crew from radioing back to Earth. He killed the crew, many Dido natives, but spared Vicki so she would back up his story when the rescue crew came to collect them. Just as Bennett prepared to kill the Doctor, two Dido natives saved him and forced Bennett to his death. With all of her associates dead, Vicki joined the Doctor in the TARDIS, providing him with a new youngster to care for as had been the case with Susan. (TV: \"Desperate Measures\" [+]Part of The Rescue, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nAccording to one accounrt, the Doctor and Vicki came across a Roman villa after arriving near Rome, where they found the caretaker, Lucius, wounded after being attacked by a lion.

McIntee, More Short Trips (BBC Short Trips, 1999).)\n\nAccording to a second account, the TARDIS landed in 64 AD in the area just beyond the great metropolis Byzantium immediately following the departure from Dido. Despite the Doctor's resignation from visiting the Roman Empire, the group made their way to the city. After a week in Byzantium, the group prepared to go back to the TARDIS, but were instead caught up in a large Jewish revolt in the market-square, separating them. At least two weeks passed before the group was brought together again, but then the TARDIS was missing, and the group joined a travelling caravan moving towards Rome, in hopes of finding the TARDIS along the way. (PROSE: Byzantium! [+]Keith Topping, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nHaving found the TARDIS and spent several weeks relaxing at the villa, the Doctor and Vicki decided to visit Rome. However, on the way, the Doctor was mistaken for famous lyre player Maximus Pettulian and was taken to meet Emperor Nero.

Having escaped the city, (TV: \"Invasion\" [+]Part of The Web Planet, Bill Strutton, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) the Doctor helped Barbara and a group of Menoptera defeat the Animus and free the mind controlled Zarbi. Having reunited, the travellers left with the inhabitants promising they would always sing songs about their great deeds in saving their planet. (TV: \"The Centre\" [+]Part of The Web Planet, Bill Strutton, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nThe Doctor and his companions arrived on a planet in the early days of the universe. There, they discovered a huge shining crystalline city. It soon became apparent that there were two species on this planet, beings of Light and beings of Dark, and their only desire was to see the total destruction of the other.

Whilst the Doctor was helping a group of scientists attempting to communicate with the local giant rays, the Rocket Men, led by Ashman, attacked Platform Five. The Doctor helped the scientists fashion a force field to repel the Rocket Men's weaponry and succeeded in communicating with the rays, persuading them to attack the Rocket Men. (AUDIO: The Rocket Men [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Vicki then travelled to 1868, where they attended a lecture by Thomas Huxley. After the lecture, they joined Huxley to help find a group of missing students in the London Underground and discovered the Zarbi. Taken prisoner by the Zarbi, the Doctor, Ian and Huxley found the Animus, who had reformed itself and had moved to Earth to take revenge on the human race. Ian was able to kill the Animus by driving a train into it. The Doctor and his companions prepared to leave, but the Doctor discovered that his companions were missing, having been pulled out of time by Adam Mitchell. (COMIC: Unnatural Selection [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) Following a chronal trail left by the Eleventh Doctor as the Tenth Doctor merged their TARDISes together, the First Doctor joined his ten future incarnations as they stormed Adam's fortress in Limbo to save their friends from Adam and the Tremas Master. Though the Master attacked them with Autons, Frobisher was able to free the captured companions, and they helped the Doctors fight off the Autons, as Adam had a change of heart when the Master revealed he intended to use the chronal energies he had stolen across the Doctor's timelines to destroy the universe. After the Master killed Adam as he foiled his plans, the eleven Doctors honoured Adam as a \"true companion\". (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nThe TARDIS arrived in the holy land in the 12th century. Just as the travellers exited the ship, a scuffle took place between a group of Saracens and a group including Richard the Lionheart. During this scuffle, Barbara was kidnapped, and the remaining TARDIS crew helped the injured William de Tornebu back to meet the King at his castle in Jaffa. (TV: \"The Lion\" [+]Part of The Crusade, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)

(TV: \"The Knight of Jaffa\" [+]Part of The Crusade, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) However, Joanna was told of this arrangement and, after an argument with her brother, he accused the Doctor of revealing the secret. (TV: \"The Wheel of Fortune\" [+]Part of The Crusade, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) However, it was the Earl of Leicester who was indiscreet and, having left Jaffa and reunited with their friends in the forest, the Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki made their escape before the Earl could arrest them under suspicion of witchcraft. (TV: \"The Warlords\" [+]Part of The Crusade, David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nThe Doctor and his companions landed on Xeros, only to find their future selves exhibits in display cases. (TV: \"The Space Museum\" [+]Part of The Space Museum, Glyn Jones, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) While they began trying to avoid this version of the future, the Doctor was taken by the Moroks to be prepared for the exhibit, (TV: \"The Dimensions of Time\" [+]Part of The Space Museum, Glyn Jones, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) though Ian saved him.

(COMIC: A Religious Experience [+]Tim Quinn, Doctor Who Yearbook 1994 (Doctor Who Yearbook comic stories, Marvel Comics, 1993).)\n\nReturning to the planet Vortis, the Doctor, Ian and Barbara saved a pair of Menoptera from the Zarbi and their larvae gun when the arrival of the TARDIS scared them off. (COMIC: On the Planet Vortis [+]adapted from The Web Planet (Bill Strutton), GASP comics (Kenner, 1965).) The travellers were then confronted by the Zarbi, who captured the Doctor for his knowledge. However, the Doctor was saved when Ian and Barbara found the Animus and killed the brain. Having saved the grateful Menoptera from the Zarbi menace, the three took their leave. (COMIC: The Zarbi Are Destroyed [+]adapted from The Web Planet (Bill Strutton), GASPS comics (Kenner, 1965).)\n\nTheir next adventure took the group to 1605 London, mere days away from the Gunpowder Plot. After encouraging Barbara and Ian to enjoy a showing of Shakespeare's plays at the Theatre, the Doctor took Vicki to the court of King James I, disguised as a priest of York, with Vicki as his young male ward. Following the Doctor's unravelling of the true mastermind of the plot, a young member of a secret society plotting for England to fall into darkness, the group left once more in the TARDIS, which was undergoing a lengthy exorcism, believed to be a temple of Satan. (PROSE: The Plotters [+]Gareth Roberts, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).)\n\nWhile collecting minerals for the Doctor's latest invention, Ian and Barbara told Vicki of their past Christmases, and she used the Doctor's newly built machine to give them a nice Christmas in a shared-dream. However, due to Vicki's misconceptions of Christmas and the machine not being fully operational, the dream ultimately crashed, but Ian and Barbara still enjoyed their experience. (PROSE: All I Want for Christmas [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter the TARDIS landed on Unitaria, the single country of 23rd century Earth, the travellers were caught by a group of rebels led by Markus, who Vicki recognised as the historical assassin of the Iron Judge, who's death lead to a revolt that put an end to Unitaria. Using her knowledge of Unitaria future history, Vicki saved her friends from execution by claiming to know the rebels' plans, and allied herself with Jensen, whom Vicki knew would betray the rebels, but they discovered by the police of Unitaria and Jensen was shot and Vicki captured. After a long interrogation with the Iron Judge, it was Vicki who actually betrayed the rebels, revealing their hideout so that history could keep its course. In the following fight, the travellers left in the TARDIS.

The Doctor was later imprisoned with Ian and Chaucer on Thomas Arundel's whim. He pretended to have plague to escape the guards. (AUDIO: The Doctor's Tale [+]Marc Platt, The Early Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki became trapped in a time loop, forcing them to relive Christmas Day in 2004 for two weeks with the Smythe family, which had been set by George Smythe as he couldn't bear to lose his children and his wife Patricia, who was leaving him for another man. After George killed Patricia, the Doctor convinced him to break the loop after it reset and she was restored. (PROSE: Every Day [+]Stephen Fewell, Short Trips: A Christmas Treasury (Short Trips, 2004).)\n\nOn Aridius, the Doctor discovered via the Time-Space Visualiser that the Daleks were on his trail to kill him and take the TARDIS, and that they were already on Aridius as the visualisation was in the past. (TV: \"The Executioners\" [+]Part of The Chase, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) After saving Ian and Vicki from a Mire Beast, the Doctor and his companions escaped Aridius. (TV: \"The Death of Time\" [+]Part of The Chase, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)  With the Daleks in hot pursuit in their time vessel, the Doctor went to many different times and places to shake them off, including the Empire State Building in 1966 and the sailing ship Mary Celeste.

They accidentally left Vicki behind at the Festival of Ghana in 1996, but she stowed away on the Daleks' time ship and followed the TARDIS to Mechanus. (TV: \"Journey into Terror\" [+]Part of The Chase, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nOn Mechanus, the Daleks created an android version of the Doctor, which Ian believed to be the Doctor and ended up fighting the real Doctor as he thought he was the fake until the Robot Doctor addressed Vicki as Susan. (TV: \"The Death of Doctor Who\" [+]Part of The Chase, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) The next day, the Doctor and his friends were captured by the Mechonoids and imprisoned in the city with Steven Taylor, a stranded Earth astronaut. The Doctor escaped, leaving the Daleks and Mechanoids to destroy themselves in a pitched battle for supremacy of the city. Steven got lost in the battle and was presumed dead by the travellers, (TV: \"The Planet of Decision\" [+]Part of The Chase, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) but he had in fact stowed away in the TARDIS. (TV: \"The Watcher\" [+]Part of The Time Meddler, Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) Preparing to leave, the Doctor was wary when Ian and Barbara asked him to help them use the Daleks time machine to finally return to 1963. Although he was sorry to bid farewell to them, he did as they asked. A while later, he and Vicki observed them back in 1965 Shoreditch on the Visualiser. (TV: \"The Planet of Decision\" [+]Part of The Chase, Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nShortly after bidding farewell to Ian and Barbara, the Doctor and Vicki were shocked to find Steven aboard the TARDIS as the ship landed in 1066 Northumbria. (TV: \"The Watcher\" [+]Part of The Time Meddler, Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) To his great dismay, the Doctor discovered another member of his race, the Monk, was scheming to alter history (TV: \"A Battle of Wits\" [+]Part of The Time Meddler, Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) by luring and destroying a Viking fleet with an atomic cannon, which would result in King Harold Godwinson winning the Battle of Hastings. After the Monk was driven out of his monastery by Saxons, the Doctor infiltrated the Monk's TARDIS and stole the dimensional control. When the Monk tried to take off after his plans failed, the interior of his TARDIS began to shrink beyond use, trapping him in 1066. (TV: \"Checkmate\" [+]Part of The Time Meddler, Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS landed a city-sized sentient computer called Xenith, the Doctor was forced to flee when Vicki and Steven got spooked by a robot, (COMIC: Are You Listening? [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) only to realise it was a translation done after the TARDIS left. (COMIC: Younger and Wiser [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nFrom there, they arrived in England during the struggles of the Suffragettes in 1912, where an alien skull created havoc in its conquest to kill all males. Vicki and Steven became telepathically linked with the alien, and through this bond, she was defeated. (AUDIO: The Suffering [+]Jacqueline Rayner, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2010).)\n\nThe TARDIS travellers went to London in 1814, during the last Frost Fair, where they met Jane Austen and, with her assistance, tried to prevent a Phoenix's egg from hatching; if it did, the creature would absorb all the heat on Earth, condemning it to extinction. The Phoenix possessed Lady Georgiana, the wife of the Deputy Warden of the Royal Mint Sir Joseph Mallard, and with her help tried to enter the building, hoping that the heat of the furnace would be enough to hatch the egg. After tracing the egg, the Doctor offered the Phoenix to take it somewhere else, on a planet yet to be born, so that it could still live without endangering anyone. When the Phoenix refused, the Doctor and his companions stopped the furnace from working and let its fire die so that the Phoenix could die too. (AUDIO: Frostfire [+]Marc Platt, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2007).)\n\nThe First Doctor was pulled out of his time by the Time Lords, who wanted his help in getting the Second Doctor and the Third Doctor to work together to stop Omega, but he became trapped in a time eddy and had to advise his succeeding incarnations from afar, though he succeeded in getting them to cooperate. Once his successors solved the crisis, the First Doctor was returned to his proper place in time, (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973).) with his memories wiped to preserve the timeline.

Whilst in a base on Ceres, the Doctor was attacked by a robot. He became unconscious after being exposed to the elements, but was revived using the base's cryogenics pods. Whilst in the pods, he heard a voice that wanted to kill him. The Doctor worked out using the data Vicki had collected for him that Thorn was behind the mysterious happenings on Ceres. (AUDIO: The Bounty of Ceres [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor waited for Vicki and Steven when they ran from the Antoim who were shooting at them. However, his fifth incarnation took his place and was forced to act as the First Doctor would have to protect the timeline when they visited Ravenna, Italy, 540. the Monk had been behind the displacement in the Doctor's timeline. The Monk located Sophia, a time-sensitive Human/Hetrodon hybrid in ancient Greece and used her abilities to create a hole in space-time, which the Monk planned to use to take the Doctor's place in history after being deeply affected by the death of Tamsin Drew. The Doctor brought a group of Antoim warriors to Earth in order to blackmail the Monk into restoring the Doctor's timeline. (AUDIO: The Secret History [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nLanding in the city of Winter, the Doctor became intrigued about how they grew fruits and vegetables on a planet where it was constantly winter. He watched a graduation ceremony and thought something was wrong. He learnt that the citizens were working with the Daleks. With Steven's and Amala Vost's help, he started the defeat of the Daleks, but was forced off the planet before their final destruction. (AUDIO: The Dalek Occupation of Winter [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Immediately after leaving Winter, the crew visited T19.

He learnt that Isaiah Hardy, Linus Woolf and Charles Lewis were aliens observing human developments, and eventually stopped their plans. Upon leaving Cambridge, something went wrong with the TARDIS and Vicki disappeared, (AUDIO: Entanglement [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) having travelled into her own personal timeline. The Doctor sent Steven after her to stop her from changing her past.

(TV: \"Small Prophet, Quick Return\" [+]Part of The Myth Makers, Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965).) With his friends caught up in the battle, the Doctor helped the Greeks to infiltrate the city. (TV: \"Death of a Spy\" [+]Part of The Myth Makers, Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965).) With the help of Cassandra's handmaiden, Katarina, the Doctor rescued an injured Steven from his fights with Trojan soldiers. Vicki fell in love with Cassandra's brother, Troilus, and remained in Troy with the Doctor's blessing, whilst he gained a new companion in Katarina. (TV: \"Horse of Destruction\" [+]Part of The Myth Makers, Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nThe Doctor and Katarina visited the Lakhotha tribe to seek Healing Song's help to treat the injured Steven, but the Conduit violently transformed the whole tribe into plant and animal life.

(PROSE: Scribbles in Chalk [+]Gareth Wigmore, Short Trips: Life Science (Short Trips, 2004).)\n\nThe Doctor landed the TARDIS on the planet Kembel in the hopes of finding medicine for Steven's blood poisoning, leaving Steven in the TARDIS with Katarina. There, he encountered Bret Vyon, a Space Security Agent who wanted to steal the Doctor's ship, and was knocked out and had his keys stolen. As Bret tried to get Katarina to pilot the TARDIS, Steven knocked him out and let the Doctor in. After securing Bret to a chair, the Doctor went outside again, where he heard a spaceship landing, and decided to head towards it in search of the needed medicine, only to learn that it was a Dalek saucer. (TV: \"The Nightmare Begins\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).)\n\nAfter moving away from the Daleks unseen, the Doctor discovered a magnetic tape in the jungle undergrowth. He rejoined his friends who escaped from the TARDIS with Bret's help. Bret, however, informed the Doctor that the Daleks had started to burn down the jungle. With the Doctor resolved to find out what the Daleks were doing on Kembel and stop them, he and the others discovered a large landing bay with ships from the many outer galaxies and the Spar ship Bret recognised as belonging to Mavic Chen, the Guardian of the Solar System.\n\nAfter capturing one of the delegates, Zephon, the Doctor used his cloak as a disguise and infiltrated the meeting. There, Mavic Chen presented the Daleks with the Taranium Core, the power source for the Daleks' Time Destructor. However, the Doctor stole the Taranium and ran off before the meeting was concluded. (TV: \"Day of Armageddon\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).) Having only just managed to get aboard the Spar in time before Bret and the others blasted off, the Doctor learned of the Daleks' plans by listening to a tape he had retrieved with a message from Marc Cory, another SSS Agent and associate of Bret's.\n\nThe Doctor and Bret agreed to head back to Earth and warn the authorities of the Dalek threat. However, the Daleks seized control of the Spar and forced it to crash-land on the planet Desperus, where convicted criminals were sent. With Steven and Bret having fixed the Spar and the Doctor having used his ingenuity to prevent some prisoners getting on board, the ship took off again. However, another prisoner, Kirksen, had snuck on board and took Katarina hostage inside the airlock. (TV: \"Devil's Planet\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).) Despite Steven and the Doctor's protests, Bret was forced to turn the ship back towards Kembel. However, Katarina opened the outer door of the ship, sending Kirksen and herself to their deaths in the vacuum of space. Shaken, the Doctor lamented that, while Katarina couldn't have understood what she was doing, he would always remember her as \"one of the daughters of the gods\".\n\nAfter landing on Earth, the Doctor, Steven and Bret went to see Daxtar, a friend of Bret's who he thought would believe their story, at a nearby research complex. Daxtar proved to be untrustworthy when he let slip he knew about the Taranium. Suspecting him to be in league with Chen, Bret shot him. Believing they would be caught any moment, the Doctor and Steven escaped just as another SSS Agent, Sara Kingdom, arrived. Showing no mercy, she killed Bret before he had a chance to explain himself. (TV: \"The Traitors\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).)\n\nEvading capture, the Doctor and Steven were pursued by Sara into an empty chamber where they all fell victim to a molecular dissemination experiment and were transmitted to the swampy planet Mira. A small Dalek task force soon arrived on Mira to apprehend the travellers and regain the Taranium. After the Doctor found Steven and Sara, they made their way to a nearby cave for shelter and tried to persuade Sara about the Daleks' plot with Mavic Chen, with Steven also furious with Sara for killing Bret, who Sara admitted was her brother. Suddenly, the invisible inhabitants of Mira, the Visians, surrounded the cave, but a Dalek appeared and shot one of them dead, (TV: \"Counter Plot\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).) causing the other Visians to begin attacking the Daleks and, in the confusion, the travellers evaded capture, stole the Daleks' spaceship and escaped Mira. Upon their return to Kembel, the Doctor gave the Daleks a copy of the Taranium Core he had made on the way, and then returned to the TARDIS. (TV: \"Coronas of the Sun\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).)\n\nThe Doctor landed outside a police station on 25 December 1965, where he was arrested. After being rescued by Steven, they visited a Hollywood film studio in the 1920s, though they did not know where they had landed and thought they were in an insane asylum. The Doctor was mistaken for an expert on Arab customs and had an encounter with Bing Crosby. Back on board the TARDIS, the time travellers toasted a Happy Christmas to themselves. (TV: \"The Feast of Steven\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).)\n\nThe Doctor found that the TARDIS was locked onto the signal of another time machine, which was travelling to several different Christmases throughout Earth's history. Eventually, Sara realised that the other time machine belonged to Robert, who had become trapped in the machine after the death of his twin brother and unintentionally trapped it in a loop where it would perpetually visit different Christmases trying to fulfil Robert's wish to go back to before his brother died of leukaemia. When the now-adult Robert touched the Taranium Core and reverted to his original age, the Doctor used the unique circumstances of the current situation to subtly change history, using the fast return switch to take Robert back to the last Christmas so that he could take the place of his brother, the TARDIS crew then taking him to Mars so that he could see something incredible before his death. (PROSE: The Little Drummer Boy [+]Eddie Robson, Short Trips: Companions (Short Trips, 2003).)\n\nWhile dreaming, the Doctor was brought to the Underworld by Persephone to guide Katarina through the afterlife, even arguing with Hades until he was forced to allow Katarina to enter the Elysian fields. (PROSE: Katarina in the Underworld [+]Steve Lyons, Short Trips: The Muses (Short Trips, 2003).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS was dragged inside the Great Clock, the Doctor was intrigued by its functioning, and insisted on going to explore. He, Steven and Sara saw the old men toiling inside the Clock, but, as they were trying to figure out what they were doing, they were captured by Space Security Service agents. The agents recognised Sara as one of their own, and took her to meet a superior officer for questioning. The Doctor and Steven managed to escape from their cell, and found a deserted monitor, which they used to search for information about their whereabouts. They discovered that they had landed in 3999, one year before their meeting with Sara, that Bret Vyon was the officer Sara had been brought to, and that Mavic Chen was there too. Steven proposed to go looking for Sara, but the Doctor stopped him, as them being spotted by Chen and Bret could have disastrous consequences for the future. Instead, they went back to the Clock to sabotage it and escape in the confusion. However, they ended up being trapped inside it, since the machine fed on the hope of escape of its prisoners and their efforts to find a weak link in its construction. They were freed by Sara when she managed to destroy the Clock. (AUDIO: The Guardian of the Solar System [+]Simon Guerrier, The Companion Chronicles (2010).)\n\nOn their travels, the TARDIS landed on a planet covered in water, where they found a set of miners in a collapsed mine. They were attacked by a tentacled creature, but Sara and the Doctor were able to reason with it. (AUDIO: The Drowned World [+]Simon Guerrier, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2009).)\n\nThe Doctor, Steven and Sara then landed in Ely in a house which had a secret. He theorised that the house could sense what you desired. Exploring the house, they found dead bodies. The Doctor wanted to investigate, but Steven got annoyed when he couldn't find a way to get out of the house. (AUDIO: Home Truths [+]Simon Guerrier, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2008).)\n\nThe TARDIS later crashlanded in 1950s London, as a result of the psychic attack by a race of anemone changelings. Because of his bond with the ship, the Doctor fell into a coma as Steven and Sara brought him out, moments before the TARDIS locked itself as a defence mechanism, though he was conscious and aware of his surroundings. Steven and Sara were given shelter by Joseph Roberts, a Jamaican immigrant, and his nephews, Michael and Audrey Newman, but Michael was actually a changeling duplicate, and kidnapped the Doctor and the TARDIS. The changelings intended to use the TARDIS as a source of psychic energy for their morphing abilities, but deemed the Doctor unimportant their plans. As he gathered information about them during his imprisonment the Doctor finally awakened after two-weeks in his coma and, by Steven's intervention, reached Sara, explaining to her how to stop the changelings and shielded her presence so that she could reach their hideout undisturbed. (AUDIO: An Ordinary Life [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAttempting to rest on an asteroid, the TARDIS crew were caught in a conflict between members of the Space Security Services and a Sontaran platoon, the SSS forces seeking to take control of a Sontaran space cannon that would allow them to destroy any human ships passing through the only safe path through the asteroid belt. This crisis was made more complicated as Sara knew of this event from history. Despite the Sontarans infiltrating the SSS team using a stolen Rutan device to transform one of their own into a human, as well as the Sontarans managing to capture and interrogate Steven after a cave-in separated him from the rest of the team, the TARDIS crew and the SSS team leader were able to reach the cannon and destroy it with the aid of the asteroid's native population. Although the cannon was no longer a threat, Sara's knowledge of the future revealed that the asteroid would be found deserted around a year from then, suggesting that the Sontarans would kill them in revenge for this action, although the natives decided to hope for the best. With this example in mind, the Doctor, Steven and Sara decided that it was time to return to the battle with the Daleks. (AUDIO: The Sontarans [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor discovered that another time machine was on the same flight path as the TARDIS, and thought it might be the Daleks pursuing them. After briefly materialising in the Oval during a cricket match, the TARDIS landed on Tigus, where the Monk, seeking revenge for being stranded in 1066, sabotaged the TARDIS lock, stranding the Doctor and his companions. However, the Doctor quickly fixed the problem and departed, with the Monk following close behind.\n\nAfter briefly materialising in Trafalgar Square during the New Year's Eve night of 1966, (TV: \"Volcano\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).) the TARDIS landed near a pyramid in ancient Egypt. Not only was the Monk there, but so were the Daleks, who had discovered that their Taranium Core was a fake. (TV: \"Golden Death\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).) After stealing the directional unit from the Monk's TARDIS and changing its shape to a police box, the Doctor was forced to hand over the real Taranium Core to the Daleks, who had taken Steven and Sara hostage. The Doctor used the directional unit to take the TARDIS back to Kembel. (TV: \"Escape Switch\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).) The Doctor activated the Daleks' Time Destructor, which destroyed them, transformed Kembel into a desert, and rapidly aged Sara to death when she went back to aid the Doctor. (TV: \"Destruction of Time\" [+]Part of The Daleks' Master Plan, Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS materialised in 1966 London, the Doctor and Steven encountered the Fulgurites, who were involved in the trafficking of humans across the galaxy for slave labour with the full knowledge of the British government. The duo put an end to the Fulgurites' activities with the assistance of a young homosexual city trader named Oliver Harper, who joined them in the TARDIS to escape being arrested for his sexuality. (AUDIO: The Perpetual Bond [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor took Steven and Oliver to a satellite which was near a meteor field, but the Calleons chucked the TARDIS off the satellite when they saw no value in it, annoying the Doctor. However, when a girl entered the TARDIS, he realised that she had accidentally caused the satellite to fall out of orbit, resulting in the satellite being fractured when it struck a piece of space debris, the Doctor and the Calleons in one part of the satellite while Oliver and Steven were in another. After Steven was able to perform some complex flight calculations to nudge his fragment back to the Doctor's, the Doctor worked with Oliver and the Calleons to draw up new contracts that would help the humans benefit from the Calleons' work while Steven recovered. (AUDIO: The Cold Equations [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor took Oliver and Steven to Grace Alone after found their names on criminal records on a database in the future. He tried to hide his thoughts from the Vardans to stop them from learning knowledge about the TARDIS, going so far as to fake his death and trick his companions so that he could take the Vardans by surprise later. Oliver would later meet his death at the hands of the Vardans while saving his friends' lives, disrupting the last Vardan in a final attack. (AUDIO: The First Wave [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nKnowing he was nearing his first regeneration, (PROSE: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from The Five Doctors (Terrance Dicks), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1983).) the Doctor visited his rose garden for some peace and contemplation, while Steven rested in the TARDIS. As he tried to look for ways of rectifying his relationship with Steven, (PROSE: Roses [+]Robert Mammone, Brief Encounter (1994).) the Doctor was taken by a Time scoop to the Death Zone, where he was reunited with Susan in a tower. After dealing with a Dalek, the First Doctor and Susan found the TARDIS of the Fifth Doctor, who was inside with his companions Tegan Jovanka and Vislor Turlough. Heading to the Tower of Rassilon with Tegan, the First Doctor met the Tremas Master, who slaughtered the Cybermen keeping him prisoner, as he and the Doctor manoeuvred around the tower's traps, (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) with the Doctor contemplating on the \"evil\" he felt in the Tower. (POEM: A Simple Truth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nReaching the Tomb of Rassilon, the First Doctor joined with his second and third incarnations to study the writing on Rassilon's tomb, and open the teleportation systems. The Fifth Doctor arrived, under the control of Lord Borusa, who had brought the Doctors there to help him retrieve immortality from Rassilon. The combined concentration of the three Doctors, however, was enough to break Borusa's control over their future incarnation. When Borusa spoke to Rassilon and took his offer of immortality, the First Doctor realised the true meaning of the inscriptions related to the immortality offered by Rassilon and triggered the events leading to Borusa's eternal imprisonment within a sarcophagus. The Doctor then left with Susan as he was returned to his time zone by Rassilon. (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).)\n\nWhen Steven told him he had been having trouble sleeping due to still recovering from Sara and Katarina's deaths, the Doctor told him a story from his time hiding in 1963 Shoreditch. (PROSE: Ash [+]Trevor Baxendale, Short Trips: A Universe of Terrors (Short Trips, 2003).) The Doctor later visited Homer many years after the Fall of Troy to check in on how Vicki was doing, and was told that she was still happily in love with Troilus. (PROSE: The Myth Makers [+]Donald Cotton, adapted from The Myth Makers (Donald Cotton), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1985).)\n\nThe Doctor and Steven stopped an alien invader on a nearby beach with the help of Greenaway, who lost his legs and part of his skull in the incident, and ended up in a coma. The Doctor made telepathic contact with Greenaway to try to prompt him out of his coma, but Greenaway declined to do so. (PROSE: Greenaway [+]Peter Anghelides, Short Trips: Steel Skies (Short Trips, 2003).)\n\nThe Doctor and Steven used a helicopter to fight a giant mosquito, with the Doctor destroying the creature with washing up liquid. (PROSE: Do You Smell Carrots? [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nArriving in a forest on Christmas Eve, the Doctor and Steven discovered a family forced for generations to care for alien trees. Learning the trees had taken one member of the family who hadn’t believed his father’s warnings, the Doctor berated the trees for taking advantage of the family, convincing them to release him. With a more amicable relationship between the family and trees established, the Doctor and Steven left to celebrate Christmas themselves. (AUDIO: O Tannenbaum [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nSteven and the Doctor once again met the Vardans in the connection between Earth and the Mediosphere when they came up with the idea of using comedy television to spread a virus that would kill humans with laughter after studying radio frequencies from Earth in order to conquer the planet. However, a comedian, Teddy Baxter, and his straight man, Stan, perceived them while observing the stars. The Vardans managed to pull Stan into the Mediosphere, but were unable to do the same with Teddy. While the Doctor and the TARDIS were absorbed into the Mediosphere, Steven was stranded in 1950s London. When the Vardans brought Steven and Teddy to their spaceship, they tried to absorb Teddy as well, but made the mistake of showing Teddy a possible future. This made it impossible for them to kill him, since, as the Doctor explained, once the future had been made real, it became a fixed point in time, and if the Vardans killed Teddy, this would trap them into a time bubble. Steven and the Doctor then helped Teddy to defeat the Vardans, chasing them from Earth, before bringing him back to Earth in the TARDIS. (AUDIO: The Vardan Invasion of Mirth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Steven arrived in Paris in 1572, where the Doctor decided to visit Charles Preslin, leaving Steven to sightsee. (TV: \"War of God\" [+]Part of The Massacre, John Lucarotti and Donald Tosh, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) After a few days, the Doctor reunited with Steven, and realised that the St Bartholomew's Day massacre was about to begin, forcing them to hastingly departed in the TARDIS. Steven was angry that the Doctor had deliberately left a French girl he had befriended, Anne Chaplet, to her probable death, and disregarded the Doctor's plea that he couldn't rewrite history. He decided to leave the TARDIS when it landed in Wimbledon Common in 1966, leaving the Doctor alone to reminisce over all of the companions who had left him. He briefly wondered if he should return to his own planet, but decided that he could not. However, Steven returned when a young girl named Dodo Chaplet forced her way into the TARDIS, which then departed. (TV: \"Bell of Doom\" [+]Part of The Massacre, John Lucarotti and Donald Tosh, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nThe TARDIS took them to New York City in 1965, where a cult had formed around six self-proclaimed \"gods\", who performed miracles on their followers. The Doctor's suspicion proved true when the gods turned out to be alien lifeforms, who existed by belief and gained power equal to the faith the humans held in them. Recognising the danger such creatures posed, the Doctor worked with the US military to weaken the faith of the gods' worshippers, and subsequently driving the gods away by dropping a dud bomb that everyone watching believed would harm the gods. The Doctor and Steven subsequently accepted their differences and departed in the TARDIS, taking Dodo as their new companion. (PROSE: Salvation [+]Steve Lyons, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nTogether, the TARDIS crew encountered humans and Monoids from the far future, which were fleeing the doomed planet Earth to Refusis II on a spaceship which Dodo nicknamed the Ark. (TV: \"The Steel Sky\" [+]Part of The Ark, Paul Erickson and Lesley Scott, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) The Doctor aided the crew against an outbreak of the common cold, (TV: \"The Plague\" [+]Part of The Ark, Paul Erickson and Lesley Scott, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) but upon returning to the Ark seven hundred years later, he discovered that the Monoids had taken over and were planning to kill the humans. (TV: \"The Return\" [+]Part of The Ark, Paul Erickson and Lesley Scott, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) With the aid of a Refusian, the Doctor saved the humans. (TV: \"The Bomb\" [+]Part of The Ark, Paul Erickson and Lesley Scott, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nThe TARDIS was then captured by the Toymaker, who turned the Doctor invisible and forced him to play the Trilogic game, while Steven and Dodo were forced to play against the Toymaker's pawns. (TV: \"The Celestial Toyroom\" [+]Part of The Celestial Toymaker, Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) The Doctor's companions won their games, (TV: \"The Hall of Dolls\" [+]Part of The Celestial Toymaker, Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., \"The Dancing Floor\" [+]Part of The Celestial Toymaker, Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) while the Doctor himself outwitted the Toymaker again and escaped. Celebrating their victory, the Doctor hurt his tooth while eating a sweet. (TV: \"The Final Test\" [+]Part of The Celestial Toymaker, Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nIn search of a dentist, the TARDIS arrived at Tombstone, Arizona in 1881, where the Doctor received treatment from Doc Holliday. (TV: \"A Holiday for the Doctor\" [+]Part of The Gunfighters, Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) The Doctor was mistaken for Holliday by the gunfighter's enemies, Ike Clanton and his brothers Billy and Phineas. (TV: Don't Shoot the Pianist (2) [+]Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) The Doctor and his companions witnessed the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and then departed. (TV: The O.K. Corral (4) [+]Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS brought the crew to an old house holding a Halloween party, the Doctor discovered that the Toymaker had set a trap for him, but was able to escape in the confusion of a game of statues. (PROSE: Murder in the Dark [+]Jacqueline Rayner, Tales of Terror (2017).)\n\nThe Doctor, Steven and Dodo settled down in 1812 Russia for a while, where the Doctor became the tutor for a local gentry's children, though he still wished to leave the country before Napoléon Bonaparte invaded. Before Napoléon arrived, however, the Doctor was attacked by a shape thief who took his form, but he caused the thief's downfall by convincing him that Napoléon was going to win and tricked him into taking Napoléon's form. (AUDIO: Mother Russia [+]Marc Platt, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2007).)\n\nLanding on Ulysses 519, the Doctor, Steven and Dodo discovered a group of colonists being raided by a crew of Rocket Men led by Van Cleef. After they kidnapped Dodo and a number of other colonists, the Doctor let Steven go rescue them using a dead Rocket Man's equipment and hatched his own plan, using the colonists' communications equipment to fool the Rocket Men's sensors a nearby moon was a Galactic Heritage vessel so they would retreat.

[+]Jonathan Morris, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2007).) and investigated a crashed spaceship at the Battle of Spion Kop during the Boer Wars, where they witnessed Tommy Watkins apparently destroy Kali Carash, but the Doctor remained unconvinced of Kali Carash's defeat. (AUDIO: Tales from the Vault [+]Jonathan Morris, The Companion Chronicles (2011).) On Vortis, the Doctor became separated from Steven and Dodo and saved a platoon of Sontarans from a Rutan infiltrator. (PROSE: The Dream [+]The Shakespeare Notebooks (2014).)\n\nOn the planet Comfort, the TARDIS arrived in the middle of a war. The Doctor realised that the inhabitants were brainwashed into boldly following orders. The locals took him to their leader when they realised he wasn't local. He was able to use his status as an outsider to end the staged conflict that was part of the system on Comfort by identifying himself as the leader of the enemy forces, despite the fact that the \"enemy\" were the same population wearing different uniforms, and end the war by declaring his \"surrender\". (AUDIO: The War To End All Wars [+]Simon Guerrier, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor, Steven and Dodo arrived on a planet shared by two very different peoples; the Elders and the Savages. The Elders led a civilised lifestyle, but their intelligence was gained by draining the life energy from the Savages. The Doctor stopped this practice with the aid of a group of Savages by destroying the laboratory and equipment that transferred energy from the Savages and left Steven behind to keep the peace between the two groups for the future. (TV: The Savages [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nAs his physical strength began to leave him with the approaching of his first regeneration, (PROSE: The Man in the Velvet Mask [+]Daniel O'Mahony, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) the Doctor started to struggle holding back the change. (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) The TARDIS landed in what appeared to be Paris just after the French Revolution, but history had been perversely warped. Dodo and the Doctor became separated, with Dodo being taken in by a travelling troupe of actors, and the Doctor being held prisoner in the Bastille. They discovered that the history in which they had landed was an altered history, made by aliens whose curiosity made them rewrite history to the designs of a depressed Marquis de Sade. After correcting history, Dodo and the Doctor left the alternate France behind. (PROSE: The Man in the Velvet Mask [+]Daniel O'Mahony, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).)\n\nThe Doctor and Dodo arrived on Tarron, where the Doctor exposed the truth of the Azmec Corporation's holoprobe. (PROSE: Tarnished Image [+]Guy Clapperton, Decalog 3: Consequences (Virgin Decalogs, 1996).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS materialized on the petal of a gigantic flower, the Doctor found that had been infected by a parasitic crystal plague that manifested in the form of dancing fairies, and smashed the crystal to kill the parasites, though Dodo found it upsetting. (PROSE: There are Fairies at the Bottom of the Garden [+]Sam Lester, Short Trips (BBC Short Trips, 1998).)\n\nThe Doctor and Dodo visited Scrabster Harbor in 1947, where they helped a weapon convoy get to Scapa Flow, (AUDIO: Masters of Earth [+]Mark Wright and Cavan Scott, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2014).) and, while fighting a Mim invasion of New Houston, befriended Meg Carvossa, who rejected an offer to join the TARDIS crew.

He helped to attend the wounded and saving Hugh de Courtney's life. He warned Nicholaa de la Haye not to trust the Monk, but convinced her not execute him, leaving him to be thrown in a dungeon. He sabotaged the Monk's TARDIS before leaving. (AUDIO: The Outlaws [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Dodo landed in Coulton Salt Mine. He identified it as a Zechstein mine. Mick Huff told him about the missing monuments and people. He became affected by the shell in the mine and became more agitated after the TARDIS disappeared. Encountering the Miniaturist, he learnt that she was an interdimensional creature and that she was in pain. He convinced her not to play with people and asked Medra to be the creature's custodian. (AUDIO: The Miniaturist [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Dodo visited Camden in the 2020s, which excited Dodo. He got distracted by a strange tune shortly after Dodo disappeared. He encountered Archana Pawar who was looking for her missing boyfriend Paul Carter. Daniel De'ath told him about the demon song with siren properties. He theorised that the people[which?] were musically trained as both Paul and Dodo were pianists. After learning that the Camden Community Self-Help Singers were singing the song, he helped to deprogramme them. After Archana led them to the demon, he learnt that it came from a different dimension. When Daniel caused another set of demons to appear, he used the combined organ playing of Paul and the singers to boost the song to help both sets of demons return home. (AUDIO: The Demon Song [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nDodo and the Doctor arrived near Incherton-on-Sea in 1947 after Sanderson's spaceship forced the Doctor to land the TARDIS. This caused the TARDIS circuitry to explode. He started to investigate the local area after seeing some strange fires. They encountered Virginia Hancock whilst she was trying to sneak into the exclusion zone. This got them caught in the crossfire with the local soldiers. He got angry after Dodo got shot and Virginia wouldn't go back after her. He eventually made his way back to the base to discover that Dodo was alive. He worked out that the government wanted Sanderson's ship so they could create a form of unlimited energy. Sanderson was sent to arrest the Doctor because of his future actions. He planned to hand himself in but realised that Sanderson would double cross them. After Sanderson was killed by residual blowback energy, the Doctor faded away whilst inside the TARDIS, leaving Dodo alone. (AUDIO: The Incherton Incident [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile Dodo slept, the Doctor found that the Blessing Star was not in Susan's room and realised it was probably still in 1963 and decided to find it the next time he landed in London, which happened to be his next destination (PROSE: The Rag & Bone Man's Story [+]Colin Brake, Short Trips: Repercussions (Short Trips, 2004).) as the TARDIS arrived in London during 1966. There, the Doctor noticed the new Post Office Tower and felt compelled to investigate the building. Inside, he discovered a new supercomputer called WOTAN, which had become sentient. It gained mental control of its creator and several others, including Dodo, and forced them to create mobile War Machines to take over London. Having almost been taken over himself, the Doctor discovered Dodo's true motives and put her to sleep with hypnotism. With the Army being called in by Sir Charles Summer, there was an unsuccessful raid on a Covent Garden warehouse and the War Machines attacked. However, the Doctor managed to stare down the machine and it backed down. The Doctor was then able to reprogram the machine to attack and destroy WOTAN, which it did. (TV: The War Machines [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nAfter he inadvertently picked up Polly Wright and Ben Jackson as companions when they entered the TARDIS as it took off, (TV: The War Machines [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) the Doctor and his new friends got caught up with a band of smugglers led by Captain Samuel Pike as he searched for a lost treasure. Although the Doctor was forced to help Pike trace a series of clues to the location of the treasure in a local graveyard, the smugglers were eventually captured by the local revenue men and Pike was killed.\n\nAfter they left in the TARDIS, the Doctor assumed that they had landed \"at the coldest place on Earth\", (TV: The Smugglers [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) but it was soon revealed that they had actually landed in Lewes in the 1950s, where they became caught up in a series of local riots.

(PROSE: The Witch Hunters [+]Steve Lyons, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).)\n\nWhile Ben and Polly were visiting an old friend, the Doctor was gifted a golden bow by the Emperor of Gallutia for convincing his enemies into a surrender. Travelling to medieval England to have some archery practice, the Doctor saved Lady Mary from bandits and brought her into the TARDIS, but was prevented from entering himself by knights in armour, who mistook him for a kidnapper and a wizard. Afraid of his powers, the knights tried to kill the Doctor, but he escaped to a castle and locked himself inside as the knights and their reinforcements arrived. With his arm injured, the Doctor summoned his second, third, fifth and sixth incarnations to rescue him. After the Fifth Doctor lost the game that chose who would face the knights, he explained the situation to them and the Doctors were permitted to leave when he also gave them the golden bow as a peace offering. (PROSE: Five Card Draw [+]Todd Green, Short Trips: Zodiac (Short Trips, 2002).)\n\nUsing the \"small boon\" given to him by Rassilon, the Doctor returned to Salem Village, where he signed a registration as \"Benjamin Jackson\", to see Rebecca Nurse before her execution and show her how her death would be perceived in the future.

However, he collapsed when Mondas began draining Earth's energies, (TV: The Tenth Planet [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) due to his regeneration process starting, (PROSE: Interference - Book Two [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and Mondas syphoning off his ability to resist regenerating any longer.

While emerging from his sleep, the Doctor overheard Ben claim that it was \"all over now,\" and became weary. (TV: The Tenth Planet [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).)

(TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) However, the Doctor, believing the TARDIS before him to be his own, instead thought that the man was another Time Lord come to reclaim it, only for time to freeze around them, and a World War I Captain to appear. Taking the Captain into the TARDIS to protect him from his pursuers, the Doctor saw that it was from his future and convinced of the Twelfth Doctor's identity, shortly before the TARDIS was pulled into a hovering spaceship. Sent out as a distraction, the Doctor was addressed as \"the Doctor of War\" by a glass avatar of the Testimony Foundation, who offered to trade the Captain for the Twelfth Doctor's deceased companion, Bill Potts. Now joined by his future self, the Doctor examined the interior of the spaceship, and realised that the glass avatar was based off of a real person due to being too asymmetrical. Managing to escape as the Twelfth Doctor's TARDIS was taken by the Testimony, the two Doctors, the Captain and Bill retreated to the First Doctor's TARDIS, where the Twelfth Doctor decided to visit \"an old friend\" to figure out what the Testimony was.\n\nArriving at Villengard, the Captain was attacked by a familiar creature, and left inside the TARDIS with Bill as the two Doctors journeyed towards a tower, briefly stopping to discuss their shared refusal to regenerate. When the Twelfth Doctor entered the tower alone, the First Doctor examined the wreckage and found the remnants of Dalek shells as he was joined by Bill, who revealed herself to be a glass avatar. Despite the initial shock of there being \"a spy in the camp\", the First Doctor was told the true purpose of Testimony and its benevolent agenda, just as the Twelfth Doctor learned the same from the Dalek Pathweb. When the Doctors agreed that the Captain had to die at his allotted point in time, the Twelfth Doctor requested, much to the First Doctor's surprise, that they take him back, which was allowed by the Testimony.\n\nReturning the Captain to 1914, the Doctor expressed his regret that \"the universe generally fail[ed] to be a Fairytale,\" and promised to \"make it [his] business\" to look in on the Captain's family, the Lethbridge-Stewarts, as a favour. Hidden by a perception filter, the two Doctors watched as the Captain, now with no memory of having ever met them, prepared to meet his fate. Suddenly, Christmas carolling started up on both sides of the battlefield, and the Twelfth Doctor explained that he had adjusted the time frame by a couple of hours so that when time resumed for the Captain and his opponent, it would be the beginning of the Christmas Armistice. As the Twelfth Doctor explained the Armistice to the First Doctor, the Captain called for aid for his wounded opponent and the First Doctor realised that his future self maneuverered events to save both men's lives, and that that was \"what it [meant] to be a Doctor of War.\" After watching the Armistice for a few hours, the First Doctor admitted that he felt ready to regenerate, but questioned his future self on his decision, with the Twelfth Doctor only answering that the First Doctor would have to find out \"the long way round\" before the First Doctor departed to his TARDIS. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nNow inside the TARDIS and glowing with more regeneration energy, the Doctor managed to set the coordinates to return it to Antarctica in 1986 (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) using the fast return switch. (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) As the TARDIS' controls continued to operate on their own, the Doctor opened the doors for Ben and Polly before collapsing unconscious to the floor, having lost the energy needed to keep his old body going. Before the astonished eyes of his friends, the Doctor transformed into a much younger man, (TV: The Tenth Planet [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) at the age of 450-years-old. (PROSE: Iceberg [+]David Banks, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1993).)\n\nBecause of a trick in his Gallifreyan optics, (AUDIO: The Power of the Daleks [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Second Doctor saw his first incarnation in his reflection while still adjusting to his new body after his first regeneration.

(PROSE: Into the Silent Land [+]Steven A. Roman, Short Trips: Farewells (Short Trips short stories, 2006).)\n\nWhen trapped in a dimensionally-unstable pocket universe controlled by Iam and the Rani, the Sixth Doctor's morphic print was destabilised, causing him to unwillingly regress back through his previous incarnations as his body sought a stable morphic print. He eventually \"settled\" into his first body, which remained stable long enough for him to return to the TARDIS and return to his current self. (PROSE: State of Change [+]Christopher Bulis, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).)\n\nIn a bid to detach the Funhouse from the TARDIS in the time vortex, the Sixth Doctor binded the switch that protected the TARDIS' passengers from the changing time fields outside with a string, allowing him to pull it remotely from the limited protection of the Zero Room. As a result, the Doctor immediately began to regress back through his first five incarnations as he made his way back to the console room where, as the First Doctor, he flipped the switch back, restoring himself while trapping the Funhouse in the vortex. (COMIC: Funhouse [+]Alan McKenzie, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1985).)\n\nWhen the Timewyrm sent Ace into the Seventh Doctor's mind, she encountered the First Doctor as an elderly librarian. (PROSE: Timewyrm: Revelation [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Total Eclipse, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1991).)\n\nDuring the Last Great Time War, the Doctor was affected by a degeneration weapon and began rapidly degenerating through his past incarnations, including the First Doctor, who attempted to resist the process, but was unable to stop himself changing again. (AUDIO: Past Lives [+]Robert Valentine, Once and Future (Big Finish Productions, 2023).) The Doctor turned back into his first incarnation again shortly after being captured by the Time Lords, only to change again soon afterwards. (AUDIO: A Genius for War [+]Jonathan Morris, Once and Future (Big Finish Productions, 2023).) The Doctor had become the First Doctor again by the time he landed at Planetoid 50, which he was confused to discover appeared to be Victorian London under the occupation of Martians. As he investigated, he was struck by a beam engineered by Missy to help stabilise him, causing him to degenerate into the Tenth Doctor. (AUDIO: The Martian Invasion of Planetoid 50 [+]Jonathan Barnes, Once and Future (Big Finish Productions, 2023).)\n\nDuring the final days of the Time War, when the War Doctor was preparing to destroy Gallifrey with the Moment, he was told that the weapon, having taken the form of the Bad Wolf entity, could hear his previous incarnations \"jangling around that dusty old head of [his]\". (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhen the Tenth Doctor was confronted by Es'Cartrss within the TARDIS' Matrix, he summoned the First Doctor, among his other past incarnations, to use their united memories and willpower to take back control of the Matrix. (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).)\n\nDuring many failed attempts to duplicate the Tenth Doctor, defective copies of all his past incarnations, including the First Doctor, were created instead. (COMIC: Breakfast at Tyranny's [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter the Eleventh Doctor was accused of committing deadly crimes against the Overcast, he brooded in the TARDIS for two days, imagining all his previous numbered incarnations, including the First Doctor, interrogating him over the crimes. When he offered the rationale that he always left things better than he found them, they all turned and left him in disgust and disgrace. (COMIC: Pull to Open [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nWhen the Eleventh Doctor entered into the T'keyn Nexus in order to defend himself, Matrix projections of his previous incarnations, including the First Doctor, appeared inside it to defend themselves as well. Standing with his latest incarnation, the First Doctor debunked auditor Sondrah's accusations of him being a pestilence on the Earth. When the Eleventh Doctor began to deduce Sondrah's true identity, the past Doctors faded away as Oscar Wilde interfered with the Nexus. (COMIC: Dead Man's Hand [+]Tony Lee, Doctor Who (2012) (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nWhen Clara Oswald entered the Doctor's time stream, she saw the First Doctor walk past her when the Eleventh Doctor claimed that \"everything around [her] was [him]\". (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAfter saving Gallifrey from the Moment at the conclusion of the Last Great Time War, the Eleventh Doctor dreamed of himself standing with all his past incarnations, including the First Doctor, as he thought about his search for Gallifrey. (TV:  The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhen he was exposed to energy from a time storm, the Twelfth Doctor degenerated through all of his previous incarnations, including the First Doctor, who appeared in the form of \"a frail young boy.\" (AUDIO: The Lost Magic [+]Cavan Scott, New Series Adventures Audio (BBC Worldwide, 2017).)\n\nWhen the Spy Master forced the Thirteenth Doctor to regenerate so he could use the regeneration to overtake her body and become the Doctor himself, she was greeted by the First Doctor at the Edge within her mind that represented her moving on from her time stream. He and the other \"Guardians of the Edge\" that manifested urged the Thirteenth Doctor to resist the Master's attempt to take possession of her body and identity until her contingency plan allowed her to undergo a retro-regeneration and return from the Master's hijacking. (TV:  The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nAccording to several accounts, the First Doctor was indeed the original incarnation of the renegade known as the Doctor. (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017)., PROSE: Lungbarrow [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Lungbarrow, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) Known as the original \"definite article\" (TV: Robot [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1974-1975)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) he was credited with being the one who, in one way or another, stole a TARDIS (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., AUDIO: Disassembled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., PROSE: Lungbarrow [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Lungbarrow, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) and ran away from Gallifrey because of \"many pressing reasons\", such as finding the answer to the question of why good triumphs over evil despite not being the logical choice (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) or out of fear of the Hybrid. (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) He and his various incarnations developed a deep bond with the TARDIS, with his eleventh incarnation stating the First Doctor described it as \"the most beautiful thing [he] ever saw\" upon first entering it. (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nIn regards to his name, he chose the Doctor as a promise to the universe to never be \"cruel or cowardly. Never give up, never give in.\" (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) Indeed, this Doctor's decision to disobey the policy of non-interference by helping people and fighting the evil in the universe, especially the Daleks, helped shape and cement his identity as the Doctor. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) All his successors tried to uphold and live by this promise, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017)., The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022)., Doctor Who: The Bedtime Story [+]Oliver Jeffers, adapted from The Way Back Home, CBeebies Bedtime Stories (CBeebies, 2023).) as they shared their first incarnation's distaste for violence and weapons. (TV: The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964)., Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) As such, without even knowing it, he and his other selves became the very answer to the question he wanted answered. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017)., Survivors of the Flux) Compared to other \"doctors\", the First Doctor believed that others \"may be a doctor. But [he was] THE Doctor. The original, you might say.\" This sentiment was echoed by his fourth and twelfth incarnations. (TV: Robot [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1974-1975)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nHowever, other accounts suggested that there were other incarnations that existed before the First Doctor. The Second Doctor, shortly after he emerged from the First Doctor's renewal, implied he might have regenerated before and went to open a trunk that contained relics from his previous incarnations. (PROSE: The Power of the Daleks [+]John Peel, adapted from The Power of the Daleks (David Whitaker), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1993).) Indeed, this implication was backed up when eight more mysterious faces appeared during the Fourth Doctor's mindbending battle aginst Morbius on Karn; (TV: The Brain of Morbius [+]Robin Bland, Doctor Who season 13 (BBC1, 1976).) and when the Thirteenth Doctor encountered an unknown incarnation from her past who already used the name of the Doctor and traveled in the TARDIS, whom she had no memories of and who was hiding from the Division. (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nOne of these accounts stated that these 8 faces and the \"Fugitive Doctor\" existed as a result of the Doctor actually being the Timeless Child, a being capable of endless regeneration who had their regeneration limited to the usual twelve (after being forced to regenerate into the infant First Doctor) and their memories erased. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) When the Thirteenth Doctor discovered this, she experienced an identity crisis before she rediscovered herself. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) Nevertheless, the Doctor was still deeply disturbed by this discovery into their fourteenth and fifteenth incarnations. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nWhatever the account and source, the Doctor's origin and life before leaving Gallifrey were always told in many versions that contradicted themselves, partly due to shifting timelines caused by the Doctor's own travels (AUDIO: Previously, Next Time; PROSE: Celestial Intervention - A Gallifreyan Noir [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (BBC Children's Books, 2018).) and many enemies, with so many possibilities becoming true at once, in a paradox. (PROSE: Celestial Intervention - A Gallifreyan Noir [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (BBC Children's Books, 2018).) Notably, after he reunited with the Fourteenth Doctor, the Toymaker stated that he \"made a jigsaw out of [their] history\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nStrangely in cases of regeneration, the Second Doctor emerged from their \"renewal\" already wearing his own signature outfit instead of his predecessor's clothes, the process having changed the clothes as well. (TV: The Power of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) This only happened one more time, when their thirteenth incarnation eventually regenerated into their fourteenth. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nHowever, the First Doctor's successor retained the specs and signet ring originally used and worn by the First Doctor, though he quickly found out that he didn't need glasses anymore and that the signet ring no longer fit on his thicker finger, so he discarded them, with the ring falling into the TARDIS control console. (TV: The Power of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966)., PROSE: The Power of the Daleks [+]John Peel, adapted from The Power of the Daleks (David Whitaker), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1993).) He eventually found the ring in the console while in his seventh life and wore it again for a time, before giving it to Joan Redfern. (PROSE: Human Nature) Nevertheless, a version of the Doctor posing as Merlin eventually came to possess and wear the ring again. (PROSE: Birthright [+]Nigel Robinson, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1993).) The ring contained no sonic technology, but the First Doctor could still use it like the other Doctors used their sonic screwdrivers. (GAME: Sonic Adventure) As such, he was one of the few incarnations to not be overly reliant on sonic devices, the others being the Fifth Doctor, who preferred a \"hands-free\" approach (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) after his screwdriver was destroyed, (TV: The Visitation) and the Fugitive Doctor, who considered herself too smart for the \"gizmo\". (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nThe First Doctor was not the last to wear glasses. His fifth incarnation introduced the concept of \"brainy specs\", glasses worn to make himself look clever. (TV: Frontios) The concept itself was named by the Tenth Doctor, who also had a pair, (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) while his successor employed glasses which he borrowed from Amy Pond, but kept after losing her and Rory Williams to the Weeping Angels, (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan) with the two complimenting each other's glasses. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) A later, retired incarnation of the Doctor from far into his future, the Curator, also had a pair of \"brainy specs\" and stated his aforementioned predecessors' glasses were indeed used mainly to make them look clever. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) The Fugitive Doctor also had a pair of \"brainy specs\". (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nLike with the glasses, the Second Doctor did not need to use the First Doctor's cane, which was the case for most future incarnations. However, the Third Doctor once used a cane that also doubled as a laser to disintegrate a creature. (COMIC: Assassin from Space) and the Eleventh Doctor started using a cane as he aged more and more while defending Christmas during the 900-year old Siege of Trenzalore before he ultimately regenerated. (TV: The Time of the Doctor) Many lifetimes later, the Tenth Doctor found his original walking stick cane, along with a copy of his original outfit, enshrined as the primary possession of his first incarnation in a \"museum\" within the TARDIS Matrix. When suffering from memory loss, touching the cane restored his recollections of the First Doctor's life, and he recalled the cane's role in saving Menkaure in particular. It was later used alongside his other incarnations' possessions to give form to the First Doctor in the Time Lord's final confrontation with Es'Cartrss. (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).)\n\nThe Second Doctor inherited the white TARDIS console room used by his predecessor, which he used for most of his own life. While he traveled for a time with the console room remodeled due to synchronizing his TARDIS with Gallifrey by linking it to the Stattenheim remote control, (AUDIO: The Black Hole) the Second Doctor started and ended his life while using the basic white TARDIS control room, which the Third Doctor also briefly inherited. (TV: The Power of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966)., The War Games in Colour) However, by the time he became UNIT's scientific advisor, the control room eventually underwent a significant change in design; (TV: The Time Monster, The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973).) The design of the console room underwent many alterations as the Doctor himself regenerated, tough it was not until near the end of his seventh incarnation that the desktop theme was completely changed as the Victorian parlour. (TV: Doctor Who)\n\nThe original design meanwhile was recreated and archived by the TARDIS \"for neatness\". (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) The war console used by the Doctor's War incarnation during the Last Great Time War in particular had a similar design with with his first incarnation's console room, specifically the white walls full of roundels. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) The First Doctor he kept brandy in one of the roundels and, many lifetimes later, River Song found it stored within the roundels of the Twelfth Doctor's TARDIS and took to drinking some of it whenever using the TARDIS without the Doctor's knowledge, much to his surprise. (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nAccording to most accounts, at the end of the Last Great Time War, the War Doctor returned to the barn in which he slept in as a young First Doctor, bringing with him the Moment, which he intended to use to destroy Gallifrey, the Time Lords and the Daleks. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) He returned to his childhood home as he believed he could only find courage to meet his end by returning to the beginning. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) However, the Moment opened a time fissure leading to his future to show him the consequences of his actions. The War Doctor returned from the future with the Moment ready to detonate. Soon after his arrival, the Tenth Doctor, the Eleventh Doctor and a younger version of Clara Oswald arrived to assist him in Gallifrey's destruction. However, the Moment showed them the direct consequences of their actions and the Eleventh Doctor decided to alter their plan. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAfter returning to Gallifrey, the Twelfth Doctor returned to the barn and went into the loft where he slept as a child. A woman came in yelling at him that the things in the barn were for \"the boys\", but upon recognising him, told the Doctor that he would be killed for coming back to Gallifrey. Angry at the death of Clara Oswald, the Doctor took a stand outside of the barn against Rassilon, ordering Rassilon off of Gallifrey. One by one, the Time Lord soldiers and even The General joined the Doctor in front of the barn, ultimately overthrowing Rassilon. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nThe First Doctor received a library card from Shoreditch Library and retained it to as late as his eleventh incarnation, who mistakenly presented it as his identification to a group of Saturnyns, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) before he eventually obtained his own. The Thirteenth Doctor still had her first incarnation's library card as well as cards for her ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth incarnations. (COMIC: A Little Help from My Friends)\n\nImmediately after his first regeneration, the Second Doctor was at one of the weakest points in his life, allowing the Timewyrm to enter his mind, where it would stay until he travelled to Panjistri with Ben and Polly. (PROSE: Timewyrm: Revelation [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Total Eclipse, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1991).)\nAfter the renewal was completed, the new Doctor found himself suspected as an impostor by Ben, while Polly was more ready to believe that he was the same Doctor. (TV: The Power of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966)., COMIC: The Chameleon Factor [+]Paul Cornell, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics, 1991).) Very soon after, they all became caught up in events on the planet Vulcan. (TV: The Power of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) The Eleventh Doctor  experienced similar doubts from Ian and Barbara when he reunited with them. (COMIC: Hunters of the Burning Stone [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2013).) The Tenth Doctor was also similarly mistaken for an impostor of the Ninth Doctor by Rose Tyler moments after the Ninth Doctor's regeneration. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nUpon coming back into contact with the Second Doctor, the War Chief revealed that he knew who he was despite his change in appearance. Due to the First Doctor and his successor breaking the Time Lord non-interference policy, the Second Doctor was forced to stand trial by the Time Lords and sentenced to an exile on Earth and forced regeneration; after the process, the Third Doctor continued his exile on 1970s Earth (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) until he helped the Time Lords defeat Omega. (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973).) While ordering the Second Doctor's change of appearance at the end of the Doctor's trial, the First Time Lord reminded the Doctor that \"[his] appearance ha[d] changed before\". (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).)\n\nWhen the Third Doctor was strapped to a mind analysis machine during the Time Paradox Incident, images of the First and Second Doctors appeared on its screen, causing the Daleks to recognize him as their sworn enemy. (TV: Day of the Daleks [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).)\n\nWhen the Fourth Doctor connected his mind to Morbius through a machine for a mindbending contest, on its screen appeared images of the known Doctors in reverse order, with the First Doctor appearing last, before being followed by 8 mysterious faces. (TV: The Brain of Morbius [+]Robin Bland, Doctor Who season 13 (BBC1, 1976).) The Fourth Doctor also remembered how his second incarnation fought the Daleks on Vulcan after regenerating from the First Doctor. (AUDIO: The Power of the Daleks [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He remembered his first incarnation as the \"grumpy one\". (TV: Dimensions in Time [+]John Nathan-Turner and David Roden, Doctor Who 30th anniversary special (BBC1, 1993).)\n\nThe Fourth Doctor once traveled to the Medusa Cascade with Romana II, (PROSE: City of Death [+]James Goss, adapted from City of Death (David Agnew (writer)), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2015).) revisiting it after first seeing it as young First Doctor when he was just a child, something the Tenth Doctor briefly reminisced about during the Planetary Relocation Incident. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhen the Fifth Doctor interfered with the CyberNeomorphs' attempt to blow up Earth, they recognized the TARDIS and identified their enemy as the Doctor; they then recounted previous Cybermen encounters with the Doctor, including the First Doctor interfering in the 1986 Cyberman invasion of Earth. (TV: Earthshock [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).)\n\nThe First Doctor was among the things the 1983 Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart remembered as he recovered his memories from coming into contact with his younger 1977 self, who in turn lost his memories from the same cause during an adventure with the Fifth Doctor. (TV: Mawdryn Undead [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).)\n\nDuring the Duplicate Incident, the Fifth Doctor was captured by the Daleks and subjected to a duplication machine for the purpose of creating a copy to assassinate the Time Lord High Council. During the process, the Doctor's mind was scanned and the machine's monitor displayed images of present and past companions, as well as the Doctor's past incarnations, including the First Doctor. Ultimately, the process was stopped by Stien, a defective Dalek duplicate. (TV: Resurrection of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).)\n\nWhen the Fifth Doctor accidentally came into contact with the Tenth Doctor when their iterations of the TARDIS collided, he was reminded by his future self of their time as the First Doctor: \"Back when I first started, at the very beginning, I was always trying to be old and grumpy and important, like you do when you're young.\" (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).).\n\nAfter sealing Gallifrey away in a pocket dimension, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) the Seventh Doctor was able to recall teaming up with his other twelve incarnations to save Gallifrey. (AUDIO: Cold Fusion [+]Lance Parkin, adapted from Cold Fusion (Lance Parkin), Novel Adaptations (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nWhen the Seventh Doctor's memories were reviewed by the the Dalek Emperor and the Imperial Guard while on the Death Wheel during Operation Genocide, images of his previous incarnations, including the First Doctor, appeared on screens; this allowed the Daleks to identify the Doctor. (COMIC: Nemesis of the Daleks [+]Richard Alan and Steve Alan, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics, 1989).)\n\nThe Seventh Doctor relived his memories of the First Doctor's regeneration while he was interrogated by Matheson Catcher. (PROSE: Christmas on a Rational Planet [+]Lawrence Miles, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) When the Doctor's friends travelled through the Seventh Doctor's memories, they experienced all six of his previous regenerations, including the First Doctor's. (PROSE: Lungbarrow [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Lungbarrow, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).)\n\nCuriously, when the Eighth Doctor looked into the Tomorrow Windows, he saw an incarnation identical to the First Doctor in his future. (PROSE: The Tomorrow Windows [+]Jonathan Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) Indeed, the Curator told the Eleventh Doctor that he \"might find [him]self revisiting a few [old faces]\" in the \"years to come\", though only \"old favourites\". (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) and the Thirteenth Doctor did eventually regenerate into an incarnation almost identical to the Tenth Doctor. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nWhen he was told by Nancy that he needed to speak with \"the doctor\" (in reality Doctor Constantine) to find out more about the Empty Child, the Ninth Doctor was accidentally led to believe he was another of his incarnations. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor also lost his hand in a swordsmanship duel similar to the First Doctor, tough this time against a Sycorax leader. Unlike his first incarnation, the Tenth Doctor almost immediately regrew his hand using residual regenerative energy due to still being within his first fifteen hours of regeneration.  (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nJohn Smith's A Journal of Impossible Things featured a drawing of the First Doctor alongside the other past selves of the Doctor. (TV: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., PROSE: Extract from \"A Journal of Impossible Things [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, BBC Books (2013).)\n\nWhen the Tenth Doctor accidentally came into contact with the Fifth Doctor when their iterations of the TARDIS collided, he reminded his past self of their time as the First Doctor, saying: \"Back when I first started, at the very beginning, I was always trying to be old and grumpy and important, like you do when you're young.\" (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).).\n\nUpon meeting Jackson Lake, a man who believed himself to be the Doctor due to tampering with an infostamp stolen from the Cybermen to protect himself from them, the Tenth Doctor helped him realize who he was using his initialized fob watch and revealed his own identity using the infostamp stolen by the Cybermen from the Daleks by showing all his numbered incarnations up to that point, starting with the First Doctor. (TV: The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nShorty after his regeneration, the Eleventh Doctor asked the Atraxi (who were planning to destroy the Earth to kill Prisoner Zero) to review Earth's history about alien threats and what happened to them, causing them to display a hologram of his previous numbered selves, starting with the First Doctor; after which the Eleventh Doctor told them to \"Basically...

(TV: Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nTo quickly inform Craig Owens of his identity and the danger that lurks over his apartment, the Eleventh Doctor telepathically shared information with him by bumping their heads; among the knowledge Craig got were images of his previous numbered selves, including the First Doctor. (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nWhen he was taken over by the Cyber-Planner \"Mr Clever\", the Eleventh Doctor, as part of his plan to trick him that he could regenerate and burn him out of his brain and eventually extract him using chess as a distraction, showed him images of his previous numbered selves, starting with the First Doctor. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhen the Twelfth Doctor visited Snowcap University, he was unnerved due to associating the area with his first regeneration. (COMIC: Blood and Ice [+]Jacqueline Rayner, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2015).)\n\nAfter Missy used siphoned energy from Daleks to power her and Clara Oswald's vortex manipulators and save them from extermination, she explained to Clara that she copied the Doctor in a previous adventure and proceeded to tell the story to Clara; however, since she doesn't remember which incarnation of the Doctor had this adventure, she briefly imagined him as the First Doctor, before imagining him as the Twelfth.  (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nBy the time the Twelfth Doctor thwarted Bonnie and the Truth or Consequences' plans, a portrait of the First Doctor was hanging in a UNIT safe house, behind which was a decoy of the Osgood Box. (TV: The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nRiver Song once showed the Twelfth Doctor, whom she did not recognize at the time, pictures of his twelve predecessors, including the First Doctor. (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhile he conversed with Bill Potts about the prospect of testing Missy to find out if she could become good, the Twelfth Doctor revealed that, lifetimes ago, the young Master was the First Doctor's first \"man crush.\" (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Testimony Foundation had information regarding the Doctor's incarnations, including the First Doctor. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nTo escape form the Matrix, the Thirteenth Doctor used her and her other selves' collective memories, including those of the First Doctor, as well as any incarnation that seemingly came before him such as the Timeless Child and the Fugitive Doctor, to overload the Matrix. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nMemories of the First Doctor's encounter with the Toymaker flashed through the Fourteenth Doctor's mind when he again came face to face with the Toymaker. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nWhen the Fifteenth Doctor visited 1963 and pointed out the Totters Lane junkyard off in the distance to Ruby Sunday from atop EMI Recording Studios, saying he lived there with his granddaughter Susan, remembering his time as the First Doctor. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n}}\n\nWhen the Cyberiad allied with Rassilon to take over history, (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).) the First Doctor was ambushed by three CyberMondans outside his TARDIS in 76 Totter's Lane on the day he was supposed to leave Earth with Susan Foreman, Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright. When Susan entered the junkyard, the Doctor told her to run. (COMIC: Prologue: The First Doctor [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) This timeline was eventually unwritten by Rassilon and the Twelfth Doctor. (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nWhen Jamie McCrimmon and Zoe Heriot reattached the time path indicator in the Second Doctor's TARDIS, they overloaded its systems, causing a temporal collision with the First Doctor's ship, disabling its dematerialisation circuit and causing it to crash on Urbinia. The Doctor spent the next three months repairing the circuit. When he finished, the Dalek Empire invaded the planet, able to complete the Time Destructor without the Doctor's interference. With the chancellor fleeing, the Doctor took charge of the planet, trying to coordinate an evacuation before he was approached by his succeeding incarnation who explained how the timeline had been altered and what the correct path should be. Though the First Doctor was initially amenable, he protested when he learned that Katarina would die. After escaping a Dalek landing force, the Doctors reunited with their companions in the spaceport where the Second Doctor explained to Katarina what would happen. When the Daleks turned the Time Destructor on the planet, Katarina agreed to the Second Doctor's plan, the First Doctor giving his successor the repaired dematerialisation circuit. Unsure if the timeline would be reset, the First Doctor stayed behind in the spaceport, defying the Daleks before the timeline was ultimately reset. (AUDIO: Daughter of the Gods [+]David K Barnes, The Early Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nIn a parallel universe where the Second Doctor escaped his trial, the First Doctor went to the Academy with a Time Lord who found him to be an eternal bore. (AUDIO: Exile [+]Nicholas Briggs, Doctor Who Unbound (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nIn a universe where the Time War started early, a temporal \"aberration\" of the Sixth Doctor reflected on his first visit to Aridius shortly after arriving on the planet. (AUDIO: Dust Devil [+]John Dorney, Genesis (Doctor of War, Big Finish Productions, 2022).)\n\nIn his older years, the First Doctor was a guarded figure who was slow to trust newcomers who learnt of him, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Edge of Destruction [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) but once his trust had been earned, he would show himself to be a mischievous anti-authoritarian, (TV: The Space Museum [+]Glyn Jones, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Savages [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) who would not follow instructions without giving his own input, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) nor would he stand by and allow someone to bark orders without contributing themselves. (TV: The Reign of Terror [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) He was protective of the young women he took on as companions, as they reminded him of his granddaughter. (TV: The Massacre [+]John Lucarotti and Donald Tosh, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nThe First Doctor was a pragmatic individual, opting to focus on an objective that would benefit the majority, even if it meant being counterintuitive to his own safety and freedom, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Reign of Terror [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964)., The Web Planet [+]Bill Strutton, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Tenth Planet [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) and was not afraid to leave someone to their fate if it was too late to save them, (TV: The Chase [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) or if they were fated to die. (TV: The Massacre [+]John Lucarotti and Donald Tosh, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) He preferred to remain in the background and \"observe, note, collate, and then conclude\" before he acted. (TV: Galaxy 4 [+]William Emms, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nDisdainful towards \"fools\", (TV: The Crusade [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) and rather \"tetchy\" due to his youth, (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) the Doctor thought highly of his \"superior brain\", (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) and was prone to criticise those whom he felt were beneath his intellect, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., Marco Polo [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964)., The Crusade [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) even believing himself superior to those he saw as intellectually inferior. (COMIC: A Religious Experience [+]Tim Quinn, Doctor Who Yearbook 1994 (Doctor Who Yearbook comic stories, Marvel Comics, 1993).) He initially refused to kneel to Kublai Khan due to both his pride and a pain in his back, but was talked into do so by Susan, though he remained defiant towards the Great Khan's demands, which earned him the respect of the Khan. He did, however, respectfully bow to the Empress. (TV: Marco Polo [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) He could put his own interests ahead of others', but would abandon his plans if he realised they were putting him in danger. (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).)\n\nOriginally a very difficult and stubborn misanthrope, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) who would leave others to their own business in spite of the dangers they were in, (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964)., The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) the First Doctor matured from an apparent selfishness and became more inviting, (TV: The Rescue [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Time Meddler [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Myth Makers [+]Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965)., The Massacre [+]John Lucarotti and Donald Tosh, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., The Smugglers [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) less willing to involve others in his dangerous exploits, (TV: The Chase [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) and more friendly and approaching to new people. (TV: The Gunfighters [+]Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) His happier, kinder characteristics fostered when he began to acquire an entourage of companions to accompany him throughout the wonders of the fourth dimension and learned to be a caregiver with a sense of justice in a universe afflicted by evils. (COMIC: Hunters of the Burning Stone [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2013).) However, his ego persisted, with him telling white lies to inflate his own self-importance, (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) and his false modesty at being heralded by the Thals when he visited their city. (AUDIO: Return to Skaro [+]Andrew Smith, The First Doctor Adventures: Volume Four (The First Doctor Adventures, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nIn his youth, the young Doctor was something of a pessimist, until a conversation with the Hermit opened his eyes to the beauties in the mundane, (TV: The Time Monster [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) leading him to believe that it was impossible to \"diminish wonder, beauty and discovery,\" even when people tried to take the mystery out of things. (PROSE: Longest Day [+]Michael Collier, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) He never felt at home on Gallifrey. (AUDIO: No Place Like Home [+]Iain McLaughlin, Big Finish DWM originals (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) Upon leaving Gallifrey, the Doctor did not see \"good\" as \"a practical survival strategy\", as \"it require[d] loyalty, self-sacrifice, [and] love\", (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) but told Susan that \"individuals hungry for power\" were to be fought, and that \"the right thing to do was often forbidden\". (COMIC: Time & Time Again [+]Paul Cornell, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics, 1993).)\n\nDuring his early travels, the Doctor rarely smiled, (PROSE: Dr. First [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) although, when he first witnessed the French Revolution, his emotions were swept up in the revolutionary fervour and optimism as the French population around him rose up against their rulers. (PROSE: Just War [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) However, he remained satisfied with merely observing the universe due to having the non-interference policy ingrained into his psyche. (PROSE: Time and Relative [+]Kim Newman, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2001).) While he felt he had a duty to prevent outside intervention from corrupting a society, (COMIC: Operation Proteus [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1995).) he was willing to allow civilisations to be destroyed without aiding them, until Susan convinced him to save Earth from the Cold, which did gave him \"a feeling of satisfaction\". (PROSE: Time and Relative [+]Kim Newman, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2001).) However, the Doctor was mostly self-serving, even locking fleeing people out of Coal Hill School to better protect himself from the Space wolves, (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Horror of Coal Hill [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) though he still respected humanity as \"intelligent, sentient beings\" that were deserving of basic respects. (COMIC: Operation Proteus [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1995).)\n\nWhen the Doctor first met Ian and Barbara, he abducted them, and even set the TARDIS console to shock Ian when he tried to open the doors, justifying his actions by claiming he was keeping himself and Susan safe. He regarded humans as primitives, and contemplated killing the mortally wounded Za so that he would not slow him down. When Ian caught him apparently ready to bludgeon the man with a rock, the Doctor explained he merely wanted Za to draw him a map, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) but this was, in fact, a lie to cover up his murder attempt. (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) When first visiting Skaro, the Doctor was willing to risk everyone's safety so he could satisfy his own curiosity, resulting in them nearly dying from radiation poisoning in the prison cells of the Dalek city. (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) He also threatened to throw Ian and Barbara into space after accusing them of sabotage, but humbly apologised when he was proven wrong. (TV: The Edge of Destruction [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).)\n\nHe was willingly to put his morals aside to have others fight his battles for him, but was horrified when he learnt the full extent of the Daleks plans to exterminate the Thals, branding it \"sheer murder\". (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) He was also quick to bargain with the Tribe of Gum for Ian's safety, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) and offered to help build a ship for the Daleks to leave Skaro in return for Susan's safety. (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) The Twelfth Doctor later opined that his experience on Skaro helped shape his identity for the better. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nAs the Doctor travelled more, he began to thaw and help people, albeit reluctantly at times, (TV: The Keys of Marinus [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).) and more willingly on other occasions. (TV: The Reign of Terror [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) Eventually, he would not hesitate to dare to stop any \"menace to common humanity\" that he encountered in his travels, sometimes out of a \"moral obligation\" to minimise damages he felt responsible for. (TV: Planet of Giants [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964)., The Dalek Invasion of Earth [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964)., The Daleks' Master Plan [+]Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966)., The Savages [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., The Smugglers [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) However, he did not see himself as a saviour, instead as someone merely \"doing what [had] to be done\". (TV: The Daleks' Master Plan [+]Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).) Indeed, when the Doctor heard his twelfth incarnation declare the Earth to be protected, he failed to realise that his future self was referring to himself as the protector due to being in the \"early days\". (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nWhile he initially refused to help a fallen enemy, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) and would not hesitate to abandon someone to save himself, (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) the Doctor came to see it as \"monstrous\" and \"inhuman\" to leave a person to die by refusing them aid. (TV: The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964)., The Savages [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., The Tenth Planet [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) He even negotiated the release of the First Monk from the Daleks, despite peace not being brokered between the two. (TV: The Daleks' Master Plan [+]Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).)\n\nHe would sometimes fall back into old habits of focusing solely on his own interests, but was quicker to put his companions' safety first than he was before. (TV: Marco Polo [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) He would also forget his niceties when under pressure. (TV: The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964)., Planet of Giants [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964)., The Chase [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) While he claimed to never give advice, (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) the Doctor would share his wisdoms to those that needed it, (TV: The Keys of Marinus [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).) seeing that it was his responsibility as an elder to use his accumulated knowledge to help other people. (TV: The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) He came to hold such a welcoming presence that others would instantly feel they could trust him. (TV: The Rescue [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Crusade [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nWhile he could get easily flustered when he lost control of a situation, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Edge of Destruction [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) the First Doctor did not allow himself to be easily intimidated, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., Marco Polo [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964)., The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964)., The Dalek Invasion of Earth [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964)., The Myth Makers [+]Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965)., The War Machines [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., The Smugglers [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) even being willing to take a fight directly to his adversary's lair, (COMIC: The Klepton Parasites [+]Neville Main, TVC comic stories (1964-1965).) as he did not like to show when he was afraid. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) He employed self-control to keep his emotions in check and prevent his brain from becoming vulnerable to fear, (TV: The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) though would react with indignity if he thought his capabilities were being belittled. (TV: The Romans [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Chase [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nWhen he disagreed with something, the Doctor would deny the facts his companions gave to him in favour of believing his opinions. (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Edge of Destruction [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964)., Marco Polo [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964)., The Chase [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Time Meddler [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) He would get particularly annoyed with those who doubted the TARDIS could actually travel through space and time. (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Time Meddler [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) However, when he realised he had been in the wrong, the Doctor would acknowledge his blame in events and apologise. (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Edge of Destruction [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).)\n\nCraving the adventures to be found in the universe, (TV: The Reign of Terror [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) the Doctor did not like the idea of staying still, believing he would be \"bored to tears doing nothing\", (TV: The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) even deriding sleep as being \"[for] tortoises\". (COMIC: In-Between Times [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The French Revolution was among his favourite places in time and space. (TV: The Reign of Terror [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) He enjoyed learning of the new places he found himself and their properties, with his notebook being of high importance to him due to what he had documented inside of it. (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) When he was given the chance to obtain what he desired most, the Doctor asked for \"a well-equipped laboratory with every conceivable instrument\", (TV: The Keys of Marinus [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).) and he would also seek out other scientists to discuss their theories when the chance presented itself. (TV: The Massacre [+]John Lucarotti and Donald Tosh, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nHe could get excited by frightening experiences, such as being insistent on exploring an abandoned city, (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) erupting into uncontrollable giggles when told Marco Polo would take his TARDIS as a gift for Kublai Khan, (TV: Marco Polo [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) chuckling at the thought of an ambush as he and Ian pursued a person in a dark tunnel, (TV: The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) laughing as he fought off the assassin Ascaris, and finding amusement after he realised he accidentally had a hand in burning down Rome. (TV: The Romans [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nHe admired those who built and rebuilt civilisations, (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) and got especially giddy when he realised he was watching a solar system being created. (TV: The Edge of Destruction [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) While he disagreed with the Aztecs using human sacrifices, he did admire them for their architectural achievements, (TV: The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) and also held a passion for fifth dynasty Aquilian architecture. (PROSE: The Golden Door [+]David Auger, Decalog (Virgin Decalogs, 1994).) However, he took contradictory satisfaction in destroying something that helped in \"evil\". (TV: The Savages [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nHe disliked whistling, (TV: The Chase [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) unnecessary climbing, (TV: The Time Meddler [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) riding camels, (COMIC: Plague of the Black Scorpi [+]Bill Mevin, TVC comic stories (1966).) hippies and pop music. (PROSE: Dr. First [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He also \"loathed\" recorders, (AUDIO: The Power of the Daleks [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and looked down on the sonic screwdriver and the sonic sunglasses. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe First Doctor liked pomegranates, grapes, (TV: The Keys of Marinus [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).) hot chocolate, (TV: The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) coconut milk, (COMIC: Plague of the Black Scorpi [+]Bill Mevin, TVC comic stories (1966).) and chocolate ice cream. (PROSE: Bide-a-Wee [+]Anthony Keetch, Short Trips: Past Tense (Short Trips, 2004).)\n\nWhile he claimed to \"never touch\" alcohol, and would decline it when offered, (TV: The Gunfighters [+]Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., The Smugglers [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) the Doctor enjoyed mead, (TV: The Time Meddler [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) wine, (TV: The Smugglers [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) and kept brandy in his TARDIS. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) He also drank Madeira with Samuel Pike, (TV: The Smugglers [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) shared a few glasses of Médoc with John Lucarotti, (PROSE: The Meeting [+]John Lucarotti, Brief Encounter First printing (1990).) and told Steven that he wanted chilled white wine while in France. (PROSE: The Massacre [+]John Lucarotti, adapted from The Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve (Donald Tosh and John Lucarotti), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1987).)\n\nBelieving that \"nothing [was] impossible\", (PROSE: The Nine-Day Queen [+]Matthew Jones, Decalog 2: Lost Property (Virgin Decalogs, 1995).) the Doctor was adamant that there was \"always a way\" out of a conundrum, (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964)., Planet of Giants [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).) and would implore those in doubt to have hope, (TV: The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) though he thought hope was forever linked with fear. (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) When Dyoni feared the Thals' history would die with them, the Doctor encouraged her to have hope, (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) and also encouraged Carol Richmond to have courage that John would recover from the Sensorites' attack. (TV: The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) He was insisted that he should not give up a task until he had at least tried it first. (TV: Planet of Giants [+]Louis Marks, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).)\n\nWhile he could be pessimistic, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) the Doctor believed that there was a reason for everything in the universe, (TV: The Chase [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) having left Gallifrey to find what \"[kept] the balance between good and evil in [the] appalling universe\", and why \"good prevail[ed]\" despite not being \"a practical survival strategy\" in the face of \"evil\". (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) He believed that evil \"[didn't] follow principle\", and that \"the greatest evil [was] inaction\", with rules \"just [being] distractions\". He thought that the best way to combat evils was with kindness and understanding. (POEM: A Simple Truth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He also thought that the smallest and most seemingly unimportant of details could lead to the \"greatest discoveries\". (TV: The Space Museum [+]Glyn Jones, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nWhile he could disagree with the culture of the civilisations he visited, the Doctor did not see it as his place to judge and interfere with their business, (TV: The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) though found the slavery of humans to be \"inhuman and wicked\", (COMIC: The Trodos Tyranny [+]Roger Noel Cook, TVC comic stories (1966).) decreeing that one should both never \"be a slave to time\" or waste it. (PROSE: Barbara in Wonderland [+]Rowan Ayers, Radio Times short stories (1964).)\n\nSeeing that \"fear [made] companions of [everyone]\", (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) the Doctor thought that forging alliances between factions was reward enough for his travels and efforts, (COMIC: Mission for Duh [+]The Dr Who Annual 1967 (Doctor Who annual, 1966).) and believed it was important to honour agreements made in an exchange. (COMIC: Challenge of the Piper [+]Neville Main, TVC comic stories (1965).) He thought that bias based on appearance instead of intelligence was unwelcome, (TV: Galaxy 4 [+]William Emms, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965).) and defied the suggestion that progress was based on exploitation, branding it as \"protracted murder\". (TV: The Savages [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nSeeing everyone as \"adrift on a sea of random[ness]\" caused from decisions taken by millions of strangers, the Doctor sought to \"steer through the storm\" in the \"tempest of chaos\" as he \"resolve[d] to make good progress when the wind [was] behind [him]\". (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Horror of Coal Hill [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He also theorised that fate was on the side of justice. (COMIC: The Experimenters [+]Roger Noel Cook, TVC comic stories (1966).)\n\nDue to his adventures, the Doctor was unable to \"feel very much fear\". (PROSE: The Sons of the Crab [+]The Dr Who Annual 1966 (Doctor Who annual, 1965).)\n\nWhile the First Doctor learned to disapprove of violence, (TV: The Gunfighters [+]Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) he was not averse to beating his opponents with his bare hands in self-defence, (TV: The Romans [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) and could be dismissive towards casual violence. (PROSE: Tarnished Image [+]Guy Clapperton, Decalog 3: Consequences (Virgin Decalogs, 1996).) While he also disliked guns, (TV: The Gunfighters [+]Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) he noted that weapons were \"handy little things\" when used for protection, (TV: The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) and even constructed a ray gun explicitly to help destroy Daleks. (COMIC: The Defeat of the Daleks [+]GASPS comics (Kenner, 1965).) He disapproved of revenge. (TV: The Keys of Marinus [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).)\n\nAfter seeing the callousness of the Daleks, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Doctor came to stand against \"senseless, evil killing\", (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964)., The Daleks' Master Plan [+]Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966)., The Savages [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) vowing to only take a life if his own was sufficiently threatened, (TV: The Dalek Invasion of Earth [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).) and was greatly disturbed when he saw needless bloodshed. (TV: The Myth Makers [+]Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965)., The Smugglers [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) He thought that to sacrifice a life in the name of progress to be \"nauseating\" and \"inhumane\". (TV: The Savages [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nWhile he was willing to drop bombs on the Master Race's city, he knew to be careful not to hit the innocent prisoners. (COMIC: The Experimenters [+]Roger Noel Cook, TVC comic stories (1966).)\n\nBecause they could be caught off-guard by the unexpected, (COMIC: The Gyros Injustice [+]Neville Main, TVC comic stories (1965).) the First Doctor looked down on machines, as, while they could make laws, he did not believe they could preserve justice, seeing only living beings capable of doing so, which was his reasoning for why \"man was [not] made to be controlled by machines\". (TV: The Keys of Marinus [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).) While he was defensive towards his TARDIS's capabilities, (TV: The Daleks' Master Plan [+]Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).) he viewed travel dials as \"perfectly acceptable method[s] of travel\", as they were \"very compact and very neat\". (TV: The Keys of Marinus [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964).)\n\nWhen it came to changing history, the Doctor knew he \"[couldn't] stem the tide\", instead focusing on not \"being carried away with the flood\", (TV: The Reign of Terror [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) preferring to \"watch and wait\" in the trust that time would sort itself out in the end. (AUDIO: Daybreak [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He stood against \"time meddler[s]\", (TV: The Time Meddler [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) believing that not a single line in history should be altered, (TV: The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) even if it meant sending someone to their death in a historical event, such as when he sent Anne Chaplet back to Paris before the St Bartholomew's Day massacre, though admitted there was a possibility she would survive. (TV: The Massacre [+]John Lucarotti and Donald Tosh, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) However, he would interfere if he believed the effect to time would be minuscule, (COMIC: Unnatural Selection [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) such as when he tried to convince King Richard to carry out a peace plan that was fated to fail. (TV: The Crusade [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) After watching the Twelfth Doctor alter time slightly to save the lives of Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart and a German soldier, the First Doctor took his future self's meddling to be a good indicator of the man he would eventually become. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nComparing himself to an immigrant, (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Horror of Coal Hill [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor claimed he was \"a scientist of no time or place\", (COMIC: The Caterpillar Men [+]TV Comic Annual stories (1965).) being \"a citizen of the universe, and a gentleman to boot\". (TV: The Daleks' Master Plan [+]Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).) He once claimed to Vicki that he was \"a wanderer and a survivor\" in \"the fourth dimension of space and time\", as well as \"a refugee from an ancient civilisation, cut off from [his] own people by aeons of time and universes far beyond human understanding\". (PROSE: The Empire of Glass [+]Andy Lane, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).) He once described himself as having \"the directional instinct of a homing pigeon\". (TV: The Chase [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).)\n\nReflecting on his successors, the First Doctor labelled his third and second incarnations as \"a dandy and a clown\", and joked when meeting them for the first time to battle Omega that they had yet to do anything. However, he did get along with them to a point, though got noticeably frustrated when the Second Doctor was slow to catch on. (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973).) He also got on well with his fifth incarnation, admitting he did \"quite well\" after the Game of Rassilon and was reassured that his future was in \"safe hands\". (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) While combating Adam Mitchell's Autons, the First Doctor associated himself with his second and seventh incarnations, combining with them to think of a solution to the situation. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) However, he disliked his seventh incarnation, believing him to be \"too manipulative\". (PROSE: Five Card Draw [+]Todd Green, Short Trips: Zodiac (Short Trips, 2002).) Upon meeting his tenth incarnation, the First Doctor took a disliking to him and his behaviour. (AUDIO: Collision Course [+]Guy Adams, The Legacy of Time (Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nThe First Doctor was confused by the mannerisms of his twelfth incarnation, such as his use of the sonic sunglasses, (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) and did not like him at first, leading the First Doctor to make comments that he knew would wind the Twelfth Doctor up, (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) but eventually confided in him his fears of regenerating, and came to respect his future incarnation after seeing him save two men from death. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nSeveral of his future incarnations had a noticeably profound respect for the First Doctor, so much so that they dared not question his judgement, or argue in his presence, (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973)., The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) with the exception of the Eleventh Doctor, who looked upon his first incarnation with shame, branding him a \"selfish idiot\" and a coward, (COMIC: Hunters of the Burning Stone [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2013).) with the Twelfth Doctor recognising that his past incarnations would let the First Doctor get away with whatever he wanted, but stated that he would not do the same, (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) though meeting his first incarnation still made him excited. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor remembered the First Doctor as a \"fierce old man\". (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) The Twelfth Doctor considered his first incarnation to have been \"eccentric, a bit mad, [and] rude to people,\" (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and was rather shocked at some of his mannerisms, particularly his lack of political correctness (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) that was deliberately exaggerated by the First Doctor to make his future incarnation feel uncomfortable due to his initial dislike of him. (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) The Fourteenth Doctor lambasted his first incarnation for being \"so sure of [him]self\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe First Doctor's strongest relationship was with his granddaughter, Susan Foreman, with him always putting her wellbeing first, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Edge of Destruction [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) even if he could come across as condescending towards her, refusing to tolerate her ideas and treating her like a child, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964)., The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964)., The Dalek Invasion of Earth [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).) though he appreciated her faith in him highly. (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) His last act of paternity towards Susan was to leave her in the 22nd century with David Campbell, a freedom fighter she had fallen in love with, to start her own life. (TV: The Dalek Invasion of Earth [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964).)\n\nWhile visiting 15th century Tenochtitlan, the Doctor became attracted to an elderly Aztec woman named Cameca, admiring her for being \"intelligent and gentle\". While he was shocked to be accidently engaged to her due to misunderstanding an Aztec custom, when the time came for him to leave, he could not bring himself to depart without the brooch she had gifted to him. (TV: The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).)\n\nThe Doctor was protective of youngsters, being morally outraged when he found the Pied Piper keeping children away from their parents, (COMIC: Challenge of the Piper [+]Neville Main, TVC comic stories (1965).) and helping Santa Claus build model TARDISes so as not to disappoint the children who has asked for one for Christmas. (COMIC: A Christmas Story [+]Bill Mevin, TVC comic stories (Polystyle Publications, Ltd., 1965-1966).)\n\nThe First Doctor had a low opinion of the Master, dismissing him as a \"charlatan\" and taking great pleasure in outsmarting the Inventor Master. (AUDIO: The Destination Wars [+]Matt Fitton, The First Doctor Adventures: Volume One (The First Doctor Adventures, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nWhile Susan once described her grandfather as being a \"great man\", (AUDIO: Domain of the Voord [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor considered himself to be very dangerous when roused. Geoffrey Chaucer, meanwhile, described the Doctor as being \"a man of rare wit and temper, a philosopher.\" (AUDIO: The Doctor's Tale [+]Marc Platt, The Early Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2014).) Ian Chesterton once described the First Doctor as being \"basically good, but bad-tempered, [and] mischievous\" and also voiced that he \"sometimes [didn't] trust him\". (PROSE: Venusian Lullaby [+]Paul Leonard, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).) Dodo Chaplet implied that she thought the First Doctor to be \"condescending, arrogant, smug and irritating\". (PROSE: Tarnished Image [+]Guy Clapperton, Decalog 3: Consequences (Virgin Decalogs, 1996).) Steven Taylor recalled the Doctor as being \"a wily, old character\". (TV: The Time Meddler [+]Phil Ford, Tales of the TARDIS tales of the tardis (BBC iPlayer, 2023).)\n\nPrincess Joanna told the Doctor that \"there [was] something new in [him], [and] yet something older than the sky itself.\" (TV: The Crusade [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) When recalling her encounter with the First Doctor to Mortimus, Ace described him as \"sweet\". (PROSE: No Future [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).) When the Eighth Doctor had a tarot card reading, the First Doctor was identified as \"the Hierophant\". (PROSE: The City of the Dead [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nWhile the Tremas Master found him admirable for his intelligence, he also admitted that the First Doctor was a \"bore\", (GAME: Destiny of the Doctors [+]Hannah Redler, Gary Russell, Terrance Dicks and Andy Russell, BBC Multimedia (1997).) with Adam Mitchell identifying the First Doctor as the \"educator\" in comparison to his other incarnations. (COMIC: Unnatural Selection [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nAs he felt his first regeneration nearing, the Doctor hoped that his successor would be a better man than he was. However, he was fearful of the regeneration, knowing that it would change him beyond recognition. (PROSE: The Man in the Velvet Mask [+]Daniel O'Mahony, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) Though he continued to be afraid of the change, (PROSE: Ten Little Aliens [+]Stephen Cole, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) the Doctor put on a brave face to comfort Polly Wright while dying as a prisoner of the CyberMondans. After Ben Jackson rescued them, the Doctor hurryingly made his way back to the TARDIS, (TV: The Tenth Planet [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) and became determined to fight the regeneration, branding \"the whole thing\" as \"ridiculous\". (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) His fear of regenerating grew during an encounter with his twelfth incarnation, where he learned he would become known as \"the Doctor of War\" to the Testimony Foundation, and saw recordings of the conflicts his future selves would participate in. However, after witnessing the Twelfth Doctor alter time to spare two lives on a battlefield, the First Doctor understood what he would truly become, and decided to return to the South Pole to regenerate, (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) using the last of his strength to unlock the door for Ben and Polly. (TV: The Tenth Planet [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nThe First Doctor would frequently end his sentences with a questioning hum, something which was picked up by those that acquired elements of his personality, such as Jano (TV: The Savages [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) and the newly-regenerated Fifth Doctor. (TV: Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) He also made a habit of putting his fingers to his lips when thinking, an impulse that was also subconsciously adopted by Jano when he absorbed a piece of the Doctor's consciences, (TV: The Savages [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) and holding onto his lapels, which was also imitated by the Fifth Doctor when he mentally relapsed back into his first incarnation's mannerisms. (TV: Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).)\n\nThe First Doctor polluted his speech with unpredictable stuttering (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964)., The Edge of Destruction [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964)., The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964)., The Sensorites [+]Peter R.

(TV: The Ark [+]Paul Erickson and Lesley Scott, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nHe also made a habit of repeatedly uttering \"dear\", (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964)., Marco Polo [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964)., The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964)., The Dalek Invasion of Earth [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964)., The Rescue [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Web Planet [+]Bill Strutton, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).,  The Crusade [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Space Museum [+]Glyn Jones, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The Chase [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965)., The War Machines [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) \"yes\", (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964)., The Edge of Destruction [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964)., Marco Polo [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964)., The Keys of Marinus [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv and BBC1, 1964)., The Sensorites [+]Peter R.

(TV: An Unearthly Child, The Reign of Terror, Planet of Giants, The Dalek Invasion of Earth) He was also known to stand with his hands behind his back, (TV: The Edge of Destruction, The Sensorites, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Rescue, The Web Planet, The Space Museum, The Chase, The Ark, The Celestial Toymaker) and would sometimes stand with his hands in his pockets, flicking his coat back as he did so. (TV: The Edge of Destruction, The Aztecs, The Sensorites, The Rescue, The Space Museum, The War Machines, The Tenth Planet)\n\nAs he was on the run from the Time Lords, (AUDIO: The Five Companions) the Doctor never stated the nature of his own origins, other than to hint that Susan and himself were exiled from another place and time, (TV: An Unearthly Child) and to state that he and the Monk originated on the same world. (TV: The Time Meddler)\n\nThe First Doctor was very particular about how others addressed him; he never liked how Drax called him \"Theta Sigma\", (PROSE: Devided Loyalties) refused to answer to the name \"Dr. Foreman\", (TV: An Unearthly Child) disliked being referred to as \"Doc\", (TV: The Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Time Meddler, The Five Doctors) and also didn't like being called \"Pop\". (TV: The Gunfighters)\n\nWhen met with a concept he rejected, he would describe the ideas as \"rubbish\".[source needed] He had a tendency to use \"ugly costumer\" when referring to his opponents. (COMIC: The Klepton Parasites, The Hijackers of Thrax) He would also shout, \"Great powers\", when surprised. (COMIC: The Haunted Planet, The Underwater Robot, Return of the Trods)\n\nThe First Doctor was more of an intellectual incarnation, and would mostly leave the fighting to others, due to his older and frail appearance. (PROSE: The Eleventh Tiger) He was certainly a thinker, preferring to find the best way of tricking himself out of a situation to achieve victory, (TV: An Unearthly Child, The Reign of Terror, The Romans, The Crusade) with the Doctor believing that knowledge was the only way to defeat the \"evil creatures\" of the universe. (PROSE: Salvation) Because of this, the Elders recognised him as a man of infinite wisdom. (TV: The Savages)\n\nTrying his best to avoid making \"uninformed guesses\", (TV: The Sensorites) the Doctor's broad range of knowledge allowed him to make various complex calculations from memory. (PROSE: City at World's End) He could be an effective detective when the situation called for it, (TV: The Keys of Marinus) and also see a person's true character behind their attempts to disguise it. (TV: The Massacre, The Smugglers) At the conclusion of the Game of Rassilon, it was the First Doctor who realised the meaning of the riddle in the Tower of Rassilon, with none of his future incarnations uncovering the meaning until he explained it to them. (TV: The Five Doctors)\n\nWhilst normally peaceful, the Doctor would, when pressed, resort to hand-to-hand combat with an effectiveness which belied his age, (TV: The Romans, The Crusade, The Chase) usually relying on his intelligence to outwit his opponents and to find simple ways to deflect attacks, (PROSE: The Eleventh Tiger) and using whatever he could get his hands on as a weapon. (TV: The Rescue, The Romans) He had a knowledge of Venusian aikido, (AUDIO: The Y Factor) and was able to overpower Dako when he took him by surprise, (TV: The Space Museum) and also managed to take down the First Monk after he had sufficiently intimidated him. (TV: The Daleks' Master Plan) He proved to be a capable swordsman, (TV: The Crusade) even if he had to use his cane as a makeshift blade. (TV: The Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Chase) At other times, however, the Doctor revealed age-related vulnerabilities, such as needing to catch his breath after a long period of running, (TV: An Unearthly Child) the rheumatism he suffered from that flared up if he was exposed to cold, (TV: The Space Museum) and Ian noted that the Doctor's moments of physical activity often left him more fatigued and weary than he normally was after the effort was over. (PROSE: The Eleventh Tiger)\n\nWhile he proved inept with a hand gun, (PROSE: The Gunfighters) the Doctor was a crack shot with long-range firearms, (COMIC: On the Web Planet, Space Station Z-7) and could also hit a target with a frisbee. (COMIC: The Galaxy Games)\n\nHaving been taught by the Master, (PROSE: The Dark Path) the Doctor could perform hypnosis, using a fob watch to induce sleep in a giant lizard, (COMIC: Lizardworld) and using his signet ring to break Dodo Chaplet's mind control by the artificial intelligence WOTAN, causing her to sleep for two days and forget her ordeal. (TV: The War Machines) He once claimed he could read minds. (TV: The Sensorites)\n\nThe First Doctor was something of an inventor, being able to tinker with machines until they were functional, (TV: The Chase) rework technologies to suit his benefits, (TV: Galaxy 4, The Daleks' Master Plan) and build new contraptions for his needs. (TV: The Myth Makers, The War Machines)\n\nThe Doctor could diagnose atropine poisoning, and was able to quickly create an antidote when he had the right equipment, (TV: The Sensorites) and was also able to manufacture a cure to a mutation of the common cold. (TV: The Ark) He could also recognise a dislocated bone on sight, and fix it just as quickly. (TV: The Smugglers)\n\nThough he required spectacles for reading, the Doctor's eyesight was better than a human's. (PROSE: The Plotters)\n\nThe Doctor could pilot a rocket, (COMIC: The Experimenters) drive a car, (PROSE: The Time Travellers) and ride a horse, though he found it uncomfortable to do so. (PROSE: Bunker Soldiers)\n\nWhile the Doctor had virtually no control over his TARDIS, (TV: The Daleks) due in part to piloting it by himself without the needed amount of pilots, (TV: Journey's End) he was able to pilot the TARDIS to Venus circa 3000000000 BC, explaining that, as it was close to the origin of the universe, plotting coordinates was more stable, though the process was still difficult, causing the TARDIS to shake badly during the journey. (PROSE: Venusian Lullaby) After a period of time where Rassilon allowed him complete control over his TARDIS, (PROSE: The Witch Hunters) the Doctor had gained enough experience to return the TARDIS to 1986 Antarctica from 1914 Ypres. However, he wasn't confident in his ability to pilot it after initially taking off from Antarctica and was amazed by his future incarnation's ability to flawlessly pilot the TARDIS to Villengard. (TV: Twice Upon a Time)\n\nThe Doctor once claimed to be able to speak all the Chinese dialects, (PROSE: The Eleventh Tiger) and could also read Old High Gallifreyan. (TV: The Five Doctors)\n\nThe Doctor was a skilled gambler, being able to win half of Asia in a game of backgammon with Kublai Khan, (TV: Marco Polo) and could at least imitate the Toymaker's voice. (TV: The Celestial Toymaker) He was an effective pickpocket. (TV: The Reign of Terror)\n\nHe was also quick to learn new skills when required; when trapped on the planet Avalon, the Doctor spent a few days being coached in the planet's \"magic\" by Kilvenny Odoyle, and was then able to hold his own against the powerful magician, Gramling, in a magical duel, at one point engaging Gramling on his own after his enemy had been weakened by Odoyle and Anni Glassfeather. (PROSE: The Sorcerer's Apprentice) He had also been trained to be a ninja while on Quinnis. (PROSE: The Devil Goblins from Neptune)\n\nThe Doctor had a knack for knowing one's character and finding who to trust, (TV: Marco Polo) and had the ability to sense an alien presence, getting goose bumps upon seeing the Post Office Tower and claiming that there was \"something alien\" about it. (TV: The War Machines)\n\nThe First Doctor could suppress strong bouts of pain though sheer willpower. (PROSE: A Big Hand for the Doctor) He proved a stealthy person, able to draw out the First Monk from his monastery hideout and sneak in when his back was turned. (TV: The Time Meddler)\n\nIn his youth, the Doctor had short, light brown hair, (COMIC: Vortex Butterflies) and claimed that he was considered \"quite a looker\". (PROSE: The Plotters) Though other accounts disagreed with her statement, (COMIC: Time & Time Again; TV: The Name of the Doctor) Iris Wildthyme claimed that, when the Doctor first fled Gallifrey, he looked younger than the Eighth Doctor, with his hair not yet greyed. (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress) One account implied that the First Doctor's body was prematurely aged by too many different gravities and too many \"close encounters with death\". (PROSE: Prisoners of the Sun)\n\nBy the time he met Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, the Doctor appeared to be a man in his early sixties, (PROSE: Who Killed Kennedy) who had shoulder length, greyish-white hair that grew around the back of his head, and piercing blue eyes that rested under expressive eyebrows, (TV: An Unearthly Child) though Shivani Bajwa described his eyes as being a mixed blue-green in colour. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Horror of Coal Hill) According to his war incarnation, the First Doctor was colour-blind. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor) He had short hairs growing on his arms. (TV: The Chase)\n\nA part of the Doctor disliked being \"trapped in an old, decrepit body\". (PROSE: Ten Little Aliens)\n\nJames Stirling was told by a shopkeeper that the First Doctor was a \"white-haired old gentleman\", (TV: The Reign of Terror) while Martin had been told by the head undertaker that the Doctor was \"an old geezer with white hair\". (TV: Remembrance of the Daleks') When Ace encountered the First Doctor in the Seventh Doctor's mind, she noticed that he kept his \"silver hair swept back\" and had a \"long, hawklike nose\". (PROSE: Timewyrm: Revelation) When Legion took on the appearance of the First Doctor, William Blake saw him as \"an old man with neck length grey hair\". (PROSE: The Pit) When she found his wanted poster, Bernice Summerfield described the First Doctor as \"a dignified-looking white-haired man in an Edwardian frock coat\". (PROSE: Sanctuary) A waiter once described the First Doctor as the \"little old man with the long grey hair\". (PROSE: The Meeting)\n\nKitty though that the Doctor he looked like \"that disc jockey\", (TV: The War Machines) while Sir Charles Summer described him as \"an English gentleman in his early sixties, with imperious white hair swept back from his face and reaching almost to collar length, with haughty features and piercing eyes that burned with intelligence and wit.\" (PROSE: Who Killed Kennedy)\n\nThe Fourth Doctor, when reflecting on his change of appearance after his first regeneration, called the First Doctor a \"distinguished white-haired gentleman\". (AUDIO: The Power of the Daleks) The Fifth Doctor described his first incarnation as an \"old man\", (PROSE: Five Card Draw) with the Eighth Doctor calling him a \"white-haired old man with a fierce beak of a nose\", (PROSE: The Eight Doctors) a \"arthritic old buzzard\" (PROSE: The Taint) and a \"crotchety old man\". (PROSE: Escape Velocity)\n\nWhen Affinity took on the First Doctor's appearance, the Twelfth Doctor noted that his first incarnation was \"an elderly gentleman,\" with his \"white hair receded from a high forehead and spilled over the collar at the back of his neck.\" The manifestation was dressed \"in a [typically Victorian] dark jacket and checked trousers with a thin black cravat.\" (PROSE: Silhouette)\n\nMaking his fashion decisions with a computer to better blend in with modern society, (PROSE: A Big Hand for the Doctor) the First Doctor affected a slightly eccentric Edwardian dress sense, wearing a double breasted town coat of ebony black velvet with a shawl collar, a beige tweed waistcoat over a white shirt with a royal blue ribbon tie, grey tartan trousers, and shiny elasticated boots when he left Earth with Susan, Ian and Barbara. (TV: An Unearthly Child) On occasion, the Doctor instead wore a mustardy brown waistcoat and a cream ascot tie with ivory stripes to accompany his usual gear, (TV: The Rescue) and would replace his dark coat with a light blue blazer jacket. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Daleks)\n\nThe Doctor wore a blue signet ring on the middle finger of his right hand, (TV: An Unearthly Child, Twice Upon a Time) which had special powers, such as to unlock the TARDIS doors, (TV: The Web Planet) facilitate hypnotism and protect the Doctor from an electrical shock. (TV: The War Machines) He also often wore a small silver ring on the little finger of his left hand. (TV: The Edge of Destruction) On occasions, he did not wear his rings and wore fingerless gloves instead. (TV: The Tenth Planet, The Five Doctors)\n\nHe would occasionally wear a cape, (TV: An Unearthly Child, Planet of Giants, The Crusade, The Time Meddler, The War Machines, The Smugglers, The Tenth Planet) and would don a scarf when in the cold. (TV: An Unearthly Child, The Tenth Planet) For headgear, he would wear an Astrakhan, (TV: An Unearthly Child, The War Machines, The Tenth Planet) or a white Panama hat. (TV: The Daleks, The Chase, The Daleks' Master Plan) To keep himself warm in Christmas-land, the Doctor donned a dark inverness coat with yellow stripes on the trims. (COMIC: A Christmas Story)\n\nHe also carried a monocle on a necklace that he would use for examinations, (TV: The Sensorites, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Web Planet, The Space Museum, Galaxy 4, The Daleks' Master Plan, The War Machines, Twice Upon a Time) and sometimes wore half-moon reading glasses. (TV: The Daleks, The Sensorites, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Rescue, The Romans, The Chase, The Daleks' Master Plan, The Ark, The War Machines, The Tenth Planet)\n\nHe also used a smoking pipe on at least one occasion, (TV: An Unearthly Child) and also employed a walking stick (TV: Marco Polo) given to him by Kublai Khan. (COMIC: The Forgotten)\n\nWhen adventuring into Earth's past, the First Doctor would make changes to his wardrobe so as to blend in with the local population, (TV: The Reign of Terror, The Romans, The Crusade, The Massacre) and would gladly accept the vestments of extra-terrestrial societies. (TV: The Sensorites, The Savages)\n\nWhen he travelled to Marinus during the Battle for the Great Power, the Doctor wore a yellow space suit with a blue sash and silver neck collar, with a green hooded cloak as an accessory. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Daleks)\n\nDuring the First Doctor's tenure, other actors occasionally stood in for Hartnell, either for demanding scenes or due to Hartnell being ill or otherwise unavailable, such as Albert Ward, who served as a hand double for Hartnell during The Romans, (DWM 251) The Celestial Toymaker, (DWM 196) and The Smugglers. (DWM 321)\n\nBrian Proudfoot stood in for Hartnell during location filming of the Doctor roaming the French countryside on foot in long shots for The Reign of Terror, being photographed from the back. (DWM 204) He later doubled for Hartnell again during The Space Museum. (DWM 316)\n\nEdmund Warwick stood in for Hartnell in the third episode of The Dalek Invasion of Earth after Hartnell suffered an on-set injury. (DWM 280) Warwick later played the Doctor in some scenes of The Chase when Hartnell was playing the Robot Doctor.\n\nGordon Craig doubled for Hartnell during The Smugglers, (DWM 321) and then again during The Tenth Planet, first acting as a body double during the snowstorm scenes in the first episode, and then replacing Hartnell for all of the third episode after he was taken ill. (DWM 214)\n\nWhen the time came for the First Doctor to appear in the 1983 Children in Need anniversary special TV: The Five Doctors, actor Richard Hurndall was hired to play the role, standing in for William Hartnell, who had died in the mid-1970s. A clip of Hartnell as the Doctor from The Dalek Invasion of Earth preceded the opening titles, and Hartnell's name appeared amongst those of his fellow Doctors in the end credits.\n\nDuring the 50th anniversary year in 2013, Hartnell appeared in TV: The Name of the Doctor by way of manipulated stock footage and audio, allowing the actor to posthumously share dialogue with a Clara Oswald splinter on Gallifrey. Later in the same episode, the First Doctor is seen walking past the real Clara within the Doctor's time stream, with body double Kevin Legg [5] made up to emulate the appearance of Richard Hurndall. Later in 2013, Hartnell was again represented via stock footage in TV: The Day of the Doctor, but with John Guilor providing newly recorded dialogue, and Legg once again serving as a body double. (DWMSE 38)\n\nDavid Bradley played Hartnell himself, playing the First Doctor, in the 2013 docu-drama An Adventure in Space and Time. In 2017, Bradley was brought to the show proper, to play the First Doctor himself at the end of TV: The Doctor Falls as a lead in to the 2017 Christmas special, TV: Twice Upon a Time. Bradley also voiced the First Doctor in the Big Finish audio series The First Doctor Adventures.\n\nIn audio, William Russell officially voiced the First Doctor for Big Finish's The Light at the End, having previously voiced him in narration form during all the Companion Chronicles audios that featured his own character Ian. Russell would then reprise the role when required in The Early Adventures, while Peter Purves portrays him in the audios that feature Steven. After his casting, Elliot Chapman also began playing the Doctor in narration form in audios that feature Ben.\n\nTemplate:Companions of the First Doctor\nTemplate:Presidency\nTemplate:NameSort",
