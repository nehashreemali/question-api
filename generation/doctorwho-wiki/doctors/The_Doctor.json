  "content": "Though largely a believer in non-violent conflict resolution, the Doctor was, when absolutely necessary, a great warrior. Indeed, some civilisations in the universe (e.g. the denizens of the Gamma Forests) translated the word doctor as warrior, (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) whilst others saw the Doctor as a compassionate benefactor, worthy of their admiration and compassion. (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAlthough the Doctor had saved untold numbers on their travels, sometimes being known as \"Life's Champion\", (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) even in darkness, (AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021)., TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) the Doctor was thought to have caused the deaths of billions at the end of the Last Great Time War, (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005). as well as countless others before and after, when available options was limited and others was caught in the crossfire. (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThough most of the Daleks were destroyed on the final day of the Time War, most accounts of those final moments held that Gallifrey was hidden, rather than being burned, through the combined efforts of at least thirteen, possibly all of, the Doctor's incarnations, the first eleven of whom retained no memory of the event. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013)., PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018)., PROSE: Dalek Combat Training Manual [+]Richard Atkinson and Mike Tucker, BBC Books (2021).) For their actions, the Time Lords granted the Doctor a new regeneration cycle, allowing them to live on after using up all twelve available regenerations in their first cycle. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor's personal history was constantly changing and contradicting itself. (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) Their early life and their true species was matters of much contention, in part due to shifting timelines (PROSE: Celestial Intervention - A Gallifreyan Noir [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (BBC Children's Books, 2018).) and powerful enemies. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., et. al) The Doctor's own memories was unclear regarding their early life and origins, (COMIC: The World Shapers; PROSE: Who is Dr Who? [+]The Dr Who Annual 1966 (The Dr Who Annual 1966, World Distributors, 1965)., Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and several accounts even suggested that the Doctor had non-Gallifreyan origins, either human (TV: The Evil of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1967).; PROSE: Doctor Who and the Daleks [+]1964., The Monsters from Earth [+]The Dr Who Annual 1966 (Doctor Who annual, 1965).) or of an unknown species. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nAccording to one account, the Doctor was some form of reincarnation of the Other, a mysterious figure from Gallifrey's past who helped form Time Lord society and perfect time travel technology. The Other would later become the Doctor by looming himself. (PROSE: Lungbarrow [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Lungbarrow, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) Indeed, the Doctor explicitly told Davros that the Doctor was \"far more than just another Time Lord\", (TV: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988).) and Lady Peinforte claimed knowledge of the Doctor's actions during the Dark Times of early Gallifrey. (TV: Silver Nemesis [+]Kevin Clarke, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1 and TVNZ, 1988).)\n\nAccording to another account, the Doctor was originally \"the Timeless Child\", a being from an unknown realm, which possibly lay within another universe. The Child was discovered by the First Tecteun early in Gallifreyan history, and had a natural ability to regenerate, which Tecteun studied and eventually replicated. Eventually the Shobogans, Tecteun's people, became Time Lords, and the origin of regeneration was covered up by the Founding Fathers of Gallifrey in favour of a \"noble creation myth\" instead. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) Indeed, it was Tecteun themself who ordered that the Doctor's memories be redacted after their service to the Division was complete, which resulted in the Doctor being unaware of their true nature, (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) and in Time Lord civilisation being built on a lie. (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) This revelation, which occurred during their thirteenth incarnation, would go on to haunt them (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) into their fourteenth (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and fifteenth incarnations. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nFrom the latter years of their first incarnation onward, the Doctor had a pronounced affinity for Earth and the human race. (TV: The Ark in Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975)., New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) After departing Gallifrey, the Doctor voluntarily chose to spend time on Earth, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).; AUDIO: Summer, The Haunting of Thomas Brewster) choosing it as the place of their exile for most of their third incarnation, (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969)., Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) and even owning property in Kent, (COMIC: Fellow Travellers; PROSE: Warlock [+]Andrew Cartmel, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995)., Warchild [+]Andrew Cartmel, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996)., The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) as well as London (AUDIO: The Haunting of Malkin Place, The White Room, Lost Property) and New York City. (PROSE: The Forgotten Army [+]Brian Minchin, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2010).) The Doctor favoured Great Britain in particular, frequently returning, and finding many of their companions there. (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Time Monster [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., et al.) Later on, the Doctor thought of themselves as Earth's protector. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017)., Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) Even before the disappearance of Gallifrey, the Doctor spent much more time on Earth than on their homeworld, as \"home from home\". (PROSE: The Rag & Bone Man's Story [+]Colin Brake, Short Trips: Repercussions (Short Trips, 2004).; AUDIO: A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nDespite the varying personality traits of each incarnation, the Doctor always retained \"a bit of adrenaline, a dash of outrage and a hint of panic\", which helped define who the Doctor was, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) and a questionable fashion sense according to many, (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) along with the promise of sticking to everything that their name stood for: duty, compassion, and resourcefulness. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nTrouble seemed to follow the Doctor, (TV: Inferno [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) by their own admission. (TV: Marco Polo [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) The Doctor spent much of their time bounding from one place to another, with \"all of time and space\" to explore, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) solving problems with whatever was at hand, (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) making friends (AUDIO: Companion Piece [+]John Dorney, Ravenous 3 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Ravenous, Big Finish Productions, 2019).) and enemies, (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and rarely looking back, (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) always having an eye on their next destination. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nDuring a battle with the Toymaker, the Doctor, now in their fourteenth incarnation, underwent bi-generation, a variation of regeneration that was supposed to have been a myth. During the Doctor's bi-generation, instead of changing into their next incarnation, the Doctor's fifteenth incarnation split from his fourteenth incarnation. Despite existing at the same time, however, the Fifteenth Doctor carried lived experiences from the Fourteenth Doctor's future, making the Fifteenth Doctor an older incarnation. Whilst the Fourteenth Doctor, weary from years of travelling, remained on Earth to do \"rehab out of order\", the Fifteenth Doctor continued to travel the universe with a rejuvenated sense of wonder. As the Fifteenth Doctor's prize for defeating the Toymaker, he was also able to split his TARDIS into two[disputed statement] for each Doctor. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Doctor's true name remained unknown to all but a very few individuals, such as Sam Jones, (PROSE: Vanderdeken's Children [+]Christopher Bulis, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) River Song, (TV: Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and the Master. (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Though the Time Lords knew the genuine name of the Doctor, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) the Doctor did not use it in the formal setting of the majority of their legal trials. (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969)., The Trial of a Time Lord)\n\nAccording to the Saxon Master, he chose the name \"Doctor\" to reflect his constant desire to make people \"better\". (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Missy claimed to know the Doctor's real name from their time together on Gallifrey; she said it was \"Doctor Who\", and the Doctor had chosen it to be mysterious but dropped the \"Who\" when he realised it was too on-the-nose. (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Indeed, several accounts suggested that \"Doctor Who\" was a proper way to address the time traveller. (TV: The War Machines [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).; PROSE: Doctor Who and the Space War [+]Malcolm Hulke, adapted from Frontier in Space (Malcolm Hulke), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1976)., et. al)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor told Clara Oswald that his real name was not so important, since he specifically chose in its place the title of \"Doctor\", \"like a promise you make\". (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) This promise was, as the Tenth and War Doctor recited together, \"Never cruel or cowardly. Never give up, never give in.\" (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) The Twelfth Doctor claimed that when he originally adopted the title it was \"just a name,\" which held no real significance until his first visit to Skaro. It was through his opposition to the Daleks that the Doctor was able to define himself and realise who he was. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe title \"Doctor\" was not undeserved; the Doctor did hold one or more doctorates of some sort, (TV: The Armageddon Factor [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 16 (BBC1, 1979)., The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) formally studied medicine on at least 19th century Earth at Glasgow University, (TV: The Moonbase [+]Kit Pedler, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1967).) and frequently displayed detailed medical knowledge. (TV: The Ark [+]Paul Erickson and Lesley Scott, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., Frontios [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984)., The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Curse of the Black Spot [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) At least some versions of their sonic screwdriver performed medical scans and healed minor wounds. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) The Seventh Doctor showed knowledge on how to help someone thrown by an explosion recover quickly. (TV: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988).) Although their first, (TV: \"\"The Forest of Fear\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).), \"Mighty Kublai Khan (6) [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).\") second, (TV: The Krotons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1968-1969).) fourth (TV: The Ark in Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) and fifth incarnations (AUDIO: Red Dawn [+]Justin Richards, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2000).) had claimed not to be a doctor of medicine, their third, (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) eighth, (AUDIO: Sword of Orion [+]Nicholas Briggs, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).) ninth (COMIC: The Cruel Sea [+]Robert Shearman, DWM Comics (2005).) and tenth incarnations (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) claimed to be a doctor of practically \"everything\", and by their eleventh incarnation, the Doctor claimed to hold doctorates in at least medicine and cheesemaking. (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) In their thirteenth incarnation, the Doctor claimed to be a doctor of \"Medicine, science, engineering, candyfloss, Lego, philosophy, people, [and] hope. Mostly hope.\" (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nAccording to Evelina, the Doctor's name was written in the stars of the Medusa Cascade. (TV: The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Members of an unidentified race of pan-dimensional beings also knew the Time Lord's real name, at one point. (AUDIO: The Last Voyage [+]Dan Abnett, New Series Adventures Audio (BBC Audio, 2010).)\n\nIn one account, he had taken the moniker after his first contact with humans. Colonists on the medical/penal colony of Iwa began calling him \"Doctor\" after his arrival. He failed to correct them. After the Doctor left the planet, \"the Doctor\" simply kept the name he had been given by the humans. (PROSE: Frayed [+]Tara Samms, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).) In another, he had already been introducing himself by that name after his first trip in the TARDIS, which gave an alternative account of meeting humans for the first time on the Moon. (AUDIO: The Beginning [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The First Doctor responded to the name when an echo of Clara Oswald put it to him before even departing Gallifrey. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nRiver Song believed that the Doctor had influenced the etymology of the word doctor itself; and in multiple cultures was the first recorded use of \"Doctor\" (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAccording to Dorium Maldovar and the Silence, the oldest and most dangerous question in the universe was \"Doctor who?\" The Doctor's true name was apparently the answer. Dorium claimed the Doctor had been running from the question all his life. According to the Silence, \"silence must fall when the question is asked,\" (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) because if the question was answered, it could lead to destruction on a universal scale; through several methods, each of which was located on the planet Trenzalore. The first was that the Doctor's name could be used to open his grave and alter his timeline, potentially undoing the countless times the Doctor had saved the universe. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) The second was that his name could be used to confirm to the Time Lords, who was sealed in a pocket universe and had been broadcasting the question throughout the entirety of time and space, that it was safe for them to return; which could result in another Time War. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAt some point River Song learned his name, prompting the Doctor to claim that there was only one reason he ever would or could reveal it. (TV: Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Indeed, even while spending centuries in a town permeated by a Truth Field and hearing the question asked multiple times, the Doctor would not or could not answer. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) However, River later stated that she \"made him\" tell her his true name and that it \"took a while\". (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara Oswald viewed the Doctor's name in a book on the Time War, contained in the TARDIS library. She subsequently lost the information when time was rewound. (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nTheta Sigma was, by some accounts, the Doctor's true name, (TV: The Armageddon Factor [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 16 (BBC1, 1979)., PROSE: K9 and the Beasts of Vega [+]Dave Martin, The Adventures of K9 (Sparrow Books, 1980)., et al.) however the Seventh Doctor later claimed that this was merely a nickname he was given at college. (TV: The Happiness Patrol [+]Graeme Curry, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988).)\n\nMoments before regenerating into the Thirteenth Doctor, the Twelfth Doctor used his last words to leave his future self some advice. Amongst these last words was that the future Doctor must not tell anyone their name, but that the Doctor couldn't understand it even if the Doctor did tell them. The Doctor went on to state that \"children can hear it, sometimes. If their hearts are in the right place and the stars are too. Children can hear your name. But nobody else, nobody else ever.\" (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor later learned from the Spy Master that in early Gallifreyan history, she had been known as the Timeless Child, the being from whom the Time Lords' ability to regenerate originated. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nThe Doctor's age was a matter of great confusion, as the Doctor provided many inconsistent statements. The Second Doctor once gave his age in Earth terms as 450. (TV: The Tomb of the Cybermen [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967).) On two separate occasions, the Third Doctor implied that he may have been several thousand years old. (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) The Fourth Doctor, however, gave his age as \"something like 750 years\". (TV: Pyramids of Mars [+]Stephen Harris, Doctor Who season 13 (BBC1, 1975).) Immediately after his sixth regeneration, the Seventh Doctor claimed to be 953. (TV: Time and the Rani [+]Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 24 (BBC1, 1987).) The War Doctor considered himself 400 years younger than the Eleventh Doctor, who was purportedly 1,200 at that time. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) The Ninth Doctor claimed to be 900 years old. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) The Tenth Doctor claimed to be 903. (TV: Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) Also, at least prior to leaving Amy and Rory behind, (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) the Eleventh Doctor maintained an age of 909, less than his seventh incarnation. (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor later claimed to the Ponds that he was 1,200 years old (TV: A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) but clarified to Clara Oswald that he'd lived so long he'd forgotten whether or not he was lying about his age. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) The Twelfth Doctor, after spending 900 years defending Trenzalore, stated his age to be over 2,000. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor spent approximately four and a half billion years (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) trapped inside his confession dial in an energy loop. In each loop, the Doctor would die, providing energy to a teleporter which would \"print\" another copy of himself as he was when he first arrived. Although this kept his body from ageing, he claimed to remember the living through every single version of the loop. (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) He later stated to the Master that he was, in fact, four billion years old. (COMIC: Doorway to Hell)\n\nRomana I once caught the Fourth Doctor \"rounding down\" his age, (TV: The Ribos Operation [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 16 (BBC1, 1978).) while the Eighth Doctor once flatly admitted that he didn't necessarily use the same definition of the word year each time he gave his age to someone, usually changing his age depending where he was in the universe. (AUDIO: Orbis)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor once told Solomon that he was probably a Sagittarius. (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor once told her companions that she was thousands of years old and was so old she didn't even remember her true age anymore. (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) She later discovered that she had once been the Timeless Child, a being with infinite regenerative capabilities that led to the Time Lords developing the ability themselves early in their history. The Doctor had her memories of this time redacted however, meaning she was far older than she thought. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) Rassilon had previously stated that the Time Lords \"held a billion years of Time Lord history on [their] backs\". (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) Since the Timeless Child dated back to the beginning of the Time Lords, this would make the Doctor, counting their many forgotten lives as the Timeless Child, at least a billion years old. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nThe Fourteenth Doctor claimed to Donna that he was a billion years old. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Doctor's familial relations was unclear at best. In early accounts, the Doctor and Susan was human, so therefore the Doctor's child who parented Susan was also human. (TV: The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964)., etc.) According to a couple of accounts, the Doctor was one of the forty-five cousins created by the Loom of the House of Lungbarrow on Gallifrey.

At other times, the Doctor stated that he had parents, including a Time Lord father (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996)., PROSE: The Infinity Doctors [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Books (1998)., Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., Matrix [+]Robert Perry and Mike Tucker, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) and a human mother.

(COMIC: The Comfort of the Good [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., et. al) \"The Uncle\" was the Doctor's uncle. (GAME: The Eternity Clock [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Thirteenth Doctor recalled once having had sisters, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) though another account indicated the Doctor at least never had an older sister. (PROSE: Dragonfire [+]Ian Briggs, adapted from Dragonfire (Ian Briggs), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1989).)\n\nThe Doctor had at least one brother, Irving Braxiatel, (PROSE: Tears of the Oracle [+]Justin Richards, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1999)., AUDIO: Disassembled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) who became an associate of the Doctor's companion Bernice Summerfield. (PROSE: Tears of the Oracle [+]Justin Richards, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1999).) Braxiatel was also a Cardinal of Gallifrey (AUDIO: Weapon of Choice [+]Alan Barnes, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) and was the owner of the Braxiatel Collection, (PROSE: Tears of the Oracle [+]Justin Richards, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1999).) which the Doctor and Romana once compared to the Louvre in Paris. (TV: City of Death [+]David Agnew, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).) The Doctor had one niece by Irving Braxiatel, Maggie Matsumoto. (AUDIO: The Empire State [+]Eddie Robson, Bernice Summerfield: Single Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nAt the Doctor's wedding to Scarlette in the post-War universe, the Man with the Rosette sat at the table reserved for the Doctor's family. (PROSE: The Adventuress of Henrietta Street [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor told Sally Sparrow that he was \"rubbish at weddings, especially [his] own\". (TV: Blink [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow (Steven Moffat), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) In an alternate universe, an earlier incarnation had been wed (PROSE: Cold Fusion [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) to Patience and the Doctor was said to have had fifteen children and a granddaughter, Susan. (PROSE: The Infinity Doctors [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Books (1998).)\n\nThe Doctor had, in the Tenth Doctor's own words, been \"a dad\" (TV: Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and \"a father\". (TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) These children was \"sons or daughters, or both.\" (PROSE: The Eleventh Tiger [+]David A. McIntee, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) The Twelfth Doctor claimed he had \"dad skills\". (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Clara Oswald also claimed the Doctor had \"children\". (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor also had several grandchildren, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) including Susan Foreman (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., et al.) and John and Gillian Who. (COMIC: The Klepton Parasites, PROSE: Beware the Trods!, et al.) Some accounts referred to Susan as \"the Other's\" granddaughter. (PROSE: Lungbarrow [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Lungbarrow, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).)\n\nAt one point, the Doctor became the adoptive father to a female Time Lord named Miranda Dawkins, whom the Eighth Doctor reared until her mid-teens. (PROSE: Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) Miranda later gave birth to a daughter, Zezanne, and died while trying to protect the Doctor. (PROSE: Sometime Never... [+]Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).)\n\nThe Doctor also had a great-grandson named Alex, the son of Susan and David Campbell. (AUDIO: An Earthly Child) Alex went on several adventures with the Eighth Doctor and backpacked around the Earth with Lucie Miller before the Doctor was both killed by the Daleks. (AUDIO: Lucie Miller, To the Death [+]Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2011).) Susan and David also had adopted children, Barbara, Ian and David Junior. (PROSE: Legacy of the Daleks [+]John Peel, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).)\n\nMuch of the Doctor's family died or went missing. (TV: The Tomb of the Cybermen [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967)., The Curse of Fenric [+]Ian Briggs, Doctor Who season 26 (BBC1, 1989)., AUDIO: To the Death [+]Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2011)., TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) After the last day of the Time War, the Tenth Doctor, while telling Donna that he'd been a father before, explained that he \"lost all that a long time ago along with everything else.\" (TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) The Eleventh Doctor involuntarily reacted to Corc's accusation that he had never lost a child. (PROSE: Dark Horizons [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Even after the Doctor realised that Gallifrey and the Time Lords was not destroyed at the end of the Time War, the Doctor still believed their missing children and grandchildren to be dead. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).)\n\nGenetic material from the Doctor in their tenth incarnation was used to create a daughter, Jenny, via progenation. The Doctor explained to Donna Noble and Martha Jones that due to the way his DNA was processed, he was Jenny's \"biological mother and father\". Although initially spurning her, he soon considered Jenny his daughter and invited her to travel with him in the TARDIS. Before she could join him, however, she was shot by General Cobb. The Doctor believed Jenny to have died, and departed. (TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Unbeknownst to him, she survived and set out on her own life of adventure. (TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., AUDIO: Stolen Goods, et al.)\n\nWhen the Earth was relocated to the Medusa Cascade, an instantaneous biological meta-crisis was created from the Doctor's aborted eleventh regeneration ; this meta-crisis Doctor was later was exiled by the Time Lord to an alternate universe. Technically, the meta-crisis could be considered a relative of the Doctor's. Sarah Jane Smith referred to the Doctor's companions as his family, saying, \"You act like such a lonely man, but you've got the biggest family on Earth!\" (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe First Doctor was accidentally engaged to Cameca in the 15th century. (TV: The Aztecs [+]John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).)\n\nAfter Gallifrey was destroyed in the War in Heaven, the Eighth Doctor married Scarlette in order to ceremonially tie himself to the planet Earth. (PROSE: The Adventuress of Henrietta Street [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor romanced and later married Elizabeth I. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013)., PROSE: Suspicious Minds) She later declared him an enemy after he failed to return as promised. (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) The Tenth Doctor implied he had been married several times prior to Queen Elizabeth, as he remarked to Sally Sparrow about being \"rubbish at weddings, especially [his] own\". (TV: Blink [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow (Steven Moffat), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) In his eleventh incarnation, the Doctor accidentally became engaged to Marilyn Monroe, and married her the same night in what he later claimed was not a real chapel. (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nRiver Song often hinted that she and the Doctor had a physical relationship somewhere in her past and his future relative to the Eleventh Doctor's encounter with the Silence in Florida. (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)./Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)./Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)./The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) The Eleventh Doctor, operating a Teselecta shaped like himself, performed a \"quick version\" of a wedding ceremony with River because the Doctor was in the middle of a combat zone in an alternate reality. The Doctor repeatedly referred to each other as husband and wife after the ceremony.

(TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nAlong their travels, the Doctor's role in events, both great and small, left a lasting impression, being remembered as \"the stuff of legend\" on Earth (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) and beyond. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., AUDIO: Return to Skaro [+]Andrew Smith, The First Doctor Adventures: Volume Four (The First Doctor Adventures, Big Finish Productions, 2020)., PROSE: Venusian Lullaby [+]Paul Leonard, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).) The Doctor had a profound influence on many worlds and was written into their histories, (TV: Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) passed down, most often, with three big questions: how the Doctor vanished, who the Doctor was, and why the Doctor came to help at all. (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nAs a result, the Doctor was the recipient of many honours, being made a noble of Draconia, (TV: Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) a knight and enemy of the British Empire, (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and even President of Earth under the incursion protocols. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Pyramid at the End of the World [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) The Twelfth Doctor recalled that, in one of his lives, he once pulled Excalibur from the stone, becoming \"King of England for a day\" before abdicating in order to hand the throne over to King Arthur. (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nMany stories was developed and passed down along the Doctor's adventures. River Song was convinced every story with a \"good wizard\" ended up being about the Doctor. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) In fact, the Doctor was so accustomed to being made a figure in local mythology that the Thirteenth Doctor felt sidelined when it was her companion instead, Graham O'Brien, being worshipped on a return trip to Lobos. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).)\n\nDuring their time together, the Tenth Doctor and Donna Noble was honoured as household gods by Lobus Caecilius and Metella in Rome, (TV: The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and the Ood's Song of Freedom was dedicated to them, (TV: Planet of the Ood [+]Keith Temple, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) with their stories being told and re-told all across the worlds the Doctor had saved together. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nTecteun regarded the Doctor as a beacon of hope for the universe, changing worlds and inspiring rebellion wherever the Doctor travelled. Since the Doctor could not help but interfere whenever things went wrong, the Doctor frequently stood in the way of the Division's plans without knowing, becoming a power the Doctor could not account for. As a result of the Doctor's influence, Tecteun sought to end this universe, to begin again without the Doctor. (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nThe Doctor's influence on the universe became clear when the Eleventh Doctor's time came to need its help. The Doctor's apparent death at Lake Silencio was a fixed point in time, but River Song prolonged his final moment by refusing to take part, creating River Song's World. As time fell apart, River was desperate to save the Doctor, and built a timey-wimey distress beacon, informing all of time and space that the Doctor was dying. Responses came from all over the universe that the Doctor would help. According to her, the Doctor's impact on the universe was so profound that if he ever needed help, all he had to do was ask. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nPerhaps the Doctor's greatest influence was on their companions, who was inspired by the Time Lord to fight injustice and help those in need. (TV: Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) Even those who had never met the Doctor was inspired by their exploits. (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009)., The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013)., et al.)\n\nJack Harkness counted those who'd even met the Doctor as lucky, (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) but Martha Jones compared the Doctor to fire, saying he was \"brilliant\", but getting too close meant \"people get burned\". (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Rose Tyler and Madame de Pompadour, however, agreed that \"the Doctor is worth the monsters\", since \"you cannot have one without the other.\" (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nJoan Redfern scolded the Tenth Doctor, and had him confirm that no one would have died in Farringham if he hadn't chosen that time and place, \"on a whim\", while fleeing from the Family of Blood. (TV: The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) By the Eleventh Doctor's time, the Doctor himself believed he put people in danger by involving them. Though Craig Owens believed the safest place to stand would be by the Doctor's side, both Craig and Alfie Owens was put in danger, and the Eleventh Doctor placed this on himself. (TV: Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe First Doctor set out travelling in hopes of finding an answer to a fundamental question: how, despite all odds, good tended to triumph over evil in the universe. According to Bill Potts, the Doctor became the answer to this very question, without ever pausing to consider this. She suggested it was him \"wandering around, putting everything right when it goes wrong\", and that only the Doctor failed to see his own impact. Everyone else could see that, by fighting oppression wherever the Doctor went, the Doctor helped to \"hold [the universe] together\". (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Doctor belonged to the Prydonian Chapter, the most important chapter of Time Lord society. (TV: The Deadly Assassin [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 14 (BBC1, 1976).)\n\nHaving broken the Time Lords' non-interference policy, the Second Doctor was put on trial as a renegade. (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) Subsequently, for a time, he acted as an agent of the Time Lords' Celestial Intervention Agency before the beginning of his sentence on 20th century Earth. (PROSE: Players [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., World Game [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) Following his defeat of Omega, which saved Gallifrey, he was granted a pardon and given his freedom. (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973).) The Fourth Doctor, as part of a ploy to outwit the Decayed Master on Gallifrey, became a candidate for the position of Lord President of the Supreme Council. While he had the right to stay and keep up the title, he left after the Master's defeat. (TV: The Deadly Assassin [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 14 (BBC1, 1976)., The Invasion of Time [+]David Agnew, Doctor Who season 15 (BBC1, 1978).)\n\nThe Doctor later returned to reclaim his title and \"try out\" being President, (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) although in truth he had only returned only to foil the Vardans' and Sontarans' attempted invasion of Gallifrey. Afterward, he quickly left, (TV: The Invasion of Time [+]David Agnew, Doctor Who season 15 (BBC1, 1978).) declaring it the worst vacation he'd ever taken. The Time Lords later reflected that the Earth had been invaded, by their count, every week during the Doctor's exile, only for Gallifrey to be invaded twice when the Doctor had arrived. As such, the Doctor was happy to see the Doctor kept away from their homeworld in the hope that the Doctor would not suffer more invasions. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Indeed, a Time Lord messenger once admitted the Time Lords was happy to allow the Doctor his freedom to travel throughout time and space, so long as the Doctor could sometimes send him to do their dirty work, much to his annoyance. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975)., Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).)\n\nThe Fifth Doctor was put on trial again for recklessness. (COMIC: The Stockbridge Horror) He was later given the title of Lord President by Councillor Flavia, against his wishes. He pretended to accept the office but ran away in his TARDIS. (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) The Fifth Doctor did later serve time in office on Gallifrey, and initiated various reforms for the Academy. (AUDIO: Time in Office [+]Eddie Robson, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2017).) The Sixth Doctor was later deposed in absentia and put on trial for breaking the non-interference policy and later in the same trial, for genocide. The validity of this trial was called into question when it was discovered it had been orchestrated by the Valeyard, a future manifestation of the Doctor who intended to steal the Doctor's regenerations. (TV: The Trial of a Time Lord)\n\nDuring the Last Great Time War, the Sisterhood of Karn revived the Eighth Doctor and offered him an elixir for regeneration precisely because the Doctor believed only the Doctor could save the universe from the Time War's devastating impact. Ohila pressured him to take a more active role, as the universe's final hope. She deplored the Doctor not to let this universe fall. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) The ensuing incarnation, the War Doctor, was beloved by the Time Lord army, as the Doctor saw that he fought side by side with them. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., PROSE: Decoy)\n\nDuring the Siege of Trenzalore, when the Eleventh Doctor was again on the verge of death, with no remaining regenerations, the Time Lords responded to Clara Oswald's plea to help him by granting the Doctor a new regeneration cycle, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) rather than allow him to die on Trenzalore, as in the original timeline. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) After returning to Gallifrey by means of his confession dial, the Twelfth Doctor stood against Lord President Rassilon, and deposed him, using the reputation he had gained with his fellow Time Lords during the Time War. Rassilon's own firing squad refused to execute him, intentionally misfiring. The Doctor then took over as Lord President to save Clara Oswald's life, before once more fleeing Gallifrey in a stolen TARDIS. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nIn the Thirteenth Doctor's time, the Spy Master ravaged Gallifrey when he discovered that the Doctor's earliest incarnations had been the template for all Time Lords. The Doctor herself was responsible for killing all remaining life on the planet, in order to stop the Master's Cybermen. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nOf the many foes the Doctor encountered and bested over their travels, their most persistent and notable enemy was the Daleks, a species of xenophobic mutants native to the planet Skaro, with the Doctor and Daleks both recognising each other as each other's greatest foe. (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., COMIC: Harvest of the Daleks, Defender of the Daleks) As Darla von Karlsen once observed, \"first, there was the Daleks. And then, there was a man who fought them\". (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) In fact, the First Doctor's first visit to Skaro marked a change for both him and the Daleks; the Doctor was horrified by the evil of the Daleks, making the mutants the reason the Time Lord made it their mission to fight evil across time and space, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) while their first meeting with the Doctor proved to the Daleks that life existed on other worlds, convincing them to form the Dalek Empire to spread across the stars. (AUDIO: The Lights of Skaro)\n\nFurthermore, the Daleks eventually learned the Fourth Doctor had been present at their genesis and nearly wiped out their species then on behalf of the Time Lords, with the Daleks viewing that action as an act of aggression that began the Last Great Time War. The Dalek Eternity Circle, however, did claim to the War Doctor that his failure to wipe them out proved to the Dalek Empire that emotion was a weakness. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014). For their repeated stands and victories against the Daleks, the Doctor became seen as the sole reason the Daleks had yet to conquer all of creation. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) Becoming the most hated enemy to a species that could only hate, the Daleks also appeared to showcase fear towards the Time Lord despite the Daleks having removed all trace of that emotion from themselves; the Doctor became known as the \"Oncoming Storm\" and \"the Predator\" amongst other names, with one Dalek drone reflecting that the Daleks had grown stronger in fear of their enemy. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nWhen all knowledge of the Doctor was erased from the Dalek Pathweb for a time, a historical text stated the Daleks' never-ending war against the rest of existence collapsed, with the Dalek Parliament left squabbling to figure out who their forgotten arch-enemy had been. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013)., PROSE: Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe [+]George Mann, Justin Richards and Cavan Scott, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Ebury Publishing, 2017).) Another account, however, held that forgetting the Doctor gave the Daleks a great sense of freedom. With this freedom, the Daleks embarked on a new crusade against the universe without fear, much to the horror of the Doctor. (AUDIO: Daleks Victorious [+]Felicia Barker, Victory of the Doctor (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2024)., et. al) When the Dalek race's memory of the Doctor was restored during the Siege of Trenzalore, the Prime Minister of the Daleks was left in a mortified, insane state that made the current Dalek Supreme execute it to take control of their empire. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013)., PROSE: Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe [+]George Mann, Justin Richards and Cavan Scott, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Ebury Publishing, 2017).) Missy once reflected that, out of all of the Doctor's enemies, it was the Daleks who hated them the most, (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and the Thirteenth Doctor declared encounters with the Daleks personal affairs. (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) In fact, fighting the Daleks helped her to rediscover her identity as \"the Doctor\" after being shaken by secret truths, stating \"I'm the Doctor, I'm the one who stops the Daleks\". (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nThe Doctor also became a consistent enemy to the Cybermen, a race of human cyborgs who sought to survive and upgrade others to \"become like [them]\". (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) A Neomorph Cyber-Leader observed that the Doctor, in contrast to the Time Lords' non-interference policy, did \"nothing else but interfere\". (TV: Earthshock [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) Despite only encountering him one time prior, the Cybusmen of Pete's World quickly recognised the Doctor as an enemy, with Cyber-Leader One telling the Tenth Doctor that he was proof that emotions was destructive. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) The Twelfth Doctor once claimed that legends spread about his stands against the Cybermen, proclaiming that \"There's only ever been one way to stop [a massive army of] Cybermen. Me!\" (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nWhereas most Cybermen regarded the Doctor as proof of the weakness and destructive nature of emotion, (TV: Earthshock [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982)., The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) the CyberReaper saw the Doctor as someone who lacked in emotion and aspired to be like the Doctor, whom it declared to be \"the ultimate warrior\". The CyberReaper engineered the Reality Virus plot to make the universe so chaotic that peoples would willingly ask for conversion, but it also intended the plot as a way to make the Doctor chose between compassion or \"a warrior's heart,\" as the Doctor would need to sacrifice the new realities the virus made to stop the Cybermen. When the CyberReaper encountered the Thirteenth Doctor, she mocked the Cybermen for the many times she had defeated them and declared the Cybermen still failed to understand the importance of emotions. In response, the CyberReaper outlined its opinion of her, much to her horror. The Doctor was unable to bring herself to destroy the new realities, resulting in a human companion making the choice for her. (GAME: The Edge of Reality [+]Gavin Collinson, adapted from The Edge of Time, Maze Theory (2021).)\n\nThe Sontaran Empire came to see the Doctor as their archenemy (TV: War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) despite their never-ending war with the Rutan Host. The Doctor was thus recognised as a priority target, although the Doctor's actions during the Time War was spread amongst the Sontarans as legends. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Commander Skaak of the Sontaran Empire regarded the Doctor as \"treacherous vermin\". (TV: War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nMissy claimed to Clara Oswald that she had \"always\" cared about the Doctor and that she was their friend, that the Doctor shared a friendship older and \"infinitely more complex\" than Clara's civilisation. When Clara disputed her claim, noting that she had tried to kill the Doctor, Missy retorted that the Doctor had tried to kill her, likening as \"sort of [their] texting\" and that the Doctor had \"been at it for ages\". She chided Clara for the \"disgusting\" suggestion that the Doctor was in love, telling her to try to \"rise above the reproductive frenzy of [her] noisy little food chain\". (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nConfronting the Third Doctor, the Master admitted that he was \"almost\" his intellectual equal. (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) The \"Tremas\" Master once reflected that \"a cosmos without the Doctor scarcely bears thinking about.\" (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) Whilst evaluating the Doctor's first seven incarnations, he regarded the Third Doctor as a worthy foe, while lamenting that the Seventh Doctor's cunning and ingenuity was wasted on a \"stubborn streak of goodness\". (GAME: Destiny of the Doctors [+]Hannah Redler, Gary Russell, Terrance Dicks and Andy Russell, BBC Multimedia (1997).)\n\nThe Third Doctor introduced the Master as his \"best enemy\" to Sarah Jane Smith. (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) The \"Spy Master\" later introduced himself to the Thirteenth Doctor's companions as such. (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) The Doctor always had a great effect on the Master, to the point where Missy began to give up her dark ways and stand up for what was \"kind\" through a series of discussions and adventures with the Twelfth Doctor. Fully embracing the idea that it was time \"to stand with the Doctor\", she was killed at the hands of the \"Saxon\" Master (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) but regenerated into a new incarnation who called herself \"the Lumiat\", embracing the new start as a way to do good in the universe, only for a younger version of Missy to kill her. (AUDIO: The Lumiat [+]Lisa McMullin, Missy: Series Two (Missy, Big Finish Productions, 2020).) The \"Spy\" Master, who returned to the dark ways that Missy and the Lumiat began to move past, (PROSE: The Doctor vs the Master [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who annual (2020)., AUDIO: The Lumiat [+]Lisa McMullin, Missy: Series Two (Missy, Big Finish Productions, 2020).) hated the Doctor more than ever before after learning about the Timeless Child. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nRiver Song believed that \"all the skies of all the worlds might just turn dark\" if the Doctor ever gave up on helping other people, (TV: Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and Nardole once told the Twelfth Doctor that, if he died that day, \"everybody in the universe might just go cold\". (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nWhen the Great Intelligence changed time so that the Doctor's victories was negated, entire star systems began to disappear without the Doctor, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and when a Time Beetle created a parallel world in which the Tenth Doctor died, never having met Donna Noble, Earth quickly devolved into chaos, and across the universe, the stars was going out, (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) without the Doctor and Donna to stop the Reality Bomb from destroying the multiverse. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Doctor had a variety of different and contradictory origins: (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., Celestial Intervention - A Gallifreyan Noir [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (BBC Children's Books, 2018).) most often, the Doctor had always been a Time Lord from Gallifrey, (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969)., et al.) but sometimes the Doctor had always been a human-Gallifreyan hybrid (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996)., et al.) or possibly a human from Earth (PROSE: Dr. Who and the Daleks [+]adapted from Dr. Who and the Daleks (Milton Subotsky), Dell Publishing (1966)., et al.) or from \"some planet\" the 49th century. (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) Sometimes, the Doctor believed the Doctor had been woven from a loom, and sometimes the Doctor believed there had been a mother and father. (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) The Doctor could not remember which was true and which was a dream. (PROSE: The Shadows of Avalon [+]Paul Cornell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nAll of these origins was equally and paradoxically true due to the Doctor's biodata being retroactively manipulated (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) by subconscious regeneration influences (PROSE: The Blue Angel [+]Paul Magrs and Jeremy Hoad, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) as well as interference from Omega, (PROSE: The Infinity Doctors [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Books (1998).) Faction Paradox, (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., Interference - Book Two [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., The Shadows of Avalon [+]Paul Cornell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) the enemy, (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) the Great Intelligence, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and the Toymaker. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Doctor left Gallifrey and became a figure who fought evil and injustice across the universe in violation of the Time Lords' non-interference policy. (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor later explained to that it was his first encounter with the Daleks on Skaro which truly defined his character. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) In his earliest travels, the First Doctor stressed the importance of not interfering, and felt his and Susan's only responsibility was to themselves. (AUDIO: The Sleeping Blood [+]Martin Day, The First Doctor: Volume One (The Companion Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) By most accounts, the Doctor began exploring only to experience the wonders of the universe first-hand and have some fun. In practice, he frequently became embroiled in machinations and crises that ended with him defeating the foe and saving the planet he was visiting. (TV: Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., \"\"An Unearthly Child\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).\", \"A Desperate Venture (6) [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).\") On Skaro, the Doctor first became involved, and took a stand against oppression. (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) In time, he became a man he would no longer recognise. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) After much time spent alone re-thinking her identity, the Thirteenth Doctor only needed one more encounter with the Daleks to remember who she really was, no matter her origins: she was the Doctor, the person she chose to be, the woman who stopped the Daleks. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) As the Twelfth Doctor proclaimed, he was \"the man who stops the monsters\", who constructed his identity in response. (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).})\n\nBy Azure's estimation, the Doctor wanted people \"to live, to breathe\", (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) as Rose Tyler understood it, in order to be able to experience the wonders of the everyday. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Azure could not understand this, as life was but one form for matter, but the Thirteenth Doctor explained it well: \"Because otherwise, why are we here?\" (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nAccording to Robin Hood, the Doctor was a hero, born of wealth and privilege but unable to stand the plight of the oppressed, who stole a TARDIS and flew among the stars to protect those who needed outside help. However, the Doctor himself refused the title of hero. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) He instead proclaimed that he wasn't a good man or a bad man, not a hero or an officer, nor a president; instead, he was an \"idiot with a box\", who travelled around helping and learning. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThough he claimed to simply \"be passing by\" whenever he got involved, Bill Potts believed he was always helping out because the Doctor could never simply walk past and let problems go. (TV: Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) In fact, the Doctor frequently answered distress calls, to find these opportunities, believing that:\n\nThough ideas of responsibility, (AUDIO: The Lost Resort [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) the promise of power, (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) or the intellectual game of a complex scheme with parts to play (TV: The Curse of Fenric [+]Ian Briggs, Doctor Who season 26 (BBC1, 1989)., PROSE: Nightshade [+]Mark Gatiss, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1992)., Love and War [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1992).; TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) often led the Doctor to ignore the autonomy of others, in time the Doctor began to defer to others on matters which concerned them, (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) as a strong believer in free will, (TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., AUDIO: What Just Happened? [+]John Dorney, Stranded 3 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Stranded, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) and recognised that sometimes, he needed \"someone to stop him\", to call him out when he was going wrong. (TV: The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006)., Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nFor this, and to have someone to share the universe with, the Doctor took on many companions, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963). et al.) and lost many, each time having to relearn their ways of coping (AUDIO: The Lost Resort [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., The Wrong Woman [+]John Dorney, Dalek Universe (Big Finish Productions, 2021)., The Lost [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) in order to move on. (AUDIO: Relative Dimensions [+]Marc Platt, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2010).)\n\nOf everyone who came to travel with the Doctor, the TARDIS was their oldest and most cherished companion. She considered that she chose him when the Doctor left Gallifrey. (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) The TARDIS also considered herself the Doctor's librarian, creating records of their adventures and storing them in her library, (PROSE: The Library of Time) partly in the form of the sentient Encyclopaedia Gallifreya. (PROSE: Citation Needed [+]Jacqueline Rayner, The Target Storybook (2019).) The TARDIS felt that she always took the Doctor where the Doctor needed to be, though not always where the Doctor asked. (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAfter leaving Gallifrey for \"many pressing reasons\" (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) and enjoying several adventures with his granddaughter Susan (TV: The Edge of Destruction [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).) before landing in London 1963, the First Doctor took on his first human companions, Susan's teachers Barbara Wright and Ian Chesterton from Coal Hill School, when the Doctor discovered the TARDIS in Foreman's Yard. (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).) One of their earliest travels brought them to the planet Skaro, where the Doctor insisted on investigating a nearby city. There, the Doctor encountered the Daleks for the first time. (TV: The Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963-1964).) This encounter was a formative event for the Doctor, with the Twelfth Doctor later recalling that until then him calling himself the Doctor had just been a title, but after meeting the Daleks he was clear that \"the Doctor was not the Daleks\". (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThis humble beginning led to \"quite the spirit of adventure\", with all four growing and changing as a result of their travels and their time together. (TV: The Sensorites [+]Peter R. Newman, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC1, 1964).) Seeing as the Doctor had little control over his Ship, the group tended to bound from one destination to another, rarely looking back. As a result, the Doctor had little sense of their impact. When the Doctor did return to Skaro, a century had passed since the Doctor fought the Daleks, and the Doctor found that quite the mythology had been built around them. (AUDIO: Return to Skaro [+]Andrew Smith, The First Doctor Adventures: Volume Four (The First Doctor Adventures, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nEventually, the First Doctor left Susan behind on 22nd century Earth, so that she could take root, and, for once, stay somewhere long enough build a life of her own. He knew that she would object, and stay with him forever if given the chance, so he locked her out of the TARDIS, promising he would \"come back\" before departing. (TV: The Dalek Invasion of Earth [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1964)., AUDIO: After the Daleks [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Ian and Barbara left for 1964 Earth when given the chance, (TV: The Chase [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) although the Doctor would again become involved in the Doctor's world. (COMIC: Hunters of the Burning Stone [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2013).; PROSE: The Face of the Enemy [+]David A. McIntee, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).; AUDIO: The Five Companions [+]Eddie Robson, Bonus Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2011)., Sphere of Influence [+]Eddie Robson, Susan's War (Big Finish Productions, 2020).) From this point forward, the TARDIS was the only major constant in the Doctor's lives. (AUDIO: Relative Dimensions [+]Marc Platt, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2010).)\n\nThe Doctor subsequently travelled with Vicki Pallister and Steven Taylor, during which he encountered another of his people, the Monk, who meddled far more recklessly in history than the Doctor would. (TV: The Time Meddler [+]Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 2 (BBC1, 1965).) After Vicki chose to remain in Troy, the Doctor was aided in transporting an injured Steven back to the TARDIS by Katarina. (TV: The Myth Makers [+]Donald Cotton, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965).) The Doctor immediately became embroiled in a Dalek plot in the year 4000, working alongside Space Security Service agents Bret Vyon and Sara Kingdom to stop the Daleks developing the Time Destructor. In the course of the conflict, Katarina and Sara died aiding the Doctor, (TV: The Daleks' Master Plan [+]Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1965-1966).) losses which would weigh heavily on the Doctor throughout their lives. (COMIC: Planet of the Dead [+]John Freeman, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics, 1988)., The Last Word [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (2001)., The Everlasting Summer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., AUDIO: The Lost [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nFollowing another tragic loss when Oliver Harper died shortly after joining the Doctor and Steven, (AUDIO: The First Wave [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the pair was embroiled in the St Bartholomew's Day massacre, after which Steven briefly contemplated leaving the Doctor for good, outraged at his refusal to interfere in history. Alone, the Doctor considered whether he should return to his home planet, however Steven ultimately returned and the Doctor was joined by a new friend, Dodo Chaplet. (TV: The Massacre [+]John Lucarotti and Donald Tosh, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nIn what the Fourteenth Doctor would later claim was a mistake born of youthful arrogance, the Doctor let his TARDIS fall into \"a hollow beneath the Under-Universe\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) There he and his companions found themselves in the Celestial Toyroom, home of the Toymaker who the Doctor had encountered briefly once, escaping in time to avoid his games. The Toymaker challenged the Doctor to play the Trilogic Game whilst Steven and Dodo played lethal variants of children's games to reach the TARDIS. Knowing the Toyroom would disappear the moment he won, the Doctor imitated the Toymaker's voice to move the final piece remotely from the safety of the TARDIS. (TV: The Celestial Toymaker [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nIn the company of Ben Jackson and Polly Wright, the Doctor encountered the Cybermen at Snowcap in Antarctica. Once the crisis was all over however he hurriedly made for the TARDIS, (TV: The Tenth Planet [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) knowing his first regeneration was imminent. He was initally resistent to the change, however a chance encounter with his future self and Testimony Foundation changed his outlook to embrace the process. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe new Second Doctor's first adventure saw him encounter the Daleks on Vulcan, with his actions reaffirming to Ben and Polly he was indeed the same man. (TV: The Power of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) Shortly afterwards he encountered Jamie McCrimmon, who would become this incarnation's foremost friend. (TV: The Highlanders [+]Elwyn Jones and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966-1967).) After Ben and Polly decided to leave after the TARDIS brought them back to their home time period, (TV: The Faceless Ones [+]David Ellis and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1967).) the Doctor and Jamie was embroiled in the Dalek Emperor's plan to research the Human Factor. Manipulating Jamie in the process, the Doctor manipulated the experiments to incite a civil war on Skaro, which he hoped was the Daleks' \"final end\". Amongst the chaos, a human scientist caught up in the experiment, Edward Waterfield, died saving the Doctor's life and asked him to look after his daughter, Victoria Waterfield. (TV: The Evil of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1967).)\n\nDuring his travels with Jamie and Victoria, the Doctor's curiosity got the better of him on Telos, where he helped a team of archeologists access a Cyber-tomb. (TV: The Tomb of the Cybermen [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967).) The Doctor subsequently encountered the Ice Warriors and the Great Intelligence for the first time. (TV: The Abominable Snowmen [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967)., The Ice Warriors [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967).) During a second battle with the Intelligence in 20th century London, the Doctor met Colonel Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart for the first time, becoming firm allies. (TV: The Web of Fear (TV story)\n\nShortly after Victoria left, the Doctor and Jamie encountered the Cybermen at Space Station W3 after which one of the crew, Zoe Heriot, stowed away. (TV: The Wheel in Space [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1968).) The trio subsequently found themselves in the Land of Fiction, (TV: The Mind Robber [+]Peter Ling, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1968).) worked with newly-promoted Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and UNIT to stop a Cyberman invasion of Earth, (TV: The Invasion [+]Derrick Sherwin, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1968).) and inadvertently altered the past of his first incarnation, which gave the Doctor an opportunity to say a proper goodbye to Katarina when he put things right. (AUDIO: Daughter of the Gods [+]David K Barnes, The Early Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nThe Second Doctor's adventures was cut short after he was forced to call in the Time Lords to return hundreds of humans kidnapped from their own time eras by the War Lord in a scheme to create an army to conquer the galaxy. As he'd feared, the Time Lords put the Doctor on trial for his interference, which he pled guilty to though argued he had only been doing so to fight against the evils of the cosmos. The Time Lords separated him from his companions, who was returned home with only the memory of their first adventures, and sentenced him. To his surprise the Doctor accepted his plea, though still enforced a change of appearance, exile to Earth in the 20th century, and the loss of his knowledge of how to control the TARDIS. (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).)\n\nBefore serving his complete sentence, the Second Doctor worked for the Celestial Intervention Agency. For a time he was allowed to travel, even being accompanied by Jamie again, albeit with his memories altered. (PROSE: Players [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., World Game [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) Eventually however his exile was enforced, though he escaped the change of appearance. (COMIC: The Night Walkers [+]Roger Noel Cook, TVC comic stories (Polystyle Publications, Ltd., 1969).) Taking up residence at the Carlton Grange Hotel, the Doctor became a celebrity, (COMIC: Action in Exile, The Mark of Terror, The Brotherhood, U.F.O.) but soon faced his regeneration, at the Time Lords' behest. (COMIC: The Night Walkers [+]Roger Noel Cook, TVC comic stories (Polystyle Publications, Ltd., 1969).)\n\nConfined to Earth as an exile, the Third Doctor reluctantly agreed to work for UNIT, an organisation which fought to protect the Earth against alien threats led by Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, as their scientific advisor. (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) He and the Brigadier fell out early into his work after the Brigadier ordered the destruction of a Silurian tribe the Doctor had hoped to establish peace with. (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) Absconding from UNIT to Peru, the Doctor was finally persusaded to return by the Brigadier, with the two men coming to an understanding. (AUDIO: AWOL) Over time the two developed a close friendship, disagreements and all. The Eighth Doctor later regretted that he never gave the Brigadier enough credit as looking back he realised he had been redirecting his own frustration at feeling trapped on Earth, in one place and time. (AUDIO: UNIT Dating)\n\nInitially the Doctor was assisted at UNIT by Liz Shaw, (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) however she left UNIT feeling the Doctor only needed soemone to \"pass the test tubes and tell [him] how brilliant [he] is\". Jo Grant was recruitrd as her replacement, though had no formal training as a scientist so the Doctor was poised to reject her out of hand. However, she proved herself early in their first encounter with the Master and a deep fondness developed between the two over time, uncovering a gentler side to him. (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Time Monster [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972)., et al.)\n\nThe Third Doctor found his match in the Master as an opponent, but always managed to get the upper hand. (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971). et al.) The Twelfth Doctor later characterised him as the only person \"even remotely like [him]\". The Master had been his closest friend on Gallifrey. Though the Doctor was now enemies, a certain kinship was never lost, (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and in truth, the Master often created chaos in order to get the Doctor's attention, laying traps for him, and even looking forward to his response. (TV: The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).; PROSE: Legacy of the Daleks [+]John Peel, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998)., AUDIO: Animal Instinct; TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Even the Doctor admitted he was \"looking forward to [their] next encounter\". (TV: Terror of the Autons [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) The Master even attempted to win the Third Doctor around to his side during his scheme to possess the Doomsday Weapon but the Doctor rejected him, claiming he'd never understood that the Doctor simply wanted to see the universe, not rule it. (TV: Colony in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) After the Master was finally apprehended by UNIT, the Doctor pleaded for him not to be executed. (TV: The Sea Devils [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).)\n\nOver time the Time Lords used the exiled Doctor on discreete missions, directing his TARDIS to Uxarieus, (TV: Colony in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971).) Peladon, (TV: The Curse of Peladon [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) Solos, (TV: The Mutants [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) and 1944. (AUDIO: Operation: Hellfire) Finally his knowledge of the TARDIS and his freedom to travel was restored to him after the Doctor stopped Omega's assault on the Time Lords, partnering up with his two other selves. (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973).) Afterwards, the Doctor resumed his adventures in time and space with Jo, (TV: Carnival of Monsters [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) though soon had to turn to the Time Lords' aid after discovering a Dalek plot in the 26th century against the empires of Earth and Draconia. (TV: Frontier in Space [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).) The Doctor was heartbroken when Jo decided to leave his company soon after, and gifted her a crystal he'd managed to obtain from Metebelis III. (TV: The Green Death [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1973).)\n\nThe Doctor met Sarah Jane Smith near the end of his third life, (TV: The Time Warrior [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1973-1974).) forming a friendship which would last several lifetimes. (TV: Robot [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1974-1975)., School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).; COMIC: Train-Flight; PROSE: Lily, Interference [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The pair encountered a Sontaran warrior in the 12th century, (TV: The Time Warrior [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1973-1974).) foiled Operation Golden Age, (TV: Invasion of the Dinosaurs [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) prevented Daleks seizing the only cure to a space plague on Exxilon, (TV: Death to the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) and revisited Peladon. (TV: The Monster of Peladon [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).)\n\nWhilst experimenting with ESP, the Doctor encountered the Eight Legs and learnt the Doctor was seeking the crystal he'd taken from Metebelis III, which Jo had returned to him. With guidance from his old mentor K'anpo Rimpoche, the Doctor faced his fears and took the crystal back to their leader, the Great One, knowing that the radiation from her cave would be fatal to him. He managed to escape back to the TARDIS, (TV: Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) and spent a decade lost in the Time Vortex whilst slowly dying of the radiation; an experience that would remain one of his worst memories. (PROSE: Love and War [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1992).) Finally the TARDIS brought him back to UNIT HQ where he collapsed in front of Sarah and the Brigadier, acknowledging that he was \"home\". With a \"little push\" from K'anpo, the Doctor was able to regenerate. (TV: Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).)\n\nThe Fourth Doctor continued to work for UNIT, for a time, but he became less reliable, as he began gallivanting around the universe, no longer bound to Earth. (TV: Robot [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1974-1975)., The Ark in Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975)., The Android Invasion [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 13 (BBC1, 1975)., et al.) Early in the Fourth Doctor's life, he was sent by the Time Lords to prevent the creation of the Daleks, but despite having the chance he refrained from committing genocide. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1975).) He later had to leave Sarah Jane Smith behind when he was called to Gallifrey, (TV: The Hand of Fear [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 14 (BBC1, 1976).) where he attempted to avert the assassination of the President and became implicated in a political plot, and in the Decayed Master's first major attempt to prolong his life by unnatural means. (TV: The Deadly Assassin [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 14 (BBC1, 1976).)\n\nHe travelled for a while with Leela of the Sevateem, a \"savage\" woman whom he educated, and whom he learned to respect in turn. Alongside them, K9 Mark I joined the scene. (TV: The Face of Evil [+]Chris Boucher, Doctor Who season 14 (BBC1, 1977)., The Invisible Enemy [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 15 (BBC1, 1977)., et al.) On Gallifrey, the Doctor became Lord President. Leela and K9 stayed behind on Gallifrey, while the Doctor abandoned his new post. (TV: The Invasion of Time [+]David Agnew, Doctor Who season 15 (BBC1, 1978).)\n\nLater on, the Doctor was tasked with collecting the segments to the Key to Time, and Romana I was assigned to his operation. (TV: The Ribos Operation [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 16 (BBC1, 1978).) On discovering that the final segment was Princess Astra of Atrios and assembling the Key, the Doctor attracted the attention of the Black Guardian, and found a new goal: preventing him from obtaining the Key, which held untold power. In order to evade him, the Doctor fitted his TARDIS with a randomiser. (TV: The Armageddon Factor [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 16 (BBC1, 1979).)\n\nRomana II, K9 Mark II and the Doctor became trapped in E-Space when the Doctor accidentally travelled through a CVE. On Alzarius, the Doctor met Adric, who had an impressive young mind, but much to learn, (TV: Full Circle [+]Andrew Smith, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980).) though, in Romana's view, the Doctor never seemed to know what to say to the child. (AUDIO: Purgatory 12 [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Eventually the Doctor found a way out of E-Space, though Romana and K9 opted to remain behind to help the Tharils. (TV: Warriors' Gate [+]Steve Gallagher, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).)\n\nBack in normal space, the Doctor and Adric visited Traken, where the Doctor met Nyssa and encountered the Decayed Master once more. Unknown to them after their departure, the Master stole the body of Nyssa's father, Tremas. (TV: The Keeper of Traken [+]Johnny Byrne, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).) He subsequently stalked the Doctor, embroiling Tegan Jovanka after killing her aunt, and eventually following him to Logopolis, where the Master's meddling led to the failure of the Logopolitans' efforts to divert entropy through CVEs. With a wave of entropy now spreading, the Doctor reluctantly agreed to work with the Master to save the universe. Together the Doctor used the Pharos Project to reopen a CVE to divert the entropy; however, the Master revealed his intent to blackmail the universe with the threat of closing it again. The Doctor foiled his plan by sabotaging the equipment, but fell from the Project's radio telescope in doing so. The Doctor regenerated into his fifth incarnation, aided by the Watcher, and in view of Adric, Tegan and Nyssa. (TV: Logopolis [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).)\n\nIn his early days, the Fifth Doctor was mainly preoccupied with unsuccessful efforts to return Tegan to Heathrow Airport. (TV: Four to Doomsday [+]Terence Dudley, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982)., The Visitation [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) Tragedy struck during an encounter with the Cybermen, when Adric was killed foiling their plan to crash a freighter into Earth in the 26th century. (TV: Earthshock [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) After another encounter with the Master, the Doctor finally left Tegan at Heathrow, (TV: Time-Flight [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) and travelled on with Nyssa. (PROSE: Empire of Death [+]David Bishop, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004)., AUDIO: The Land of the Dead) Notably the pair became embroiled in the creation of the Cybermen on Mondas and made an ultimately futile effort to delay their development. (AUDIO: Spare Parts)\n\nThe Doctor and Nyssa was reunited with Tegan during Hedin's scheme to unleash Omega using the Doctor's biodata. After foiling Omega's return, (TV: Arc of Infinity [+]Johnny Byrne, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).) the Doctor resumed their travels. During this time, the Black Guardian sought his revenge on the Doctor and secretly tasked Vislor Turlough with assassinating him. Turlough joined the TARDIS crew to this end. (TV: Mawdryn Undead [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).) After Nyssa departed, (TV: Terminus [+]Steve Gallagher, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).) the crew became embroiled in a race between Eternals organised by the Guardians. During this the Doctor learned the truth about Turlough and helped him stand up to the Black Guardian, allowing him to remain onboard the TARDIS afterwards. (TV: [[Enlightenment (TV story)}}) The Doctor also encountered a member of the Celestial Preservation Agency, who came from a time in Gallifrey's future history where the Doctor was a cultural hero. (AUDIO: Omega)\n\nAfter being embroiled in President Borusa's insane scheme to claim immortality in the Game of Rassilon, along with his previous four incarnations, the Doctor was again appointed President of Gallifrey by the High Council. He opted to run away from his new responsibilities. (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) After he accidentally crossed the frontier in time, (TV: Frontios [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) the Doctor was summoned to Gallifrey to serve his term. After a short time in office, during which he pursued reforms to the Time Lord Academy, the Doctor passed the presidency onto Castellan Lowri and resumed his travels. (AUDIO: Time in Office [+]Eddie Robson, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nFollowing a brutal encounter with the Daleks, Tegan opted to stay behind on Earth, believing travelling with the Doctor was no longer fun. (TV: Resurrection of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) Shortly afterwards Turlough also left to rejoin his people, leaving the Doctor in the company of Peri Brown, whom he'd saved from drowning in Lanzarote. (TV: Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) The Doctor and Peri visited Androzani Minor, where the Doctor both contracted spectrox toxaemia. The Doctor was able to retrieve the antidote but only had enough for Peri, forcing him to regenerate to survive. (TV: The Caves of Androzani [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).)\n\nThe Sixth Doctor endured a difficult post-regeneration period, during which he briefly attacked Peri whilst deluded into believing her a spy. (TV: The Twin Dilemma [+]Anthony Steven, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) The pair continued travelling together, with their initially frosty relationship becoming much closer, encountering Cybermen, Sil, the Rani and Davros together. (TV: Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985)., Vengeance on Varos [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985)., The Mark of the Rani [+]Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985)., Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).)\n\nAfter stumbling onto Ravolox, the Doctor was again put on trial by the Time Lords. During this he was separated from Peri, having been moments away from saving her from having Lord Kiv's brain implanted in her. With the surprise intervention of the Tremas Master, he discovered that the Prosecutor, the Valeyard, was a personification of his evil future self, who was helping to cover up the crimes of the High Council of the Time Lords. After defeating the Valeyard, the Doctor was assured Peri had been saved, (TV: The Trial of a Time Lord) and later learned she had multiple contradictory yet co-existing fates due to the Time Lord meddling. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) In the immediate aftermath of the trial, the Doctor was reluctant to interfere but eventually resumed his travels in the company of Grant Markham. (PROSE: Time of Your Life [+]Steve Lyons, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).)\n\nThe Sixth Doctor went on to travel with a wide variety of companions including Evelyn Smythe, (AUDIO: The Marian Conspiracy) Charlotte Pollard, (AUDIO: The Condemned) a fictionalised verison of Jamie McCrimmon, (AUDIO: City of Spires) Henry Gordon Jago and George Litefoot, (AUDIO: The Hourglass Killers) Flip Jackson, (AUDIO: The Curse of Davros) Constance Clarke, (AUDIO: Criss-Cross) and finally Melanie Bush, (PROSE: Business Unusual [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) with whom he shared an adventure which had previously been used as evidence from his future in his trial. (TV: Terror of the Vervoids [+]Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) He and Mel was also joined by Hebe Harrison. (AUDIO: The Rotting Deep)\n\nThere was contradictory accounts as to the cause of the Sixth Doctor's regeneration. One suggested it had been due to his next incarnation influencing him to ensure he might come into existence sooner, (PROSE: Head Games [+]Steve Lyons, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).) another as a consequence of his battle against the Lamprey alongside numerous parallel counterparts of himself, (PROSE: Spiral Scratch [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) and a third as part of a scheme to foil the Valeyard's master plan to usurp Time Lord civilisation. (AUDIO: The Brink of Death) Regardless of the cause, all accounts agreed the TARDIS fell into a trap set by the Rani, who entered the ship just as the Doctor regenerated into his seventh incarnation. (TV: Time and the Rani [+]Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 24 (BBC1, 1987).)\n\nThough initially a jovial character in the company of Mel, (TV: Paradise Towers [+]Stephen Wyatt, Doctor Who season 24 (BBC1, 1987)., Delta and the Bannermen [+]Malcolm Kohll, Doctor Who season 24 (BBC1, 1987).) the Seventh Doctor darkened over time. (PROSE: Just War [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996)., AUDIO: The Fires of Vulcan) Whilst visiting Iceworld, he and Mel met Ace, a teenager from the 20th century displaced in time by a time storm. (TV: Dragonfire [+]Ian Briggs, adapted from Seventh Doctor Audition Tapes (Andrew Cartmel), Doctor Who season 24 (BBC1, 1987).) Recognising the influence of Fenric on her, (TV: The Curse of Fenric [+]Ian Briggs, Doctor Who season 26 (BBC1, 1989).) the Doctor let her come with him whilst Mel chose to stay behind with Sabalom Glitz. (TV: Dragonfire [+]Ian Briggs, adapted from Seventh Doctor Audition Tapes (Andrew Cartmel), Doctor Who season 24 (BBC1, 1987).)\n\nAdopting a more proactive approach, the Doctor ended the Imperial-Renegade Dalek Civil War by setting a trap with the Hand of Omega, (TV: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988).) saw to the overthrow of Helen A on Terra Alpha, (TV: The Happiness Patrol [+]Graeme Curry, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988).) and disposed of the Nemesis and the factions fighting over it. One of those involved in the fight for the Nemesis, Lady Peinforte, learned secrets about the Doctor through the statue (TV: Silver Nemesis [+]Kevin Clarke, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1 and TVNZ, 1988).) and a \"place of knowledge\" called TARDIS Wiki. (PROSE: Lady Peinforte) As he'd suspected, Fenric returned and the Doctor was forced to break Ace's faith in him to enable the Ancient One to move against Fenric. (TV: The Curse of Fenric [+]Ian Briggs, Doctor Who season 26 (BBC1, 1989).)\n\nAfter encountering the Tremas Master once more, (TV: Survival [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who season 26 (BBC1, 1989).) the Doctor and Ace continued travelling together. There was multiple possible outcomes of their travels, including Ace growing old in the Doctor's company, (PROSE: At Childhood's End [+]Sophie Aldred, Mike Tucker and Steve Cole, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2020).) Ace dying in his arms after fighting the Lobri, (COMIC: Ground Zero) Ace leaving his company to patrol a rift in Paris, (PROSE: Set Piece [+]Kate Orman, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).) and the Doctor sending her to Gallifrey. (AUDIO: Intervention Earth) By one account after witnessing these possible fates via the quantum anvil and growing angry at the Doctor's scheming, Ace asked the Doctor to take her home. (PROSE: At Childhood's End [+]Sophie Aldred, Mike Tucker and Steve Cole, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2020).) A similar account also suggested the Doctor simply fell out, (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) following an adventure involving the Rani. (TV: The Curse of Fenric [+]Pete McTighe, Tales of the TARDIS (BBC iPlayer, 2023).)\n\nAs recalled by the Eighth Doctor, later in his life the Seventh Doctor ended up travelling alone, unable to trust himself with others' lives. (AUDIO: The Resurrection of Mars) In this lonely phase of his life, the Doctor made a deal with Death to try to save the Master, (AUDIO: Master) built himself a robotic companion, Catherine Broome, (PROSE: Companion Piece [+]Robert Perry and Mike Tucker, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).) and tied up loose ends including Elizabeth Klein, (AUDIO: A Thousand Tiny Wings) and Mags. (AUDIO: The Monsters of Gokroth)\n\nAs ordered by the Time Lords, (PROSE: Lungbarrow [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Lungbarrow, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997)., The TV Movie) the Doctor collected the Master's remains for return to Gallifrey following his execution by the Daleks. En route, the Master, who had survived using a Deathworm Morphant, (AUDIO: Mastermind) sabotaged the TARDIS console causing the ship to make an emergency landing in the midst of a gang war in San Francisco. Upon exiting the TARDIS, the Doctor was gunned down and subsequently taken to hospital. Confused by his alien anatomy, Dr Grace Holloway inadvertently caused his hearts to stop. The Doctor regenerated later that night in the hospital's morgue, the process having been delayed by the anaesthetic in his system.\n\nThough initially suffering amnesia, the newly regenerated Eighth Doctor managed to regain his identity and defeated the Master's plan to use his TARDIS' Eye of Harmony to steal his body. (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) He resumed his travels with a more optimistic outlook, sometimes styled as Life's Champion. (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997)., AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) He initially travelled with Sam Jones, (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) but left her at a Greenpeace rally and went travelling alone for some years. (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) During this time his main companion was Izzy Sinclair, with whom he tied up loose ends regarding the Threshold, and the Master during his attempt to seize the Glory, being aided by Fey Truscott-Sade and Kroton respectively. (COMIC: Wormwood, The Glorious Dead [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2000).)\n\nResuming his travels with Sam, the Doctor began to encounter parts of the looming War in Heaven, including Faction Paradox, (PROSE: Alien Bodies [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) and was joined by Fitz Kreiner. (PROSE: The Taint [+]Michael Collier, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) After Sam departed, the Doctor was joined by Compassion, (PROSE: Interference [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) whose signal receiver the Doctor linked to the TARDIS. (PROSE: The Taking of Planet 5 [+]Simon Bucher-Jones and Mark Clapham, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) This inadvertently caused her to evolve into a sentient TARDIS. After his TARDIS was seemingly destroyed, the Doctor and Fitz began travelling within her, pursued by the Time Lords who wished to exploit her in preparation for the War. (PROSE: The Shadows of Avalon [+]Paul Cornell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) The Time Lords eventually tracked them down, (PROSE: The Banquo Legacy [+]Andy Lane and Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) just as the outbreak of the War approached and Faction Paradox invaded Gallifrey. Discovering his old TARDIS had become the Edifice, the Doctor used it to destroy Gallifrey to prevent the War and stop Faction Paradox. (PROSE: The Ancestor Cell [+]Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) With Compassion's help, he saved the Time Lords by copying all their minds from the Matrix, suppressing his own memories. (PROSE: The Gallifrey Chronicles [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) Compassion retrieved Fitz and the remains of the TARDIS and took the amnesiac Doctor to Earth in 19th century, leaving a note to meet Fitz in 2001 by which time his TARDIS would have recovered. (PROSE: The Ancestor Cell [+]Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nAfter a century living on Earth, (PROSE: The Burning [+]Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000)., Casualties of War [+]Steve Emmerson, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000)., The Turing Test [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000)., Endgame [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000)., Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) the amnesiac Doctor reunited with Fitz and resumed travelling in the recovered TARDIS, being joined by Anji Kapoor. (PROSE: Escape Velocity [+]Colin Brake, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) The Doctor repeatedly battled Sabbath, (PROSE: The Adventuress of Henrietta Street [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001)., Time Zero [+]Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) and was joined by Trix MacMillan. (PROSE: Timeless [+]Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003).) The Doctor finally confronted Sabbath's employers, the Council of Eight, and defeated them. (PROSE: Sometime Never... [+]Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) Not long afterwards the Doctor encountered a surviving Time Lord, Marnal, and learnt the cause of his amnesia. Intending to restore the Time Lords, he first faced the Vore invasion of Earth. (PROSE: The Gallifrey Chronicles [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nBy rescuing Charlotte Pollard from her fate on the R101 and allowing her to travel with him, (AUDIO: Storm Warning) the Doctor damaged the Web of Time, creating an opportunity for anti-time to contaminate the universe. He was forced by President Romana to join the Time Lords' expedition to the antiverse to stem the flow and ultimately saved Gallifrey from the Neverpeople's plan to destroy the Web of Time. (AUDIO: Neverland) In the process he was contaminated by anti-time and had to exile himself to a Divergent Universe to prevent damage to time. (AUDIO: Zagreus)\n\nTo his annoyance, Charley joined him against his wishes, putting herself in danger all over again when he'd just finished saving her. (AUDIO: Scherzo) Together the Doctor explored the divergent universe, being joined by C'rizz, (AUDIO: The Creed of the Kromon) until the Doctor discovered a way back to the main universe, and confirmed that he was free of anti-time. (AUDIO: The Next Life) Tragedy struck not long afterwards when C'rizz was killed, (AUDIO: Absolution) prompting Charley to demand to go home. Due to complications arising from an encounter with the Cybermen, the Doctor was left believing she was on Earth in 2008 when she was actually stranded in 500002, only to be rescued by the Sixth Doctor. (AUDIO: The Girl Who Never Was)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor travelled with Destrii. (COMIC: Sins of the Father) The Doctor encountered an advanced force of Cybermen from the far future in 2005, during which the Doctor briefly bonded with the Time Vortex to save the Earth by wiping out the Cyber-Army. Although the Vortex called to him with the offer of an immortal existence, he rejected the offer to save Destrii. (COMIC: The Flood)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor later travelled with Lucie Miller, initially as part of a forced Time Lord witness protection scheme and eventually by choice. (AUDIO: Blood of the Daleks, Human Resources) The Doctor was separated after a confrontation with Morbius, (AUDIO: The Vengeance of Morbius) during which the Doctor spent centuries living on Orbis. (AUDIO: Orbis) Resuming their travels, Lucie eventually left his company after discovering he'd lied to her about the death of her aunt Pat. (AUDIO: Death in Blackpool) The Doctor subsequently reconnected with Susan, meeting his great-grandson Alex Campbell, (AUDIO: An Earthly Child) and travelled with Tamsin Drew, (AUDIO: Situation Vacant) until an encounter with the Monk reunited him with Lucie whilst Tamsin chose to travel with the Monk instead. (AUDIO: The Resurrection of Mars)\n\nIn a brutal battle with the Daleks, the Doctor witnessed the deaths of Tamsin, Alex and Lucie. He furiously dismissed the Monk after discovering his role in enabling the Daleks and delaying his arrival, and travelled on alone. (AUDIO: To the Death [+]Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2011).) Desperate for hope, he ran to the end of the universe. He reluctantly accepted a mission from the Time Lords to look after Molly O'Sullivan and battled the Dalek Time Controller. He subsequently became embroiled in the Reborn Masters scheme to exploit the Eminence and was joined by Liv Chenka. (AUDIO: Dark Eyes)\n\nThe Doctor and Liv travelled together for some time before battling the Doom Coalition assembled by Cardinal Padrac to destroy the universe. The Doctor was joined by Helen Sinclair and discreetly aided by River Song, who was aware the Doctor was too young to meet her. In the aftermath of Padrac's defeat, the Doctor went in search of Helen, who had been lost in time. (AUDIO: Doom Coalition) Retrieving Helen, the trio subsequently encountered the Ravenous and stopped the Eleven's plan to exploit them. The TARDIS was critically damaged by the Ravenous, (AUDIO: Ravenous) leaving the Doctor, Liv and Helen stranded in London in 2020 whilst it recovered. (AUDIO: Stranded)\n\nLater in his life, the Eighth Doctor travelled with Josephine Day, (COMIC: The Pictures of Josephine Day) and became embroiled in the crisis caused by his future self. (AUDIO: The Enemy of My Enemy)\n\nAs the Last Great Time War between the Time Lords and the Daleks spread, turning time upside down, the Eighth Doctor vowed to help victims from the sidelines, but refused to take part. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013)., AUDIO: The Starship of Theseus, et al.) He died in a spaceship crash on Karn, trying to save someone who despised him as a Time Lord. When the Doctor was revived by the Sisterhood of Karn, and was persuaded he needed to get involved in the fight by Ohila. Accepting her elixir to trigger a regeneration, he agreed to become a warrior. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) In truth, the elixir was really just lemonade and dry ice, with Ohila putting on a \"moment of theatre\" to help the Doctor embrace what he needed to do without falling into self-loathing before he regenerated from injuries he had sustained in the crash. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nIn his new incarnation, the Doctor actively fought in the Time War. Initially he served as a free agent, appearing on battlefronts across the cosmos at his own whim, (AUDIO: Forged in Fire, COMIC: Ambush) though later he fought alongside the Time Lords, answering to Cardinal Ollistra. (AUDIO: Only the Monstrous) He became famous among the Gallifreyan soldiers as he fought alongside them, (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and his exploits in the War was legends among the Sontarans. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nIn the midst of the conflict, the War Doctor was affected by the Union's degeneration weapon, (AUDIO: The Union [+]Matt Fitton, Once and Future (Big Finish Productions, 2023).) resulting in him shifting between past incarnations for a time whilst trying to piece together who was responsible from his scattered memory. (AUDIO: Past Lives, The Artist at the End of Time, A Genius for War, Two's Company) Aid from the Master, who was also suffering from the weapon's effects, saw him directed back to the Union and she also used her solution to temporary stabilise on him, resulting in the Doctor experience two future incarnations. (AUDIO: The Martian Invasion of Planetoid 50, Time Lord Immemorial) Finally the Doctor returned to face the Union and with the aid of Susan and River Song destroyed her weapon to return to normal, though did make use of the instability first to give Susan a moment with her Doctor. (AUDIO: The Union [+]Matt Fitton, Once and Future (Big Finish Productions, 2023).)\n\nLater in the War, the Doctor began to turn against his own people. He foiled Gallifrey's alliance with Technomancers by wiping them out, after discovering the Technomancers was exploiting it to resurrect the Horned Ones. For this Ollistra branded him a war criminal. (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost) He continued to serve Ollistra for a time, (AUDIO: Agents of Chaos) until the Doctor finally fell out when he suggested the Enigma should wipe out both sides to finally end the War, a suggestion the entity ultimately didn't act on. (AUDIO: The Enigma Dimension) Finally the Doctor turned on the Time Lords after discovering Rassilon's plan to destroy the Tantalus Eye, during which Cardinal Karlax gunned down Cinder, a human whom the Doctor had befriended. Foiling both the Time Lord and Dalek plans for the Eye, the Doctor swore to finally end the War in Cinder's honour, swearing there would be \"No More\". (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).\n\nIn the War's final days, the War Doctor was at the Fall of Arcadia and stole the Moment, the last weapon in the Omega Arsenal, intent on using it to destroy Daleks and Time Lords together. The conscience of the weapon decided to show him two of his future selves, to see what he would become, and after an adventure together establishing peace between UNIT and Zygons, the three Doctors realised that the Doctor had devised another way to end the War. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWith the help of at least thirteen of his incarnations, with the Twelfth Doctor admitting he was not sure how many Doctors united to prevent the Fall of Gallifrey, (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) the War Doctor placed Gallifrey into a pocket universe instead, annihilating the Daleks bombarding the planet from orbit in their own crossfire. This caused the near-extinction of the Daleks. The War was sealed in a time lock, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) making it impossible to time travel back to save Gallifrey, (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) as much as the Doctor would desperately want to return. (AUDIO: The Wrong Woman [+]John Dorney, Dalek Universe (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nDue to the timelines being out of sync, the War Doctor lost all memory of having saved Gallifrey rather than destroying it, so that future incarnations would believe the Doctor had been responsible for its end. Only the Eleventh Doctor retained memory of this changing narrative. Going on his way, the War Doctor found himself regenerating, remarking that he was \"wearing a bit thin\". (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor believed that he had destroyed Gallifrey, wiping out both the Daleks and Time Lords, (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018)., COMIC: Don't Step on the Grass) and chose to travel alone for a time, (AUDIO: Way of the Burryman) deciding he \"didn't need companions or friends\". (PROSE: The Eyeless [+]Lance Parkin, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2008).) In truth, he wished to punish himself for surviving. (PROSE: Meet the Doctor) During this time, he dealt with relics from the Time War, (AUDIO: The Oncoming Storm, Her Own Bootstraps) prevented the escape of the Ravagers, (AUDIO: Ravagers) made peace with a new race of Cybermen, (AUDIO: The Forth Generation) and was present at the assassination of John F. Kennedy, (PROSE: Have You Seen This Man?, TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and the sinking of the RMS Titanic. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nAfter meeting her whilst battling the Nestene Consciousness, the Doctor invited Rose Tyler to travel with him, asking that she was sure before allowing her to enter his dangerous life. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Together the Doctor witnessed the final destruction of Earth, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and foiled alien threats alongside Charles Dickens (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and Harriet Jones. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nRose helped the Doctor to become a better version of himself – by his own admission – by challenging him. He was the product of war, fuelled by anger and revenge, (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) saving the world out of obligation, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) but bent on making someone pay for all this suffering. When he was brought face-to-face with the last surviving Dalek, the Doctor was made to confront his anger when Rose brought out a more human side to the Dalek. She stopped him from destroying the Dalek, to \"finish the job\" by assuring no survivors. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).\n\nAdam Mitchell briefly joined them, but was abandoned at home when he tried to use time travel for personal gain, (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) creating a powerful grudge which would lead to Adam's ultimate revenge. (COMIC: Mystery Date) Later, the Doctor and Rose met the time-travelling con artist Jack Harkness, who joined them in the TARDIS for the rest of their time together. Jack had experience as a Time Agent, (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and the Doctor would frequently remind him he was the one who made the plans. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Finally, their travels came to an abrupt end when the Doctor was intercepted by the Game Station in 200100, (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) where the Dalek Emperor had amassed a new Dalek fleet, having survived the Time War.\n\nIn the ensuing Battle of the Game Station, the Doctor manipulated Rose into getting sent back to London, where she'd be safe, and planned to use a Delta wave to destroy all proximal lifeforms, including humans. Unwilling to let her life with the Doctor go, Rose managed to pilot the TARDIS by looking into the heart of the TARDIS, becoming Bad Wolf. Rose showed the Doctor, even with all the power of time at her disposal, to favour life. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) The Doctor saw that she was \"so human\", (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and developed somewhat of a fascination with the human race in his next incarnation, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) a drastic change from the Ninth Doctor's early attitude. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWith the energy about to kill her, the Doctor took this power upon himself, forcing him to regenerate to survive. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) In his tenth incarnation, the Doctor continued travelling with Rose, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) until the Battle of Canary Wharf separated them, with Rose becoming trapped in a parallel universe. This was also the fall of Torchwood One, (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) the London branch of an organisation started by Queen Victoria to capture the Tenth Doctor, an enemy of the British Empire. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThe weight of being the last of their people still weighed heavily on the Tenth Doctor, (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) with the Moment branding him as \"the man who regrets\". Whilst the guilt of the Time War did drive him to do good, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) the War's legacy also emboldened him to recklessly callous behaviour at times. Donna Noble believed he needed someone by his side to tell him when to stop after witnessing his ruthless defeat of the Racnoss and getting him to stop, (TV: The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006).) saving his life in doing so. (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThough reluctant to take on companions after losing Rose, the Doctor took Martha Jones with him on a \"one trip\" basis after she saved his life. (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) The one trip soon became extended to multiple travels, and eventually he embraced her as a proper companion. (TV: The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) While travelling with Martha, the Tenth Doctor rediscovered the Master on Malcassairo, hiding out at the end of the universe as the human Professor Yana, under a Chameleon Arch. Regenerating by the hand of Chantho, the professor's faithful assistant, the new Master stole the Doctor's TARDIS (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and retrofitted it into a paradox machine. On Earth in the 2000s,[nb 1] the Master set himself up as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, taking the name Harold Saxon. (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nIn the Year That Never Was, the Master unveiled the Toclafane, (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) who was the final remnants of humanity, ripped from Professor Yana's planned journey to Utopia. (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He decimated the Earth's population, (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and sent the rest into hiding. While the Doctor was trapped on board the Valiant as the Master's prisoner, and made to show his years, Martha was tasked with spreading the word, travelling all around the Earth to tell people about the Doctor. When the time came, the combined power of humanity, sharing a single thought, amplified by the Master's own Archangel Network, restored the Doctor to full health.\n\nThe decommissioning of the paradox machine by Jack Harkness reversed time to the moment it was activated. The Doctor prepared to take the Master onboard, as he felt responsibility toward him, as \"the only two left\" among the Time Lords. However, Lucy Saxon, the Master's wife, shot him on board the Valiant, and the Master refused to regenerate, as a final act of rebellion to hurt the Doctor. (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nAfter Martha left of her own accord, (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) the Doctor reunited with Donna Noble, accepting her as a companion out of a desire for a mate without complications. (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) The pair travelled together for a time. Notably, the Doctor freed the Ood from centuries of servitude, restoring the telepathic Ood Brain which bound them together, (TV: Planet of the Ood [+]Keith Temple, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) leading to a Golden Age on the Ood Sphere. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) In Pompeii, Donna convinced the Doctor to save just one family, (TV: The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) teaching him an important lesson he would carry in his future travels. (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nAfter escaping a catastrophic parallel universe in which she had never met the Doctor, by travelling back in time to restore the timeline, ensuring she would turn left as before, Donna passed on a message from Rose Tyler, who had visited her world. The Doctor understood \"Bad Wolf\" to mean the end of the universe, (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and on visiting Earth, experienced its mysterious disappearance from right beneath the TARDIS. Earth had been stolen by Davros, and taken to the Medusa Cascade, where it would be used as part of a formation designed to power the Reality Bomb. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Doctor joined up with many of his former companions, including Sarah Jane Smith, to defeat Davros and the Daleks. He inadvertently created the Meta-Crisis Tenth Doctor when he channeled regeneration energy into his \"spare hand\", to avoid complete regeneration. In the process, Donna also achieved a partial biological meta-crisis, gaining access to her own version of the Doctor's mind. All the Doctor's allies, including the Meta-Crisis Tenth Doctor, was instrumental in ending this crisis. After leaving Davros and the Daleks to burn, the Doctor and his friends piloted the TARDIS to bring Earth back to its original co-ordinates. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nOne consequence of this whole affair was that the Doctor was forced to erase all of Donna's memories of their time together, in order to preserve her life. The Meta-Crisis Doctor was left on Pete's World with Rose Tyler, (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) with various sources disagreeing on all that followed for him. (PROSE: The Turning of the Tide, COMIC: Empire of the Wolf)\n\nIn light of Donna's fate, the Doctor resolved to travel alone to avoid further pain. (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) He took it upon himself to change history and save Adelaide Brooke from the Flood on Mars, even though her death was a fixed point in time. He burdened her with the task of influencing her granddaughter, Susie Fontana Brooke, to explore the stars, since Adelaide's death was originally her inspiration. With the Time Lords gone, he saw himself as the Time Lord Victorious, the victor, the decider of fates, no longer content to obey the Laws of Time, when he had the power — and perceived justification — to change things however he saw fit.\n\nAdelaide rejected the Doctor's new turn towards power, and killed herself on Earth, in order to restore the chain of events which would see humanity spread out (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) and outlive their home planet. (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Fleeing a summons from Ood Sigma he believed heralded his death, (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) the Doctor travelled to the Dark Times where he became embroiled in the Kotturuh crisis. He became convinced that stopping the Kotturuh spreading death would change the future for the better, eventually wiping them all out and reclaiming the title Time Lord Victorious. (PROSE: The Knight, The Fool and The Dead [+]Steve Cole, Time Lord Victorious (BBC Books, 2020).)\n\nIntervention by two of his previous selves, and an encounter with Inyit, who had become the last of the Kotturuh, showed the Tenth Doctor he had gone too far. This had devastating consequences. After stopping the Dalek Time Squad from exploiting the crisis he'd created to wipe out Gallifrey, he agreed to stop changing history and left the Dark Times. (PROSE: All Flesh is Grass [+]Una McCormack, Time Lord Victorious release order (BBC Books, 2020).)\n\nDreading his own demise, he distracted himself with more lighthearted destinations, still unwilling to let go. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) In the end, the Doctor learned there was no \"winning\", and that survival came at a cost. All he had done, all the terrible decisions he had had to make to reach the end of the Time War, strengthened his resolve to make sure \"no one else [would] ever have to feel this pain.\" (TV: The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) By the end of his twelfth incarnation, the Doctor understood that he did what he did only because it was kind, because it was the decent response to do what he could, to stand for others, no matter the consequences. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor saw his end saving Wilfred Mott, after preventing Rassilon from escaping the Time War and enacting his Final Sanction, which would rip the Time Vortex apart and leave only the Time Lords, ascendent, to become creatures of pure consciousness. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) When the time came, he revisited all his old companions, as his final reward, before regenerating, to become someone new again. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010)., Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).)\n\nIn his new incarnation, the Doctor crashed landed in Amelia Pond's garden and became intrigued by a crack in time in her wall. Promising he would come back, the Doctor took his TARDIS on a short trip to the near future, but arrived twelve years too late, gaining his new companion a premonitory monicker, \"the girl who waited\". In the intervening years, Amy had grown up, and lost faith in the Doctor's fairy tale. Together, the Doctor worked to stop Prisoner Zero and prevented the Atraxi from destroying the Earth in pursuing them. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nIntrigued by the idea that the crack in her wall might have eaten away at Amy's history, (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) the Doctor invited her on board, finally fulfilling his initial promise. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) The Doctor was later joined in the TARDIS by Rory Williams, whom she planned to marry on the following day, with all these adventures being contained within that final night. (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Together the Doctor encountered many more of these impossible cracks, and soon discovered that these was the result of an unimaginable explosion which would destroy the universe on 26 June 2010. (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nThe Doctor was lured into a trap by the Pandorica Alliance, along with River Song, in Roman Britain. Above Stonehenge, a large number of the Doctor's enemies, including Daleks, Cybermen, and Sontarans, had unified in an attempt to prevent the end of the universe — by containing the Doctor — reasoning it would be the Doctor's TARDIS at the heart of the explosion. Trapped within the Pandorica, the Doctor was unable to prevent what followed. River Song piloted the TARDIS, being dragged off course to the temporal explosion's coordinates. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Earth became the only remaining planet in the universe at the eye of the storm. The Doctor used a paradox to arrange his own release from the Pandorica, and soon devised a plan for \"rebooting\" the universe. In Big Bang Two, the preserved remains of the original universe was re-released like spores when he piloted the Pandorica right into the heart of the explosion. He was successful, but was erased from time himself in the process. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Seeing his own time stream reverse, he decided to take his leave on the night Amelia Pond began waiting for him. The Doctor resigned himself to becoming a story in a vague memory, long forgotten, somberly noting, \"We're all stories in the end.\" However, the Doctor was able to influence a young Amelia to remember him on her wedding night, and made his return to the universe. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nAccording to most records, the Doctor then \"died\" in his eleventh incarnation at 1103 years old on 22 April 2011, when River Song appeared in an astronaut suit and seemed to kill him, creating a fixed point in time. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) However, the Doctor avoided this death by having the Teselecta take on his form, tricking the universe into believing that the Doctor was dead. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) After this, the Doctor tried to \"lay low\" for a while, going as far as to delete himself from every database in the universe, (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) to soften the blow of the impact he had been having. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) He felt he had gotten \"too big\". (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nThe Doctor briefly \"retired\" from travelling and refused to take on companions, (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) after losing his long-time friends, Amy Pond and Rory Williams, (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) but began travelling with Clara Oswald, determined to uncover the mystery she represented. The Doctor had met Clara twice before, but she had led other lives, in other times and places. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nIn the original timeline, the Doctor's grave was on Trenzalore, where he died in a great battle. The Doctor was buried in his TARDIS. Instead of a body, the TARDIS contained the Doctor's time stream, manifesting as a column of light. The Great Intelligence forced the Eleventh Doctor to go to Trenzalore to open the TARDIS by speaking his name, ultimately uttered by the data ghost of River Song. The Great Intelligence entered the timestream to alter the Doctor's history, but the Doctor was saved by Clara, who scattered herself across his timeline, helping the Doctor many times in all his lives, and, in this account, even suggesting the Doctor's TARDIS over another as he first fled Gallifrey. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAfter believing for four hundred years that he had destroyed his own people, the Doctor finally learned the truth when the Moment united the War, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors in an effort to change the War Doctor's mind about destroying the Time Lords to save the universe.\n\nThis encounter gave the Doctor a new perspective on his war incarnation; he came to realise that the War Doctor was \"more the Doctor\" than any of them, as he was somehow the Doctor \"on the day it was impossible to get it right\". (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) Finally, the Doctor retained the knowledge that he had saved the Time Lords. The Doctor had this, at least, as he faced his approaching death on Trenzalore. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhen the Time Lords sent out a signal from Trenzalore, through the final crack in space-time, the Doctor answered the call, as so many others had. He survived through the Siege of Trenzalore, standing his ground in the town of Christmas for centuries, and protecting it against the likes of the Daleks, Cybermen, Weeping Angels, and Sontarans.\n\nFinally, he was granted a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor was ready to lose to the Daleks, as he had grown old and weary, and had no more lives left, but found a new lease of life, and, remembering what he thought of \"the rules\", wiped them out with his regeneration energy. In doing so, he changed the future. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor regenerated in his TARDIS and began his new regeneration cycle, pausing beforehand to call Clara Oswald at a later point in time, to remind her this new Doctor was still him, and would need her help. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).; The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) The Doctor's relationship with Clara deepened, and he began to feel responsible for her, frequently mentioning a \"duty of care\", (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) echoing Clara's own use of this term to describe her responsibility for her students. (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nHe worried she would be hurt if the Doctor continued to be reckless, (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and when she died, having put her life in danger for a chance to save Rigsy, (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) the Doctor spent billions of years in an effective teleportation-aided time loop, trapped in his own confession dial, mourning over her. (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) The Doctor was expected to reveal his secrets, and was placed in the confession dial by the Time Lords, who sought to find out what he knew of the Hybrid. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nRather than give in, he continually engineered the circumstances so that, on the next loop, he would again punch the azbantium crystal wall – 400 times the strength of a diamond, and 20 feet thick – which would be his way out. (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Each time, the cycle killed him, but he fought for the chance to rescue Clara from her demise, and would not give in. (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) In the end, he ruptured the wall, and walked through onto his home planet Gallifrey. (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nHere, he took over and deposed Rassilon, whom he sent into exile, building on the respect and trust the War Doctor had built with his compatriots during the Time War. Finally, he manipulated the General into bringing Clara back from the moment before her death, and caused him to regenerate while the Doctor escaped. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Taking her to the end of the universe, the Doctor finally realised that the lengths he had gone to, to bring Clara back even after losing her for good, showed how dangerous this relationship had become. The Doctor agreed that one of them should be made to forget the other. In the end, the Doctor's memories of Clara was erased. Afterwards, Clara went her own way, taking her own TARDIS with her. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor was given guardianship of the Vault, containing Missy as prisoner, after he made an oath to protect the chamber for a thousand years. (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He took to teaching at St Luke's University, becoming known for his fascinating but off-book lectures on a variety of topics. (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Earth-bound once more, he was joined by Nardole, who often reminded him of his duties, (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and eventually took on Bill Potts as her private tutor, seeing something in her which he thought the Doctor could build together. Bill became interested in his real life, and he began taking her on trips in the TARDIS. (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Doctor's hope for a better relationship with Missy eventually overcame his mistrust for her, and he began allowing her to leave the Vault and remain within the TARDIS, performing maintenance duties. (TV: The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Missy had committed at the start to learning how to become \"good\", (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and she claimed she was trying to change for the better. (TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He wanted to believe the Doctor could be friends again. (TV: The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) The Doctor sent Missy out with his companions, Bill and Nardole, on a trial adventure, so she could prove herself. The Doctor arrived on a Mondasian colony ship heading toward a black hole. Bill was fatally wounded, and taken below decks, where Missy's previous self, the Saxon Master made sure she was converted into a Cyberman. Due to time dilation, the Doctor arrived too late, (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and faced an army of Cybermen alongside the two Masters. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nMissy intended to join the Doctor in his last stand, but never made it, as she was fatally shot by the Master, whom she killed in turn. The Twelfth Doctor met his end in his last stand for kindness, attempting against all odds to save those around him. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He regenerated after meeting the First Doctor, who helped him realise he should always carry on, even if it meant becoming someone new. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nNow in a female form, the Doctor met three new friends, Ryan Sinclair, Graham O'Brien and Yasmin Khan, in Sheffield. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) Calling themselves Team TARDIS, the Doctor travelled with her newfound family for a time, facing up against the Stenza Tzim-Sha, (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) the Daleks, (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) and a new incarnation of the Master. She found that the Master had ravaged Gallifrey. Though she had tried to keep her past behind her, sharing almost nothing about herself with her new friends, (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) the Doctor was soon confronted with a mysterious past incarnation of herself, whom she did not remember, (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and found herself back on Gallifrey, where the Master revealed the secret of the Timeless Child. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nThe Doctor learned that her story was not her own, that she was once the child that Tecteun used as template for the Time Lords, and in fact came from somewhere beyond the Boundary, rather than Gallifrey. The Timeless Child, later the Doctor, was involved with the Division, who robbed them of their memories, from before the Doctor became the First Doctor. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nThe Doctor grappled with these revelations, and resolved questions of her identity during another battle with the Daleks on Earth: she was the Doctor, the person she had chosen to become. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) She continued to investigate the Division in her travels. During the Flux incident, in which space itself threatened to come undone, the Ravagers returned, to play their part in unravelling time. At the Temple of Atropos, the Doctor learned the role she had played in ending the Dark Times. Within her time stream, the Doctor relived the Siege of Atropos from the Fugitive Doctor's point of view. (TV: Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021).) Finally, she was recalled to Division Control by the Weeping Angel Extraction Squad, (TV: Village of the Angels [+]Chris Chibnall and Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) and met a new incarnation of Tecteun. She expressed anger at her newfound guardian for having stolen her away, believing that she might have lived a whole other life as the Timeless Child if not for Tecteun and Gallifrey. (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nTecteun revealed that the Flux was her design, intended to end this universe whilst the Division crossed over into another, specifically in order to quell the Doctor's influence on the multiverse. She also showed the Doctor the biodata module containing her stolen memories, before being killed by Swarm, who had infiltrated their base. (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) Swarm showed the Doctor inside her lost memories, but wrought destruction on what remained, out of revenge. Afterwards, the Doctor narrowly averted the endtimes by teaming up with her splintered selves. Swarm and Azure attempted to offer her up as a sacrifice to Time, but as the Doctor had failed, Time took them, instead. Taking the Doctor's form, the embodiment of Time gave warning to the Doctor, telling her to \"beware the forces that mass against [her]\". (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nTime's prophecy was fulfilled when the Master revealed his survival and worked with the Daleks and Cybermen in an elaborate trap for the Doctor. Using technology pilfered from Gallifrey, he used a forced regeneration to take the Doctor's body and identity for himself. From within the subconscious the Thirteenth Doctor resisted his takeover, encouraged by manifestations of past Doctors in the form of Guardians of the Edge. With the aid of an AI hologram the Doctor had designed for a scenario where she'd died, Yaz worked with Vinder to force the Master to reverse the process. After the Doctor saw to the ruination of his allies' plans, the wounded Master caught up with her and exploited the Qurunx to strike a final fatal blow. Parting ways with Yaz, the Thirteenth Doctor regenerated alone. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nThe new Doctor was shocked to find himself identical in appearance to the Tenth Doctor. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) Donna Noble later reasoned that returning to that face and his subsequent encounter with her was the Doctor telling himself to \"come home\" to recover from the centuries of hardship he had experienced. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Setting off to see what the universe had in store for him, he first discovered the Dalek Dome, (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) unwittingly influenced the genesis of the Daleks, (TV: Destination: Skaro [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2023).) and encountered the Sycorax again. (PROSE: Under Control)\n\nEventually, the Doctor found himself in London in 2023 where he was reunited by chance with Donna Noble and her family, just as the Doctor was embroiled in the arrival of the Meep on Earth. The Doctor was forced to undo the memory block to allow Donna to help him stop the Meep's ship destroying London, but discovered the meta-crisis had been split between her and her daughter, preventing her from dying. The Doctor took Donna back to the TARDIS so the Doctor could go to her grandad Wilf however she spilt coffee on the console, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) sending the ship careening out of control to the edge of the universe. There the Doctor encountered the Not-things, during which the Doctor invoked a superstition to try to hold them back. After the Doctor escaped, the Doctor feared this action at the edge of reality may have had greater consequences. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nReturning to Earth, the Doctor found the Toymaker on the loose there and driving humanity mad, and feared it had been his own actions at the edge of the universe which had drawn the entity into reality. Facing him in a game, the Doctor lost however cited the rule of best of three for a rematch, as he'd beaten the Toymaker once before. The Toymaker complied but later decided it must involve another incarnation of the Doctor, so used UNIT's Galvanic beam to mortally wound the Doctor. Instead of regenerating however, the Fourteenth Doctor underwent a mythical bi-generation into the Fifteenth Doctor, with the two Doctors existing as separate entities. Together the Doctors beat the Toymaker in a final game of catch, with the Fourteenth Doctor using his reward to banish the Toymaker from reality. Afterwards the Fifteenth Doctor used remnants of the Toymaker's power to claim his prize by duplicating the TARDIS, enabling the Fourteenth Doctor to take the opportunity to retire on Earth with Donna's family to heal himself properly, whilst he set out for further adventures throughout time and space. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nDiscovering Goblins active on 21st century Earth, the Fifteenth Doctor learnt their alternative science of ropes and coincidence and that their activities centred on Ruby Sunday. After preventing the goblins rewriting history to kidnap Ruby as a baby, the Doctor invited her aboard the TARDIS. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor was apparently succeeded by further incarnations, though accounts of these Doctors greatly varied and diverged.\n\nEventually, in an incident even more \"strange\" than the many \"adventures and experiences\" leading up to it, Dr Who arrived at the point in Infinity-Eternity where he found the \"final goal\" for which he had always been searching. (PROSE: Who is Dr Who? [+]The Dr Who Annual 1966 (The Dr Who Annual 1966, World Distributors, 1965).)\n\nBy regenerating, the Doctor's personality and outer form changed greatly over time, though all of their incarnations was essentially the same person, retaining the memories, curiosity, eccentricity, and wisdom of the ones before.\n\nBy one account, the Doctor was the Timeless Child, and so the Doctor once had the ability to regenerate an indefinite number of times before their memory was redacted and their regenerations limited to the customary Time Lord limit of twelve. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nUnder their chosen name as \"the Doctor\", the Doctor regenerated at least sixteen times by the time of the Fifteenth Doctor. (PROSE: First Day of the Doctor [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (Penguin Group, 2023). Page 31.) Though the Doctor's first thirteen incarnations appeared male, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) at least three incarnations of the Doctor appeared to be women. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018)., TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) In fact, Clive Finch's research revealed that some incarnations of the Doctor was also \"in-between [male and female] or neither\". (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nDespite appearances, the Eighth Doctor firmly denied ever having been a man or a woman, on two occasions, (PROSE: Interference - Book One [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., Beltempest [+]Jim Mortimore, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) as did the Thirteenth Doctor. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).)\n\nWith regards to the Timeless Child, even the Doctor had no idea how many lives had been lost, nor had any sense of their identities. (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) Of those recorded, some of the Doctor's earliest known incarnations as the Timeless Child also presented as young women, including their first, second, third and sixth selves. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nEach incarnation of the Doctor developed their own personal style, and differed in opinion and manner, but certain constants remained. For instance, though particular taste in fashion did change with each Doctor, one more-or-less constant within the Doctor's wardrobe was a coat or jacket, incorporated into an outfit, (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Power of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966)., Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982)., The Twin Dilemma [+]Anthony Steven, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984)., Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996)., Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) or worn as an extra layer, like a trench coat. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) Several incarnations also had particular interest in hats, with special regards to their second, fourth and eleventh incarnations. (TV: The Power of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966)., Robot [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1974-1975)., The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., etc.)\n\nThe Doctor's known incarnations are described below:\n\nA number of other incarnations have been chronicled; however, where the Doctor fall within the Doctor's lifetime is unclear:\n\nBeyond the incarnations who existed at unclear parts of the Doctor's timeline, there existed other individuals across the universe and beyond who met the Doctor's description, attitude, or actions.\n\nDue to the Doctor's many adventures it was sometimes unclear as to which incarnation of the Doctor experienced them. Some of these adventures include:\n\nDue to the unique structure of their biology, the Doctor had the ability to regenerate, to \"cheat death\". (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) A Time Lord was usually limited to twelve regenerations. (TV: The Deadly Assassin [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 14 (BBC1, 1976)., Mawdryn Undead [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983)., Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) The High Council of the Time Lords could influence regenerations, treating them as punishment (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) and reward. (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983)., Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) At times, enemies coveted the Doctor's future regenerations and tried to take them for their own. (TV: Mawdryn Undead [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983)., Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996)., Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)./The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nThe effect of regeneration on the Doctor in the time immediately following the event varied from incarnation to incarnation. In some cases, the Doctor regained their faculties quickly, erratic behaviour notwithstanding. (TV: The Power of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966)., The Twin Dilemma [+]Anthony Steven, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984)., The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) On one occasion when the regenerative process was postponed for a long time, he was rendered amnesiac. (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) In most cases, the Doctor was incapacitated for a period of time before ultimately recovering. (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Robot [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1974-1975)., Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982)., Time and the Rani [+]Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 24 (BBC1, 1987)., The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) There was also rare cases where the Doctor was able to delay regeneration from setting in for an extended period of time. The Tenth Doctor once did such to visit all of his past companions - though, after the long delay, the resulting energy release was catastrophic for the TARDIS. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010)., Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).)\n\nAfter gaining a new regenerative cycle, the Twelfth Doctor did something similar while trying to decide whether or not to regenerate. He called this period \"a state of grace\" where the Time Lord within the state would be briefly restored to health before weakening and must choose to either regenerate or die. Like the Tenth Doctor, the Twelfth Doctor's regeneration was highly explosive as a result. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) In contrast, the First Doctor's regeneration into the Second Doctor, despite having delayed his regeneration like the Tenth and Twelfth Doctors, was not explosive at all. (TV: The Tenth Planet [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).) However, the Twelfth Doctor did delay the change further after the First Doctor left, (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) and the Tenth Doctor delayed it longer than the Twelfth, having managed to visit every single one of his previous companions before changing. (TV: Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).)\n\nDue to the regeneration into the War Doctor and the Tenth Doctor's aborted regeneration, the Eleventh Doctor was actually the Doctor's last incarnation until the Time Lords gifted him with a new regenerative cycle at the end of that life. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) It was unclear exactly how many regenerations he was given, the Twelfth Doctor stated that he himself was not sure and didn't rule out the possibility that his new cycle could be infinite as he stated he could now possibly regenerate forever. (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Indeed, Rassilon, while threatening the Twelfth Doctor with his gauntlet, remarked to him \"how many regenerations did we grant you? I've got all night,\" (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and when all of the incarnations, past and future, of the Doctor teamed up to help preserve Gallifrey from disaster as it slipped into a parallel pocket universe at the end of the Last Great Time War, there was enough of them that the sky was filled with \"a blizzard of blue boxes\". (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor also reflected that, over his lives, his regenerations had grown more destructive and volcanic; as he warned the First Doctor, the Eleventh Doctor's regeneration into him was powerful enough to wipe out an entire Dalek Fleet. (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time) The Thirteenth Doctor later learned that she was originally the Timeless Child, a being from another unknown universe or dimension with the ability to regenerate an indefinite number of times. Along with the Doctor's memories of their lives prior to the First Doctor being redacted, the Doctor's ability to regenerate appeared to have been reduced to that of a normal Time Lord (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) which meant the Eleventh Doctor had to receive a second regeneration cycle from the Time Lords in order to continue living. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor would later regenerate into another new incarnation while alone in the TARDIS. (PROSE: Contents)\n\nAn interesting aspect of the Doctor's personality was that the Doctor occasionally expressed a personal liking or disliking for particular incarnations, though this opinion depended on the incarnation making the assessment. The Doctor's tenth incarnation expressed a deep fondness for his fifth incarnation, (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) and slight disdain for his ninth, considering him unnecessarily violent. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) The Twelfth Doctor was obviously flattered when he believed, incorrectly, that his companion was romantically involved with a fellow teacher he considered to bear a resemblance to his eleventh incarnation. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) The Fifth Doctor was disliked by his immediate successor. (TV: The Twin Dilemma [+]Anthony Steven, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).)\n\nIn another instance, the Fourth Doctor made reference to the Third Doctor, saying, \"Some people liked it, but I prefer this one.\" (TV: The Brain of Morbius [+]Robin Bland, Doctor Who season 13 (BBC1, 1976).) The Twelfth Doctor told his first incarnation that \"there [was] a few false starts [before becoming him], but you get there in the end\". (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) The Seventh Doctor was also annoyed when he had to work with the Fifth Doctor, seeing him as \"not even one of the good ones\". The Fifth Doctor was equally disgusted by what he would become. (PROSE: Cold Fusion [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) The Fifth Doctor also stated after meeting his past selves that he was not the man he had been - and \"thank goodness for that!\". (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) Immediately before his regeneration, the Tenth Doctor stated, \"I don't want to go\", showing he had become attached to his current self. Immediately after his twelfth regeneration, the Eleventh Doctor remarked upon his new nose, stating that, \"I've had worse\" — possibly a reference to multiple incarnations, including his third, who was once described as a \"long-shanked fellow with a mighty nose\". (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010)., The Time Warrior [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1973-1974).) The Eleventh Doctor also at one point expressed loathing for his first incarnation's initial personality, considering himself at that time a foolish and arrogant liar and a selfish coward. (COMIC: Hunters of the Burning Stone [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2013).)\n\nBefore learning the true outcome of the Time War, the Eleventh Doctor expressed an even greater hate for the \"War Doctor\" whose actions was so shameful that he went against \"the name of the Doctor\" and not counting him among his incarnations. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Both the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors however forgave their war incarnation and honoured him as being the Doctor more than any of his incarnations once the Doctor learnt the real result of the Time War. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe First Doctor, even as his ailing body began the regenerative process, tried to hold back the change, maintaining that he had \"the courage and the right to live and die as [him]self.\" However, he confided to the Twelfth Doctor that he was motivated by fear, being \"very, very afraid.\" After learning who he would become and witnessing his future self save Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart, the Doctor decided that he was ready and so completed his first regeneration. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017)., The Tenth Planet [+]Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966).)\n\nThe Second Doctor's view on the prospect of changing was influenced by the fact that it was the Time Lords who forced him to do so, protesting that the Doctor could not do so without consulting him. Though he was provided with a selection of faces from which to choose from, the Doctor rejected all of them, which he attributed to being \"very particular\". (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969)., COMIC: The Night Walkers [+]Roger Noel Cook, TVC comic stories (Polystyle Publications, Ltd., 1969).)\n\nAfter confronting the Great One, the dying Third Doctor explained to Sarah Jane Smith that facing his fear was more important than \"just going on living\", only managing to regenerate with the assistance of K'anpo Rimpoche. (TV: Planet of the Spiders [+]Robert Sloman, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).) Earlier, he was unfazed to know that he would regenerate. (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).)\n\nGravely wounded after falling from the Pharos Project telescope, the Fourth Doctor was content to regenerate, assuring his present companions that it was \"the end, but the moment has been prepared for\" before he merged with the Watcher to regenerate into the Fifth Doctor. (TV: Logopolis [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).)\n\nWhen both he and Peri Brown contracted the lethal spectrox toxaemia, the Fifth Doctor, left with only enough of the queen bat's milk to cure one of them, selflessly used it to cure Peri, unsure as to whether the affliction would even allow him to regenerate. Nevertheless, he entered and completed the regenerative process, with his former companions urging him not to die. (TV: The Caves of Androzani [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).)\n\nHaving been exposed to radiation deadly to Time Lords, the Sixth Doctor believed that he was to finally die until he heard the voice of the Seventh Doctor. Feeling the change coming, the dying Doctor was assured that he would indeed regenerate, confident that his future was \"in safe hands\". (AUDIO: The Brink of Death)\n\nAfter spending some time avoiding getting involved in the Last Great Time War, the dying Eighth Doctor requested that the Sisterhood of Karn make him a warrior, with Ohila providing a potion for him to drink before he regenerated into the War Doctor. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) She would later claim that the drink she gave him was just lemonade and dry ice, and her \"moment of theatre\" was simply an act to trick him into regenerating. (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nFeeling the regenerative process start as his body was \"wearing a bit thin\", the War Doctor, having just saved Gallifrey, was content as he regenerated into the Ninth Doctor. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) Likewise, the Ninth Doctor felt the same as his regeneration neared, taking the time to joke about what he may become and assuring both Rose Tyler and himself that the Doctor was \"fantastic\". (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nIn contrast, the Tenth Doctor hesitated to change. Mortally wounded by a Dalek during the 21st century Dalek invasion of Earth, (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) the Doctor regenerated to heal himself but used his severed hand to siphon of the rest of his regeneration energy before he could change, rhetorically asking Rose why would he want to do so, he added \"look at me\". (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Nevertheless, this still counted as the Doctor's eleventh regeneration, and the Eleventh Doctor would attribute this instance of regenerating but keeping the same face to \"vanity issues\". (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nLater, the Doctor became aware of his impending death after seeing Ood Sigma (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) and so moved to avoid it by traveling. He confided to Wilfred Mott that even to regenerate would feel like dying, that he would be dead while \"some new man [went] sauntering away\". Ultimately, the prophecy was fulfilled when Wilf knocked four times from a locked booth which was to be flooded with radiation. Distraught, the Doctor bemoaned his fate while Wilf told him to go, noting that he was an old man who had his time. Agreeing with Wilf's assessment, the Doctor raged that the human was \"not remotely important\" whereas he \"could do so much more\". Ultimately, the Doctor still absorbed the radiation in Wilf's stead, sustaining fatal damage. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) After spending some time looking back on all his old companions, (TV: Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).) the Doctor's injury caught up with him and he returned to the TARDIS where, in tears, he gave his last words \"I don't want to go.\" before regenerating. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) In an alternative timeline envisioned by a continuity bomb, instead of sacrificing himself, the Doctor let Wilfred die in the radiation chamber of the Immortality Gate, viewing himself to be \"more valuable to the universe\", though he regretted his choice and broke down in tears immediately afterwards. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor did not share the outlook of his predecessor, though it should be noted that for the majority of life he believed that he was the \"last Doctor\", having expended all his regenerations. (AUDIO: Regeneration Impossible) Finding himself speak briefly with the voice of the Tenth Doctor, the Doctor's Ganger cried out \"No, let it go, we've moved on!\" (TV: The Almost People [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Hearing the Tenth Doctor comment that he did not want to go to Trenzalore, where the Doctor was said to have died, the Eleventh Doctor made light of his last words when he told Clara Oswald that \"he always [said] that.\" (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) At the end of his life on Trenzalore, the Doctor was enabled to regenerate again after being provided with additional regeneration energy \"love from Gallifrey\". After making a phone call to a near future version of Clara, convincing her to stay and help the newly regenerated Twelfth Doctor, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Eleventh Doctor was content to change as he spoke to the present Clara:\n\nAfter being mortally wounded in the Battle of Floor 0507, the Twelfth Doctor held back his regeneration, having grown tired of \"being somebody else\". (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Even after being brought into contact with the similarly-minded First Doctor, whose hesitance to change took him by surprise, the Twelfth Doctor was still prepared to die until he was challenged by the glass avatar of his former companion, Bill Potts. Realising that everybody was \"important to somebody, somewhere\", the Doctor, after saving the life of Lethbridge-Stewart, returned to his TARDIS where, acknowledging that the universe still needed saving, he conceded that one more lifetime \"wouldn't kill anyone\", \"well, except me.\" After addressing his forthcoming incarnation, the Doctor gave his last words \"Doctor, I let you go.\" before finally regenerating. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThough she longed for more time, the Thirteenth Doctor was more accepting of the coming change, holding the process back only to have a final trip with Yaz. Wishing that she could see what happened next, in her final words, she told the next Doctor \"tag, you're it\". (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nWhen the Fourteenth Doctor regenerated, he expressed an acceptance to its occurrence, remarking to Donna Noble that the process did not mean he would die; he did not resist and allowed it to begin quickly. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nOn occasion, the Doctor performed acts that was expected to have an impact on future incarnations. Once, in order to recharge the TARDIS, the Tenth Doctor transferred some of his life energy, an act he acknowledged shortened his lifespan (and, by extension, the life of his ultimate final incarnation) by ten years. (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Later, the Twelfth Doctor gave up some of his regeneration energy to revive Davros, (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) as did the Eleventh Doctor to heal River Song's wrist; (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) when River Song did something similar to save the Eleventh Doctor's life, it was stated that doing so cost her the ability to regenerate. (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Indeed, River pointed out to the Eleventh Doctor that he had wasted regeneration energy. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor, after becoming blind, once created a device capable of borrowing eyesight from a future version of his current incarnation, but at the possible cost of being permanently blinded or having all possibility of future regeneration disabled; however, this took place in a computer-generated simulation, so the result of this action on his future incarnations never occurred. (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nBeyond their capacity to regenerate, the Doctor had many abilities, all of which came in handy at one point or another, when faced with unforeseen challenges. In almost all circumstances, the Doctor was adept at analysing, assessing and quickly responding when new dangers arose. This included understanding the balance of power, and weighing up different options which might tip this balance in their favour. (TV: Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nEven before the Doctor took on the name \"the Doctor\", the Doctor \"always was fast at processing everything\". (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) The Doctor was also quick to deduce their whereabouts, so long as the Doctor had something to anchor a hypothesis. By smell alone, the Tenth Doctor could identify the 1920s. (TV: The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) The Doctor could also smell out paradoxes. (COMIC: Defender of the Daleks) The Doctor was a master manipulator, strategist, scientist and trickster in all their incarnations, able to devise and improvise many schemes to defeat adversaries or spin impossible situations to their advantage and achieve victory. (TV: The Three Doctors [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 10 (BBC1, 1972-1973)., Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAs a Time Lord, the Doctor had a respiratory bypass system, which allowed them to hold their breath for an extended period of time, in order to survive strangulation or (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Pyramids of Mars [+]Stephen Harris, Doctor Who season 13 (BBC1, 1975).) suffocation, (TV: The Caves of Androzani [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984)., Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and to avoid drowning. (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nEven in the vacuum of space, the Doctor could survive far longer than a human, (TV: Four to Doomsday [+]Terence Dudley, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982)., Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) though this left the Twelfth Doctor blinded. (TV: Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Doctor also had a binary vascular system, with two hearts. (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) This meant that many attempts to kill them by stopping their heart was unsuccessful. Though the Doctor had trouble with just one heart, their second heart could be resuscitated again, to restore full health, so long as one heartbeat remained. (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nThe Doctor is highly intelligent throughout their incarnations, with the Thirteenth Doctor once claiming to have an understanding of \"pretty much everything\". (COMIC: A New Beginning [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2018-2019).) The Doctor are regarded as a scientist all their lives (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).), especially when serving as a scientific advisor to UNIT. (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., etc.) The Second Doctor successfully convinced an Ice Warrior to spare his life by claiming to be a genius. (TV: The Seeds of Death [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) The Tenth Doctor told John Lumic that he would call him a genius \"except I'm in the room\", (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and told Professor Yana on Malcassairo that he didn't have many chances to say this to others. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nCassandra O'Brien.Δ17 had reason to believe the Ninth Doctor was the \"school swot\". (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) This same Doctor was also described by the Editor to have infinite knowledge. (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) While recalling an incident in which he escaped death at the hands of Android Assassins, Missy described the Doctor as a swot. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nThe Abzorbaloff valued the Tenth Doctor's experience and knowledge, and sought to absorb him to acquire it. (TV: Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) The Eleventh Doctor once declared that he knew many things about the universe from living a long life, including secrets that must never be told and knowledge that must never be spoken. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor claimed he could speak five billion languages. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) The Fourteenth Doctor later claimed he could speak 57 billion 205 languages. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) The Doctor liked speaking English, (TV: The Mind Robber [+]Peter Ling, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1968).) always with an accent that was similar to accents used in the British Isles. (TV: An Unearthly Child [+]Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963)., The Power of the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966)., Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Robot [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1974-1975)., Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) This accent changed from incarnation to incarnation. For example, both the Seventh (TV: Time and the Rani [+]Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 24 (BBC1, 1987).) and the Twelfth Doctor (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) spoke with an accent similar to one used in Scotland. Rose Tyler noted the accent of the Ninth Doctor made him sound like he came from \"the north\", (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) while Harriet Jones described it as \"a northern accent\", (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) both of them referring to the north of England. The Doctor once retorted to Rose that \"lots of planets have a north\". (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) American Grace Holloway once told a San Franciscan policeman that the Eighth Doctor was \"British\". (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).)\n\nThe Doctor could read and write Old High Gallifreyan, (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) a skill unusual even among Time Lords. (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).) The Doctor also spoke the language of the Judoon, (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Delphon (a language \"spoken\" using only eyebrow movements), (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) several Chinese languages, (TV: The Mind of Evil [+]Don Houghton, Doctor Who season 8 (BBC1, 1971)., The Talons of Weng-Chiang [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 14 (BBC1, 1977).) Ancient North Martian, (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) Venusian, (TV: The Curse of Peladon [+]Brian Hayles, Doctor Who season 9 (BBC1, 1972).) Vietnamese, (PROSE: Interesting Times) Portuguese (TV: Black Orchid [+]Terence Dudley, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) and Tritovore. (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) The Doctor knew at least some Sycoraxic (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) and a language of Tiaanamat, which sounded like canine barking to human ears. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) The Second Doctor did not seem to understand French, (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) but later became fluent in it across several periods of French history. (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) The Doctor also claimed to speak \"sabre-toothed tiger\", (PROSE: Sick Building [+]Paul Magrs, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).) \"baby\", (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) \"cat\", (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) \"horse\" (TV: A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) and \"dinosaur\". (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) The Eleventh Doctor claimed that he \"spoke everything\". (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) The Doctor once understood British Sign Language; by their twelfth incarnation, though, the Doctor had lost the skill, saying that it had been \"deleted\" and replaced with semaphore. (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) The Tenth Doctor claimed to never have learnt to speak Welsh, but did carry a pocket Gallifreyan-Cymraeg phrasebook on at least one occasion when he visited Arcopolis. (PROSE: The Eyeless [+]Lance Parkin, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2008).)\n\nRose Tyler at one point believed that the Doctor was a \"one-off\" across the multiverse, (AUDIO: The Last Party of Earth) due to the fact that she could find no trace of them in several parallel universes she had visited. (AUDIO: The Endless Night, The Flood, Ghost Machines). The exception to this was Pete’s World, owing to the arrival of the Meta-Crisis Doctor (TV: Journey’s End), and a world where the Tenth Doctor died before he could regenerate while stopping the Racnoss (TV: Turn Left). However, other accounts showed the Doctor did have many counterparts in other universes across the multiverse or even omniverse. (COMIC: The Glorious Dead [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2000)., PROSE: Spiral Scratch [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005)., AUDIO: The Library in the Body [+]James Goss, The Unbound Universe (The New Adventures of Bernice Summerfield, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) The Seventh Doctor's companion Ace once speculated that his parallel selves was the closest thing the Doctor had to a family. (COMIC: Final Genesis [+]Warwick Gray, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics, 1993).)\n\nAdditionally, the Doctor's time stream was constantly shifting, alongside the palimpsest universe among them; this meant that even the \"prime\" Doctor's time-stream encompassed many alternative versions of their history, whom the Doctor could sometimes remember. (PROSE: The Infinity Doctors [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Books (1998)., Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) A version of the Seventh Doctor who appeared not to have regenerated acknowledged time streams could be funny things, believing it was all a matter of perspective. (TV: The Curse of Fenric [+]Pete McTighe, Tales of the TARDIS (BBC iPlayer, 2023).)\n\nIn his observations of the universe's past and future changing, Omega claimed to have seen an infinite number of Doctors.\n\nIn an altered state of reality, the Doctor, who resembled a short-haired version of the Eighth Doctor, returned to living on Gallifrey where he married and taught at the Academy. Years after his wife died, this Doctor organised a peace conference to resolve the Rutan-Sontaran War, during which the Effect was discovered by the Time Lords. Investigating the Effect led this Doctor to encounter Omega and he subsequently thwarted his attempt to escape the anti-matter universe and seize the Eye of Harmony's singularity. Afterwards the Doctor resolved to leave Gallifrey. During these events the Doctor experienced a vision (PROSE: The Infinity Doctors [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Books (1998).) which was somehow shared by the Eighth Doctor. (PROSE: Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nIn some time streams the Seventh Doctor did not regenerate, living into his old age. One such version of the Seventh Doctor was brought to the Memory TARDIS. (TV: The Curse of Fenric [+]Pete McTighe, Tales of the TARDIS (BBC iPlayer, 2023).)\n\nIn an alternate timeline visited by Siblings Same and Different the Doctor's TARDIS was possessed by a malevolent hunger, forcing the Doctor to rally an army to hunt and destroy the TARDIS. The two eventually slayed one another in the light of a dying sun. (PROSE: The Paradox Moon [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (BBC Children's Books, 2020).)\n\nDuring the Time War, the Barber-Surgeon claimed to have encountered a Doctor who remembered a different past to that recalled by the War Doctor. According to the Barber-Surgeon, this Doctor had different recollections of his first meeting with Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, (AUDIO: The Horror [+]Robert Valentine, He Who Fights With Monsters (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2022).) which matched one account of the event claiming it had begun with a car crash at Barnes Common. (PROSE: Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks [+]David Whitaker, adapted from The Daleks (Terry Nation), Target novelisations (Frederick Muller Ltd, 1964).)\n\nAmong the alternate timelines contained within the Axis, two alternative Doctors was known to exist on alternative Gallifreys. (AUDIO: Disassembled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., Forever [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) One lived on a Gallifrey where the Temporal Intervention Agency freely interfered in the affairs of other people and planets. This Doctor ran away but was later caught and tried, being reintegrated into Gallifreyan society and reaching the position of Lord Burner. (AUDIO: Disassembled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Another was known as Theta Sigma and lived on a Gallifrey where time travel had never been achieved, working as a commentator. (AUDIO: Forever [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn at least two parallel universes, the Doctor was a fictional character in a television series called Doctor Who. These universes was visited by the Eighth and Eleventh Doctors. (COMIC: TV Action!, The Girl Who Loved Doctor Who)\n\nIn one reality, the TV show Doctor Who was cancelled before being broadcast, with its would-be creator later going mad and believing himself to be the Doctor. (AUDIO: Deadline)\n\nSome versions of the Doctor had lives which echoed the N-Space Doctor's while having no obvious point of connection. For example, the Third Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith visited a parallel universe where the Doctor encountered identical counterparts of themselves who was criminals with no knowledge of time travel. The Doctor of this world did go by the name of \"the Doctor\", and resembled the Third Doctor, but seemed to be a human, having no knowledge of time-travel, the TARDIS, or extraterrestrials. (COMIC: Who's Who?) The Eighth Doctor glimpsed many alternative versions of himself while in the Omniversal Spectrum, including Doc Gallifrey, Tardis Tails, Quiquaequod, Theta Stigma, Joe Smith and a counterpart who was a cyborg. (COMIC: The Glorious Dead [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2000).)\n\nIn one parallel universe, (COMIC: Fire and Brimstone) the Doctor was the secret child of Ulysses and Annalisse. This Doctor was named President of the Time Lords by his grandfather, Barusa, however his half-brother the Master seized the title due to a lack of proof of the Doctor's heritage, forcing the Doctor to embark on a search for his missing father. (PROSE: The Chronicles of Doctor Who?)\n\nIn one parallel universe, Gallifreyan history was different, marked by Auld Mortality whose incarnation in the Doctor's era was Quences, (AUDIO: Auld Mortality) instead of the equivalent figure in N-Space, the Other, whose modern-day reincarnation was the Doctor. (PROSE: Lungbarrow [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Lungbarrow, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) This world's version of the First Doctor was an author who was delayed in leaving Gallifrey due to the machinations of Quences. (AUDIO: Auld Mortality) Before his granddaughter joined him, the Doctor's travels saw him frequently alter Earth's history. (AUDIO: A Storm of Angels)\n\nIn another parallel universe, a more ruthless Doctor became stranded on Earth in 2039 after losing his TARDIS on the DEEP. When the Doctor began trying to reclaim his TARDIS, he was shot by his surrogate daughter Ruth Mills after she discovered that he had killed her biological father. The Doctor regenerated into a new body only for Ruth to kill that incarnation as well, a pattern she swore to repeat as long as was necessary. (AUDIO: Full Fathom Five) Similarly, in one parallel universe, Kate Stewart knew the Doctor as a man who went about annihilating \"pathetic, pacifist aliens\". (AUDIO: False Negative)\n\nIn one universe, the Doctor was known as the Pilgrim. In another, the Doctor was known as the Wanderer. (AUDIO: The Key To Key To Time [+]Tim Foley, Destiny (Doctor of War, Big Finish Productions, 2022).)\n\nHowever, other alternative Doctors' lives branched off directly from particular point in the conventional Doctor's lifetime. Another of the timelines seen by the Eighth Doctor was one where he accepted Grace Holloway's offer to live with him on Earth as a couple, (COMIC: The Glorious Dead [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2000).) instead of spurning her. (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) In one parallel universe, the Doctor was killed by River Song who fulfilled her programming, (AUDIO: The Two Rivers) instead of rejecting it as occurred in N-Space. (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nOn the Inferno Earth, the Second Doctor had chosen one of the faces that the Time Lords had offered him at his trial. Arriving in the 1930s instead of the 1970s, the Doctor became an ally of Oswald Mosley and eventually took Mosley's place as the Leader, later becoming Great Britain's ruler. (PROSE: I, Alastair [+]Robert Mammone, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2020)., Timewyrm: Revelation [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Total Eclipse, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1991).)\n\nWhilst battling the Lamprey, the Sixth Doctor worked with several counterparts of his current incarnation, including a version travelling with Melanie Baal and another travelling with a counterpart of Mel Bush from an Earth where the Roman Empire had never fallen. The Doctors worked together to overload the Lamprey with their chronon energy, which cost many of them their lives. (PROSE: Spiral Scratch [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nIn one parallel universe, the Third Doctor was killed in an explosion whilst encountering the Silurians, though peace between humanity and the Silurians was still achieved. The Seventh Doctor of N-Space later visited this Doctor's grave. (COMIC: Final Genesis [+]Warwick Gray, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics, 1993).)\n\nIn the Unbound Universe, the Doctor, as in N-Space, was exiled to Earth following his Malfeasance Tribunal, but arrived in 1997 instead of the 1970s, creating a radically different timeline for Earth. (AUDIO: Sympathy for the Devil [+]Jonathan Clements, Doctor Who Unbound (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) This Doctor was left as the ruler of his universe after the Great War wiped out his people, (AUDIO: The Library in the Body [+]James Goss, The Unbound Universe (The New Adventures of Bernice Summerfield, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) and later became stranded in N-Space in the company of Bernice Summerfield. (AUDIO: The True Saviour of the Universe)\n\nIn one universe, a version of the Doctor was placed on trial in circumstances matching (AUDIO: Exile [+]Nicholas Briggs, Doctor Who Unbound (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) the trial of the Second Doctor following the War Chief incident, (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) although he sounded somewhat different. Killing himself in an escape attempt, he regenerated into a female incarnation who led from the Time Lords but was later captured, imprisoned in her TARDIS which would dematerialise her if she tried to take off. This Doctor was told that the controls was not set so and she took the chance to take off. (AUDIO: Exile [+]Nicholas Briggs, Doctor Who Unbound (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nIn one reality, Sarah Jane Smith convinced the Fourth Doctor fulfill his mission to avert the creation of the Daleks. Caught off-guard by the temporal shockwave, the Doctor was unprepared for an already created prototype Dalek which exterminated Sarah and Harry. Already morose at having committed genocide, the Doctor allowed himself to be exterminated only to be time scooped to Gallifrey. Awakening, the Doctor was met by Narvin who surreptitiously gave him the Elixir of Life to allow him to regenerate while informing him that the mission had failed and the Time Lords was now in a Time War as a result of the changes to history. Unwilling to allow Sarah and Harry's deaths to be in vain, the Doctor accepted the regeneration and cast aside his former alias, renaming himself \"The Warrior\". (AUDIO: Dust Devil) The Warrior later became President of the Time Lords. (AUDIO: The Difference Office) At the end of the Time War, the Warrior renounced his new title, choosing to become the Doctor again as he removed himself from time, alongside Davros so that the conflict could end. Unexpectedly however, the Doctor found he had averted the Time War entierly, resuming his travels with Sarah and Harry. (AUDIO: The Key To Key To Time [+]Tim Foley, Destiny (Doctor of War, Big Finish Productions, 2022).)\n\nThe use of the name \"Doctor Who\" when referring to the Doctor is commonplace in the British media, the end credits of many episodes, and most prose and comic stories of the 1960s and 1970s. The ending credits for the series gave his name as \"Doctor Who\" or \"Dr. Who\", from 1963 until Logopolis [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981). part four, when incoming Doctor Peter Davison insisted upon a change in the credits of Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982). to \"the Doctor\", which remained in place until the end of the original series in 1989; executive producer Russell T Davies used \"Doctor Who\" when the series returned in 2005, but Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant asked to change it back to \"the Doctor\" beginning with The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).. Despite these insistences, both Davison and Tennant called the character \"Dr. Who\" in several different interviews, as is common for media and cast members.\n\nEspecially in the 1960s and early 1970s, many stories referred to the Doctor as \"Doctor Who\". The Doctor Who annuals and Target Books novelisations frequently called him \"Doctor Who\" in titles and narration, though dialogue between characters usually used \"the Doctor\". In The War Machines [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., WOTAN directly referred to the Doctor as \"Doctor Who\", but most other usages of the name throughout the series' history was non-serious, such as the Second Doctor's pseudonyms and K9's jokes. In World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Missy told Bill Potts that the Doctor originally called himself \"Doctor Who\"; the Twelfth Doctor told Bill that Missy was trying to wind her up, but never denied the claim, and later in the episode explicitly self-identified as such.\n\nSince the Doctor Who universe is an expansive playground for writers, subject to multiple rights holders, it's often prone to contradiction. Quite often, stories will provide incompatible accounts of retroactive continuity. As the head of the franchise, this has affected the Doctor more than anyone. Early on in Doctor Who history, for instance, the First Doctor had a second life as Dr. Who in his TV Comic run, where it's suggested he's a human time traveller. This did not contradict anything previously stated within the series (from TV: \"\"An Unearthly Child\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).\", we only know the Doctor came from \"another time, another world\", and the Doctor insinuates he is a human throughout the William Hartnell era).\n\nSome stories have attempted to establish that, say, the Eighth Doctor's adventures in the BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures and his Big Finish audio stories each belong to separate continuities, while others have ignored this, making reference to both continuities in one breath. Different stories also give different ideas of the Doctor's early life, often including incarnations from before the First Doctor, like the so-called Morbius Doctors. There's even been the suggestion that the Doctor was a reincarnation of the Other, posited by the VNAs, while other stories give the Doctor birth parents.\n\nAfter 2020's The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020). aired, introducing pre-Hartnell Doctors to mainstream continuity (even more directly than in The Brain of Morbius [+]Robin Bland, Doctor Who season 13 (BBC1, 1976).), some writers, like Russell T Davies, decided that \"all stories are true now\", meaning that all versions of the Doctor have equal claims to \"existence\". As a result, Davies published PROSE: Doctor Who and the Time War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020)., initially planned for Doctor Who Magazine in 2013, but scrapped as it contradicted TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013)., involving a \"parallel [continuity]\" in which the Eighth Doctor ended the Time War using the Moment.\n\nUp until 2019, every actor to portray the Doctor on an ongoing basis was Caucasian and born in the United Kingdom. However, the first Doctor of colour was introduced in Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020). and The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., respectively. Similarly, every actor to play the role in the main series until Jodie Whittaker had been male.\n\nDespite the fact that the Doctor is not a native of Britain, Scotland, or of Earth for that matter, every actor to play them so far has had either a British or Scottish accent, much in the way most aliens in the Star Trek franchise tend to speak with an American accent. The precise type of accent has varied from one incarnation to the next. The earliest incarnations used RP, whereas some of the more recent incarnations have had Estuary accents. The Ninth Doctor had a Northern accent, causing Rose to ask why an alien would have a Northern accent, to which he replied, \"Lots of planets have a north.\" (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Both Sylvester McCoy and Peter Capaldi used their natural Scottish accents while playing the role, with the fact the Doctor sounds Scottish being used in dialogue plot points in (to date) TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014). and Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).. The Thirteenth Doctor had a Yorkshire accent. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).[additional sources needed])\n\nTo date, the oldest actor to be cast as the Doctor has been John Hurt, who was 73; the youngest has been Matt Smith, who was 26 when cast. The oldest to be cast on an ongoing basis was Peter Capaldi, who was 55 when he was cast and began filming, and turned 56 during the production of Series 8. In 2014, Tom Baker turned 80 and continued to record new performances as the Doctor for Big Finish Productions' Fourth Doctor Adventures audio dramas, making him the oldest actor to play the part in an officially licensed capacity. Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann, all in their sixties or seventies, also continue to portray the Doctor in licensed audio dramas produced by Big Finish, with McGann also appearing in audio dramas produced by Big Finish and BBC Radio for broadcast on BBC7 radio. In the 2000s and 2010s, Tom Baker also portrayed the Doctor in AudioGO's Hornets' Nest, Demon Quest and Serpent Crest audio dramas.\n\nIn the Sarah Jane Adventures episode Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010). Part 1, Daniel Anthony, who plays Clyde Langer, became the first non-Caucasian actor to play the Doctor, when Clyde's body is briefly taken over by the Eleventh Doctor's consciousness. Anthony delivered a line of dialogue as the Doctor while impersonating Matt Smith's voice. Owing to the brevity of the performance, and the fact he is playing an established incarnation, the fact Anthony was the first to break the barrier of skin colour is generally not recognised. Aged 22 at the time the episode was filmed, Anthony was at the time the youngest to play the part.\n\nAlthough the character has predominantly been portrayed as white, Jo Martin has portrayed an incarnation who is of colour, as have other uncredited supporting artists. (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) Prior to this, there had been black actors who was considered for the role. Among them comedian Eddie Murphy, Charles Venn and Robbie Gee.[source needed] Paterson Joseph auditioned for the part of the Eleventh Doctor.[1] Additionally, Steven Moffat has stated that he offered the role of the Doctor to a black actor - though which incarnation is unknown.[2]\n\nThere are several different methods for calculating who was the \"longest serving Doctor\". The most commonsensical definition is simply that of the actor who played the role on television for the longest continuous period. This mantle goes to Tom Baker, who was the Fourth Doctor from June 1974 to March 1981, for 6 years, 9 months. Baker is also the longest-serving Doctor in terms of the number of individual episodes, total story count and amount of screen time. Thus he is generally considered to be the \"longest-serving Doctor\".\n\nBut there are other methods of measurement — all of which exclude Dimensions in Time [+]John Nathan-Turner and David Roden, Doctor Who 30th anniversary special (BBC1, 1993)..\n\nThe issue of the longest-serving Doctor was a source of controversy on British game show The Million Pound Drop, which asked the question with the choices of McCoy, McGann, Eccleston, and Tennant; the team split their £650,000 between McCoy and McGann, only to find out that the \"correct\" answer was Tennant. Once the error was discovered (partly since the question was fundamentally flawed due to the absence of Tom Baker), the team was brought back to continue where the Doctor left off with £325,000 and ended up winning £25,000.\n\nThere have been several characters outside the confines of the legal DWU which have been broadly modelled on general aspects of the Doctor. Such \"pastiches\" are examined in greater detail elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps more interestingly, other characters within the DWU, and who have in some cases met the \"real\" Doctor, have also sometimes been conceptualised as pastiches of the character of the Doctor. Sabbath Dei was envisioned by Lawrence Miles as the individual who took on the role of the Doctor in the post-War universe, although he was later developed into a more villainous figure. Iris Wildthyme is not only a mildly ironic pastiche of the Doctor, but is, thanks to her metafictional qualities, aware of it, and The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998). has the Doctor himself act with mild annoyance around Iris precisely due to his knowledge that she is duplicating his own life.\n\nSteven Moffat, in his production notes column in DWM 482, speculated that the Doctor's first spouse out of the four mentioned in the television story Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014). was a woman who was married to the First Doctor for a long time on Gallifrey and bore the Doctor's children. He claimed \"Mrs Who No 1\" was never mentioned by the Doctor nor has he ever discussed her.\n\nOne of the longest running gags of the series is the Doctor's penchant for jelly babies. Multiple incarnations have attempted to offer them to others, be it to comfort them (such as in TV: Robot [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1974-1975).) or distract them (such as in TV: The Pirate Planet [+]Douglas Adams, Doctor Who season 16 (BBC1, 1978).). This gag was particularly evident during the Fourth Doctor era.\n\nAnother long running gag was the Doctor observing a change in a familiar room or building, and stating that the Doctor \"don't like it\". This gag was commonly done when an earlier incarnation of the Doctor entered a newer incarnation's TARDIS.\n\nThe only character other than the Doctor to deliver a variation of this quote was Clara Oswald, on her entrance to the Twelfth Doctor's console room. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nAn inverse version of this gag has also occurred, when the Thirteenth Doctor looked around her TARDIS's new console room and gleefully stated \"I like it!\" (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nAs well as the TARDIS, the Doctor was the owner of two earthbound vehicles, named Bessie and the Whomobile (the latter name not used in-universe). These was most prominently used by the Third Doctor during his exile on Earth (for example, TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Invasion of the Dinosaurs [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 11 (BBC1, 1974).), though the Doctor have also been used by later incarnations when required (for example, TV: Robot [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 12 (BBC1, 1974-1975)., Battlefield [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 26 (BBC1, 1989).).",
