  "content": "As he collected and fixed the flotsam and jetsam of the Time War, the Doctor was content to skulk in the shadows instead of facing his challenges, (AUDIO: The Oncoming Storm [+]Phil Mulryne, The Churchill Years: Volume One (The Churchill Years, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) even denying himself a companion as penance for his wartime actions. (PROSE: The Eyeless [+]Lance Parkin, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2008).) However, as he began to heal from the Time War (AUDIO: The Bleeding Heart [+]Cavan Scott, The Ninth Doctor Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2017).) and embrace his second chance, (AUDIO: Battle Scars [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor began to make new friends as he opened himself up to finding a potential companion, offering up the TARDIS to the likes of Adriana Jarsdel, (AUDIO: The Bleeding Heart [+]Cavan Scott, The Ninth Doctor Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2017).) Nova (AUDIO: Food Fight [+]Nicholas Briggs, Ravagers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) and Fred. (AUDIO: Planet of the End [+]Timothy X Atack, Respond to All Calls (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) After reunions with the Brigadier and Liv Chenka ended with them convincing him to find a new companion, (AUDIO: The Forth Generation [+]Roy Gill, Old Friends (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2022)., Flatpack [+]John Dorney, Hidden Depths (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 2, Big Finish Productions, 2022).) the Doctor found himself being accompanied by Callen Lennox and his dog, Doyle, when he had to help them find a new home. (AUDIO: Red Darkness [+]Roy Gill, Shades of Fear (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 2, Big Finish Productions, 2023).) After they settled down on New Earth, the Doctor resumed his solitary travels, though now more hopeful. (AUDIO: The Green Gift [+]Roy Gill, Pioneers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 3, Big Finish Productions, 2023).)\n\nWhen he thwarted the Nestene Consciousness's invasion attempt of London on 5 March 2005, the Doctor asked Rose Tyler, a shop assistant who had assisted him in defeating the Nestene after he had blown up her shop, to join him in the TARDIS, and she accepted when he told her it could time travel. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) After taking her to the end of the world and 1869 Cardiff, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) the Doctor accidently returned Rose to her home at the Powell Estate a year late, putting in the bad graces of her mother, Jackie, and her ex-boyfriend, Mickey Smith. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However, they were able to put their tension aside to foil the Slitheen family's attempt to destroy the Earth for profit. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhen a distress signal brought him to Henry van Statten's Vault in 2012 Utah, the Doctor found a Dalek had survived the Time War, but it destroyed itself after it absorbed the human factor from Rose. At Rose's request, the Doctor allowed van Statten's researcher, Adam Mitchell, into the TARDIS, (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) but he was swiftly evicted when he tried to filch information from Satellite Five for his own benefit and refused to take responsibility for his actions. (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Rose also faced banishment afterwards when she, in a moment of high emotion, prevented her father's death in 1987, but a Reaper attack allowed them to make amends when her father set history back on track. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Adam then returned to exact revenge on the Doctor for booting him from the TARDIS (COMIC: Mystery Date [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) by trying to kill all his other companions, (COMIC: The Choice [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) but he redeemed himself by sacrificing his life to defeat the Tremas Master. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nAfter they faced the Kotturuh crisis, (COMIC: Monstrous Beauty [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2020).; PROSE: All Flesh is Grass [+]Una McCormack, Time Lord Victorious release order (BBC Books, 2020).) the Doctor and Rose were accidentally scammed by the ex-Time Agent Captain Jack Harkness, (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) who helped them resolve the Empty Child plague he had unleashed, and welcomed him on board the TARDIS after they rescued him from an exploding Chula warship. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) As they helped recover Jack's memories that were wiped by the Time Agency, the trio was joined by UNIT soldier Tara Mishra. (COMIC: Official Secrets [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., Slaver's Song [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nEventually, the Doctor, Rose and Jack were drawn back to Satellite Five in 200,100, (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) where they learnt that that the Dalek Emperor had rebuilt the Dalek Empire by manipulating the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire to its advantage. While the Doctor built a delta wave generator to destroy the Daleks, albeit at the cost of all life on Earth, Jack was killed leading a resistance against the Daleks. Despite sending her back to the Powell Estate to ensure her saftery, Rose absorbed the power of the Time Vortex through the heart of the TARDIS and became the Bad Wolf entity, allowing her to destroy the Daleks. The Doctor absorbed the energy out of her and into himself to prevent it burning her up, forcing him to regenerate into a new body in order to survive. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhen an alternate version of the Twelfth Doctor attempted to trap his post-Time War incarnations in various alternate timelines so that he could manipulate their minds to ensure his existence, he was unable to target the Ninth Doctor. Since his plan involved presenting the Doctors with dark visions of possible alternates, the tenth and twelfth incarnations mused in the aftermath that the Ninth Doctor had been left alone because the Alternative Twelfth Doctor was unable to find a timeline in which the Ninth Doctor was \"anything less than fantastic.\" (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nAfter being \"beaten by losing a war with Death\". (PROSE: What the TARDIS thought of \"Time Lord Victorious\" [+]James Goss, Time Lord Victorious (2020).) the Ninth Doctor was an emotional incarnation of great sorrow and anger, plagued by the outcome of the Last Great Time War, breaking down or unleashing a great rage born from emotional exhaustion when faced with the consequences of the war. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However, when truly outraged with someone, the Doctor would stare at them calmly before bluntly speaking to them about what they had done to upset him. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) A mercurial individual, he hid his sorrow with a façade of manic energy, sharp wit and enthusiastic confidence, but would quickly drop the masquerade when he was either alone or deeply displeased. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) His masquerade hid a near overwhelming sense of guilt regarding his predecessor's actions in the Time War, something he kept at bay by insisting that his strife had been worth it. (PROSE: A Brief History of Time Lords [+]Steve Tribe, BBC Books (2017).)\n\nBehind his war-torn demeanour, however, he was one of the nobler incarnations, with not even a continuity bomb able to find a timeline where he was \"anything less than fantastic\", (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) and him willingly returning the power of the Time Vortex to the heart of the TARDIS after saving Rose from burning up by absorbing the power into himself, (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) despite the Tenth Doctor claiming that a Time Lord would become a \"vengeful god\" if they absorbed such powers. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Indeed, the Ninth Doctor found it humorous when Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen identified his TARDIS as \"technology of the gods\", dismissing the idea of being a god by claiming he would \"never get a day off\". (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He always tried to keep his promises. (AUDIO: Cataclysm [+]Nicholas Briggs, Ravagers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) Not wanting to be a fighter, (PROSE: All Flesh is Grass [+]Una McCormack, Time Lord Victorious release order (BBC Books, 2020).) the Ninth Doctor described himself to Lynda Moss simply as a traveller in search of \"a quiet life\". (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nPreferring to remain unnoticed in the background, the Doctor would instead encourage or inspire others into acts of heroism. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However, he was unafraid to confront his adversaries directly. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nHe could get self-defensive over how others described him, defiantly telling Rose that he \"[was] impressive\" after she called him out for showing off his time travelling capabilities, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) claiming he was \"making an effort not to be insulted\" when Rose rhetorically asked why all the \"great looking\" men disappear from her, (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and questioning if Mickey Smith found him unattractive after Mickey pointed out how handsome Jack Harkness was. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nBecause of the emotional burden he carried with him from the Last Great Time War, the Ninth Doctor was initially reluctant to involve himself in events. (AUDIO: The Oncoming Storm [+]Phil Mulryne, The Churchill Years: Volume One (The Churchill Years, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) Despite being less of an interventionist, the Doctor was willing to help his friend Plex populate a planet with clones using the Chameleon Arch, understanding the pain Plex felt for the loss of his species in a freak singularity. (COMIC: The Promise [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Trying to hide his friendlier side, (AUDIO: Cataclysm [+]Nicholas Briggs, Ravagers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) the Ninth Doctor could come across as uninterested in the details around him, acting out his plans and intentions without informing his allies of his objective. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Despite initially wanting to travel alone indefinitely after the Time War, (PROSE: The Eyeless [+]Lance Parkin, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2008).) the Doctor became a lonely man in his solitude, (PROSE: A Day to Yourselves [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) looking particularly crestfallen when Rose rejected an invitation to travel in the TARDIS. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhile he was more adept at noticing the flaws of humanity than his predecessors, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) the Ninth Doctor still retained the selfless and caring attitude that he carried throughout his previous lives, being willing to lay down his own life if it meant others would be saved. (COMIC: The Cruel Sea [+]Robert Shearman, DWM Comics (2005).) Indeed, when facing Henry van Statten, the Doctor noted the greater aspects of mankind while deriding van Statten for his greed, (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and also admitted his admiration for England's defiance of the Third Reich. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) When he realised that he could reverse the pain and suffering he had encountered with the Empty Child plague, the Doctor became overjoyed, whooping how \"just this once, everybody live[d]\", with Rose Tyler claiming he was \"beaming away like [he was] Father Christmas\". (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also tried not to hold grudges when those who wronged him needed his help. (PROSE: The Red Bicycle [+]Gary Russell, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).)\n\nDespite initially coming across as emotionally scarred and melancholy, the Ninth Doctor displayed a fun side from time to time, bobbing his head to Soft Cell's \"Tainted Love\", (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) enjoying a meal with Nancy and her children friends, (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) having a dance with Rose Tyler, (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and enjoying some downtime in Cardiff with Rose, Jack and Mickey. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) While discussing the grave consequences of the human race being fed constant reality television like sheep, he interrupted himself to ask Lynda Moss if they still had the program \"Bear With Me\", even chuckling about the celebrity edition where the bear got into a bath tub. (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nPreferring to be in the present, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) the Ninth Doctor would make decisions in the heat of the moment, focusing more on emotion rather than logic. (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He was also prone to falling for minor deceptions or overlooking obvious details. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However, he confessed that he downplayed his intelligence on occasion to lure his opponents into a false sense of security to have then expose their plans to him. (PROSE: The Clockwise Man [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor expressed a keen interest in history, claiming he travelled in time specifically so he could see history unfold after seeing the London UFO crash. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He was also a fan of Charles Dickens's work, (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and had a fondness for art as well, taking Rose to see the original Mona Lisa at the Oriel, (COMIC: Art Attack [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (2005).) and considered himself an admirer of geohacking rather than a critic. (COMIC: Hacked [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He also found pleasure in playing Mickey's video games, (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) and enjoyed immersive reality. (AUDIO: Sphere of Freedom [+]Nicholas Briggs, Ravagers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nHe did not \"do domestic\", (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) which led to tensions between him and Jackie Tyler. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He resisted speaking of his past to others, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) as well as avoided revisiting places he'd already been, (COMIC: Art Attack [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (2005).) and would feel sorrow instead of nostalgia when seeing aspects of his past. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor liked \"unsurprising\" surprises, (PROSE: The Beast of Babylon [+]Charlie Higson, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).) with the one thing that kept on surprising him being how disobedient his companions were when he told them to avoid \"wandering off\". (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also voiced an affection for hugs, (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and gave them out to comfort others, (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) or when in moments of joy. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nHe disliked dealing with people who tried to deny the extra-ordinary and unexplainable, even after they had witnessed it, believing that they only wasted his time with their denial. (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor was a vocal fan of bananas, calling them a \"good source of potassium\", (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and liked grapefruit juice. (COMIC: The Cruel Sea [+]Robert Shearman, DWM Comics (2005).) Sharing bacon sandwiches with Rose in a cafe, he voiced an admiration for ketchup that challenged brown sauce as his favourite condiment. (AUDIO: Retail Therapy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He happily accepted turkey while dining with young orphans, (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and ordered steak and chips while dining with Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen for her last meal. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also enjoyed lemon gingerbread. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nHe liked to have his coffee with just milk, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and took his tea with two sugars. (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) While Rose claimed to her mother that the Doctor drank, he did not enjoy wine, instantly spitting what he had drank back into his glass after a toast. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He did, however, enjoy brandy. (PROSE: The Clockwise Man [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor did not see it as his place to strip away blissful happiness from others, asking Rose, on the bases that she was human and he was not, if he should stop Igrix's plan to give humanity a happier future, though he was glad when she told him to stop the Kustollon. He also didn't believe in luck. (COMIC: The Love Invasion [+]Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman, DWM Comics (2005).)\n\nWhile he stood against killing, (AUDIO: Sphere of Freedom [+]Nicholas Briggs, Ravagers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) the Ninth Doctor displayed a huge sense of authority against his enemies, willing to let them die when he felt it justified their actions, claiming that everything had its time and that everything eventually ended, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) but was willing to use diplomacy, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) though he preferred action to philosophical debates. (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He showed a particular dislike for those who tried to justify their actions by saying they were only \"following orders\", telling the female programmer she had \"lost the right to even talk to [him]\" when she tried to use the excuse. (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nBecause of his pragmatic approach to situations, he would at times brush off individual deaths to focus on the task at hand, and would even encourage others to do the same and mourn later. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However, while the Doctor showed the ability to move past the deaths of those around him in the heat of the moment, (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) he acknowledged the lives lost as soon as he could. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhile he voiced a hatred of guns, (COMIC: Weapons of Past Destruction [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) the Doctor was willing to use of them in drastic situations (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and as tools. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) While he similarly frowned upon violence, he admitted that he found fantasy violence in the form of video games somewhat therapeutic. (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nAlways aiming to see the innocence in those deemed hostile, (AUDIO: Sphere of Freedom [+]Nicholas Briggs, Ravagers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) the Doctor was angered when the Space pig was killed merely for looking threatening when it was only acting out of fright and comforted it in its dying moments by stroking its snout. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He likewise became morally outraged when he learnt that victims of the Empty Child Syndrome had been left to be forgotten. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nBecause he saw time as having \"strands [that were] so tiny and so intricate\", the Doctor saw \"everyone and everything\" as being important in the grand scheme. (COMIC: The Love Invasion [+]Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman, DWM Comics (2005).)\n\nWhile the Doctor never shied away from the dangers of his adventures, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) he voiced an admiration for the mundane lives of Sarah Clark and Stuart Hoskins, and was shocked when they suggested they weren't important. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nMore aloof than other incarnations, the Ninth Doctor failed to consider any discomfort the TARDIS translation circuit would cause, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and was willing to temporarily allow the Gelth to occupy dead human bodies, likening it to recycling. (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also displayed a certain level of childish joy when it came to toying with people, such as by deliberately addressing them by the wrong name, insulting their intelligence or subjecting them to unnecessary humiliation. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) According to Rose, he liked to insult species as a whole when in moments of stress. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He would often make dry jokes to diffuse the tension of a situation. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor was not keen to encounter his other selves, (PROSE: A Day to Yourselves [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) being apprehensive to speak to Dr. Constantine when he was led to believe he was another of his incarnations. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Upon receiving a message from the Fourth Doctor, the Ninth Doctor bemoaned the occasion, reaffirming the Fourth Doctor's dislike of \"talking to [him]self\". (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) He compared a Multi-Doctor Event to ChuckleVision. (WC: Doctors Assemble! [+]James Goss, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nWhen forced to reflect on his memories of his war incarnation in the Last Great Time War, the Doctor reacted in agony, showing a great dislike of his immediate predecessor, as well as his eighth incarnation, (COMIC: Weapons of Past Destruction [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) though he reflected on how innocent the Eighth Doctor was before the Time War. (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).) He was especially angry with the War Doctor for leaving him to \"clean up the mess\" left by the Time War. (PROSE: A Day to Yourselves [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).)\n\nA Matrix projection of him referred to the Tenth Doctor as \"fantastic\". (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).) Upon meeting his tenth and twelfth incarnations, the three were able to work together amicably, though he claimed he did not trust either of them to rescue Jack and Tara from the Void. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor held a somewhat low opinion of the Ninth Doctor, thinking him to have been \"full of blood and anger and revenge\" due to being \"born in battle\". (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) The Eleventh Doctor seemingly harboured no such ill feelings, cheerfully delivering a message to the Ninth Doctor and signing off with a jovial, \"Cheers, Ears\", before apologising for the joke with concern. (AUDIO: Night of the Whisper [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Twelfth Doctor would later claim that there was no possible timeline that even the continuity bomb could find where his ninth incarnation was anything other than \"fantastic\", a sentiment shared by the tenth and eleventh incarnations. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015)., The Promise [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor cared very deeply about Rose Tyler, being reluctant to put her in danger, (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and was even willing to let a Dalek loose on Earth to keep her safe. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) When the Daleks invaded Satellite Five, the Doctor sent her back home to protect her, and deliberately absorbed the Time Vortex energy in her to save her life, knowing that he would regenerate afterwards. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) While others would mistake them for lovers, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) the Doctor himself denied such a claim when it was made by Ali. (PROSE: The Beast of Babylon [+]Charlie Higson, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).)\n\nDuring his limited travels with Adam Mitchell, the Doctor admitted to him that he was a \"tiny bit fantastic\" after he helped the Doctor defeat the Bygone Horde, (AUDIO: The Other Side [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and accepted him as a true companion when he sacrificed his life to defeat the Tremas Master's plan to end the universe, (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) despite previously kicking him out of the TARDIS for attempting to send information from 200000 to his 2012 answering machine. (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He was initially being dismissive of Jack Harkness for being a con man and indirectly causing the Empty Child plague, but chose to save him from the bomb he had taken onto his ship and invited Jack along as a companion when he emended his mistake. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor though that his TARDIS was a \"magnificent time ship\", (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) even calling it the \"best ship in the universe.\" (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhile he initially believed him to be no more than Rose's \"stupid boyfriend\", and claimed that he was \"choking on [his] words\" asking for his help, the Doctor nonetheless entrusted Mickey Smith with a computer virus to delete all mentions of him from the internet, even inviting him along in the TARDIS after his help in defeating the Slitheen family, and defended his honour in front of Rose by claiming he was refusing Mickey entry after he turned down the offer. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) While he stilled enjoyed teasing him, the Doctor came to enjoy Mickey's company in Cardiff, even offering to wait for Rose to say goodbye to him before they left. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhile he though humans could be \"warlike and stupid\", the Doctor did admire them for their artwork. (COMIC: Art Attack [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (2005).)\n\nBelieving marrying for love to be overrated, (PROSE: Only Human [+]Gareth Roberts, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) the Ninth Doctor was aromantic as well as asexual, (AUDIO: Swipe Right) turning down explicit romantic advances, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) but would be willing to return romantic pursuits if he felt there was chemistry with them. (AUDIO: Fond Farewell [+]David K Barnes, Old Friends (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2022).) He would also engage in friendly flirting, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and openly called Sam Bishop \"gorgeous\". (AUDIO: Way of the Burryman [+]Roy Gill, Old Friends (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2022).)\n\nWhen it came to children, the Ninth Doctor generally treated them kindly. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) When Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen reverted back into an egg, rather than send her to execution, the Doctor desired to give her to a new family to start a new life, believing the new child had a chance to make things better. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also cared for a baby Rose Tyler, taking surprise that Jackie deemed him the best man to be trusted with her care. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However, he could grow irritated with children who misbehaved, (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and once had to wrestle a television remote control out of a little boy's hand, though the boy at least had a laugh about it. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor held a deep hatred for the Daleks, but was also fearful of them. When he realised that Henry van Statten's prized Metaltron was a Dalek, and that its weaponry was powerless, the Doctor proceeded to try and kill it after via torture, and even tried to convince it to kill itself when it demanded orders. However, after Rose came to its defence, the Doctor calmed down, with his anger turning into apathy as he realised the Dalek was dying of its own mutation. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Upon learning the Daleks had survived by hiding away in the year 200100, the Doctor noted his desire to \"burn every last stinking Dalek out of the sky\". (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However, when dared by the Dalek Emperor, the Doctor struggled with the decision to either destroy the Daleks and the Earth with a delta wave or simply allow the Daleks to kill him and take over the universe. In the end, the Doctor couldn't bring himself to pull the trigger, happily calling himself a \"coward\" instead of a \"killer\". (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nMickey Smith described the Ninth Doctor as being \"tall, dark, handsome [and with a] good sense of humour\", but also mentioned that he was anti-social. (COMIC: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).) Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart noted that the Ninth Doctor had a military mind set to him, (COMIC: Official Secrets [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) with Adam Mitchell identifying the Ninth Doctor as the \"soldier\" in comparison to his other incarnations. (COMIC: Unnatural Selection [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) Rose believed he had a \"worry etched on his face\" that hid his true feelings, (PROSE: He's Behind You [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) while Audrey Mohinson recognised his apathy \"mask[ed] the troubled soul just beneath the surface\". (AUDIO:Cataclysm [+]Nicholas Briggs, Ravagers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nWhen talking about the possibility of his death, the Doctor would show no concern for his demise, only hoping for a good death, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) with his only concern when faced with being killed by the Gelth was that it was to happen in a Cardiff morgue. (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nAfter the regeneration process was started by the cellular damage he had achieved from siphoning the Time Vortex out of Rose's body, the Doctor first stated his regret at being unable to take her to the planet Barcelona, and then speculated what he would look like after he regenerated. In the closing moments of his life, though, the Doctor made peace with his past actions, smiling peacefully before he regenerated. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor spoke with a distinctive Northern English accent, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and had a fondness for saying \"fantastic\" when he was pleased with something, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) came across a dangerous situation, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) explaining his admiration for someone, (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) describing a favoured place, (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) found something of interest, (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) or was sarcastically expressing displeasure. (AUDIO: Night of the Whisper [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHe would at times promote his actions with the phrase, \"and for my next trick\", (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).; COMIC: Sin-Eaters [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).) and exclaim, \"give the man a medal\", when celebrating a positive outcome, (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) or congratulating cleverness. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) During interactions with new people, the Doctor often uttered that it was \"nice to meet [them]\". (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nHe also used Cockney slang and street lingo more freely than his earlier selves, such as telling Rose to \"leg it\" when instructing her to escape, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) yelling \"oi\" to get people's attention or when offended, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) calling other men \"mate\", (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and saying, \"I'll have 'ya\", to those who irritated him. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He often gave speeches about things, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) or lectured those he wished to scold. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhile his previous incarnations were rarely heard uttering curse words, the Ninth Doctor used minor curses more freely, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) though his TARDIS had a swear filter nested in the translation circuit. (PROSE: Only Human [+]Gareth Roberts, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) When being critical of human nature, the Ninth Doctor would call humans \"stupid apes\", (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and, on one occasion, \"brainless sheep\". (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor had a habit of folding his arms, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) especially as he leaned back on his shoulder.

(TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) When in his TARDIS with nothing to do, the Doctor would fiddle with a ball in his hands. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhile he was rarely seen eating, (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) the Doctor helped himself to two slices of turkey, (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) ate three sandwiches and two cakes with two cups of tea, (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) happily gobbled down multiple bacon sandwiches, (AUDIO: Retail Therapy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and helped himself to a huge slice of lemon cake. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nLike his other incarnations, the Ninth Doctor had his TARDIS key with him at all times, but also carried a spare placed on a chain with a D-shackle. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also began habitually carrying his psychic paper around. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) The Ninth Doctor otherwise broke away from the behaviour of his other incarnations, whose pockets were usually filled with seemingly random objects and knick-knacks, by carrying very little on his person, with only his sonic screwdriver on him when frisked by security. (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhen vocalising his outrage, the Doctor would punctuate his speech with sharp little head-nods that drew emphasis to his words.[source needed]\n\nThe Ninth Doctor held a commanding presence, and had a gift for leading others, (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) even those initially hostile towards him. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) As such, he disliked it when he was interrupted while explaining the situation at hand, (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) or when someone else gave out instructions on how to apprehend the enemy. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He could also convince others he was needed as a leader for the benefit of survival, (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and was able to successfully order the victims of the Empty Child plague to \"go to [their] room\" as if he were an angry parent. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He could also be effectively intimidating with just a stare. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However, he did not seem as skilled at holding audiences, being heckled while stepping in for William Shakespeare on stage, (COMIC: A Groatsworth of Wit [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2005).) and being treated as a comedy act in a makeshift cabaret when attempting to ask about a Chula ambulance falling from the sky during the Blitz. However, he could amuse and hold the attention of a group of children, (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and took a bow to roaring applause when he appeared on stage in the middle of a theatrical production in 1894 Birmingham. (AUDIO: The Other Side [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nUnafraid of fighting, (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) the Ninth Doctor was skilled in close combat, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and showed a great deal of strength and agility, being able rip parts off of artificial beings, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and kick open a locked door. (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However, he struggled to break free from an Auton's grip, only flipping it off with Rose's help, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and was restrained by two of the Editor's reanimated workers. (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also possessed keen reflexes, catching a poisoned dart-like projectile in mid-air with his fingers without even looking up from his menu when he took Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen out for a last meal, and repelled her exhaled poison with some mouthwash before she could exhale the full force of her fatal breath. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also avoided the attack of three Elians, (PROSE: The Red Bicycle [+]Gary Russell, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).) easily manoeuvred through the chaos of Traxis, (COMIC: Weapons of Past Destruction [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) and grabbed onto the underside of a passing spaceship that Slist Fayflut Marteveerthon Slitheen was flying. (COMIC: Doctormania [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nDespite being bad at card tricks, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) the Doctor was a good pickpocket, being able to swap Jack's sonic blaster with a banana undetected. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He was also quite stealthy, able to disappear from Albion Hospital without a trace, (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and arrive at a dinner table without anyone noticing him until he spoke. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Despite some initial confusion, the Doctor proved to be a skilled dancer. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nHe also displayed psychic abilities, telepathically placing Rose in a dreamscape of the Powell Estate from his memories before stealing energy from Makassar's gestalt to create a projection with physical substance, (PROSE: The Masks of Makassar [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) and confronting the entity using him as a host body within his mind before projecting his consciousness into the TARDIS to act as his vessel. (COMIC: The Cruel Sea [+]Robert Shearman, DWM Comics (2005).) He also managed to project his consciousness into Tycho Fairbank's body and reverse his influence on the people drained by Glubby Glubs, inducing them to forget the incident, and return to his body as Tycho's withered. (AUDIO: Retail Therapy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nClaiming to have \"[come] first in jiggery pokery\", (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) the Doctor was capable of reversing a teleportation feed, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and had the technical skills to make Satellite Five into a delta wave generator in a few hours after initially predicting it would take at least three days to do so. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nProfessing that he \"[had] [his] moments\", the Ninth Doctor proved a skilled physician, notably being able to accurately diagnose that the patients at the Albion Hospital had all suffered the same physical injuries. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also understood nanogenes and how they could heal any physical injuries, and even revive the dead, so long as they had been previously exposed to the patient's species. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor could recognise substances such as ozone from smell alone, associating it with the \"distinctive tingle\" of teleportation, as well as tell it apart from chronon energy, (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005)., The Red Bicycle [+]Gary Russell, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).; COMIC: The Bidding War [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2017).) was able to tell that the Lend-a-Hand girls didn't \"smell human\", (COMIC: The Love Invasion [+]Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman, DWM Comics (2005).) and was able to track down Nancy without her detection, jokingly claiming his nose had \"special powers\". (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) While he did not enjoy wine, (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) he could identify its year and place of origin by taste alone. (PROSE: The Clockwise Man [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nHe could play the guitar, and use spoons as a musical instrument. (PROSE: Have You Seen This Man? [+]various authors, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor displayed refined control of his TARDIS, managing to accurately pilot it back to where had bid farewell to Rose after he defeated the Starman (PROSE: The Beast of Babylon [+]Charlie Higson, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).) so that he arrived only seconds after he left from her perspective, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) take Rose to see her mother and father marry and returned her to the moment her father died twice with no issues, (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and even piloted it around Rose and a Dalek when coming to save her. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He was also successful at riding a moped scooter after some initial difficulty, quickly took command of a horse drawn carriage, (COMIC: The Love Invasion [+]Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman, DWM Comics (2005).) and rode a dinosaur on Clix. (COMIC: Doctormania [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nThe Doctor boasted that he could speak all the \"five billion languages in [his] head\", (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) such as Arabic, Iraqi, (PROSE: Have You Seen This Man? [+]various authors, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) and Latin. (AUDIO: Sphere of Freedom [+]Nicholas Briggs, Ravagers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) He was once seen talking with a donkey. (PROSE: Have You Seen This Man? [+]various authors, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nBeing a Time Lord, the Ninth Doctor could slow down his perception of time through sheer concentration, being able to pass through a spinning blade as a result. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also had no difficulty breathing in a room filling with gas after it became uninhabitable to humans, (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and could withstand electrical forces that were harmful to other species. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He also showed the ability to read through a book in seconds, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and suck the power of the Time Vortex out of Rose Tyler with a kiss. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nIntellectually, the Doctor was capable of making accurate deductions on how his adversaries utilised their technology, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and could identify certain technology on sight. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He was also capable of mentally narrowing down a list of five thousand planets within a matter of seconds by focusing on the characteristics of the Slitheen family. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He could judge character quickly, summing up their motivations and history after keenly observing them. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nHe was also skilled at video games, (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) knew how to handle explosives, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and could be a capable swordsman when the situation called for it. (PROSE: What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor possessed certain control over regeneration, being able to hold back the process long enough to carry Rose into the TARDIS and pilot it away from Satellite Five. The action proved strenuous though, causing him to cry out in pain after resisting it for too long. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nStanding over six feet tall, (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) the Ninth Doctor looked like a man in his early forties, (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and had pale blue eyes, strong cheekbones, a small beauty mark on his right cheek, and dark brown hair, which he wore close-cropped. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) At times, he sported a five o'clock shadow, (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and Rose Tyler claimed that he shaved. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Whilst immobilised on Occasus for ninety years, the Doctor's hair grew out and he also grew a beard, which he distastefully noted made him look like a wizard. (AUDIO: Planet of the End [+]Timothy X Atack, Respond to All Calls (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nHe had large ears, which he was initially shocked at when looking at his reflection, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and that he felt did not suit him, but determined that \"we work with what we have.\" (COMIC: The Promise [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Their size earned him the nickname \"Big Ears\" from Mickey Smith, (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and being identified as the \"me with the ears\" by the Tenth Doctor. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) The Eleventh Doctor playfully teased him about his ears, (AUDIO: Night of the Whisper [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and their size was noted by River Song as well. (GAME: The Eternity Clock [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Ironically, before his regeneration, his previous incarnation hoped that his successor's ears would be less conspicuous. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhen the Doctor told Nancy that his ears had \"special powers\", she asked him if his nose had powers too, implying that she thought his nose was large as well. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) The Tenth Doctor also considered his predecessor's nose large, even nicknaming him \"Big Nose\". (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor felt that his appearance made him look tough, especially when compared to his eighth incarnation. (PROSE: The Red Bicycle [+]Gary Russell, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).) He also believed himself to be handsome, telling Rose he was \"making an effort not to be insulted\" when she rhetorically asked why all the \"great looking\" men disappear from her, (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and being fixated on Mickey Smith implying he didn't find him handsome. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nHe was also considered attractive by the likes of Jackie Tyler, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Jabe, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and Shirley Gilbert, who described him as \"[a] bit of a dish if you like them rough\", and his eyes as \"dreamy\". (COMIC: The Love Invasion [+]Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman, DWM Comics (2005).) Slist Fayflut Marteveerthon Slitheen was awarded Cosmopolitan's \"Sexiest Planetary Saviour\" nine years in a row while using a skin suit based off the Ninth Doctor's appearance. (COMIC: Doctormania [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nRose Tyler's first impression of the Doctor was that he looked \"hard as nails\" due to his \"brutal buzzcut, weathered clothing and apparent fitness.\" When he turned to face her, Rose noted the delight in his eyes, as well as the Doctor's prominent cheekbones, and his \"splendid ears\" most of all. Even after the two parted company, as Rose processed the encounter, she thought mostly of the Doctor's bright blue eyes, beaming with excitement. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nWinston Churchill described the Ninth Doctor as a \"rough looking fellow, with wing-nut ears and a leather jacket.\" (PROSE: The Lost Diaries of Winston Spencer Churchill [+]Mark Gatiss, The Brilliant Book 2011 (The Brilliant Book 2011 short stories, BBC Books, 2010).)\n\nWhen the Eighth Doctor looked into the Tomorrow Windows, he had glimpses of various possible futures, including several possible ninth incarnations, but eventually \"the tall, thin man with [the] piercing grey-blue eyes and a prominent nose\" asserted itself as more solid than the others. (PROSE: The Tomorrow Windows [+]Jonathan Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).)\n\nPicking the first outfit he could find after his regeneration, (PROSE: A Day to Yourselves [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) the Ninth Doctor opted for a more stripped-down and rugged attire. The main staple of his outfit was a battered black double breasted leather jacket, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) which was compared to those worn by German U-boat captains by Jack Harkness. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Some accounts suggested he also had a jacket that was dark brown in colour. (COMIC: Mr Nobody [+]Scott Gray, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005)., The Cruel Sea [+]Robert Shearman, DWM Comics (2005).; PROSE: The Clockwise Man [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005)., Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) The Doctor was particularly fond of his jacket, even being more concerned with locating it when both the jacket and the TARDIS went missing, only cheering up once it was returned. After the stitching under the arms began to rip and a sleeve was damaged by a shard of glass, the Doctor left his jacket with Edward Repple and replaced it with an identical one. (PROSE: The Clockwise Man [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nAlong with the jacket, the Ninth Doctor wore a number of v-neck jumpers, coloured in plain maroon, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) navy blue, (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) olive green, (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) dark purple, (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) plain black, (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) crimson, (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) bright lilac, (COMIC: Weapons of Past Destruction [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) emerald green, (COMIC: Doctormania [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) gunmetal grey, (COMIC: Official Secrets [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) plain white, (COMIC: The Promise [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) charcoal grey, (COMIC: The Bidding War [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2017).) sapphire blue, (COMIC: Monstrous Beauty [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2020).) rust orange, (PROSE: The Guide to the Dark Times [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2021 (Doctor Who annual, Penguin Group, 2020).) bottle green, (AUDIO: Food Fight [+]Nicholas Briggs, Ravagers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 1, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) army green, (AUDIO: The Curse of Lady Macbeth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) indigo, (AUDIO: Last of the Zetacene [+]James Kettle, Into the Stars (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 2, Big Finish Productions, 2022).) and bronze brown. (AUDIO: The Beautiful Game [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) However, he was photographed wearing a navy blue polo-neck jumper at the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and wore a sage green crewneck sweater in 1923 Paris (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) and a midnight blue polo neck jumper during a trip to the Arctic. (AUDIO: Northern Lights [+]Robert Valentine, Pioneers (The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Series 3, Big Finish Productions, 2023).)\n\nCompleting the ensemble were a pair of trousers, coloured in either black, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) grey (COMIC: Weapons of Past Destruction [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) or midnight blue, (COMIC: Doctormania [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) along with a black leather belt, (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) a pair of black leather Dr Marten boots, (PROSE: The Red Bicycle [+]Gary Russell, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).) and a black, strapped wristwatch, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) which he often looked at to find out dates and years, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and that the TARDIS was able to home in on while flown by Sally Sparrow. (PROSE: What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) He also wore diamond-print socks. (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nBoth Charles Dickens and Honoré Lechasseur compared the Ninth Doctor to a navvy. (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).; PROSE: The Albino's Dancer [+]Dale Smith, Time Hunter (Telos Publishing, 2006).) Jackie Tyler was particularly critical of his stripped down clothing style, believing he either owned only one T-shirt or threw them out after wearing them once. (AUDIO: Retail Therapy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor once suggested that he bought his clothes from a Gap in Croydon. (PROSE: Only Human [+]Gareth Roberts, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nWhilst at the launch of the RMS Titanic in 1912, the Doctor wore a burgundy brocade cravat with an ivory shirt and double-breasted frock coat of ebony black moleskin. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) When hijacking the 68 to Bolton, the Doctor wore a bus driver uniform. (PROSE: Have You Seen This Man? [+]various authors, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nDuring an adventure in World War I, the Doctor wore a military trenchcoat to fit in with the British soldiers. (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).)\n\nWhile in 1924 London, the Doctor wore a dark brown round neck shirt under his jacket, with a pair of faded slacks, and battered shoes. (PROSE: The Clockwise Man [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor and Jack briefly donned skin suits of Raxacoricofallapatorians when searching for Rose and Slist Fayflut Marteveerthon Slitheen on Clix. (COMIC: Doctormania [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) During his imprisonment at Hesguard Institute, the Doctor wore an orange prison jumpsuit. (COMIC: Sin-Eaters [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).)",
