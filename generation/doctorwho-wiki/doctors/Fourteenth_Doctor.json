  "content": "After a battle against psychoplasm Dalek constructs in the Dalek Dome (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) and a crash landing on Skaro during the genesis of the Daleks, (TV: Destination: Skaro [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2023).) the Doctor found himself reunited with his old companion Donna Noble, whose memories of the Doctor had been erased by the Tenth Doctor at the end of their travels together in order to save her life. On the same night the Meep was on the run from the Wrarth Warriors, with only the release of the DoctorDonna from Donna's subconscious mind  managed to save the day, but Donna was saved from having her mind overload when it was revealed that her daughter, Rose, had inherited the Human-Time Lord Meta-Crisis and she and Donna were able to release the Meta-Crisis. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAgreeing to travel with her one last time to visit Wilfred Mott, the Doctor and Donna got side-tracked after Donna accidentally spilled coffee on the TARDIS control console, involving them meeting Sir Isacc Newton and changing the word Gravity into Mavity; but eventually leading to a conflict with the not-things at the edge of the universe, where the Doctor was forced to confront his emotional exhaustion, but chose to continue ignoring his pain, especially regarding the Flux. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nHowever, upon arriving back in London and finding its people driven mad by his old enemy, the Toymaker, the Doctor's trauma was brought back to the forefront. The Toymaker ended up shooting the Doctor with a galvanic beam, which triggered a bi-generation that split the Doctor, with the Fifteenth Doctor teaming up with his fourteenth incarnation to banish the Toymaker. Spurred on by Donna and his fifteenth incarnation, the Doctor decided to settle down on Earth with the Noble family to do \"rehab out of order\" and allow himself to heal to ensure his next incarnation would have his carefree attitude. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nIn the Daft Dimension, the Fourteenth Doctor, referred to as an \"old Doctor\", was mentioned in announcements about Doctor Who, (COMIC: The Daft Dimension 579 [+]Lew Stringer, The Daft Dimension (Panini Comics, 2022).) He went to a birthday party with his other incarnations and was seen staring at his tenth incarnation, who stared back at him in shock (COMIC: The Daft Dimension 597 [+]Lew Stringer, The Daft Dimension (Panini Comics, 2023).)\n\nOn Earth-33⅓, the Fourteenth Doctor went to a newsagents and bought a newspaper, before returning to his house and smoking a pipe as he read the newspaper. He later pottered around his garden. (COMIC: The Continuing Adventures of Doctor no. 14 [+]Tim Quinn, Doctor Who? (Panini Comics, 2024).)\n\nWhile he was initially surprised to have the same appearance as the Tenth Doctor, (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) the Fourteenth Doctor quickly adapted to having his old body, immediately looking to \"respond to calls\" of adventure. (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) He opened his arms up to friendships of all sorts, (TV: Destination: Skaro [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2023).) offering a greeting as a show of friendliness, (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) as he moved to help all those he found in trouble (PROSE: Under Control [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (BBC Children's Books, 2023).) or dealing with a difficult task. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) While he tried to reason towards the good in the universe, (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) hoping to give everyone the chance to make their case, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) the Doctor was openly cynical, and prone to introspection and self-doubt. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nIn contrast to his preceding incarnations, the Fourteenth Doctor was more open about his feelings and vulnerabilities, even being shocked at himself when he casually told Shirley Bingham how he had loved his friend Donna Noble, and later confident in Donna how much it had hurt him to wipe her memory. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He was also more willing to show more intimate signs of affection to his friends, such as gently kissing Donna on the hand, and later on the top of her head, to comfort her when she was afraid. He was similarly quicker to express annoyance, such as when he engaged in argument when Donna snapped at him over the situation in the ship at the edge of creation, and more able to admit when he was troubled, though still reluctant to actually talk his issues out. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He was also more open to taking on the ideas and suggestions of others than his tenth incarnation, such as quickly adapting to gender pronouns regarding the Meep when Rose Noble pointed out he was assuming the Meep was male presenting. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nHe did, however, still hold some of the vanity of his tenth incarnation, asking for an applause from the audience at the Dalek Dome when they mistook his defeat of the Simulacra Daleks for a rehearsed performance, (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) and becoming miffed when he thought Melanie Bush was calling him unattractive. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He also rudely rebuffed the Dalek Dome staff when they refused his instructions to close the show down, and returned smugly when he thought they had called him back. (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).)\n\nHe was quick to act when it came to saving people, hastily using himself as bait to draw the Daleks away from the crowd at Wembley Stadium, but could forget vital information when in the heat of the moment. (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) Easily succumbing to his own curiosity, (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) he could act carelessly, such as mentioning his two hearts and showing off his sonic screwdriver in front of Donna, even when he knew to keep her from remembering him. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He later got separated from Donna in the Toymaker's domain when he closed a door behind him without checking that Donna had come through. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nWhen he set himself up with a challenging task, he would look to find ways of making his mission easier on himself, though he was unafraid to do things \"the hard way\" when dealing with uncooperative people, though he would prefer to \"chat\" to solve an issue. While he would not be intentionally offensive, he was unafraid to use risqué humour. He would also leave people who were in the midst of a breakdown to focus on dealing with larger and more immediate threats, (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) but would ensure that the fallen were remembered and honoured once the current crisis was over. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nWhile he moved with a quiet confidence, and allowed himself to embrace joy more than his tenth incarnation, the Fourteenth Doctor would have explosive and violent outbursts on occasion, screaming when needing to restore Donna's memories (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and striking a wall with his hands in a screaming rage after being emotionally exposed by Donna's not-thing counterpart.\n\nHe retained the identity crisis his predecessor had developed over the revelations of the Timeless Child, and also held intense guilt over the fact that the Flux had \"destroyed half the universe\" as collateral damage in a plot to kill the Thirteenth Doctor. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He was also visibly disturbed when the Toymaker claimed to have remade his past into a \"jigsaw\". The Doctor was also shown to retain his self-loathing, as he lambasted himself for his arrogance when confronted with the Toymaker once again, and almost lost his composure when the Toymaker taunted him with the deaths of his previous companions and the destruction caused by the Flux. The Fifteenth Doctor revealed that the Fourteenth Doctor was emotionally exhausted by everything that they had been through during their lives and everyone that they had lost along the way, which the Doctor had never stopped to deal with. At the suggestion of Donna and the Fifteenth Doctor, the Fourteenth Doctor decided to go into rehab on Earth to have the adventure of living a normal life so that he could \"sort [himself] out\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Fourteenth Doctor professed a love for caves, (PROSE: Under Control [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (BBC Children's Books, 2023).) time travel, (TV: Doctor Who: The Bedtime Story [+]Oliver Jeffers, adapted from The Way Back Home, CBeebies Bedtime Stories (CBeebies, 2023). Timestamp 00:00:52.) and moles. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He also liked to act, at one point pulling out a barrister's wig to conduct a mock trial against the Meep, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and feigned death by poisoning to tease Donna. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He held a hatred for the \"cryptic\". (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nHe didn't believe in destiny, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) but \"[clung]\" to the scientific laws of his universe. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) When trying to purchase a home on Earth, the Doctor seemed profoundly moved by a house in the countryside with its history of the people who lived there, and thought it looked \"happy\". He also liked that it had a corridor, but rejected the proposal of speaking to a mortgage adviser, as he claimed the word \"mortgage\" meant \"death pledge\". (PROSE: The Giggle [+]James Goss, adapted from The Giggle (Russell T Davies), 60th Anniversary Novels (Target Books, 2023).)\n\nHe once implied he would deem violence \"fit and proper\" in a given circumstance, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and had an underlined darkness to him, threatening the Daleks with non-existence when it looked like they had destroyed Earth to prove a point, and smiling as he taunted the Golden Emperor's inability to escape destruction due to the size of his casing preventing him entering the TARDIS. (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).)\n\nHe knew to be cautious when walking in the footsteps of history, doing his best to prevent the \"timelines and canon [from] rupturing\", (TV: Destination: Skaro [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2023).) but being nonchalant if he changed established history in minor ways. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nLooking down on himself for giving into his arrogance on being \"clever\", the Fourteenth Doctor saw himself only as good as the equipment at his disposal, not knowing who he was without his \"toys\".\n\nThe Fourteenth Doctor expressed a high opinion of the Thirteenth Doctor, referring to her as a \"brilliant woman\". (TV: Destination: Skaro [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2023).)\n\nAfter the Doctor's bi-generation, he embraced his fifteenth incarnation with a hug, and then work in conjuncture with him in a game of catch against the Toymaker, and they managed to emerge victorious with their teamwork. When the Doctors departed, they shared a hug and smiled affectionately at one another before leaving with mutual salutes. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Fourteenth Doctor retained his tenth incarnation's fondness for Donna Noble and was anguished at the thought of his presence in her life causing the DoctorDonna to return and kill her, only restoring Donna's memories when there was no other choice with clear reluctance and anguish, although he was elated when Donna survived due to part of the meta-crisis having been passed down to Rose Noble. Donna later encouraged the Doctor to stick around more and spend time with her family, which the Doctor suggested that he might try, while confessing to her that he was glad to have her back, as it \"killed [him]\" to have to wipe her memory. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He later took up her offer to join her family when he retired on Earth, adopting Donna as a sister, Rose as his niece and Shaun Temple as his brother-in-law. He teasingly called Sylvia Noble his new \"evil stepmother\", and also welcomed Mel Bush as \"Mad Aunty Mel\", as he came to enjoy having a family with him, telling Donna that he had \"never been so happy in [his] life\".  (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Fourteenth Doctor was also more outwardly expressive of his feelings towards his friends, frequently stating that he loved Donna, Wilfred Mott, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and Sarah Jane Smith. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He would also outwardly cry, notably becoming distressed upon thinking Wilf had passed away, reaffirming that he had \"loved that man\", (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and greeted him with an overjoyed hug while affectionately calling him \"old soldier\" when they reunited. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) When the Doctor joined the Noble family, he happily named Wilf his \"grandad\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nWhen it was \"the only thing [he had] left\", the Doctor held his TARDIS with great affection, (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) patting it while calling his ship a \"good girl\", (TV: Doctor Who: The Bedtime Story [+]Oliver Jeffers, adapted from The Way Back Home, CBeebies Bedtime Stories (CBeebies, 2023).) gently caring for it while it was damaged, (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and also grew emotional when believing he might have to give up the TARDIS and retire so the Fifteenth Doctor could continue adventuring.\n\nWhile he knew they could be \"clever and bright and brilliant\", the Fourteenth Doctor knew that humanity was equally \"savage and venal and relentless\" with their \"lies [and] righteousness\", and were \"poisoning the world\" by constantly \"using [their] intelligence to be stupid\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He also thought that they could only give simple answers, and was tricked into thinking a not-thing was the real Donna when he accepted her simple answer to a question over Donna's overthought answer brought on by stress.\n\nTo his own surprise, the Doctor agreed with Donna's assertion that Isaac Newton was \"hot\". (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nContinuing the blasé attitude his tenth incarnation showed towards them, the Fourteenth Doctor called the Daleks \"nasty children in metal suits\", and elevated himself as a \"grown-up\" in comparison to them. He tried to belittle the Supreme Dalek by calling it \"Di Ross\", and then took joy in its inability to shoot him. (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).)\n\nBecause of the vast powers at his disposal, the Doctor feared the Toymaker, but lambasted him for being \"so small\" and noting using his powers to better the universe, even offering to play games with him throughout the cosmos to enable them both to become \"celestial\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nShirley Bingham described the Fourteenth Doctor as \"jammy\". (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Tiff the estate agent's first impression of the Doctor was that he looked a \"bit tired\", as if he had gone through \"a break-up or a loss\", but noted that he didn't seem \"the type\" to be a \"dodgy student landlord\". Though worried he was playing a prank on her when he asked for less than the house's worth, Tiff was moved by the \"sad wildness\" in his eyes. (PROSE: The Giggle [+]James Goss, adapted from The Giggle (Russell T Davies), 60th Anniversary Novels (Target Books, 2023).)\n\nUnlike his tenth incarnation, the Fourteenth Doctor was more accepting of his incoming regeneration when it was triggered, and even directly rejected the Tenth Doctor's assertion that it felt like dying, reassuring Donna and Mel that it \"[was] not dying\", though he was still saddened at the prospect of regenerating. However, his sadness quickly changed to confusion when it turned out to be a bi-generation, though he was elevated with the results regardless. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAlong with his face, the Fourteenth Doctor inherited several of his tenth incarnation's quirks, such as proclaiming \"What!?\" repeatedly when vexed by a situation, (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022)., The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) pulling at his face when thinking, (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022)., Destination: Skaro [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2023).) a need to excessively apologise, (TV: Destination: Skaro [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2023).) his affection for the word \"allons-y\", (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) swaggering around with his hands in his pockets, (TV: Doctor Who: The Bedtime Story [+]Oliver Jeffers, adapted from The Way Back Home, CBeebies Bedtime Stories (CBeebies, 2023)., The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) sitting with his legs stretched out and crossed, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) tossing his coat aside when he didn't wish to wear it, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and describing developments as \"brilliant\". (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023). , The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He also wore glasses when inspecting gadgets (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) or looking at information on a screen. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nHe often explained his jokes and wordplay, and made a habit of assigning cheeky nicknames to others. (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) He tended to repeat himself in triplicates, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and would also express his adoration using the phrase, \"I love...\", whether in expression towards people, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) places, (PROSE: Under Control [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (BBC Children's Books, 2023). Page 48.) concepts, (TV: Doctor Who: The Bedtime Story [+]Oliver Jeffers, adapted from The Way Back Home, CBeebies Bedtime Stories (CBeebies, 2023). Timestamp 00:00:52.) or even animals. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nUnlike his past incarnations, the Fourteenth Doctor was a terrible cook, having caused a fire attempting to use a toaster, and then asked never to cook again by the firemen. (PROSE: The Giggle [+]James Goss, adapted from The Giggle (Russell T Davies), 60th Anniversary Novels (Target Books, 2023).)\n\nThe Fourteenth Doctor had the agility to outrun pursing Daleks while simultaneously avoiding their gunstick fire, (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) and leap over the Toy Emporium's counter without difficulty. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He was also fast enough to outpace the not-things use of controls to contain them in the ship's bridge while simultaneously speeding up the ship's self-destruction. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He was nimble enough to sneak around unnoticed in Millson Wagner Steelworks, and climb the consoles of the Meep's ship to reach otherwise inaccessible controls. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Doctor possessed the swordsmanship skills needed to fight off the Queen of the Sycorax, (COMIC: Into Control [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (BBC Children's Books, 2023).) and the speed necessary to catch up to his not-thing counterpart in spite of their head start. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He was also particularly skilful in a game of catch, using quick reflexes to help defeat the Toymaker at the game, despite the Toymaker's attempt to catch him off-guard. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Doctor was able to bandage the Meep's cut paw with efficiency. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nHe could determine the date by smelling the air, (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) and once claimed his bones could sense if time in the local vicinity had somehow slowed down. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He could also determine the properties of an object by taste, (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) such as analysing blood, (COMIC: Into Control [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (BBC Children's Books, 2023).) and focus all his senses to pinpoint the origin of a sound. (PROSE: Under Control [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (BBC Children's Books, 2023).)\n\nHe could drive a taxi cab at speeds needed to escape danger, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and also knew how to drive a hovercraft. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nKnowing fifty-seven-billion, two hundred and five languages, (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) the Doctor could speak German without the aid of the TARDIS's translation circuit. (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) He could also decipher a language completely, as well as where he was, by studying the symbols for the language's version of the numbers one to ten. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Fourteenth Doctor had a soothing voice that was good for telling bedtime stories, (TV: Doctor Who: The Bedtime Story [+]Oliver Jeffers, adapted from The Way Back Home, CBeebies Bedtime Stories (CBeebies, 2023).) and an encyclopaedic knowledge of the London roads. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He was also able to calculate the distance between the edge of the universe and Earth by looking out into space. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nLooking above the age of 35-years-old, (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) the Fourteenth Doctor resembled a slightly older version of his tenth incarnation, sharing his tall, slim frame, finely boned hands and face, and large, dark brown eyes, as well as his thick brown hair with sideburns, though with a slight copper tinge. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) The resemblance to the Tenth Doctor was so similar that others would mistake him for his tenth incarnation at first glance. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He instantly recognised the similarity from running his tongue over his teeth (PROSE: A Letter from the Doctor [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (Penguin Group, 2023). Page 6.) and by the familiar feeling of his face, which also had a five-o'clock shadow of stubble. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nHis kidneys remained their normal blue colour, (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).) but he had distinct braincells (PROSE: A Letter from the Doctor [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (Penguin Group, 2023). Page 6.) and blood to his other incarnations. (COMIC: Into Control [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (BBC Children's Books, 2023). Page 52.)\n\nAlthough initially in denial about returning to an old body, (PROSE: \"Heroes of Time\" [+]Part of Whotopia: The Ultimate Guide to the Whoniverse, Simon Guerrier, Una McCormack and Jonathan Morris, BBC Books (2023).) the Fourteenth Doctor was pleased to have regained the hands he \"hadn't realised he had missed\", familiar face, \"fantastic\" hair, \"slightly quizzical left eyebrow\", and \"brilliant grin\" by the time he wrote about himself in a letter. (PROSE: A Letter from the Doctor [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (Penguin Group, 2023). Page 6.)\n\nWhile not as passionately as she did for his successor, Melanie Bush agreed that the Fourteenth Doctor was \"beautiful\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor described the Fourteenth Doctor as \"thin as a pin\" and told him he was \"running on fumes\", with Donna Noble agreeing that he looked \"worn out\". (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAs his clothes manifested with him from his predecessor's regeneration, the Fourteenth Doctor emerged wearing a navy blue trenchcoat over a white button-up shirt, with grey knitted tie, brown and turquoise checkered-tartan trousers and a matching waistcoat with lapels, and papyrus colored Converse shoes. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) He also wore a white undershirt, (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and owned a pair of tortoise shell glasses. (COMIC: Liberation of the Daleks [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022-2023).)\n\nAfter bi-generating, half of his clothes were taken by the Fifteenth Doctor, leaving him with just his undershirt, waistcoat, and trousers, though he was later shown to have replaced his shirt and shoes once he settled down with the Noble family, though he kept his shirt unbuttoned. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)",
