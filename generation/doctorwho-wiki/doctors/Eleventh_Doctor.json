  "content": "Arriving at Amy Pond's house in 1996 during a crashlanding caused by damage his TARDIS had sustained during his regeneration, the Doctor found a a crack in the fabric of time and space in the wall, but had to take off in the TARDIS when the TARDIS engines started overheating, not returning until 2008, where he was helped by Amy Pond and Rory Williams in stopping the Atraxi from destroying the Earth to find Prisoner Zero, who warned the Doctor that \"silence [would] fall\" when the Pandorica opened. After taking his rebuilt TARDIS for a test run, the Doctor returned to fulfil his promise to take Amy traveling with him in 2010, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) taking her to Starship UK in 3295, where they helped free the star whale, (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and then to 1941 London, where the Doctor failed to stop the rise of the New Dalek Paradigm. (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nWhen a summons from River Song lead them to the crash of the Byzantium, (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) the Doctor found another crack in time after Amy became infected by a Weeping Angel, and had to feed the Angels to the crack to close it and heal Amy, after which she told him of her engagement to Rory and tried to seduce him, (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) leading the Doctor to bring Rory aboard the TARDIS and take them to 1580 Venice as a wedding gift to stop them drifting apart as he stopped the Saturnyns drowning Venice. Rory was asked to remain with them in the TARDIS, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and Amy quickly realised her true love for him during a battle with the Dream Lord, (TV: Amy's Choice [+]Simon Nye, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) but Rory was tragically killed during an attempt to find peace with the Silurians, and then erased from time by the cracks. (TV: Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Now the only one who could remember Rory, the Doctor treated Amy to meetings with the likes of Vincent van Gogh (TV: Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and trips to destinations such as 1963 London, as they faced challenges from the Daleks, (GAME: City of the Daleks [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).) Cybermen (GAME: Blood of the Cybermen [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).) and Vashta Nerada, (GAME: Shadows of the Vashta Nerada [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).) with the Doctor also befriending Craig Owens when forced to lodge with him to investigate a timeship. (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nUltimately, another summons from River brought the Doctor before the Pandorica at 102 Stonehenge, and he was imprisoned by an alliance of his enemies to stop his TARDIS from exploding and destroying the universe, though it still blew up and destroyed every planet save the Earth when River was piloting it. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) After he was freed by Rory, who had been rebuilt as a Nestene duplicate by the Alliance, the Doctor used River's vortex manipulator to save her from the TARDIS and then rebooted the universe by launching the Pandorica into the explosion. As his timeline unravelled, the Doctor was remembered back into reality by Amy at her wedding reception, and then took Amy and Rory, revived to his old self by the reality reboot, for more adventure in the TARDIS as \"the Ponds\". (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nWhile Amy and Rory enjoyed their honeymoon, the Doctor shared an adventure with Sarah Jane Smith and Jo Jones against the Claw Shansheeth, (TV: Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).) and saved Albert Einstein from becoming an Ood, (TV: Death Is the Only Answer [+]The Children of Oakley Junior School, BBC Three (2011).) but then had to save Amy and Rory when the Thrasymachus cruise ship was crashing on Sardicktown by rewriting the history of town proprietor Kazran Sardick to turn him into a nicer person. Taking the Ponds with him, (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) the Doctor had to separate the TARDIS from itself when the exterior landed within the interior, (TV: Time [+]Steven Moffat, Comic Relief specials comic relief 2011 (BBC One, 2011).) and help Amy deal with her conflicting memories caused by the reality reboot. (HOMEVID: Good Night [+]Steven Moffat, 2011.)\n\nAfter separating from the Ponds to allow them to enjoy their married life, (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) the Doctor took on Alice Obiefune as a companion, (COMIC: After Life [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and their adventures included stopping the Talent Scout of SERVEYOUinc with John Jones and ARC, (COMIC: The Comfort of the Good [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) preventing the Volatix Cabal from enacting their masterplan through sleeper agent the Squire with Abslom Daak and River, (COMIC: Physician, Heal Thyself [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) and protecting the Sapling from the Scream. (COMIC: The Scream [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter receiving a mysterious summons, the Doctor was reunited with Amy, Rory and River in a mission to find Canton Everett Delaware III, which lead him into his first direct confrontation with the Silents in 1969 Washington DC when he found a little girl in an astronaut suit calling President Richard Nixon. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) While dealing with Amy's undecided pregnancy, the Doctor used the Silents' post-hypnotic suggestion powers against them by hijacking the Apollo 11 moon landing and having humanity wipe them out. (TV: Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) The Doctor then continued to investigate Amy's potential pregnancy as he and the Ponds saved the crew of the Fancy from a Skerth Siren (TV: The Curse of the Black Spot [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and investigated a bubble universe where the TARDIS was briefly placed in a woman's body by House, (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) until the Doctor realised Amy was a Ganger and severed the connection, though not before the Ganger told him she had watched a future version of himself die at Lake Silencio. (TV: The Almost People [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) The Doctor and Rory launched an attack on Demons Run to save Amy and her baby from Madame Kovarian, but Kovarian managed to escape with the baby, who was a Proto-Time Lord due to being conceived within the Time Vortex. River, however, revealed that she was the baby to the Doctor, who quickly left. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAfter months without contact, the Doctor was called upon by Amy and Rory for answers, only for his TARDIS to be hijacked to 1938 Berlin by Mels Zucker, the Ponds' childhood best friend, who regenerated into River Song after being shot by Adolf Hitler, revealing herself to be their child, just as she was hunted down by the Teselecta, with the Doctor learning the Silence was plotting to have River assassinate him at Lake Silencio to prevent the \"First Question\" being answered. After saving River from the Teselecta and leaving her with the Sisters of the Infinite Schism, the Doctor and the Ponds continued with their adventures, (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) such as helping the Tenza George Thompson overcome his pantophobia, (TV: Night Terrors [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) finding the missing Agent 99 (COMIC: The Moon of Lost Hope [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and saving the universe from the Atomon, (COMIC: Vengeance of the Atomon [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) until a visit to Apalapucia forced the Doctor to realise his cavalier lifestyle was endangering the Ponds, (TV: The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and he decided to leave them behind at a house in 2011 London after an adventure on a prison ship with a Minotaur. (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nEmbarking on a farewell tour to delay his assassination at Lake Silencio, the Doctor travelled around for roughly two hundred years until a \"social call\" to Craig, in which the pair fought off some Cybermen, convinced him to face his fate, (TV: Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) though not before he traced answers for his assassination to Dorium Maldovar and the Teselecta, with the Doctor deciding to avert his death by hiding in the Teselecta while it took on his form at Lake Silencio. However, River managed to prevent herself shooting him, causing time to collapse, though the Doctor was able to repair it by marrying River in a dubious wedding ceremony, albeit one they both regarded as genuine, allowing her to trust him. With the universe convinced he was dead, the Doctor went \"back into the shadows\" (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) by removing information about himself from areas like the Inforarium, (HOMEVID: The Inforarium [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) ignoring Dorium's warnings of the \"Fall of the Eleventh\" at Trenzalore. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nWhile returning a favour to Madge Arwell, the Doctor was convinced to visit Amy and Rory for Christmas and let them know he was still alive after Lake Silencio, (TV: The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2011 (BBC One, 2011).) and they remained in contact, (WC: Pond Life [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who television stories series 7 (BBC Red Button, 2012).) even sharing an adventure with the crew of the USS Enterprise-D. (COMIC: Assimilation² [+]Scott & David Tipton and Tony Lee, IDW Star Trek crossovers (IDW Publishing, 2012).) However, after their escape from the Dalek Asylum, during which the Doctor was erased from the Dalek Pathweb by Oswin Oswald, (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) the Doctor and the Ponds would go longer without seeing each other, with a gap of ten months occurring between the Dalek Asylum and them facing Solomon the trader on a Silurian Ark, (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) until the Year of the Slow Invasion forced the Doctor to live with the Ponds as he assisted UNIT's Head of Scientific Research, Kate Stewart, in repelling a Shakri invasion. Though content to leave the Ponds behind again, the Doctor was convinced to let them travel with him some more, (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) until he lost them to the touch of a Weeping Angel in New York City, with the temporal energies within the city making him unable to retrieve them. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAfter some time traveling with Decky Flamboon, (COMIC: Meteorite Meeting [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) encounters with the Cyber Legion Cybermen (PROSE: Plague of the Cybermen [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and the Dalek Time Controller convinced the Doctor to retire from adventuring (PROSE: The Dalek Generation [+]Nicholas Briggs, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2013).) and seek solitude in 1892 London, though the Paternoster Gang would continuously try to encourage him to adventure again, though they were unsuccessful (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) until Clara Oswin Oswald convinced him to investigate the Great Intelligence's plot to invade London as a snowstorm, though Clara died foiling the scheme. However, as she died, the Doctor realised there was a connection between her and Oswin from the Dalek Asylum and went looking for answers on the \"Impossible Girl\". (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nWhen his search for Clara proved fruitless, the Doctor decided to follow a distress signal (AUDIO: Prologue - Clara [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) to Research Rig 6 in the 54th century, where he became aquatinted with Valarie Lockwood, who decided to join him in his search after they failed to save her mother from being killed by the Darinthian Blight virus unleashed by Arabella Hendricks. (AUDIO: The Inheritance [+]Alfie Shaw, Geronimo! (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2022).) As the TARDIS was continuously hijacked by a mystery caller, (AUDIO: The Inheritance [+]Alfie Shaw, Geronimo! (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2022)., The End [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor and Valarie found themselves saving Medrüth from the Yearn, with Valarie starting a romance with Roanna of Medrüth, (AUDIO: The Yearn [+]Angus Dunican, All of Time and Space (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2023).) though their romance was put at risk when Valarie had an out-of-sync meeting with her husband, Hayden, on the same day she was killed by Hendricks as she tested the Surge for use in a war with the New Dalek Paradigm. (AUDIO: All's Fair [+]Max Kashevsky, Everywhere and Anywhere (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2023).) As he and Valarie finally tracked down their mysterious caller with an Arkheion device, (AUDIO: Sins of the Flesh [+]Alfie Shaw, Everywhere and Anywhere (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2023).) the Doctor learnt that Hendricks was being used by a sentient Dalek time machine to destroy the New Dalek Paradigm with a biological weapon (AUDIO: Didn't You Kill My Mother? [+]John Dorney, Victory of the Doctor (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2024).) that ultimately failed, (AUDIO: Daleks Victorious [+]Felicia Barker, Victory of the Doctor (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2024).) necessitating Valarie to alter time and become the mystery caller in order to prevent the Doctor's execution by the Parliament of the Daleks. While the time-traveling Valarie went off to live with Hayden, (AUDIO: The Last Stand of Miss Valarie Lockwood [+]Alfie Shaw, Victory of the Doctor (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2024).) the Doctor, Valarie and Roanna trapped the Paradigm Daleks in the Arkheion device after infecting it with the Darinthian Blight, resulting in the destruction of the New Dalek Paradigm. The Doctor then served as best man at Valarie's wedding to Roanna, and they parted ways to begin the next chapter in their separate lives. (AUDIO: Victory of the Doctor [+]Alfie Shaw, Victory of the Doctor (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2024).)\n\nEventually deciding to see if he met Clara again by happenstance, (WC: The Bells of Saint John: A Prequel [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who episode prequels series 7 (BBC, 2013).) the Doctor was reunited with Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, (COMIC: Hunters of the Burning Stone [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2013).) and advised by a young girl to \"find a quiet room and have a good think\" to help him locate Clara. (WC: The Bells of Saint John: A Prequel [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who episode prequels series 7 (BBC, 2013).) When Clara Oswald telephoned the TARDIS while he was secluded in 1207 Cumbria, the Doctor followed the call to 2013 London, where Clara helped him defeat the Wi-Fi plot of Rosemary Kizlet and her \"client\", (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and then agreed to travel with him to Tiaanamat of the Sun-singers of Akhet for her first trip, with the Doctor secretly investigating her (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) as they faced Skaldak the Ice Warrior aboard the Firebird during the Cold War (TV: Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and solved a ghost mystery at Caliburn House, (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) until he was convinced of Clara's obliviousness to her other lives when he confronted her in a timeline he was able to revert. (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Now seeing Clara as a friend instead of a puzzle, the Doctor agreed to take her charges, Angie and Artie Maitland, to Hedgewick's World of Wonders when they uncovered her time travelling, where they helped Emperor Ludens Nimrod Kendrick Cord Longstaff XLI destroy some Weapons-grade Cybermen. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) When the Great Intelligence took the Paternoster Gang hostage at the Doctor's tomb on Trenzalore, it was discovered that Clara became embroiled in the Doctor's time stream when she entered it in order to stop the Great Intelligence corrupting his timeline, though the Doctor was able to retrieve her after they saw a memory of the War Doctor lingering in the timestream. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWith the mystery of her existence solved, (WC: She Said, He Said: A Prequel [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor and Clara undertook carefree adventures that saw them visit the Royal Albert Hall (TV: Doctor Who Proms Film [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and have to recover the Doctor's lost memories with his Twelve Hundred Year Diary. (TV: The History of the Doctor [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who (BBC Three, 2013).) When Clara started teaching English at Coal Hill School, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) the Doctor travelled alone to let her adjust to her new job, (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) though did briefly take on Professor Brian Cox as a companion. (TV: A Night with the Stars [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) When he was brought back into the Last Great Time War by the Moment with the Tenth Doctor to help the War Doctor, the Eleventh Doctor was convinced by Clara to avert Gallifrey's destruction, and the Doctors worked with their other incarnations to lock Gallifrey in a pocket universe.\n\nWith the Time Lords saved, the Doctor was convinced by the Curator of the Under Gallery to go looking for Gallifrey, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) though he was unable to find his home planet until he received a message broadcasting throughout time and space shortly after he obtained the head of a Cyberman from the Maldovarium Market and named it \"Handles\". Tracing the message to a planet quarantined by Tasha Lem of the Papal Mainframe, the Doctor and Clara found the signal coming from a crack in time in a town called Christmas, and Handles confirmed the message came from Gallifrey. Realising the Time Lords were trying to return, an act that would start another time war, and that he was on Trenzalore, the Doctor returned Clara home and then spent the next nine hundred years of his life defending Trenzalore from his greatest enemies as they strived to prevent the Time Lords' return. Growing old and frail as he lost friends such as Handles to the conflict, the Doctor prepared to face his imminent demise by the Daleks until the Time Lords granted him a new regeneration cycle at Clara's urging when Tasha brought her back to Trenzalore, enabling the Doctor to undergo an explosive regeneration that destroyed the Daleks and Nacrana Va Hateen, saving Trenzalore. With his body resetting in preparation for the change, the Doctor bade Clara farewell in the TARDIS as he regenerated into his next incarnation, changing his personal future but leaving the Time Lords trapped outside the universe. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nPrior to the Last Great Time War, a fixed point in time was recorded on Gallifrey concerning the assassination of the Eleventh Doctor at the hands of River Song at Lake Silencio. (AUDIO: Songs of Love [+]Matt Fitton, Doom Coalition 4 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nIn 1954, Amelia Williams published Summer Falls, a novel for children in which the lead character meets a man called \"the Curator\", who was based upon the Eleventh Doctor, right down to his physical description and his use of the word \"cool\" to describe things. (PROSE: Summer Falls [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) A later edition of the book included an introduction by Amelia directly addressed to the Doctor in which she describes meeting a woman with knowledge of the Doctor. (PROSE: Summer Falls and Other Stories [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nNever shying away from adventure, (GAME: Evacuation Earth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Eleventh Doctor preferred a life of excitement, and would deliberate avoid a stable situation to keep things from being \"boring\", (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) with his one condition to his companions choosing a destination being that they had to pick somewhere \"amazing\", (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) though he also longed for a \"simple life\", (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) even if he \"hate[d] it when things [made] sense.\" (COMIC: Supernature [+]Jonathan Morris, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2010).) More childish in nature than his previous incarnations, he would advise others against \"[growing] up\", (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and frequently defined himself as a \"a madman with a box\". (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) As he struggled to act as a mature adult in his socialising, (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2011 (BBC One, 2011).) to the extent that the psychic paper failed to register him as a \"mature and responsible adult\", (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) the Doctor had trouble reading a room, which would lead to him saying something inappropriate or even offensive. (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nUnable to resist the call to adventure and the need to help others, (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) though in a reckless fashion, (TV: The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) the Eleventh Doctor tried to be a figure of comfort in the universe by standing by those who were afraid and defenceless, (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Hungry Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010)., Night Terrors [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) never abandoning those who were in need, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)  even if he believed they weren't real, (TV: Amy's Choice [+]Simon Nye, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) but prioritised those in more immediate danger than those who could be saved later. (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).) He also tried to make new friends wherever he went, taking the time to get to know their names and some details, as well as do odd jobs for them, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and would be especially aggravated when killers could not remember their victims' names. (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nMuch like his second incarnation, the Eleventh Doctor showed a childlike recklessness, but always had a grand scheme behind his actions. (TV: Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Because he believed that secrets \"make [people] safe\", (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) he was often deceptive and manipulative, habitually putting elaborate plans in place and executing them, even if his plans emotionally hurt his loved ones. (TV: The Almost People [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) However, when in an emergency, the Doctor would prefer to speak hard truths than try to falsely alleviate the situation by lying, (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2011 (BBC One, 2011)., Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) but would be gentle with those who had no control over their actions. (TV: Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nHe found it difficult to stay still for long, (TV: Amy's Choice [+]Simon Nye, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) needing to keep himself entertained because he would \"lose his mind out of boredom\", and had a poor concept of time, doing a series of tasks in an hour without realising how little time had passed. (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) Despite his impatience, he enjoyed reading, (TV: Night Terrors [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) often sitting down with a book in moments of leisure. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAble to find positive outlooks in negative situations, (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010)., Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) he preferred to settle problems through negotiation rather than violence, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Hungry Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) but was willing to fight and kill when he deemed it necessary, (TV: Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) as well as physically intimidate someone when he was suppressing his anger. (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Hungry Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) While he could succumb to emotional outbursts and rudeness when under stress, he would apologies for his words and actions once he had calmed down. (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Amy's Choice [+]Simon Nye, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Almost People [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAware that he was more absent minded than his predecessors, (GAME: Evacuation Earth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Eleventh Doctor got distracted easily, disregarding important matters once he noticed something that he found more interesting. (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) He thought aloud when he was panicking or stressed, and tended to babble about what he knew about the current situation to come up with a plan, believing that he would have one when he finished talking, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) with his usual strategy being to \"talk very fast, [and] hope something good happen[ed], [and then] take the credit\" if the situation resolved itself. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAlways striving to honour his bargains, (GAME: TARDIS [+]James Moran, Phil Ford and Sean Millard, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).) the Doctor would be immensely disappointed with himself if he let others down or had broken a promise he had made. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Hungry Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAfter losing Amy and Rory to the Weeping Angels, (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) but especially after the Dalek Time Controller tricked him, (PROSE: The Dalek Generation [+]Nicholas Briggs, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2013).) the Doctor exiled himself to 1892 London, referring to it as him being \"retired\", (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) having sworn to \"no more meddling\". (PROSE: The Dalek Generation [+]Nicholas Briggs, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2013).) He remained in strict solitude, turning away from adventures, (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) until Clara Oswin Oswald reinvigorated his wants for adventure. When she was killed by the Ice Governess, the Doctor tried to \"bargain with the universe\" by saving the Earth from the Great Intelligence to save Clara, believing that he was \"owed\" a victory, but he instead settled with adventuring again to uncover the mystery of Clara's connection to Oswin Oswald. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor had a tendency towards self-loathing for his actions, (TV: Amy's Choice [+]Simon Nye, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The History of the Doctor [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who (BBC Three, 2013).) such as holding himself accountable for the actions of his enemies when they put his friends in danger or when he failed to stop them. (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) In an imaginary interrogation session with his previous incarnations, the Doctor imagined them all leaving him in disgust after he made the claim that he always left things better than he found them. (COMIC: Pull to Open [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) He also had an intense sadness that was almost an exhausted pain, (COMIC: Hunters of the Burning Stone [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2013).) with Amy concluding that he was lonely inside. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) He missed Gallifrey, and admitted that he still felt the loneliness of being the last of the Time Lords when he interrogated Alaya. (TV: The Hungry Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) When he was given a ray of hope that he wasn't the last of the Time Lords, and it turned out to be a trap, the Doctor reacted with quiet rage. He also expressed a desire to be forgiven for what he had done in the Time War. (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nWhile he knew it was important to hold onto tragedy as motivation in the face of adversity, (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) the Eleventh Doctor would not dwell on despair, choosing instead to move on with his life, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) but would still take a period to mourn when he lost someone. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) Because of his willingness to move on from tragedy, the Moment branded him as \"the man who forgets\". (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor could be self-interested, eavesdropping on conversations about himself, (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) wanting to be impressive and admired, (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Amy's Choice [+]Simon Nye, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) being concerned about not being thought of as attractive, (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and frequently boasted about how impressive he thought he was. (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) However, his arrogance was a façade to hide his insecurities, (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and the guilt he felt over ruining his past companions' lives. (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nMuch like his sixth incarnation, the Eleventh Doctor was willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good, (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) often putting aside his own safety if his companions were endangered, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) but admitted that he could be selfish at times, telling Amy that he had taken her with him because he was vain and wanted to be adored. (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor loved visiting new planets, (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) and having new experiences. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) His favourite places in time and space included 1963 London, (GAME: City of the Daleks [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).) BC Athens, (COMIC: The Chains of Olympus [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) 1892, (GAME: The Eternity Clock [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Lake District in 1927, (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and his favourite species included the Ood, (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and the Kahler. (TV: A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) He also had a fondness for strange words, such as \"Protocols\", (COMIC: Apotheosis [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) \"Shenanigans\", (TV: The Almost People [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) \"Toggle\", (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) \"Vim\", \"vigour\", (PROSE: The Dreaming [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and \"glockenspiel\". (AUDIO: The Yearn [+]Angus Dunican, All of Time and Space (The Eleventh Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2023).)\n\nHe also had a fondness for music, and claimed to have played with various composers and musicians. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) Amy Pond even once caught him attempting to conceal a Euphonium behind his back. (HOMEVID: Good Night [+]Steven Moffat, 2011.) He liked the Beatles, and thought that Ringo Starr was the most unappreciated member of the band, (GAME: City of the Daleks [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).) but also liked music more contemporary, at one time visiting a studio to contribute some urban backing vocals. (WC: Pond Life [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who television stories series 7 (BBC Red Button, 2012).) However, he appeared to greatly dislike the \"Chicken Dance\", grimacing and plugging his ears upon hearing it. (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor liked museums, (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) fluid controls, (TV: Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) football, (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) \"big flashy lighty things\", cupboards, (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) cockerels, (TV: The Rebel Flesh [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) fairgrounds, (HOMEVID: Good Night [+]Steven Moffat, 2011.) buttons, hat stands, (GAME: The Eternity Clock [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) \"good monsters\", (COMIC: The Chains of Olympus [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) rocks, (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) video games, (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) carrier pigeons, (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and sandcastles. (COMIC: A Wing and a Prayer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He was a great admirer of Socrates, (COMIC: The Chains of Olympus [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and his favourite number was 11. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nHis \"two least favourite things ever\" were money and death, (COMIC: The Blood of Azrael [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and he also disliked monologues, (TV: The Hungry Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) clowns, Rubik's cubes, (TV: Night Terrors [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Twitter, (TV: The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) lamps, (TV: Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) rats, (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) shapeshifters, (GAME: The Gunpowder Plot [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2011).) \"cold [and] brutal\" places, (GAME: The Eternity Clock [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) teleportation, (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) and sand. (COMIC: A Wing and a Prayer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor felt distressed when the subject of his future came into question, (TV: The Almost People [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) preferring to keep his goodbyes short and swift, (GAME: Return to Earth [+]Oli Smith, Deep Silver (2010).) and wanting to avoid his future rather than investigate it, (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) due to his dislike for endings. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) However, he knew that things had to end in order for new things to begin. (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) Reflecting on bygone times or thinking about a season of his life coming to a close saddened him, especially if it concerned his own mortality. (TV: Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) Despite his dislike of looking back on his previous lives, (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) he was comfortable with keeping mementos of his past, (GAME: TARDIS [+]James Moran, Phil Ford and Sean Millard, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010)., The Gunpowder Plot [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2011).) and enjoyed seeing old friends. (TV: Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).)\n\nThough he initially hated certain foods, such as apples and bacon, because of his \"new mouth\", (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) he eventually came to like them. (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) He liked Jammie Dodgers most of all, (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Doctor Drops In [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Night Terrors [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) but also had a liking for cake, (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) with Pontefract cakes being one of his favourites. (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) He also favoured the combination of fish fingers and custard, which he called fish custard. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nHe liked sweets, custard cream biscuits, (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Torodon tea, (PROSE: Hunter's Moon [+]Paul Finch, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2011).) and decaffeinated Frappuccino, (PROSE: Touched by an Angel [+]Jonathan Morris, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2011).) but disliked drinking water, (COMIC: The Golden Ones [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) sea pumpkins, (GAME: Shadows of the Vashta Nerada [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).) ginger biscuits, (PROSE: Dead of Winter [+]James Goss, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2011).) musk tea, (PROSE: Dark Horizons [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) vegetables, (TV: Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and bourbon biscuits. (PROSE: Chasing the Dawn [+]Jenny T Colgan, Star Tales (2019).) His favourite fruit was the pomegranate, (PROSE: The Water Thief [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and he disliked drinking any kind of wine. (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nA strong believer in hope and redemption, (TV: The Hungry Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) the Eleventh Doctor saw every life as important and meaningful, (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010)., The Rebel Flesh [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) believing that \"every life [was] a pile of good things and bad things\", and that while \"the good things [didn't] always soften the bad things\", he also thought that \"the bad things [didn't] necessarily spoil the good things or make them unimportant\". (TV: Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) He tried to see the best in people, thinking that anyone would help someone else in need. (TV: The History of the Doctor [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who (BBC Three, 2013).)\n\nBecause he saw the universe as \"vast and complicated and ridiculous\", (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) where everything was \"forever growing and shrinking and creating and destroying and never remaining the same for a single millisecond\", (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) the Doctor believed that \"impossible things\" were the result of \"miracles\". He believed that one should \"never ignore a coincidence\", (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) because it was what \"the universe [did] for fun\", (TV: Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and that they should \"never knowingly be serious\", (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) though he claimed he was \"always serious\", but had \"days off\". (TV: Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) He also saw board signs as \"suggestions rather than orders\". (TV: A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) He viewed Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons as \"boring\" times, but liked Saturdays, believing them to be \"temporal tipping points [where] anything [was] possible.\" (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) He did no think there were \"stupid questions\". (COMIC: Pay the Piper [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHe was afraid of spiders, (GAME: Blood of the Cybermen [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).) and got scared on ghost trains. (HOMEVID: Good Night [+]Steven Moffat, 2011.)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor didn't think of himself as a good man, (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) being susceptible to becoming more vicious and unforgiving when he didn't have company to restrain his dark side. (TV: A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) In his more ruthless moments, he was not afraid to strike down those who committed horrific acts. (TV: Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) When he prepared to euthanise a star whale when he thought it was the safest option to keep the Starship UK afloat, the Doctor did not mince his words on the \"murder\" he was about to commit, and how he \"[wouldn't] be the Doctor anymore\" after he did it, and refused to hear anything from Amy and Liz 10, declaring that \"nobody human [had] anything to say to [him]\". (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) He also refused to accept the War Doctor until he saw his own hypocrisy and the war incarnation being a better man than him. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThough he showed disdain for guns, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) claiming they \"made people stupid\", (COMIC: Assimilation² [+]Scott & David Tipton and Tony Lee, IDW Star Trek crossovers (IDW Publishing, 2012).) the Doctor was willing to use a gun in non-harmful ways, (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) or to threaten his adversaries. (TV: A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) He also disliked knives, but believed them useful for spreading butter and jam on crumpets. (PROSE: The Dreaming [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nBelieving that time was \"not the boss of [him]\", (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) the Eleventh Doctor firmly believed that \"time [could] be rewritten\". (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) However, he knew that history could not be changed at random, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and that events had to happen if they had already been experienced, (TV: Time [+]Steven Moffat, Comic Relief specials comic relief 2011 (BBC One, 2011)., Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) as well as avoiding changing fixed points in time, (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) but was willing to take advantage of temporal tipping points to change history for the better. (TV: Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) As he explained to Clara, the Doctor saw time as a tapestry, with influential people needing to be left alone lest the \"patterns they['d] woven [become] unravel[led]\". (COMIC: A Wing and a Prayer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nMuch like his previous incarnation, the Eleventh Doctor felt his age when it took him a long time to figure things out. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Night Terrors [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2011 (BBC One, 2011)., Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Because of his age, he was sometimes pessimistic, looking at the negative things about life. (TV: Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) However, he admitted he could see the positive things with help from companions, (HOMEVID: Meanwhile in the TARDIS [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who - Minisodes series 5 (2010).) and described sharing his travels with them as the \"greatest adventure\". (TV: The Curse of the Black Spot [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) When thinking about how to solve a problem, the Doctor blocked out all outside distractions, even his companions' comments, (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and would use reverse psychology to help people re-evaluate themselves and their situation. (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nHe fully expected his companions to disobey him, as most of his previous ones had, and was surprised when Clara Oswald listened to his instructions. (TV: Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) He also took a liking to people who were observant and good at making deductions, (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and showed great sympathy for those who had suffered terribly at the hands of outside influences, even when others looked at them as \"creature[s]\". (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nOpenly describing himself as \"obsessive-compulsive\", (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) the Doctor was known to let his curiosity over enigmas get the better of him, often putting himself and others in harm's way for answers. (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) His insistence on solving mysteries also led him to take on Amy Pond and Clara Oswald as companions. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) River was aware of the Doctor's interest in enigmas, and would be purposely cryptic to allure his assistance on an adventure, (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and his enemies also knew the best way to trap the Doctor was to lure him in with a mystery. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor saw himself as being \"way past strange\", but also thought that he was \"probably incredible.\" (WC: The Bells of Saint John: A Prequel [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who episode prequels series 7 (BBC, 2013).)\n\nRegarding his other incarnations, the Eleventh Doctor liked to make fun of his younger selves, especially his tenth incarnation, jokingly calling him \"sandshoes\" to annoy him. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) He did, however, admire the Ninth Doctor, believing him to have been \"fantastic\". (COMIC: The Promise [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHe held great admiration for the Twelfth Doctor, viewing his mere existence as uplifting as it assured him that he had a future despite thinking he was the last incarnation. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) He also displayed joy at the Curator's resemblance to the Fourth Doctor and the hope he gave him that Gallifrey still existed. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThough he preferred the attention of his friends while he was \"being clever\", (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and deeply enjoyed having an audience, the Doctor was also content talking to himself on occasion. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) He once claimed he took on companions solely to have someone other than himself to talk to, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) but was aware he had a tendency to talk to people without checking if they were there. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) When facing a personal problem, or when seeing a situation as too dangerous for his companions, the Doctor would demand they return to the TARDIS, (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) or would leave them in the safest place possible. (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) At times, he would trick them into returning to the TARDIS, (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) or have someone else return them to safety for him. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nHe was very affectionate towards his TARDIS, (TV: The Curse of the Black Spot [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) calling it the \"best ship in the universe\", (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) and addressing it as \"dear\" and calling it \"sexy\". (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) He would also get defensive when others criticised his piloting of the TARDIS, such as how he \"[left] the breaks on\" when landing, (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) or when they had already figured out how to explain how it was \"bigger on the inside\", as he enjoyed seeing their reactions, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and was easily aggravated when someone harmed his ship. (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe Doctor viewed humanity as \"creatures of hope, forever building and reaching\" and learning from mistakes as they \"[strove] for greater\", with their achievements outnumbering their failings. (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) However, he also likened them to rabbits that he would \"never get done saving\". (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nWhile he could get annoyed when others ignored him due to kissing each other, (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010)., Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) and was extremely confused on what to do after River and Clara kissed him for the first time, (TV: Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) the Eleventh Doctor was good at giving relationship advice, (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010)., Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and could become quite flirty with those he knew would be annoyed by his friendly remarks. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) However, he rejected the idea of being intimate with his friends, doing everything he could to stop Amy kissing him, (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and got annoyed with being sniffed in a seductive manner. (TV: The Doctor Appears [+]Steven Moffatt, Comic Relief specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor initially had a very distrusting nature towards River Song. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) However, the two eventually grew to love one another, even marrying on the battlefield of a broken timeline. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) The Doctor came to love River so much that he couldn't bear to think of her death and the prospects of never seeing his eccentric wife again. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) He also delayed what he knew to be their final date for as long as possible to keep from losing her, repeatedly cancelling them going to Darillium. (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nHis lack of trust in others was also shown by the way he acted with Clara Oswald. Although he was nice to her whenever they were together, the Doctor grew brooding and suspicious whenever Clara's back was turned, (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) until he finally confronted Clara about her impossible nature, and realised that Clara genuinely had no idea that she had lived other lives and was happy to find out that she wasn't part of whatever had happened to her, (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) leading him to start trusting her. As his feelings and attachment to Clara grew, he became somewhat possessive of her and jealous of other men expressing attraction to her, with Mr Clever sarcastically noting how eager he was to please Clara. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) The Twelfth Doctor later indicated that the Eleventh Doctor thought of himself as Clara's boyfriend, as he clarified to Clara that \"[he] [was] not [her] boyfriend\" and that it wasn't her mistake he was referring to when he said that. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor was admired by children for his eccentric, tender, playful and childlike personality. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) He did not talk down to them, treating them as equals, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2011 (BBC One, 2011)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) not dismissing their issues, (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) and tried to encourage them to rise to the occasion. (TV: TV: The Hungry Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Night Terrors [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) He showed a great deal of compassion for children, unable to resist helping if one was upset or scared, (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010)., The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Night Terrors [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and was greatly enraged when people tried to use children as weapons, (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) claiming it to be an act that pushed him \"way beyond mercy\". (COMIC: The Golden Ones [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor thought the Daleks as being \"masters of hate and fear and destruction\", (GAME: The Eternity Clock [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and was very hostile to them, saying they were \"the worst thing[s] in all creation\" and attacking one to provoke it into revealing its true nature to Winston Churchill. (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) He showed considerable brutality towards them and took great enjoyment in destroying them. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) He was also disgusted when he learned the Daleks considered hatred to be beautiful, having previously thought they had \"run out of ways to make [him] sick\". However, the Doctor felt genuine pity for Oswin Oswald after he realised that she had been turned into a Dalek and, although he told her that she was no longer human, he still treated her as such due to her still retaining her humanity. He was grateful to her for allowing him and his friends to escape and reluctant to leave her behind, only doing so when she ordered him to run. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nHe also believed that the Weeping Angels were the \"most malevolent life form evolution [had] ever produced\". (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nAccording to Amy Pond, the Eleventh Doctor was \"a complete buffoon, with a silly fringe, and bandy legs, and the most bizarre way of talking\", (PROSE: The Forgotten Army [+]Brian Minchin, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2010).) with Tasha Lem calling him a \"fatuous egotist\". (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) Alec Palmer compared the Eleventh Doctor to a Ministry agent, calling him \"capricious [and] brilliant\", while Emma Grayling called him \"deceitful\", saying he had \"a sliver of ice in his heart\". (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nDuring his time on Trenzalore, the Doctor grew to love the people of the town of Christmas, (PROSE: The Dreaming [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) repairing and building toys for the town's children, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) as well as becoming a parental and protective figure to them, (PROSE: Strangers in the Outland [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., The Dreaming [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) telling them tales of his exploits, making an ice skating ring for them, (PROSE: An Apple a Day... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) celebrating his victories with them, receiving drawings of his achievements, teaching them the Drunk giraffe dance and being the centre of the celebrations' group hugs. The Doctor also assisted the adults of the town, repairing Barnable's family barn, and making it bigger on the inside, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) fixing the Snow Farm after it was sabotaged by Ice Warrior Zontan, (PROSE: Let it Snow [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and venturing into the Outland with the Trenzalore Lifeboat crew to find Tiberius Gluck's body. (PROSE: Strangers in the Outland [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Growing protective of the people of Christmas, the Doctor refused to leave them at the mercy of the Papal Mainframe, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) and ensured they remained out of the way of the siege's incursions, (PROSE: Let it Snow [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) getting them to tell him of anything out of the ordinary. (PROSE: An Apple a Day... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He especially developed a friendship with a child named Barnable. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) In his final days, when he was in a senile state, the Doctor still remembered Barnable and looked for him, Amy and Clara in those around him. (PROSE: The Dreaming [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He also grew closer to Handles, seemingly carrying him everywhere with him, (PROSE: An Apple a Day... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) with the head's deactivation upsetting him greatly. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAfraid for his life every day, (PROSE: Let it Snow [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor would stand and look down from his clocktower once a day to remind him of what he was protecting, eventually seeming to \"forget he'd lived any other life\". However, during the first three hundred years of the siege, the Doctor would argue with himself about protecting the town, eventually concluding that every life he saved was a victory in and of itself, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) but felt guilt for the casualties that came in the siege's wake, especially those directly caused by himself, forcibly suppressing his memories of these deaths so he could enjoy himself. (PROSE: Let it Snow [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nSlowing turning senile in his inhabiting of the planet, the Doctor would have trouble determining the meaning of questions directed at him, forgetting the details of his plans, (PROSE: Let it Snow [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) taking a while to register information, (PROSE: An Apple a Day... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and forgetting people he had met. (PROSE: Strangers in the Outland [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) After seven hundred and fifty years of the siege, the Doctor took to whittling to keep his degrading mind focused. (PROSE: The Dreaming [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) However, he would regain his youthful vigour whenever he felt there was any danger. (PROSE: An Apple a Day... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., The Dreaming [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nNo longer able to regenerate, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) the Doctor held a fear of death greater than before, but kept this fear in the back of his mind. (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) However, when he heard about his supposed death at Lake Silencio, he lost all composure. (TV: The Almost People [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) When bestowed a new regeneration cycle by the Time Lords, he was peaceful in death, remarking that change was \"good\". (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) He also expressed joy when finding out he had a future in the Twelfth Doctor. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nNearing the end of his life, the Doctor grew weary and accepting of his fate, not trying to avoid his death and resigning himself to his fate by refusing to abandon both the Time Lords and the people of Trenzalore. When the time came, the Doctor faced the Daleks fearlessly, wanting to protect Clara and the people of Christmas one last time. However, when the Time Lords unexpectedly granted him a new cycle of regenerations, the Doctor regained his fighting spirit, using his regeneration to destroy Nacrana Va Hateen and the attacking Daleks with it. Though restored to his youthful form, the Doctor continued to accept his forthcoming regeneration, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) but was unhappy to hear his next incarnation would be old and grey haired. He tried comforting Clara, first by phoning her future self to assure her his new incarnation would still be him, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and then telling her present self that people change throughout their lives and what was important was to remember who they were, promising to always remember when \"the Doctor was [him]\". Seeing hallucinations of Amy Pond, the Doctor removed his bow tie as a sign of his passing, closed his eyes and prepared for the change. When Clara still protested, his last act was to smile back at her and offer his hand, but he regenerated before she could reach. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor talked with his hands and calculated with gestures, a gesticulation that was outside of his control and often distracted him. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Indeed, it was rare for the Doctor to go long without wringing his hands together, (TV: Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Doctor Drops In [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., Time [+]Steven Moffat, Comic Relief specials comic relief 2011 (BBC One, 2011)., Night Terrors [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., The Doctor Appears [+]Steven Moffatt, Comic Relief specials (BBC One, 2013)., Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., A Night with the Stars [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) keeping them clenched just below his lapels, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Time [+]Steven Moffat, Comic Relief specials comic relief 2011 (BBC One, 2011)., Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2011 (BBC One, 2011)., Good as Gold [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., The Doctor Appears [+]Steven Moffatt, Comic Relief specials (BBC One, 2013)., The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) or randomly clapping them together.

(TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) He was also an extremely good detective, able to anticipate how River Song would attempt to assassinate him, (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and deduced the Great Intelligence's plans by surveying Walter Simeon's study. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor proved to be a decent hand-to-hand combatant when forced to fight, (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) being able to knock someone to the ground with ease, (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) and render his spam duplicate unconscious with a single punch to the head.

(TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) He was also a good climber. (GAME: The Eternity Clock [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHe was stealthy enough to hide from Amelia while luring her to stay in a museum, (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) evade White House security once they were distracted and make his way to President Richard Nixon's desk without them noticing, (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) disappear from an alley when the Paternoster Gang's view of him was obstructed, (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) and vanish when Walter Simeon turned his back on him in his study. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) He even manoeuvred around the Twelfth Cyber-legion's ships without them detecting him, and sneaked on to a stage as a Headless Monk, only being spotted when he freely revealed himself, and soon sneaked away again to a safety once the room was darkened. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) While he was only able to pickpocket Mandy Tanner's notebook after three failed attempts, (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and failed to realise when Winston Churchill stole his TARDIS key during a farewell hug, (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) the Doctor was capable of swiping objects from people without them noticing. (COMIC: The Golden Ones [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor was an excellent shot with a pistol, capable of hitting a small target from a long distance. (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)

(PROSE: Death Riders [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor could also use telepathy, but only at a low level, being able to pick up thoughts and project his own into others. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) When speed was essential, he chose to head-butt Craig Owens to transfer memories into his mind. (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) He also showed the ability to quiet a crowd simply by saying the word \"hush\" and placing his finger on his lip, (TV: Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and could apply a mental block to anyone trying to read his mind, even if they had already taken over parts of his brain.

(TV: The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2011 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nHe showed extensive knowledge of computers and coding, and proved to be both a skilled hacker, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and effective at manually rewiring devices.

He also knew how to work a vortex manipulator. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nWhen someone had been poisoned, the Doctor was capable of mixing up an antibiotic remedy out of nearby materials. (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nHe could also analyse objects and locations by taste or smell.

(PROSE: Shroud of Sorrow [+]Tommy Donbavand, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor could drive a fire truck, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) a camper van, (TV: Amy's Choice [+]Simon Nye, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and a sports car, (PROSE: Heart of Stone [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) ride a horse (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and a motorcycle, (TVThe Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and pilot a helicopter.

(TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nBecause he was a Time Lord, the Eleventh Doctor could also remember people who were erased from existence, (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and alternate timelines.

(TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor was one of the more youthful looking incarnations, (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) something he took great pride in, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) with Amy Pond describing him as a man in his \"mid-twenties\". (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) He had softer features than his previous incarnation, with green eyes, a big nose, a noticeable scar atop his forehead, and a large chin, (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) which was the subject of much ridicule, (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) with Artie Maitland identifying the Doctor as an alien purely because of his chin, (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) although Rose Tyler thought that he had a \"fantastic jaw\". (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Like his ninth incarnation, he had large ears, which became more prominent when his head was shaved, with Clara Oswald comparing them to \"rocket fins\". (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) He had hair under his armpits, a few hairs on his chest (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and small brown hairs on his legs. (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) When asking for a replacement pair of shoes, he claimed his feet were size 10, but quite wide. (TV: The Rebel Flesh [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Due to consuming a large amount of fish custard, he was of a heavy build. (AUDIO: Regeneration Impossible [+]Alfie Shaw, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nUpon first inspection, the Eleventh Doctor initially thought he was \"too handsome for comfort\", but appreciated the sharp corners of his cheekbones, though he was less enthusiastic upon noticing his chin, exclaiming that he had \"a face like a boot\". Nevertheless, he was pleased with his appearance, feeling he was a \"bit handsome, [a] bit silly, [and a] bit like a banana\". (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nBecause of his youth, Sophie and Mels Zucker considered the Doctor attractive, (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and Amy once tried to seduce him. (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Clara found him \"not unattractive\", (AUDIO: Paradise Lost [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and admitted to having a crush on him when under the effect of a Truth Field. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nGeorge Litefoot described the Eleventh Doctor as \"a rangy man with a face that seemed simultaneously ancient and youthful\", (AUDIO: The Jago & Litefoot Revival [+]Jonathan Barnes, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2017).) with Amy teasingly saying he \"look[ed] about nine[-years-old]\" (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and Clive Finch noting that he was close in age to the 19-year-old Rose Tyler. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Jo Grant and River Song both poked fun at his youthful appearance, the former showing surprise that the Doctor could turn his face \"into a baby's\", and the latter referring to it as \"the face of a twelve-year-old\". (TV: Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010)., The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) Tasha Lem described his body as \"nice\" and \"tight\". (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe First Doctor, based on visions he had of his future, considered his eleventh incarnation to be \"fit and agile\". (PROSE: A Big Hand for the Doctor [+]Eoin Colfer, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).)\n\nWhen he received a psychic image of him, the Second Doctor saw his eleventh incarnation as \"a young man, [with] his fringe hanging over one eye, his face [being] long and angular, [and] his eyes glittering with intelligence and mischief\". (AUDIO: Shadow of Death [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) However, in the account of his trial on Gallifrey where he was shown his future incarnations as potential direct successors for his forced regeneration, the Second Doctor rejected the Eleventh Doctor's appearance because he \"[would not] do at all\" for his next body. (TV: The War Games in Colour [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, adapted from The War Games (Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke), Doctor Who season 6 (BBC Four, 2024).)\n\nWhen Affinity took on the Eleventh Doctor's appearance, the Twelfth Doctor noted that his eleventh incarnation was \"a young man in a tweed jacket and mismatched bow tie, with a flop of hair that looked as if it was about to detach itself from his head and go solo\". (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAs his age caught up with him during the Siege of Trenzalore, the Doctor's hair greyed, wrinkles formed on his face and he began to use a walking stick. By the siege's end, the Doctor had become an old man, his hair having turned white, grown longer with slight balding and his face having deeper wrinkles. After receiving his second regeneration cycle and undergoing an explosive regeneration \"reset\", the Doctor's youth was returned to him before his regeneration started properly. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor had dark brown hair, which was initially long and combed back, (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) but was later cut short and stylised as a comb over parted in the right. (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) In a moment of boredom, the Doctor shaved his head clean, but his hair grew back during his time on Trenzalore, eventually turning grey. Before being granted a new regeneration cycle, the Doctor's hair had turned white, and began balding in the centre of his head, with him stylising his remaining hair in a backcomb similar to the style he had used in his first incarnation. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhen imprisoned, he would grow a scruffy beard, which he always shaved off at the first opportunity. However, one of these instances where he had a beard was faked, as the Doctor was inhabiting the Teselecta at the time and had the crew imitate hair growth to avoid revealing the deception. (TV: Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor's first outfit, which he stole from the Royal Leadworth Hospital, consisted of a single-breasted blazer forged from light fawn brown Donegal tweed with elbow patches, a burgundy striped dress shirt and bow tie with matching braces, rolled up midnight blue trousers and dark, laced up boots. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) He also wore a gold wristwatch with an expansion band on his left wrist, wearing the face on the back of his wrist rather than the front. (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nHe also wore a Harris tweed blazer, (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) but lost it while escaping the Weeping Angels aboard the Byzantium (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) after which he resumed wearing his Donegal tweed jacket, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) though occasionally wore a replacement Harris tweed blazer. (GAME: City of the Daleks [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).) Following Amy and Rory's honeymoon, the Doctor began wearing a Shetland tweed sportjacket and dark brogue boots. (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nHe would accompany his tweed blazers with braces and bow ties, with colours ranging from burgundy, navy, and blue. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) His shirt pattern also varied from striped, window pane and plain, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and also a plain white shirt with black buttons. (TV: Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).) On at least one occasion, he wore a white undershirt beneath his attire, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and replaced his trousers with black jeans. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nDuring Amy and Rory's honeymoon, (COMIC: When Worlds Collide [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor began wearing a double-breasted olive green moleskin overcoat, (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and wore it in place of his tweed jacket on occasion. (TV: The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) while also wearing a black moleskin overcoat when deceiving Kahler-Tek in Mercy, Nevada. (TV: A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nDuring his retirement to the Victorian era, the Doctor wore a black top hat, a wine purple frock coat with black collars forged from sheep fur, a single-breasted waistcoat of plum purple velvet with a pocket watch. He initially discarded his bow tie for a black cravat, (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) but inadvertently resumed wearing a violet purple bow tie decorated with two flowers after he regained his sense of adventure. He also wore an ash grey scarf. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAfter meeting Clara Oswald while wearing a monk's robe, the Doctor adopted a new attire, featuring an eggplant purple cashmere frock coat that reached mid-thigh with a corduroy collar, wearing it with a violet purple bow tie and braces, dark jeans and a new pair of brown leather boots. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) He later added a charcoal grey waistcoat, complete with a double fob chain and a watch medallion, (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) but later replaced it with a single-breasted waistcoat of raven black velvet with 6 buttons, (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) before switching it with a single-breasted waistcoat done in ebony black with ligth cheque. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) While in Victorian Yorkshire, the Doctor wore a brown chequered version of his Victorian attire, as well as a maroon bowler cap. (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nHe varied the patterns of his violet bow ties to include wheat, (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) chevron squares, (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) polka-dotts, (TV: Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) flowers, (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and thistles. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) He also wore cuffs on his sleeves. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhilst on Trenzalore, the Doctor resumed wearing the frock coat from his time in Victorian London, though with a waistcoat coloured in dark purple. During the Siege of Trenzalore, as the Doctor aged drastically, his clothes grew steadily worn out as well. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) To cope with the cold temperatures, the Doctor would also wear a woollen cap, scarf, gloves and a fur coat. (PROSE: Strangers in the Outland)\n\nAfter losing her to the Weeping Angels, the Doctor started wearing Amy Pond's glasses as a keepsake. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan, The Snowmen, The Rings of Akhaten, The Day of the Doctor)\n\nWhile attending Amy Pond and Rory Williams' wedding, the Doctor wore a black tailcoat  with a white bow tie, white scarf, and a black top hat. (TV: The Big Bang) He wore it again, while carrying a sonic cane, when confronting the Teselecta while dying of poisoning, (TV: Let's Kill Hitler) and during trips with River. (HOMEVID: First Night, Last Night)\n\nWhile visiting Abigail Pettigrew with Kazran Sardick, the Doctor wore many different outfits, including a long multicoloured scarf similar to ones worn by his fourth incarnation, a white tuxedo and black bow tie while visiting California in 1952, and a fez on a trip to Egypt. (TV: A Christmas Carol)\n\nWhile travelling through Malthill Way in 1745, the Doctor wore a burgundy full-skirted knee-length coat with golden edges, raisin purple knee breeches with white silk stockings, a violet waistcoat with golden edges, and a white frilled shirt. (COMIC: Malthill Way)\n\nWhile in the National Museum, the Doctor found a fez and, stating that \"fezzes [were] cool\", began wearing it, until it was destroyed by River. (TV: The Big Bang) He obtained a new fez from Albert Einstein, (TV: Death Is the Only Answer) and wore it during a trip with Kazran Sardick and Abigail Pettigrew. (TV: A Christmas Carol) Upon spotting a fez in the Under Gallery, he immediately donned it, and then used it to test the safety of a time fissure, only for it to be brought back by the War Doctor and left in 1562 England. (TV: The Day of the Doctor)\n\nThe Doctor was given a beige Stetson by Craig Owens, (TV: Closing Time) which he wore inside the Teselecta, and replicated it for his trip in America, where the replica was shot by River while the original Stetson remained intact. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut, The Wedding of River Song) He later wore a different Stetson while Marshal of Mercy, but gave it to Kahler-Tek upon making him the new Marshal. (TV: A Town Called Mercy)\n\nThe events of both TV: Journey's End and The Day of the Doctor retroactively complicate the question of whether the Eleventh Doctor is the \"eleventh\" Doctor or not. Certainly, there are narratives like COMIC: The Age of Ice in which Captain Kath Braxton explicitly calls his predecessor his \"tenth incarnation\". And other stories, like TV: The Lodger and The Name of the Doctor make it explicit that he is the \"Eleventh\" Doctor. In TV: The Time of the Doctor, the Doctor agrees with Clara that he is \"number Eleven\", and that his predecessor was \"number Ten,\" but the War Doctor is not included in the count as he chose not to use the name Doctor. However, while he says that the Tenth Doctor used two regenerations and the War Doctor also counted as one, meaning he is the thirteenth incarnation, he considers himself the eleventh incarnation to call himself the Doctor.\n\nTemplate:Companions of the Eleventh Doctor\nTemplate:NameSort",
