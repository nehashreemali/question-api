  "content": "After emerging from his previous incarnation's decision to regenerate into a warrior with the Elixir of Life after he failed to save Cass Fermazzi on Karn, (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) the Doctor set about joining the Time War as an independent agent, due to his disagreement on how the Time Lords were handling the conflict, (AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) believing he could end the Time War by himself, until he was awoken to the severity of the conflict by the losses of Fey Truscott-Sade (COMIC: The Clockwise War [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2018).) and Davros. (PROSE: The Third Wise Man [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) When he decided to fight alongside the Time Lords, (COMIC: Ambush [+]George Mann, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe, 2017).) he quickly became regarded as a war hero who commanded a great deal of respect from the Time Lord military. Gastron stated that, during the Time War, the \"Doctor of War\" was known for going into battle unarmed, but winning nonetheless, with his unarmed state being the last thing his enemies saw before their deaths. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nAs early as his beginnings, (AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) the Doctor had decided not to allow himself companions to ensure he was not responsible for the safety of another, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) but did find recurring comrades-in-arms in the Eleventh General, (PROSE: The Third Wise Man [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) Commander Veklin (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) and the berserker-class cyborg Case (AUDIO: Consequences [+]Timothy X Atack, Warbringer (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) as he fought the monsters forged in the fires of the battlegrounds, (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., Consequences [+]Timothy X Atack, Warbringer (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021)., Rewind [+]Timothy X Atack, Battlegrounds (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2022)., The Horror [+]Robert Valentine, He Who Fights With Monsters (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2022).) and also found himself pestered by the political machinations of the Sixth Tamasan (AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) and the War Ollistra. (AUDIO: The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) As he faced threats from the Barber-Surgeon (AUDIO: The Mission [+]Robert Valentine, He Who Fights With Monsters (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2022).) and the Volatix Cabal, the Doctor was forced to ally himself with the Child Master (COMIC: The Organ Grinder [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) until he found a way to escape the Time War. (COMIC: Fast Asleep [+]Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nFollowing a brief respite on Keska, (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) the Doctor found himself drawn more into Cardinal Ollistra's unscrupulous machinations, (AUDIO: The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) such as trying to weaponise the Neverwhen, (AUDIO: The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) and then rescuing her from the Sontarans (AUDIO: The Eternity Cage [+]Andrew Smith, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) while also fending off the masterplan of the Dalek Time Strategist to utilise the Enigma and remove the Time Lord from history with temporal dissolution. (AUDIO: The Enigma Dimension [+]Nicholas Briggs, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) Even when reunited with Leela, (AUDIO: The Lady of Obsidian [+]Andrew Smith, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) the Doctor became so disillusioned with the war that he concluded it could only end when both the Time Lords and the Daleks were destroyed. (AUDIO: The Enigma Dimension [+]Nicholas Briggs, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) He was ultimately driven to end the war absolutely when a mission against the Eternity Circle in the Tantalus Eye resulted in the deaths of his companion, Cinder, and his mentor, Borusa, by the hands of the Time Lords. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nWhen faced with Rassilon's Ultimate Sanction, the Doctor prepared to use the Moment to end the Time War by committing genocide against both the Daleks and the Time Lords. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) However, the Moment's sentient interface led him down a different path by letting him view his future first-hand. By teaming up with his future incarnations, the Doctor's mind was opened to a peaceful way to end the Time War in lieu of the deadly alternative he was going to enact. Teaming up with past and future incarnations, the War Doctor helped to save Gallifrey from the Dalek Fleet by placing it in a pocket dimension. After departing from his future incarnations' company, and once again embracing the name of \"the Doctor\", the War Doctor regenerated into a younger body due to his advanced age. Unfortunately, due to his timeline being taken out of sync by the presence of his future incarnations, the Doctor would not remember saving Gallifrey, and his next incarnations were lead to believe they had destroyed Gallifrey instead of saving it until they experienced the events as the Eleventh Doctor, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) with the memory of the War Doctor being vilified and banished (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) until he was vindicated. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nIn an alternate timeline where Rassilon gave the Cybermen the means to conquer all of time and space, (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).) the War Doctor fought in an alternative version of the Last Great Time War, with the Cybermen replacing the Daleks (COMIC: Prologue: The War Doctor [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Supremacy of the Cybermen prologues (Titan Comics, 2016).) after the Cybermen erased the Daleks from existence. (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).) In this timeline, the Doctor detonated the Moment inside the barn as it was surrounded by Cybermen. (COMIC: Prologue: The War Doctor [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Supremacy of the Cybermen prologues (Titan Comics, 2016).) This timeline was eventually unwritten by Rassilon and the Twelfth Doctor. (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nFull of self-doubt and self-loathing, the War Doctor not only thought himself unworthy of the name of \"the Doctor\", (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) dispatching the moniker with the \"philosophies and ideals\" shared with it (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) in favour of the title of \"Warrior\", (PROSE: The Stranger [+]Gary Russell, Heroes and Monsters Collection (Heroes and Monsters Collection, 2015).) but also of any identity at all, eventually leaving it to others to choose how they wished to address him, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) as he did not carry a name \"as a rule\". (AUDIO: The Eternity Cage [+]Andrew Smith, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) He would show great irritation, and even extreme bouts of anger, with anyone who addressed him as \"Doctor\", especially if they did so after he committed what he considered to be an atrocity. (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Thousand Worlds [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., Eye of Harmony [+]Ken Bentley, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., The Enigma Dimension [+]Nicholas Briggs, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).; COMIC: The Clockwise War [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2018)., Kill God [+]Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016)., Physician, Heal Thyself [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).; PROSE: The Third Wise Man [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).)\n\nRather than a \"good man\", the War Doctor saw himself as a \"lost cause\" that did what was necessary to end a \"sorry chapter of cosmic history\", as it was his \"reason for being.\" (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) His inability to find an alternative to end the Time War consumed him with so much guilt he considered it easier to view himself as a different man to the Doctor. (AUDIO: The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) He even made himself believe that he had killed \"the Doctor\" on Karn. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) He did not see himself as a \"hero\", (AUDIO: Pretty Lies [+]Guy Adams, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) instead thinking himself as a \"monster\" that was \"steeped in the blood of war\", (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) becoming \"the stuff of nightmares\" and \"a demon let loose on the time streams\". (AUDIO: Pretty Lies [+]Guy Adams, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) However, he would immediately turn apologetic when he realised that he had stepped out of place; (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) and considered himself on the side of the collateral in the war, with the idea of having to sacrifice innocents weighing heavily on him, (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) and also believed that he fought for the sake of the other Time Lord soldiers, particularly the ones that looked to him for inspiration. (PROSE: Decoy [+]George Mann, The Target Storybook (2019).)\n\nDuring his first years fighting in the Time War, the Doctor saw the conflict as \"a challenge to overcome\", and showcased an arrogant and egotistical persona, not unlike his sixth incarnation. He made puns in the face of the Morlontoa, and viewed himself as \"handsome\", \"brilliant\", and \"modest\", though Fey Truscott-Sade instead described him as \"irritating\". Following the loss of Fey, the Doctor came to see the war as a \"tragedy to face\". (COMIC: The Clockwise War [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2018).)\n\nAs he grew older, the Doctor wanted the war to end, but felt it was his duty to continue to fight and play his part. (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) Despite wanting to see the hostilities end, he did not believe peace with the Daleks would ever be possible, (AUDIO: The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) and would be genuinely surprised when arriving somewhere that hadn't been touched by the fighting. (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) He instead took peace in the certainty of death being the one dependable constant. (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) For a while, he wished for his own death, so that he would no longer have to face such choices. (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).)\n\nThe War Doctor could be cagey and cranky, but would return the kind treatment he received from those who did not antagonise him if he was in a good enough mood. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).; AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Eternity Cage [+]Andrew Smith, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) He was overjoyed to be reunited with Leela, (AUDIO: The Lady of Obsidian [+]Andrew Smith, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) and the two quickly regained their old rhythm of teamwork. (AUDIO: The Enigma Dimension [+]Nicholas Briggs, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) He also made a point to be nice to fellow soldiers so as to inspire them to continue to survive and fight. (AUDIO: The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) While he did not accept acts of gratitude for his actions, he would ask for peace and quiet as a reward when the opportunity presented itself. (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).)\n\nHe acknowledged that the Time War had changed him, (PROSE: The Stranger [+]Gary Russell, Heroes and Monsters Collection (Heroes and Monsters Collection, 2015).; AUDIO: A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) making him renounce offering chances to his enemies, (COMIC: Kill God [+]Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) and unable to make the same promises his previous incarnations could, (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) recognising that his previous selves would be disappointed in what he had become, (AUDIO: The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., Exit Strategy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and also reflected how he was a lesser man than his successors, having become great men from the guilt they suffered from his actions. On meeting his future selves, the War Doctor viewed it as his privilege to \"light the flame\" that would forge their greatness. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nHe would also state the facts without thought for niceties or the fear he was spreading. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).; AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Eternity Cage [+]Andrew Smith, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., Pretty Lies [+]Guy Adams, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) He could also be stern, as indicated by his annoyance with childlike vocabulary, considering the fact that the Eleventh Doctor used such words as a proof that he was \"ashamed of being a grown-up\". He berated his future selves for pointing their sonic screwdrivers as weapons, calling the screwdriver a \"scientific instrument, not [a] water pistol\", though later found himself wielding his screwdriver in a similar fashion against an attacking Dalek. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor was tired of the suffering and anarchy the Time War had caused, having lost the will to survive beyond the war and his self-beliefs, but still maintained a whimsical charm, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) being very attached to his TARDIS and overjoyed when reunited with it after an extended period of time separated from his ship. (AUDIO: The Lady of Obsidian [+]Andrew Smith, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) He also addressed the TARDIS as \"old girl\", did not wish to get his boots dirty in case he made a mess when he stepped in the TARDIS, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) and reassured Siatak that he would act as an intermediary between the Time Lords and the Voord when the war ended. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nThough the Time War caused the War Doctor to be saddled with much regret and weighted guilt, he also managed to be jolly and compassionate with a few moments of witty humour and sarcasm, such as providing a drink to Lithea, (AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) throwing Veklin's rude comments back at her with a laugh, (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) refusing to identify himself after his interrogator demanded his silence, (AUDIO: The Thousand Worlds [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) wryly replying that he felt \"terrific\" when questioned by Jarad, (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) mocking Kruger's attempt to intimidate him during an interrogation, (AUDIO: The Shadow Vortex [+]David Llewellyn, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) laughing at jokes he accidentally made, (PROSE: The Stranger [+]Gary Russell, Heroes and Monsters Collection (Heroes and Monsters Collection, 2015).) pointing two bananas as if they were pistols, (COMIC: The Whole Thing's Bananas [+]Richard Dinnick, The Many Lives of Doctor Who (Titan Publishing Group, 2018).) telling Cinder they had \"places to go, [and] people to see\" while joyfully sneaking into Andor, joking that the Eternity Circle of Daleks weren't a circle while drawing an imaginary circle in the air with his finger to demonstrate his point, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) quipping that it was Lord Bentham's \"lucky day\" for unknowingly stumbling upon three incarnations of the Doctor at once when Bentham threatened the Doctor for apparently bewitching the Queen, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) and pretending not to know which TARDIS was his as a joke for his successors. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nThe War Doctor liked cats, (WC: Doctors Assemble! [+]James Goss, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).) and books, and also enjoyed with the view from the banks of the Rhine, the ash oceans of Astragard and the pleasure of Cleopatra's court. He found the Tantalus Eye to be breathtakingly beautiful, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) had fond memories of Marinus as a \"lush world of many ecosystems\", (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) and also maintained his old fondness for Earth, (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) and had good memories of Vildar. He held a great respect for artists and intellectuals, calling the Vildarans \"beautiful\". (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nHe would get short-tempered with those he thought were taking too long to think, (PROSE: The Third Wise Man [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) and also disliked not having the last word in a negotiation. (AUDIO: Eye of Harmony [+]Ken Bentley, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) He also would not stand for being patronised, (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) and, due to his belief that the dead should stay dead, was horrified to find that the Time Lords had been reviving soldiers to serve as \"cannon fodder\". (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nHe enjoyed water, (AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) the fruit juice of Keska, (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) a good cup of tea, (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) bananas, (COMIC: The Whole Thing's Bananas [+]Richard Dinnick, The Many Lives of Doctor Who (Titan Publishing Group, 2018).) and also considered marshmallows and Earl Grey tea specifically to be amongst the \"finer things in life\". (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nBeing open-minded, (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) the War Doctor believed in keeping his word, (AUDIO: The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) and second chances. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) While he stood by the right for others to possess free will, (AUDIO: A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) he was willing to strip it away if it meant peace. (AUDIO: The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) He also thought that those \"who would seek the Godhead must first walk with angels\", (COMIC: The Organ Grinder [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) and countered that \"fools seldom differ[ed]\" when he heard that \"great minds [thought] alike\". (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nSimilar to his seventh incarnation, the War Doctor was aware of the need to see the \"bigger picture\", such as choosing to give up his chance of living forever in a dreamworld so he could end the war for the sake of others. (AUDIO: The Keeper of Light [+]Phil Mulryne, Battlegrounds (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2022).) He also knew it would be selfish to undo Cinder's death instead of stopping the Daleks, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) and that it was entirely proper to sacrifice his people if it would save the universe. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) When his eleventh incarnation questioned him in their time stream on the actions that he had to make during the war, the War Doctor responded by defending those actions as being done \"without choice\" and \"in the name of peace and sanity.\" (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nConvincing himself to believe he was a different man with different ideals to his predecessors, (AUDIO: A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) the War Doctor was prone to bouts of anger and rage, especially when democracy prevented him from taking action to save lives. (AUDIO: Pretty Lies [+]Guy Adams, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) He roared in grief for Cinder and the Fifth Time Lord Battle Fleet, and hoisted Karlax by the throat in the air when provoked. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) He sometimes heard a voice in his head that represented \"the Doctor\" trying to convince him away from violence, but he forced himself to shut the voice behind a door in his mind. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nUnlike his other incarnations, the War Doctor endorsed the use of weapons, holding Dorium Maldovar at gunpoint to coerce his cooperation, (COMIC: The Whole Thing's Bananas [+]Richard Dinnick, The Many Lives of Doctor Who (Titan Publishing Group, 2018).) allowing Cinder to bring her gun aboard the TARDIS, using a Temporal Cannon to defend himself from a Dalek, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) and wielding a gun during the Fall of Arcadia to carve an inscription on a wall. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) He even commented that a gun fitted his hand better than psychic paper did. (COMIC: The Organ Grinder [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) However, he was known to enter battles unarmed in the Time War, (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) expressed dismay at using \"doomsday weapons\", (COMIC: The Organ Grinder [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) berated Cinder for pointing her gun at him when he showed no hostilities, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) and had a reluctance to have weapons aboard the TARDIS, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) owing to the fact \"she [did]n't like them\". (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor could react mercilessly to a situation, such as showing delight at the sight of Daleks being killed by a chronic tripwire, (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) killing Lara Zannis by un-writing her existence, (AUDIO: The Shadow Vortex [+]David Llewellyn, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) boiling Kaled mutants alive, attempting to subject a Dalek to a Temporal Cannon, leaving Karlax to his own death after Cinder's murder, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) and unceremoniously mowing down attacking Daleks with his TARDIS. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) He was also willing to abandon others if they provided no tactful advantage, almost leaving Dalek prisoners to their fates until Cinder convinced him to liberate them. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) While he still felt grief for the pain he inflicted and guilt for the lives he had to take, the Doctor did not allow his feelings to deter him from his objective to end the war, (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) and felt despair when he found out the consequences of his hard decisions were undone. (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., The Enigma Dimension [+]Nicholas Briggs, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nHowever, he believed that mercy was a strength and valued life above all else. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) He vehemently opposed the murder of any sentient being, (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) apart from the Daleks, (AUDIO: The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) arguing at length with Rassilon about closing the Tantalus Eye, as the result would be genocide on the lives within the Tantalus Spiral in the ensuing destruction. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) He also hesitated to destroy Gallifrey when forced to think of the innocent children he would kill as a result, and was disgusted with Kate Stewart for preparing to sacrifice London to destroy the Zygons. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) He refused to kill Project K006 out of pity, (AUDIO: A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) objected to follow a plan that would have resulted in the Daleks wiping out the Sontarans, (AUDIO: The Eternity Cage [+]Andrew Smith, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) and protested to the Time Lords' plan to wipe out the Rutans. (AUDIO: In Name Only [+]John Dorney, Sontarans vs Rutans (Big Finish Productions, 2024).)\n\nDespite focusing on the grand scale, the Doctor still had his limits, and would try to employ less \"extreme\" and more \"harmless\" measures whenever he could, aiming to allow himself to be the sole casualty of his plans, (AUDIO: A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).; COMIC: The Organ Grinder [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016)., The Whole Thing's Bananas [+]Richard Dinnick, The Many Lives of Doctor Who (Titan Publishing Group, 2018).) and constantly tried to have the Time Lords avoid using dubious and lunatic tactics to win the War. (AUDIO: The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021)., Temmosus [+]Rossa McPhillips, Battlegrounds (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2022).; COMIC: The Bidding War [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2017).) He was appalled by the depths Rassilon and the High Council had sunk to in the Time War, and was both outraged and disgusted when he found out Rassilon had retro-evolved Borusa into a possibility engine. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nAs he continued to try and minimise the damage caused by the crossfires of the Time War, the Doctor would work to save as many lives as he could, (AUDIO: A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., The Eternity Cage [+]Andrew Smith, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).; COMIC: Kill God [+]Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) while ensuring that no one sacrificed their lives in vain. (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).; PROSE: Decoy [+]George Mann, The Target Storybook (2019).)\n\nDue to the horrors he had seen, the Doctor would often speak in a monotone voice when dealing with individuals he had no interest in, (PROSE: The Third Wise Man [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) even forgetting people with \"forgettable face[s]\" when they were stood in front of him. He was accustomed to people looking upon him with terror, (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) and accepted that the Daleks' schemes for victory would become more hideous and overblown with each attempt. (AUDIO: The Thousand Worlds [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor also displayed a confident recklessness, as he considered politely asking a Dalek to take him and Cinder prisoner to infiltrate Andor, approached a Dalek flying saucer with the intention of walking on board instead of sneaking on, decided his way around the Dalek saucer with \"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe\", and confidently walked out to meet the Eternity Circle after asking some Dalek soldiers to \"take [him] to [their] leader\". (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nDespite being more concerned with the Time War than defending the rest of the universe, the War Doctor still cared and was willing to help out when necessary. He aided his other incarnations in stopping the Type 1 TARDIS from consuming the universe, (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) and helped his tenth and eleventh incarnations in defeating a Zygon plot, coming up with the idea that let them get into the TARDIS-proofed Tower of London and helping them wipe everyone's memories to ensure peace. He was also shown to be pleased that the outcome of the situation was diplomacy rather than destruction. Upon learning that he had a chance to save Gallifrey rather than destroy it, the War Doctor became elated, blowing a joyful kiss to the Moment, and took solace in restoring his right to be called the Doctor. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhile he enjoyed watching them \"[work] together to solve a problem\", (WC: Doctors Assemble! [+]James Goss, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).) the War Doctor did not reflect fondly on his predecessors, believing them to be \"posturing, prancing fool[s]\" who \"lived for the thrill of stepping through a door and seeing all [the] faces turn towards [them] in hope and wonder\". (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) He especially demonised his fourth incarnation for not having \"the guts to do what was necessary\" when his hesitation to destroy them ensured the creation of the Daleks, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) but praised his sixth incarnation for his cleverness. (WC: Doctors Assemble! [+]James Goss, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nSeeing him as \"foolish\", (AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) the War Doctor had a low opinion of his eighth incarnation, viewing him as a \"romantic idiot\", (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) who had the arrogance to \"[mistake] himself for a hero\" and make jokes at often inappropriate times; (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) though he did admire him for being a \"romantic hero with hope.\" (AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021)., Exit Strategy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe War Doctor was critical at first of his tenth and eleventh incarnations, finding them to be very childish and ashamed to be grownups, and branding them a \"midlife crisis\". (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) As a consequence of their youthful appearance, the War Doctor had at first believed them to be children playing dress up, and their sonic screwdrivers to be magic wands. He also had difficulty telling the two apart. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) He was especially critical of the Eleventh Doctor because of his use of the phrase \"timey wimey\" and his inability to talk without flapping his hands around, while also criticising the Tenth Doctor's footwear and the Eleventh Doctor's bow tie. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) He was also annoyed by the apparent lack of dignity and wisdom they showed, comparing them both to presenters of Blue Peter. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) However, after watching them use their guilt from the Time War to broker peace between UNIT and the Zygons, his opinion of them changed for the better, as he described them as \"extraordinary men\" to the Moment. When leaving for his own time stream, he considered meeting his future selves \"an honour and a privilege\", a compliment they returned to him. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhile the Eleventh Doctor tried to remember his war incarnation as \"the slaughterer of billions\", when standing before him, he reflected that the War Doctor was \"kind, and brave, and hurt\", and had never been \"a warrior in his hearts\". (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nContrary to his other incarnations, the War Doctor did not take on companions unless it was absolutely necessary, or they proved to be capable of defending themselves, instead taking comfort in the sound of the TARDIS control console. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) He claimed to Rejoice that he also chose not to take on companions due to his dislike of them asking questions. (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).)\n\nDespite having a rocky start to their relationship, the Doctor grew to genuinely care for Cinder and tried to force her away from him, worried that he wouldn't be able to protect her from the Time War. When she did indeed meet her demise while protecting him, the Doctor became tempted to use a possibility engine to undo her death, but instead decided to honour her sacrifice by using the engine to destroy the Daleks. He later hunted down her home to give her a proper burial with her family. Cinder's death proved to be the last straw for the Doctor, who swore he would end the Time War in her memory. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nWhile he was willing to frighten them to ensure they understood the severity of the war, the Doctor was highly protective of young children. He encouraged Gahnna by telling him that his fear pushed him to achieve, (PROSE: The Stranger [+]Gary Russell, Heroes and Monsters Collection (Heroes and Monsters Collection, 2015).) and hesitated to use the Moment when it pointed out that he would also slaughter the children on Gallifrey. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor was afraid of the powers and capabilities of the Daleks, and the possibility that the Time War would continue after the defeat of the Daleks, with the Time Lords becoming warlike enough to find a different enemy to fight in the Daleks' place. (AUDIO: The Enigma Dimension [+]Nicholas Briggs, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) He also believed the Daleks to be even more arrogant than the Time Lords. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nHe voiced a continual reluctance for working for the Time Lords, claiming he preferred to fight the war on his own terms, (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Thousand Worlds [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) and believed that their dedication to order and discipline made them no different than the Daleks, (AUDIO: The Thousand Worlds [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) especially when they tried to justify the killing of \"lesser beings\" in the crossfires of the war. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).; AUDIO: The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) He was especially \"disgusted\" to be on \"the same side\" as Ollistra (AUDIO: The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) and Rassilon, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) but was honoured to work alongside Rasmus, who he found more trustworthy and virtuous. (AUDIO: Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nWhile the Eleventh General considered him a \"mad fool\", Clara Oswald, when distinguishing him from his other incarnations, described the War Doctor as \"the Warrior\". (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) The Squire recalled how the War Doctor carried \"pathos\" with him, (COMIC: The Then and the Now [+]Si Spurrier and Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) but noted that he was still a \"noble warrior\". (COMIC: Outrun [+]Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) The War Ollistra, however, believed that, instead of being a \"man of war\", the War Doctor sometimes allowed himself to think of himself as a \"compassionate man with high moral standards\", (AUDIO: The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) though the Child Master commentated how the War Doctor's \"morals [were] entreatingly fluid\". (COMIC: The One [+]Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nRojan, after seeing the War Doctor's elderly face, felt that he \"wasn't a man who found much joy in life.\" (PROSE: The Stranger [+]Gary Russell, Heroes and Monsters Collection (Heroes and Monsters Collection, 2015).) Artarix, when gazing at the Doctor's Auton duplicate, felt that he \"bore the weight of regret\" of being \"a man who had been forced to become the very thing he despised\". (PROSE:Decoy [+]George Mann, The Target Storybook (2019).) Co-ordinator Jarad considered the Doctor a \"wily old fox\" who could out-think everyone. (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nDue to the severity of the war, the Doctor was convinced there was no future beyond the conflict, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).; COMIC: The Organ Grinder [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) and did not mind if he died whilst fighting in the Time War, (COMIC: Kill God [+]Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) having resigned himself to death \"the moment [he] entered [the] war\", (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) and would put himself in situations that he had a low chance of surviving in, (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) with the mind-set that he would \"[go] out fighting\". (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) However, he stated he had a reluctance to die at Collis's hand, (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) and that he did not wish to become a martyr. (AUDIO: Eye of Harmony [+]Ken Bentley, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) He claimed that the only thing that was worth living for was the thought of the lives he had saved. (AUDIO: Pretty Lies [+]Guy Adams, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nUpon noticing his regeneration starting, the War Doctor showed no fear of the change, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) despite once describing regeneration as a \"trauma\", (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) due to having held back the process for \"years\". (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Instead, he noted how old he had grown, hoping his successor's ears would be \"less conspicuous\", and facing the end with an immense grin on his face in his last moments. However, due to the timelines not being synchronised, the Doctor believed he had destroyed Gallifrey, committing genocide against the Time Lords and the Daleks. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) As such, the War Doctor's memory was known to stare sombrely in the Doctor's time stream, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) not even defending his action to Es'Cartrss in the T'keyn Nexus, (COMIC: Dead Man's Hand [+]Tony Lee, Doctor Who (2012) (IDW Publishing, 2013).) until the true outcome of the Time War was revealed to the Eleventh Doctor, allowing the memory of the War Doctor to stand proudly with his other incarnations. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe War Doctor made a habit of incorporating \"no more\" into his dialogue and thought process, (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).; PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).; AUDIO: The Eternity Cage [+]Andrew Smith, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).; COMIC: Ambush [+]George Mann, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe, 2017).) and justifying his actions as being done in \"the name of peace and sanity.\" (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).; COMIC: First Rule [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., Kill God [+]Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016)., Fast Asleep [+]Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nHe also made a habit of uttering \"damn\", usually as a sign of frustration or when things did not meet his satisfaction. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).; AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Thousand Worlds [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Heart of the Battle [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., Eye of Harmony [+]Ken Bentley, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., Pretty Lies [+]Guy Adams, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017)., The Enigma Dimension [+]Nicholas Briggs, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017)., Light the Flame [+]Matt Fitton, Forged in Fire (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nMuch to the confusion of his fellow Time Lords, the Doctor was prone to referring to Earth idioms and phrases. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).; AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Thousand Worlds [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., Pretty Lies [+]Guy Adams, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017)., The Enigma Dimension [+]Nicholas Briggs, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017)., The Keeper of Light [+]Phil Mulryne, Battlegrounds (The War Doctor Begins, Big Finish Productions, 2022).)\n\nThe War Doctor would often stand with his arms folded behind his back. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).; PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).; COMIC: The Organ Grinder [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) When standing between two people engaging in conversation, such as his tenth and eleventh incarnations, the War Doctor would turn his head to face the one that was speaking, even if it meant turning his head back-and-forth continuously. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe War Doctor had a strong knowledge of warfare tactics, (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Neverwhen [+]Matt Fitton, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., The Eternity Cage [+]Andrew Smith, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016)., Pretty Lies [+]Guy Adams, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) and could deduce a person's history from sheer observation. (AUDIO: The Shadow Vortex [+]David Llewellyn, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) He could also deduce the height and weight of people and locations on sight, (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) and had a keen grasp on his surroundings, enough to know when he was being observed from behind. (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).; PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nThe Doctor had a knack for gaining authority over others, being able to gain entry into secure locations by acting as if he was in charge, (AUDIO: The Shadow Vortex [+]David Llewellyn, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) and securing his entrance into Time Vault Zero by barking orders about a break-in at the guard until she was convinced to let him in. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Even so, he favoured direct action over feigning authority. (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nThough he told Cinder he \"was not good with long-term plans\", and preferred \"winging it\", (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) the Doctor was able to think of effective stratagems in preparation for battle, (AUDIO: The Eternity Cage [+]Andrew Smith, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) sometimes seeing a hidden solution after he paced his thinking. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) with the Squire remembering him as \"always [having] a plan\". (COMIC: The One [+]Rob Williams, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) Indeed, the Doctor had the foresight on one occasion to surrender to the Daleks, knowing that they would bring him where he wanted to go instead of exterminating him on the spot. He also put a fail-safe on the TARDIS control console that caused his ship to materialise around him in the event that Karlax attempted to hijack it after his regeneration. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nEven in his last years, the War Doctor was spritely athletic, being able to outrun a squadron of Daleks ahead of Cinder, and immediately start a daunting climb up a wall afterwards, as well as being capable of dodging a Dalek gunstick at close range. He was also stronger than he appeared, hoisting Karlax in the air by his throat in retaliation for using the mind probe on Cinder and knocked out a Battle TARDIS pilot with a single right hook punch. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor was also an impressive marksman, able to inscribe \"NO MORE\" onto a wall with a fusion blaster, and keep his aim despite a battle taking place around him, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) and wield a Temporal Cannon against a Dalek. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) He was even able to quickly review the effectiveness of a firearm after close examination. (AUDIO: Pretty Lies [+]Guy Adams, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) However, like his predecessors, the War Doctor was better known for his ability to defeat enemies without employing weapons, though, rather than show his enemies mercy, he would kill them outright, as indicated by Gastron. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nHe was skilled at hacking into the Daleks' databanks, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) as well as the Technomancer equivalent of a computer. (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost [+]John Dorney, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nHe was also able to determine the way casualties on a battlefield were killed by studying their corpses. (COMIC: The Organ Grinder [+]Si Spurrier, Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nHe could detect nitrogen in the air by scent. (AUDIO: A Thing of Guile [+]Phil Mulryne, Infernal Devices (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nDue to his third incarnation watching stunt pilots with the Brigadier, the War Doctor was able to pilot his TARDIS through a series of manoeuvres with ease. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nHe could understand Dalek writing \"to a degree\". (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nThe War Doctor could judge a person's character quickly, almost instinctively knowing who he should ally himself with, (AUDIO: The Shadow Vortex [+]David Llewellyn, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).; PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) and recognising when someone wasn't a murderer (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) or was acting out of fear instead of malice. (AUDIO: The Shadow Vortex [+]David Llewellyn, Agents of Chaos (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nHe could assess his surroundings with ease, easily determining that the power pack of Cinder's makeshift gun was empty and the weapon useless, (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) knowing the equipment others had on them by observing their use of technology, (AUDIO: The Innocent [+]Nicholas Briggs, Only the Monstrous (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) ruling out the Moment's interface as a hologram by observing their surroundings, and determining the year as the 1560s by studying his location. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nThe War Doctor was capable of resisting a regeneration from old age for several years through willpower alone. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nAt the start of his life, the War Doctor had athe stern and determined face of a man in his late 30s, with hazel eyes and messy brown hair. Though he started off clean shaven, (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) he let his stubble grow (COMIC: Ambush [+]George Mann, Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe (Dalek: The Astounding Untold History of the Greatest Enemies of the Universe, 2017).) until he grew a brown Van Dyke beard. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nUltimately, after spending \"a very long time\" fighting in the Time War, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) he became jaded and tired, his beard and hair having turned a haunting silver-grey, and with pronounced wrinkles on his craggy, careworn face, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) making him resemble a man in his seventies. (PROSE: Engines of War [+]George Mann, BBC New Series tie-in novels (BBC Books, 2014).) However, Clara Oswald noticed his eyes were younger than those of his future selves, in that they were more hopeful. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) He slicked up his hair in peaks at the top of his head, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and his deep, distinctive voice became well-known amongst the people aware of the Time War, (AUDIO: Pretty Lies [+]Guy Adams, Casualties of War (The War Doctor, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) with the Tenth Doctor noting how it was \"posh, [and] gravelly\".
