  "content": "However, he held deep respect for pacifism, and had zero tolerance towards anyone who wanted to engage in violence to resolve conflicts and disapproved of guns unless they were unquestionably a last resort. He also had vanity issues that made him attached to his current body, an attachment that was so strong that he became the only incarnation of the Doctor to willingly abort one of his regenerations midway through the process itself, by way of siphoning the remaining regeneration energy that would have given him a new body into a matching bio-receptacle, allowing him to heal himself while avoiding the change of appearance after he was struck by the neutronic energy of a Dalek's gunstick.\n\nStarting out as a manic who was prone to speaking quickly in rambling tangents while peppering his speech with pop culture references, the Doctor resumed his travels with Rose Tyler after ending a Sycorax invasion of Earth, where he also deposed Prime Minister Harriet Jones when they disagreed on her destroying the retreating Sycorax ship. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) The Doctor and Rose's relationship veered more towards romance than before (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) after they travelled to New Earth (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and saved Queen Victoria from a werewolf at Torchwood House. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) However, a chance reunion with Sarah Jane Smith while undercover at Deffry Vale High School reminded him of his friends' mortality and, with Mickey Smith deciding to join him and Rose in the TARDIS, (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) the Doctor entered a doomed romance with Madame de Pompadour that ended when she passed. (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Mickey would ultimately leave the TARDIS to stay in a parallel universe to help fight the Cybermen created by Cybus Industries, (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) leaving the Doctor and Rose to travel and face menaces such as the Wire, (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) the Beast of Krop Tor (TV: The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and an Abzorbaloff. (TV: Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nAfter sensing that \"a storm [was] approaching\" when they saved the 2012 Olympics from the Isolus, (TV: Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) the Doctor and Rose, along with Jackie, were drawn to Torchwood One amid a ghost conspiracy that turned out to be an invasion by the Cybus Industries Cybermen that had followed a Void ship containing the Cult of Skaro through the multiverse. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) As Torchwood, the Cybermen and the Daleks fought each other, the Doctor was able to banish the Daleks and the Cybermen to the Void after Torchwood fell, but Rose and Jackie were trapped on \"Pete's World\" as a consequence, where Jackie got together with her late husband's counterpart. After finding a way to say goodbye to Rose, (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) the Doctor was thrusted into a scheme by the Empress of the Racnoss to infuse Donna Noble with Huon particles and release her children from the centre of the Earth, which he managed to stop by drowning them. (TV: The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nWhile still lamenting Rose, (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) the Doctor invited Royal Hope Hospital medical student Martha Jones to join him for a single trip in the TARDIS after she helped him save the hospital from the Judoon, (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) taking her to meet William Shakespeare and foil a Carrionite plot, (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and then extended her trip to New Earth (TV: Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and then 1930 New York City, (TV: Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) where they stopped the Cult of Skaro from turning people into Human-Dalek hybrid and saw the Cult destroy itself, though Dalek Caan managed to escape. (TV: Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) When the Doctor returned Martha home, they worked together to stop Richard Lazarus's experiments with rejuvenation and the Doctor officially made Martha a companion, (TV: The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) though he remained oblivious to her crush on him (TV: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) as they saved the SS Pentallian from the Torajii sun, (TV: 42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) stopped Baltazar from weaponising the Infinite (TV: The Infinite Quest [+]Alan Barnes, CBBC (2007).) and hid from the Family of Blood in 1913 England, where the Doctor turned himself into a human with a Chameleon Arch and entered into a romance with Joan Redfern until the Family found him (TV: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and he had to turn back, with Joan rebuffing him. (TV: The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nSometime after escaping being banished to 1969 by the Weeping Angels, (TV: Blink [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow (Steven Moffat), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) the Doctor and Martha were forced to the end of the universe when Captain Jack Harkness latched onto the TARDIS, and they helped the last of humanity reach Utopia to survive, only for the head of the Utopia Project to turn out to be the War Master hiding under a Chameleon Arch. After prodding from Martha caused him to open the Arch, the Master stole the TARDIS as he regenerated into the Saxon Master, (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) forcing the Doctor, Martha and Jack to follow him with Jack's vortex manipulator, only to arrive after he had won the election and became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and initiated his takeover of Earth with the Toclafane after capturing the Doctor and Jack, with Martha escaping (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) to enact the Doctor's contingency plan for a year, allowing the Doctor to topple the Master's regime and revert time to remove his rule from history, though the Master was swiftly killed by his abused wife. Jack decided to return to Torchwood Three, and Martha, realising she had responsibilities at home, elected to leave the TARDIS, but not before telling the Doctor she had outgrown her crush on him. (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nAs he processed Martha's leaving, the Doctor had to separate his TARDIS from the Fifth Doctor's TARDIS (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) and then stop the spaceship Titanic from crashing into Buckingham Palace, though he lost a potential companion in waitress Astrid Peth when she gave her life to save him. (TV: Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) The Doctor then adopted Rose-the-Cat to help him finally overcome his depression on losing Rose, (COMIC: A Rose by Any Other Name [+]Rachael Smith, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor backup comic stories (Titan Comics, 2014-2016).) was saved from fluctuating timelines by the Thirteenth Doctor, (COMIC: Alternating Current [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who Comic (2020) (Titan Comics, 2020-2021).) and ensured Hotel Historia manager Majenta Pryce was arrested for tax evasion. (COMIC: Hotel Historia [+]Dan McDaid, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2008).)\n\nWhile investigating Adipose Industries, the Doctor was reunited with Donna, who asked to join him in the TARDIS, an offer he accepted on the terms that their relationship remained platonic. (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Together, they found themselves having to destroy Pompeii to stop the Pyroviles taking over the world (TV: The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and freed the Ood of the Ood Sphere from enslavement. (TV: Planet of the Ood [+]Keith Temple, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Upon being recruited by Martha for Operation Blue Sky, in which he helped UNIT investigate the ATMOS factories, the Doctor was introduced to Donna's grandfather, Wilfred Mott, (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) as he saved the world from the Sontarans' ATMOS plot. While bidding farewell to Martha, (TV: The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) the TARDIS was suddenly drawn to Messaline, where the Doctor's DNA was harvested to create Jenny, a new soldier for the Human-Hath War, but the Doctor, Jenny, Martha and Donna were able to bring the war to a peaceful ceasefire, though Jenny appeared to perish. After dropping Martha back home, (TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) the Doctor and Donna continued their travels, such as solving a murder mystery with Agatha Christie. (TV: The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) However, their carefree adventures grew darker after they answered a call from River Song to the Library, (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) where Donna lived a married life in the Library's data core and the Doctor was forced to watch River sacrifice her life to free the other people trapped in the data core after he negotiated a peace with the Vashta Nerada. (TV: Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) A trip to Midnight also ended in disaster when the Doctor was almost killed by paranoid humans bedevilled by a mysterious entity. (TV: Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nAfter Donna was sent to a parallel world by the Trickster's Brigade, the Doctor learnt that the universe was at risk when Donna told him Rose had helped her. (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) With the Earth vanishing, the Doctor and Donna ventured into the Medusa Cascade, where they found UNIT, Torchwood Three and the Bannerman Road gang repelling an invasion by the New Dalek Empire, spearheaded by Davros and Dalek Caan. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Joined by Rose and Jack, the Doctor narrowly avoided regenerating when a Dalek shot him by siphoning off the remaining energy into \"instantaneous biological meta-crisis\" that made contact with Donna, growing a new Doctor and giving Donna the mind of a Time Lord, allowing the two Doctors and Donna to cripple the New Dalek Empire, with the Meta-Crisis Doctor destroying it fully when pushed on by Caan. After exiling the Meta-Crisis Doctor to Pete's World to be with Rose, the Doctor was forced to erase all trace of himself from Donna's memory to prevent her brain from burning up, and returned her home, (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) only to find a message she had left in advance telling him to find a new companion, (COMIC: The Time of My Life [+]Jonathan Morris, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2008).) which he did in the form of Heather McCrimmon and Wolfie Ryter, (COMIC: The Chromosome Connection [+]Christopher Cooper, DWA comic stories (BBC Magazines, 2009)., Flight of the Giurgeax [+]Christopher Cooper, DWA comic stories (BBC Magazines, 2009).) until they were forced to leave his company. (COMIC: Bad Wolfie [+]Christopher Cooper, DWA comic stories (BBC Magazines, 2009)., Dead-line [+]Christopher Cooper, DWA comic stories (BBC Magazines, 2010).)\n\nHaving sworn off travelling with companions, the Doctor was aided by Jackson Lake and Rosita Farisi in toppling the CyberKing, (TV: The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).) saved the Royal Albert Hall from a Graske, (TV: Music of the Spheres [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who at the Proms minisodes Doctor Who at the Proms special (BBC Radio 3, 2008).) and was helped by Lady Christina de Souza in returning the 200 bus to Earth from San Helios, during which he was warned by the psychic Carmen that his \"song [was] ending\". Now aware that his time was short, (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) the Doctor saved Sarah Jane from the Trickster, (TV: The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith [+]Gareth Roberts, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 3 (BBC One, 2009).) helped Majenta reconcile with her past in the Crimson Hand, (COMIC: The Crimson Hand [+]Dan McDaid, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2009-2010).) and shared an adventure with Emily Winter and Matthew Finnegan after he saved them from their historical deaths, (COMIC: Fugitive [+]Tony Lee, Doctor Who (2009) (IDW Publishing, 2009).) and then took a trip to Mars, where he managed to prevent a fixed point in time by saving Adelaide Brooke from her death and proclaimed himself the Time Lord Victorious, until Adelaide killing herself snapped him back to his senses, (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) causing him to begin the Kotturuh crisis by wiping out the Kotturuh in the Dark Times. (PROSE: The Knight, The Fool and The Dead [+]Steve Cole, Time Lord Victorious (BBC Books, 2020).)\n\nAs he continued to avoid a summons to the Ood Sphere, (AUDIO: Out of Time [+]Matt Fitton, Out of Time (Big Finish Productions, 2020).) the Doctor decided to take Gabby Gonzalez on as a companion, (COMIC: Revolutions of Terror [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).) which resulted in him being caught in the lives of Cleopatra Hunsicker, Dorothy Bell and Anubis. (COMIC: The Fountains of Forever [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015)., Sins of the Father [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) Gabby's friend Cindy Wu eventually joined them in the TARDIS, (COMIC: Arena of Fear [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) just as the Doctor faced the masterplans of Sutekh (COMIC: Old Girl [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)  and the Time Sentinels, resulting in him loosing Gabby when she fell out of the TARDIS into the Time Vortex. (COMIC: The Good Companion [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017-2018).) The Doctor then spent some time travelling in the Pre-Time War universe with Anya Kingdom and Mark Seven. (AUDIO: The Wrong Woman [+]John Dorney, Dalek Universe (Big Finish Productions, 2021).) He also defeated the Viperox at Area 51. (TV: Dreamland [+]Phil Ford, Doctor Who Animated Special 2009 (BBC Red Button, 2009).)\n\nWhen he decided to answer the Ood's call, the Doctor learnt that the Master had been resurrected, and bumped into Wilf while trying to find him, with Wilf electing to help the Doctor after he was told of Carmen's prophecy. However, it quickly transpired that the Master was just a pawn in Rassilon's plan to destroy the universe to escape the Time War. Though the Doctor was able to send the Time Lords back into the war with the Master's aid, he decided to sacrifice himself to save Wilf from a radiation shield that was about to be flooded with radiation, absorbing a huge quantity of nuclear radiation into himself and starting his regeneration. However, he held back the process long enough to visit all of his companions, and finally regenerated in the TARDIS as the Ood \"[sang him] to [his] sleep\". (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nWith the intent to have fun wherever he went, (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) the Tenth Doctor was cheerful, charismatic, hyperactive and enthusiastic, often at inappropriate times, (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) but would become severely serious when the situation called for it. (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Striving to make new friends everywhere he went, (TV: Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) the Doctor tended to keep a massive smile on his face as he found new ways to enjoy his unpredictable journeys through time and space, with the thought of a mundane existence unnerving him, (TV: The Impossible Planet [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) as he thought there was \"always something to do\". (COMIC: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).)\n\nHe had a merciful and compassionate nature, consistently extending an offer of mercy to help even his most dangerous enemies. (TV: Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).) However, when his patience reached its limit or his enemies were duplicitous, they received no mercy or second chances. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006)., The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).) He also held a forgiving philosophy, even forgiving the Saxon Master for his crimes. (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nWhile he seemed to have resolved much of the survivor's guilt felt previously, the Tenth Doctor had begun to feel his age. (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Beneath his juvenile exterior was an old man who had seen many terrible things and felt a deep loneliness, (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He felt profound regret for the deaths he had seen, (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) with the Moment referring to him as \"the man who regrets\". (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) His keen sense of loss led him to empathise with those who had also suffered, (TV: Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and feel driven to prevent death and destruction wherever possible, having a hard time accepting failure. (TV: Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) Even though he did not enjoy adventuring alone, (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) the Doctor enjoyed the freedoms that came with solitary travels, (TV: Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and felt annoyed when he had to start afresh with a new companion by explaining the basics, (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) even mouthing along to repeated phrases. (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) However, Donna Noble noted the reason the Doctor required a companion was to keep him from succumbing to his darker side. (TV: The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nDespite being more outwardly cheerful than his previous incarnation, the Doctor still felt guilt over what he had done in the Last Great Time War, showing disgust towards the Eleventh Doctor when he was unable to remember how many children died when he destroyed Gallifrey, despite him knowing the number to memory, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) with one account showing him outright attacking his eleventh incarnation. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) The Tenth Doctor also retained and even exceeded his predecessor's capacity for righteous anger, particularly when people he liked were threatened or at risk, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) or when dealing with the Daleks. (TV: Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) When driven by his anger, he would not hesitate to strike down those who opposed him, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006)., The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) though he described himself as \"a man who never would\" to set an example of peace to solidify a human and Hath ceasefire on Messaline. (TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor's biggest flaw was his ego, with him always trying to take control of situations he found himself in, (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and feeling it his place to punish those who committed horrific acts, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) sometimes even using his name as a threat. (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Occasionally, he claimed to be a higher authority than he necessarily was, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) and he often believed himself to be the smartest being in the room. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) When introduced to Louis XV, the Doctor introduced himself as the \"Lord of Time\" in an attempt to outrank the King of France. (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nHe was also something of a hypocrite, or at least was lacking in self-awareness, calling Colonel Alan Mace undiplomatic for comparing the Sontarans to trolls before he himself began antagonising them, (TV: The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) claiming he would not allow Strackman Lux's pride to cost lives while refusing to sign Lux's contract for the same reason, (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and being offended when Malcolm Taylor hung up on him after he had previously done the same to Malcolm. (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nAfter being forced to wipe Donna Noble's memories of her travels with him, the Doctor was driven into a deep state of depression, (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) that caused him to eventually forgo the idea of picking up any more companions, (TV: The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).) even refusing Lady Christina de Souza's request to travel with him. (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) However, he came to feel lonely enough (PROSE: Judgement of the Judoon [+]Colin Brake, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2009).) to offer June a single trip in the TARDIS on a strict non-interference basis after she helped him save Athens, (PROSE: The Slitheen Excursion [+]Simon Guerrier, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2009).) and extended a similar offer to Stella before he was interrupted by attacking Daleks. (PROSE: Prisoner of the Daleks [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2009).) He would eventually travel properly with Majenta Pryce out of obligation to his role in her imprisonment in Thinktwice, (COMIC: Thinktwice [+]Dan McDaid, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2008).) and was convinced to make exceptions to his no companions rule for Emily Winter, Matthew Finnegan, (COMIC: Fugitive [+]Tony Lee, Doctor Who (2009) (IDW Publishing, 2009).) and Gabby Gonzalez. (COMIC: The Arts in Space [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).) He also offered to let Anya Kingdom come with him in the TARDIS, but they became separated before she could take him up on the offer. (AUDIO: The Triumph of Davros [+]Matt Fitton, Dalek Universe (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nAfter he was given a prophecy of his demise by a human psychic, the Doctor spiralled further into an emotional breakdown that caused him to snap and try to alter a fixed point in time by saving Adelaide Brooke, Yuri Kerenski and Mia Bennett from the destruction of Bowie Base One. Upon his success, he declared himself as the \"Time Lord Victorious\" and believed that, as the last Time Lord, he had the right to control the Laws of Time. Following Adelaide's suicide, the Doctor realised he had gone too far and entered another state of depression upon seeing Ood Sigma herald his fast approaching regeneration. (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) His shock caused him to flee into the Dark Times, where he became determined to completely rewrite history for the better by wiping out the Kotturuh before they could bring death to the universe, deeming himself the \"master of [his] own fate, [and] everyone's fate\" once the Kotturuh marked him for death. Though he still retained his doubts, he was finally provoked into destroying the Kotturuh after they killed Estinee, (PROSE: The Knight, The Fool and The Dead [+]Steve Cole, Time Lord Victorious (BBC Books, 2020).) and destroyed the planet Mordeela in his anger, (PROSE: All Flesh is Grass [+]Una McCormack, Time Lord Victorious release order (BBC Books, 2020).) though he quickly felt conflicted on whether ending the Kotturuh was the right thing to have done. (AUDIO: The Minds of Magnox [+]Darren Jones, Audio Originals (BBC Worldwide, 2020).) After meeting the last Kotturuh, Inyit, and seeing what the Daleks had done in the Dark Times, the Doctor conceded that his actions had been wrong, and expressed his remorse after Inyit died defeating the Daleks. Though satisfied with the change to how death would eventually enter the universe, he agreed he had gone too far in rewriting of history. (PROSE: All Flesh is Grass [+]Una McCormack, Time Lord Victorious release order (BBC Books, 2020).) By the time he had finally decided to answer Sigma's summons, the Doctor had come to greatly regret his actions as the Time Lord Victorious, weeping when he admitted to Wilf that things had gone wrong, but he still showed some signs of a colder demeanour, even briefly questioning Wilf's \"importance\" as an individual when he realised he would have to sacrifice his own life to save him, though ultimately gave his life for Wilf. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nWhile previous incarnations intentionally flouted social conventions, the Tenth Doctor was genuinely shocked when he realised that he was being rude or uncouth. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) According to the Eleventh Doctor, the Tenth Doctor had vanity issues. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor had a stated fondness for \"little shops\", the gift stores usually found in hospitals and other public places, though he disliked hospitals. (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) He did not identify himself as a \"cat person\". (TV: Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) While he disliked calling a group a \"team\", (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) he did like using the word \"fam\". (WC: Doctors Assemble! [+]James Goss, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nHe also liked the impossible, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) The Muppet Movie, (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) picnics, picnic baskets, (PROSE: Sting of the Zygons [+]Stephen Cole, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).) fire engines, (PROSE: The Last Dodo [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).) the pyramids, New Zealand, (TV: Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) unpredictability, (TV: The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) mysteries, (TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) biographies, (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) the Proms, (TV: Music of the Spheres [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who at the Proms minisodes Doctor Who at the Proms special (BBC Radio 3, 2008).) snow, (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) teachers, (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) rock and roll music, (PROSE: Loose Wire [+]Richard Dungworth, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).) theatre, fan fiction, (PROSE: He's Behind You [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) and Christmas. (PROSE: First Day of the Doctor [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (Penguin Group, 2023).)\n\nHe disliked sleeping, (COMIC: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).) Margaret Thatcher, (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) zoos, (PROSE: The Last Dodo [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).) people saluting him, (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) lists, \"funny robots\", (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) and thrash metal music. (PROSE: Loose Wire [+]Richard Dungworth, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).)\n\nAmong his favourite years were 1727 and 1953. (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) He liked Saturdays, (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) but thought that Sundays were \"boring\", and tried to avoid them when he could. (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) His favourite movie was It's a Wonderful Life. (PROSE: Loose Wire [+]Richard Dungworth, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).)\n\nHe considered edible ball bearings to be a \"masterpiece\", (TV: Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and liked bananas, (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) but disliked spinach, (PROSE: Martha in the Mirror [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2008).) and pears. (PROSE: The Taking of Chelsea 426 [+]David Llewellyn, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2009).) He took two sugars in his tea, (PROSE: Ghosts of India [+]Mark Morris, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2008).) with Earl Grey \"with a dash of milk\" being his preference. (PROSE: Autonomy [+]Daniel Blythe, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2009).)\n\nWhile he was unsure about his religious beliefs, the Doctor stated he kept travelling in order to be proved wrong. (TV: The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) He viewed life as being \"meaningless\" if it was built on the suffering of others, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and that people made life worth living, (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) with a long life leading one to become tired of everything and ending up alone. (TV: The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He also thought books to be the \"best weapons in the world\". (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThe TARDIS believed the Tenth Doctor was \"afraid of Death\". (PROSE: What the TARDIS thought of \"Time Lord Victorious\" [+]James Goss, Time Lord Victorious (2020).) When asked his thoughts on the dead returning as ghosts, the Doctor called the scenario \"horrific\", (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and was likewise unnerved by the idea of humans achieving immortality, (TV: The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) describing the fact that Jack Harkness was a living fixed point in time as being \"wrong\". (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nWhile he thought death gave life \"size\", (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) the Tenth Doctor always attempted to solve a situation without violence, (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Dreamland [+]Phil Ford, Doctor Who Animated Special 2009 (BBC Red Button, 2009)., The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) which strained his working relationship with UNIT, with him being against their military methods. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) He also disapproved of his friends using violence, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).) and would make himself an enemy of those who would kill without proper cause. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) However, he would resort to lethal means of dispatching his enemies if no alternative could be found. (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006)., Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Doctor refused to take up a weapon against an enemy, believing it cowardly to do so, (PROSE: Made of Steel [+]Terrance Dicks, Quick Reads (BBC Books, 2007).) repeatedly refusing even when offered one by UNIT while attacking the Sontarans. (TV: The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) However, during a battle with the Cybusmen, the Doctor helped Major Burton handle a rocket launcher and destroyed a Cyberman with the weapon, despite hesitating due to it previously being human. (PROSE: Made of Steel [+]Terrance Dicks, Quick Reads (BBC Books, 2007).) He was also tempted to execute General Cobb for the murder of Jenny, but ultimately decided against it. (TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) During the Kotturuh crisis, the Doctor reluctantly accepted control of the Victis Fleet after Brian the Ood made him its admiral to fight the Kotturuh. (PROSE: The Knight, The Fool and The Dead [+]Steve Cole, Time Lord Victorious (BBC Books, 2020).) After initially refusing several times to take up Wilfred Mott's pistol to save himself and humanity from the Master, the Doctor changed his mind when he heard that the Time Lords were escaping the time lock on the Time War. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) Davros noted the Doctor's refusal to take up a gun, but pointed out that he \"[took] ordinary people and [fashioned] them into weapons\". (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) When Clara Oswald insisted the war, tenth and eleventh incarnations find a different way to end the Time War, the Tenth Doctor embraced the chance to do so when a plan was formed and worked with twelve of his other incarnations to save his planet and people. He was upset when he realised he wouldn't be able to remember what they had achieved, but was still happy with the outcome. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nHe knew when it was time to focus on the task at hand instead of trying to save someone, and would encourage others to mourn only when they were out of danger, (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) as well as focus on the \"big picture\" instead of focusing on minor problems. (TV: The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006).) He likewise had little patience for those who tried to deny the situation around them, (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and those who would bully those weaker than them. (TV: Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor had an adamant hatred for \"funny robots\", feeling that people \"dressing them up and giving them silly voices\" had \"[reduced] them\" from regular robots, though he had a soft spot for robot dogs, (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) such as K9, (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and still made an effort to protect the robots he disliked, such as ensuring that Gadget was saved from the Flood. (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor saw time as existing in an infinite temporal flux, with most events in history being subjectable to change in the same vein as Back to the Future. (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) However, he knew that \"tiny [and] precious moments\" existed that \"[had] to stand\" as fixed points in time, (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) and tried to avoid them when he could, as he knew they were not to be disturbed, (TV: The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) though briefly thought he could change one when he came to the conclusion that the Laws of Time were his to govern as the last of the Time Lords. (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) While he knew \"crossing into established events [was] strictly forbidden\", he would use his TARDIS to perform \"cheap tricks.\" (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor was particularly fond of his fifth incarnation, though he gently mocked him for wearing celery. However, the Tenth Doctor expressed that he enjoyed his fifth incarnation enough to take certain traits from him, such as wearing glasses to \"look a bit clever\", converse shoes and the way his voice went squeaky with excitement. (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) He also considered the Third Doctor to be \"brilliant\". (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) Initially, he was fearful of his war incarnation, but soon grew to greatly respect him for the impossible choices he had to make during the Time War. He admitted that it was as \"an honour and a privilege\" to work alongside him and his eleventh incarnation to save Gallifrey. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) The Tenth Doctor held a rather low opinion of his ninth incarnation, considering him to be violent due to being \"born in battle\". (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Nonetheless, he mused along with his twelfth incarnation that the Ninth Doctor was nothing short of \"fantastic\". (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nWhen it came to his future incarnations, the Tenth Doctor was often suspicious of them, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) in part because of his meeting with Jackson Lake. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) He would often seek conformation of their identities by comparing their sonic screwdrivers, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) or would scan them with the screwdriver himself. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) Despite a rocky start, he worked well with the Eleventh Doctor, although did get somewhat irritated by his childish attitude and was disgusted by his ignorance towards those who had died in the Time War. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nBecause he thought he couldn't exist due to their limited number of regenerations left, the Tenth Doctor was very cold and argumentative with the Twelfth Doctor, even calling him an \"abomination\" and briefly accused him of being the Valeyard, though they were able to work together when their companions and the Eleventh Doctor acted as mediators. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) When the Tenth Doctor met his twelfth incarnation at St Luke's University, he was more open to the idea of him, even calling him \"brilliant\" upon discovering his identity, though he lamented how elderly the Twelfth Doctor appeared. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nThe Ninth Doctor thought his tenth incarnation was \"fantastic\" for how much he had changed since the Time War. The Tenth Doctor was met with similar affections by his second and fifth incarnations, while the First Doctor referred to him as \"infantile\" and the Third Doctor dismissed his intelligence. (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor enjoyed teasing his friends, (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006).) and was not above being sarcastic to them. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He continued his previous incarnation's habit of teasing and making fun of Jackie Tyler, though generally in a more playful fashion. (TV: Born Again [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2005)., The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) He also had a noticeably more positive relationship with Mickey Smith than his predecessor, treating him as more of an equal and friend, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) though he occasionally relapsed into making fun of him or being dismissive. (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) The Doctor also prodded at Jack Harkness after they reunited, resuming his habit of telling Jack to \"stop it\" whenever he said hello to someone, which he saw as Jack's way of flirting with them. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) The Doctor referred to Donna Noble as his best friend, and had a great respect for her grandfather, Wilfred Mott, thinking of him as a kindred spirit, as he was also aged and experienced, yet energetic and unwilling to commit violence against others. The Doctor also stated that he felt it an honour to know Wilf, and claimed he would have been proud if he was his father. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nMuch like his fourth incarnation, the Tenth Doctor had a great respect and admiration for humanity, as well as a great desire to protect them, often noting their achievements, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) describing human beings as both \"brilliant\" and \"stupid\" in the same sentence while arguing the necessity of emotions with John Lumic. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) He also hugged Captain Zachary Cross Flane of the Walker Expedition, due to the human crew daring to explore a planet orbiting a black hole merely \"because it was there\". (TV: The Impossible Planet [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) When Wilf said that humanity must \"look like insects\" to a Time Lord, the Doctor responded that he thought they \"look[ed] like giants\". (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) However, he was not blind to their flaws, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., 42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and was aware of his tendency to forget that humanity could be \"stupid, stubborn and fail to learn from [their] mistakes\". (PROSE: Wetworld [+]Mark Michalowski, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).) He once admitted to Donna that he was uncertain if humanity could be considered mere explorers or like a virus to the galaxy. (TV: Planet of the Ood [+]Keith Temple, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor engaged in romantic situations far more frequently than his other incarnations, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) even falling in love with Rose Tyler. (AUDIO: Table for Two, Dinner for One [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) However, he found himself unable to explicitly describe these feelings, struggling with saying such things aloud. (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) In the end, it was the Meta-Crisis Doctor that revealed the Doctor's feelings for her. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) He also developed a romantic relationship with Madame de Pompadour. (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Others who wanted to engage him romantically included William Shakespeare, (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Martha Jones, (TV: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Jack Harkness, (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Astrid Peth, (TV: Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) Clare Pope, (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) River Song, (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Christina de Souza, (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) Minnie Hooper, (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) and Elizabeth I. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) Joan Redfern became romantically involved with his human identity, but rebuffed the Doctor himself. (TV: The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nWhile he acknowledged that \"children [could] be cruel\", (PROSE: The Mystery of the Haunted Cottage [+]Derek Landy, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).) the Tenth Doctor showed parental compassion towards the children he encountered, engaging in friendly conversations with a young Reinette and protecting her from a Clockwork Droid, (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) giving Tim Latimer his fob watch as a memento of their adventure together, (TV: The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and complimenting the Bannerman Road gang while they were under his care in his battle with the Trickster. (TV: The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith [+]Gareth Roberts, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 3 (BBC One, 2009).) While the Doctor showed little remorse in having to kill the Racnoss children to save the human race, (TV: The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006).) he showed compassion towards the young Adipose, deeming them innocent to their parents' crimes. (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhile the Tenth Doctor held a strong hatred for the Daleks, (TV: Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) his approach to them was to act dismissive instead of showing his rage, (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) though he reluctantly admired the Cult of Skaro for attempting to think \"above and beyond the Emperor himself\", (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and particularly grew to admire Dalek Sec when he became a Dalek-Human hybrid, going as far as to call him \"the cleverest Dalek ever\" after he tried to find redemption for the Daleks. He also attempted to empathise with Dalek Caan after he committed genocide against the Dalek-Human hybrid race, daring to offer his help towards Caan, citing how they were both the last of their respective people. (TV: Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) During the Kotturuh crisis, he was furious at the Eighth Doctor's initial alliance with the Dalek Time Squad and confessed to Brian it was becoming hard to act dismissive in front of the Daleks, as he really wanted to just scream at them. (PROSE: All Flesh is Grass [+]Una McCormack, Time Lord Victorious release order (BBC Books, 2020).) His preference to ignore and spite Daleks stretched to their creator, Davros, whom he insulted for his persistence to keep on creating Daleks even after their betrayals of him, (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and how he had become the Daleks' \"pet\" after the formation of the New Dalek Empire. However, he still offered to save Davros from the Cruciform after the Meta-Crisis Tenth Doctor began its destruction, only for Davros to refuse his aid. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Doctor scorned the Cybusmen created by Cybus Industries, notably their creator, John Lumic, for removing imagination and emotions from humanity, believing that he removed the reason for living at all. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) He also dismissed the Sontarans' ATMOS Stratagem as dishonourable, mocking General Staal for avoiding combat in favour of using clone feed. (TV: The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor expressed pity for the Saxon Master, (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) wanting to convince him that they could live together and \"see\" the universe rather than \"own\" it, going as far as to offer to help cure the Master's insanity. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) He even pledged to support the Master in his goals to conquer the universe in return for leaving Earth alone, but the Master refused. (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nDonna Noble described the Tenth Doctor as \"dazzling\", (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) with Rose viewing him as being more carefree than his ninth incarnation (PROSE: He's Behind You [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) and Jack believing him to have become \"cheeky\" in his new incarnation. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Clara Oswald, when distinguishing him from his other incarnations, described the Tenth Doctor as \"the hero\", (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) while Adam Mitchell identified the Tenth Doctor as the \"Oncoming Storm\" in comparison to his other incarnations. (COMIC: Unnatural Selection [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) Whilst he was the Time Lord Victorious, Brian the Ood believed the Tenth Doctor \"was vengeance\" and, as a result, the assassin much preferred him to the Eighth Doctor. (PROSE: All Flesh is Grass [+]Una McCormack, Time Lord Victorious release order (BBC Books, 2020).)\n\nTim Latimer described the Tenth Doctor as \"like fire and ice and rage, [that he was] like the night and the storm in the heart of the sun, [as well as being] ancient and forever, [burning] at the centre of time, and [could] see the turn of the universe.\" Despite his horrifying description, Latimer considered the Doctor to be \"wonderful,\" (TV: The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) a sentiment that Wilfred Mott also expressed. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) While Valerie Brannigan dismissed him as \"insane\", Thomas Kincade Brannigan commented that the Doctor was \"that, and a bit magnificent.\" (TV: Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nHaving experienced a similar process as John Smith, (TV: The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) the Doctor became fearful of his inevitable regeneration, going so far as to prevent the process by channelling the excess energy of his regeneration into his severed hand after being shot by a Dalek. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) He commented that regeneration was not a rebirth, but the death of himself. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) When Carmen prophesied his \"song ending\", the Doctor reacted with stunned silence, (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) and later became emotionally distressed when Ood Sigma heralded his demise. (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) When death seemed a certainty, he chose his last thoughts to be of the children the War Doctor had killed on Gallifrey when he destroyed it. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nWhen he realised he would have to sacrifice his life to save Wilfred Mott from the radiation of the Immortality Gate after thwarting Rassilon's Ultimate Sanction, the Doctor at first had a tantrum about how his \"reward\" was \"not fair\" and was tempted to let Wilf die when he requested it, but ultimately decided to fulfil Carmen's prophecy and save Wilf. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) While he put on a brave face for Rose, Jack and Donna during his aborted regeneration, (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) when his time finally came, the Doctor instead stated his reluctance to \"go\", and regenerated with tears in his eyes, afraid and alone. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nPossessing a voice that peaked in high tones when expressing excitement, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., 42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007)., Planet of the Ood [+]Keith Temple, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) the Tenth Doctor spoke in an accent described by George Litefoot as \"a kind of cultured cockney, flecked with hints of Scots\", (AUDIO: The Jago & Litefoot Revival [+]Jonathan Barnes, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2017).) which Mickey Smith believed he picked from Rose, (PROSE: The Christmas Invasion [+]Jenny T Colgan, adapted from The Christmas Invasion (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) with the Doctor himself once mentioning that he picked up his accent from the Powell Estate. (COMIC: Silver Scream [+]Tony Lee, Doctor Who (2009) (IDW Publishing, 2009).) The Eleventh Doctor compared his tenth incarnation's voice to that of Dick Van Dyke.

(TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)

(TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) He often talked about favourite foods and recipes, and wasn't afraid to try something new, such as seaweed truffles. (PROSE: Martha in the Mirror [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2008).)\n\nThe Doctor was an aficionado of twentieth century culture and made frequent references to movies, shows, books and songs from that era, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., 42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) though did not understand certain remarks, such as being called a \"science geek\". (TV: The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He was also fond of rock-and-roll, attempting to take Rose to see concerts by both Ian Dury and Elvis Presley. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nHe would cup his face while sitting,[source needed] jump over obstacles in his path,[source needed] and give of a serious of quick, \"no\"s, when displeased.[source needed] In times of distress, he would clench his teeth together. (TV: The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor relied heavily upon his sonic screwdriver, pushing it to limits not seen in previous incarnations, (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and even chiding the Fifth Doctor for going \"hands free\". (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) He felt defensive of his sonic screwdriver, debunking Dalek Sec's initial claim that it was a sonic probe in a hurt manner, (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) going as far as to say he \"loved\" it. (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor also revived the occasional use of a stethoscope in mostly non-medical situations, such as the diagnosis of electronic or mechanical faults or to eavesdrop on others, (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006)., Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) though he did occasionally use it to help with medical needs, (TV: Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Planet of the Ood [+]Keith Temple, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).)

(PROSE: The Price of Paradise [+]Colin Brake, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2006).) Some would even come to his defence when others thought he was a threat or a nuisance to the public. (TV: Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007)., The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nLike his previous incarnation, he had a gift for exerting authority, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., 42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) with even the most resistant of individuals eventually submitting to his way of thinking, (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007)., The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) However, when struggling to solve the issue at hand, people would dismiss his perceived authority as egotistical and actively turn against him. (TV: Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Adelaide Brooke went so far as to kill herself in defiance to the Doctor's self-declared status as the \"Time Lord Victorious\", despite him initially convincing her to trust him. (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nLike his previous incarnations, the Tenth Doctor was highly intelligent, being able to figure out solutions to problems even when they were created by an equally intelligent opponent, (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) but mostly improvised his strategies, using the justification that he did it \"brilliantly\". (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) He often did mathematical calculations in his head very quickly, making estimates and waiting for those around him to respond, and then giving a very exact answer. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) He could recount his steps accurately from memory alone, (TV: Dreamland [+]Phil Ford, Doctor Who Animated Special 2009 (BBC Red Button, 2009).) and even worked out the force that the pull on Krop Tor needed to resist the pull of a black hole in minutes, something that had taken the entire crew on the base years to figure out. (TV: The Impossible Planet [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor was an exceptionally skilled detective, deducing when people had been possessed or replaced, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) picking up on clues that escaped others perception, (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) figuring out how to defeat his opponents from little details they gave away or from his surroundings, (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and learning the details of a person after getting a brief glimpse at them. (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007)., The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).) His observation skills proved superior to that of the Saxon Master, with him noticing that one of his Master Race guards was Rossiter in disguise due to him being a little too tall to be an exact copy of the Master. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) Although he could be incorrect on occasion, such as when he continuously thought Queen Elizabeth I was a Zygon. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhile he had little interest in sport, (AUDIO: Time Reaver [+]Jenny Colgan, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2016).) the Tenth Doctor possessed the agility and relaxes of a skilled football player, (COMIC: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).) being able to keep ahead of significantly faster opponents with ease. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Planet of the Ood [+]Keith Temple, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Despite his nimble stature, the Doctor was very strong, managing to easily yank the Sycorax leader's electric whip from his grip and snap it in half, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) free Morvin Van Hoff from the grip of a damaged Heavenly Host, (TV: Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) rip off Lucius Petrus Dextrus' stone arm, (TV: The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) hold off a Cyberman with a sword, (TV: The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).) and lift a grown woman and throw her away from danger in such a way that she landed on her feet. (COMIC: The Arts in Space [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).) He could even hold his own weight and manoeuvre across a beam with just his hands gripping to it. (TV: Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) However, he could be knocked down from a direct blow to the head, (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) and was unable to escape from the hold of artificial opponents without aid. (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor displayed incredible resilience and resistance to physical pain, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., 42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) quickly recovering from being knocked unconscious and being able to carry on with the matter at hand with no sign of concussion, (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and speedily recovered from being stabbed in his left heart, although he needed Martha to strike his back a few times before he could move properly again. (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He also withstood several electrical attacks from the Saxon Master, was able to get to his feet with only some difficulty after jumping out of a ship and falling through a skylight, and was able to absorb five-hundred-thousand rads of nuclear energy and survive as well, although it was the final straw for his body and triggered his regeneration, but he refused to allow the pain of the regeneration to overwhelm him until he was back in the TARDIS after visiting his old companions. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nAlthough he disliked firearms, the Doctor was an extremely good shot with a gun, being able to shoot a White-Point Star from a distance, (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) as well as throw and catch objects with pinpoint accuracy.

He was also skilled with a sword, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).) having it as his weapon of choice if he had to fight. (TV: The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).; PROSE: The Mystery of the Haunted Cottage [+]Derek Landy, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor was also a skilled telepath, (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Planet of the Ood [+]Keith Temple, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) being able to wipe Donna Noble's memories, (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and hide his true name from those who could read minds. (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) During the Year That Never Was, he also managed to tune himself into the Archangel Network in his plan to defeat the Master. (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He could also hypnotise people with a Venusian lullaby. (PROSE: Peacemaker [+]James Swallow, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor was able to construct a variant of gadgets and devices from scrap and other items he had on hand, (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Blink [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow (Steven Moffat), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) and also claimed to be \"brilliant\" with computers. (TV: Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He was even able to build K9 Mark IV to replace the Mark III after he was destroyed. (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nHaving once affirmed he could perform medical procedures himself, the Tenth Doctor was a skilled medic, managing to cure the new humans of their diseases on New Earth, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and also performed surgery on Laszlo that ensuring he lived beyond a pig slave' life expectancy. (TV: Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He also briefly sustained the Face of Boe's life to ensure he saw the humans freed from the Motorway. (TV: Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He even used his knowledge to accurately diagnose a man had drowned artificially. (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nHe also possessed a heightened sense of smell, which he used to tell which time period he was in by smelling the air, (TV: The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and track down the Master. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) He could determine the properties of an object by taste, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005)., Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) and was said to have acute hearing. (PROSE: In the Blood [+]Jenny Colgan, (informally) BBC Books past Doctor novels (BBC Books, 2016).)\n\nHe was a skilled organist. (TV: The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nOn several occasions, the Doctor managed to pilot the TARDIS like a standard spaceship rather than simply dematerialising it. (TV: The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006)., Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) He was also able to lock the coordinates of the TARDIS with his sonic screwdriver so that it could only travel between two places in time and space. (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) When told by River Song that he would one day be able to command the TARDIS door to open with a snap of his fingers, he found that he did possess such abilities, after initially believing it to be nonsense. (TV: Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nHe was a skilled pilot, able to take control and navigate a spacecraft through and out of danger. (TV: Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007)., Dreamland [+]Phil Ford, Doctor Who Animated Special 2009 (BBC Red Button, 2009)., The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) He could also ride a horse, (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) drive a moped, (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) fly a hot-air balloon, (TV: The Next Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2008 (BBC One, 2008).) and ride a motorcycle. (COMIC: The Stockbridge Child [+]Dan McDaid, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2008-2009).)\n\nHaving learned \"millions of languages\", (PROSE: The Eyeless [+]Lance Parkin, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2008).) the Doctor could speak the Pawnee tribal language, (PROSE: Peacemaker [+]James Swallow, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).) Latin, (TV: The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Judoonese, (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and Ancient North Martian, (TV: The Waters of Mars [+]Russell T Davies and Phil Ford, Doctor Who Autumn Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) as well as the languages of the Sycorax (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) and the Tritovore. (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) However, he had never learned Welsh, believing that he would never have the need to use it. (PROSE: The Eyeless [+]Lance Parkin, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2008).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor could disguise his scent so that he smelt like a human instead of a Time Lord, (TV: The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) speed read a book, (PROSE: The Price of Paradise [+]Colin Brake, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2006).) and use escapology to pinpoint a weak point in his restraints and find the best place to stain against to enable his liberation. (TV: Dreamland [+]Phil Ford, Doctor Who Animated Special 2009 (BBC Red Button, 2009).) He appeared to have the ability to carry a large and diverse number of objects in his pockets, telling Donna Noble that they were \"bigger on the inside\". (TV: The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThe Doctor was able to channel radiation through a body part into his own clothing, although the radiated body part was described by him as being \"itchy\". (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) However, he could only do this with a small amount of radiation and the radiation he absorbed to save Wilfred Mott was too much for him and he was forced to regenerate. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) If poisoned, he could also \"stimulate the inhibited enzymes [of cyanide] into reversal\" by ingesting ginger beer, a form of protein, salt and receiving a shock. (TV: The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Doctor also showed an impressive amount of control over his regenerative abilities, more so than his previous incarnations. He was able to heal himself after being shot by a Dalek and then stop himself from changing his form by channelling the regeneration energy into his severed hand. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Improving on the control the First Doctor exhibited, (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) the Tenth Doctor was also able to resist regenerating long enough to visit his old friends, though this resulted in his regeneration becoming so violent that the TARDIS was set ablaze in the process. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor was a handsome man with a tall, slim frame, finely boned hands and face, thick brown hair, pale skin scattered with freckles, and large, dark brown eyes, (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Born Again [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2005).) which he recognised were his first of that colour. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Cindy Wu observed through his eyes that he was older than he looked, and identified the older looking Third Doctor as a younger incarnation by looking into his eyes. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) Similarly, River Song could tell that he was younger than she was familiar with by looking into his eyes. (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) He had a mole between his shoulder blades, (TV: Born Again [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2005).) and fillings in his teeth. (TV: 42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He went clean-shaven, (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) even avoiding growing a beard over a five day period through sheer concentration. (PROSE: Prisoner of the Daleks [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2009).) While he was on the cusp of regenerating, the Tenth Doctor was observed by George Litefoot as looking to be no more than 40-years-old in human terms. (AUDIO: The Jago & Litefoot Revival [+]Jonathan Barnes, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nSeeing himself as a \"handsome bloke in a tight suit\" with \"amazing hair\", (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) the Tenth Doctor was noted for having vanity issues, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) to the point that he used his severed hand to prevent a complete regeneration, reasoning that he did not want to change, rhetorically asking why he would do so after seeing himself. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhile she was possessing his body at the New New York Hospital, Lady Cassandra O'Brien.Δ17 stated that the Tenth Doctor was \"slim, and a little bit foxy.\" (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Donna Noble likewise described him as \"too skinny for words\", (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) remarking that his jacket \"wouldn't fit a rat\". (TV: The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nSteve Woolfall thought the Tenth Doctor looked like \"that Casanova bloke\". (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) Jackie Tyler claimed that the Tenth Doctor \"looked like a prawn, but [was] good in a crisis\". (PROSE: Judge, Jury and Executioner [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013).) Rose Tyler also noted that he was tall, skinny, and had \"some really great hair\" (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and also compared his appearance to the earnest singer of a boy band from the early 2000s. (PROSE: He's Behind You [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor was considered attractive by people he encountered on his travels, with Mickey Smith even noting that he was \"better-looking\" than his previous incarnation, (COMIC: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).) and River Song even nicknaming him \"Pretty Boy\". (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Clare Pope tried to arrange a date with the Doctor upon meeting him, (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and Gwen Cooper, who had heard of the Doctor from Jack Harkness, commented that he was \"nice\" upon seeing him, having believed he would be \"older\", though Ianto Jones commented that \"he [was] not that young\". (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Kath Braxton called him \"absolutely scrummy\". (COMIC: The Age of Ice [+]Dan McDaid, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2009).) Minnie Hooper described him as \"gorgeous\", \"handsome\" and \"a looker\", eagerly taking the opportunity to have a photograph taken with him, with Oliver Barnes eager to follow. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nDespite going to great lengths to join him as a travelling companion, Donna was not physically interested in the Doctor, even being repulsed by the prospect of \"mating\" with him, describing him as \"just a long streak\" of \"alien nothing\". (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) She later dismissed the notion that he was \"pretty\". (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhile one account showed a different face, (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) in the account of the Doctor's trial on Gallifrey where he was shown his future incarnations as potential direct successors for his forced regeneration, the Second Doctor rejected the Tenth Doctor's appearance for being \"too thin\". (TV: The War Games in Colour [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, adapted from The War Games (Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke), Doctor Who season 6 (BBC Four, 2024).) The Eleventh Doctor similarly described his tenth incarnation's skinniness as a \"special effect\". (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor poked fun at his tenth incarnation's youthful appearance, nicknaming him \"Bambi\" because of his brown eyes. (COMIC: Vortex Butterflies [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor was happy to have sideburns and to have more hair than his previous incarnation. (TV: Born Again [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2005).) Though he initially seemed disappointed at not being ginger, he came to take great pride in his dark brown hair, wearing it in various ways throughout his adventures, such as un-styled, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) slicked back, (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) in a quiff, (TV: Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) or flattened forwards. (TV: The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006).) At some point, he began to experiment with back-combing his hair. (TV: Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nWilfred Mott described the Doctor's hair to the Silver Cloak as being a \"modern style\", and \"all sticky-uppy\", (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) while the Doctor himself described his hair as a \"just-seen-a-ghost\" hairstyle. (COMIC: The Weeping Angels of Mons [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).) The Twelfth Doctor once recalled having \"electro-shock\" hair. (COMIC: Clara Oswald and the School of Death [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nThe Doctor's attire was often accompanied by a light brown Duster-type overcoat, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) which the Doctor claimed had been given to him by Janis Joplin. (TV: Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) He usually threw it off in preparation to flying the TARDIS, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Unicorn and the Wasp [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) upon entering a property, (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) or when about to do something of which the coat would get in the way. (TV: Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Doctor had two main suits, a dark brown suit with blue pinstripes, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) and a blue suit with red pinstripes. (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Under his suits, he usually wore a dress shirt and a loose tie under his unbuttoned collar, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) or wore an open-necked shirt with a T-shirt and white or grey top underneath. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Planet of the Ood [+]Keith Temple, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) For footwear, he wore Converse All Stars trainers, (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) coloured in cream white, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) black, (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) red, (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and yellow. (TV: The Infinite Quest [+]Alan Barnes, CBBC (2007).) Despite his protests, both his war and eleventh incarnations stated the trainers he wore were sandshoes. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nHis shirt colours of choice were plain white, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) cadet blue, (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) navy blue, (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) light blue, (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) bottle green, (TV: The Impossible Planet [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) scarlet red, (TV: 42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) dark navy blue, (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and navy red. (COMIC: The Ghost Ship [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) His t-shirts were coloured olive brown, (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) cadet blue, (TV: Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) crimson red, (TV: Planet of the Ood [+]Keith Temple, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) navy blue, (TV: Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and plain white. (COMIC: The Ghost Ship [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHis ties included a dark chestnut brown tie with subtle flora woven pattern on, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) a brown and blue tie with a woven geometric pattern, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) a dark chocolate brown birds-eye weave tie with very subtle brown circles in a diagonal grid, (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) a dark brown tie with bold swirly woven design in light blue, (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) a blue tie with a woven geometric pattern, (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) a brown tie with repeating s-shaped woven motif, (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) navy blue tie with burgundy circles in diagonal grid, (TV: The Impossible Planet [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) a dark brown tie with stylised peacock-eye blue and brown motif in honeycomb grid, (TV: Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) a herringboned burgundy background tie with mauve random flora random design, (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) a deep navy blue background tie with red flora random design, (TV: Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) plain dark red, (TV: The Infinite Quest [+]Alan Barnes, CBBC (2007).) a ribbed brown tie with a white and sky-blue repeating stylised flora design in diagonal bands, (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) a brown tie with raised diagonal stripes of navy and light blue, (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) a burgundy tie with diagonal black stripes, (TV: The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) a plain blue tie, (PROSE: The Mystery of the Haunted Cottage [+]Derek Landy, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).) a dark brown tie with semi-random floral design of blue flowers and bronze foliage, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) and a black and red striped design. (COMIC: Lady of the Blue Box [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nKevin Jones thought that the Doctor's clothes made him look like he worked in menswear. (AUDIO: Technophobia [+]Matt Fitton, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nBecause he became long-sighted after his regeneration, (PROSE: The Christmas Invasion [+]Jenny T Colgan, adapted from The Christmas Invasion (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) the Doctor would occasionally don a pair of dark tortoise-shell rectangular frame glasses, (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) which he affectionately called his \"brainy specs\". (TV: Time Crash [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).) While on San Helios, the Doctor used his sonic screwdriver to darken the lenses to effectively turn them into sunglasses. (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nAfter arriving at the Powell Estate following his regeneration, the Doctor was stripped of his predecessor's clothing and placed in a set of pyjamas and a dressing gown by Jackie Tyler, which he kept until he chose a new outfit from the TARDIS wardrobe. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nFor certain formal occasions, the Tenth Doctor would also don a white shirt with a black bow tie and tuxedo suit, accompanied by dark Converse All Stars trainers. (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nIn his private life, the Doctor often dressed much less formally. When he slept, he wore a pair of boxers decorated with illustrations of the TARDIS. He would often sleep in a plain T-shirt, and, while he would usually choose between suits during the day, he also would occasionally wear less formal attire if cooking or spending time with Rose-the-Cat and K9. (COMIC: A Rose by Any Other Name [+]Rachael Smith, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor backup comic stories (Titan Comics, 2014-2016).) He also owned a pair of pyjamas which more closely resembled his pinstriped suit. (COMIC: To Sleep, Perchance to Scream [+]Al Davison, Doctor Who Annual 2010 (2010).)\n\nAfter sentencing the Kotturuh to a lifespan of fifteen minutes, the Doctor adopted a set of Time Lord robes, coloured scarlet and orange as per his Chapter, over his usual suit. He believed it was appropriate as he was \"ringing in the dawn of a new era\" and explained to Brian the Ood that it was what his people had worn when going into battle, though purely ceremonial by his era. (PROSE: The Knight, The Fool and The Dead [+]Steve Cole, Time Lord Victorious (BBC Books, 2020).) He continued to wear the robes whilst in the Dark Times, even on a desert planet. (COMIC: Tales of the Dark Times [+]Comic Creator (Scary Beasties, 2020).)",
