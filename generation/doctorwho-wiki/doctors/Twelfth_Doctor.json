  "content": "Exploiting his vast intelligence and experiences without a fear of hiding his age, he could be difficult to deal with when there was work to be done, but remained capable of incredible compassion towards even the least likely of folk, determined to save anyone he could if it was an option, while not wasting time trying to save someone who was doomed beyond salvation.\n\nUnique amongst his incarnations, the Twelfth Doctor would not travel full time with the large majority of his companions, with some like Clara Oswald and Bill Potts taking breaks from the TARDIS between travels, some like Hattie Munroe taking the occasional trip, and some like Jata being involved in various side quests during a longer trip. He was also known to go long periods of time in one location, such as the town of Краснодар, his confession dial, 1970s Brixton, Darillium, and St Luke's University.\n\nAssured of the survival of Gallifrey, the Doctor was no longer chained down by guilt, becoming a less amiable character, as he no longer needed to cover the pain of what he thought was the extinction of the Time Lords, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) which left him to wonder if he was still a \"good man\", a question left more uncertain by his failure to reform a Dalek, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and when compared to the more idealistically heroic characters like Robin Hood (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and Danny Pink. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) As he continued to drive people away with his apparent callousness, even Clara found herself wanting to leave the Doctor when he took his disinterest too far, (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) until he proved his worth to her by defeating the Foretold, (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) although this left Clara trying to emulate him in their battles with the Boneless (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and the Umbra, (COMIC: The Eye of Torment [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) further confusing the Doctor on his moral standings, which was not resolved until his first confrontation with Missy, where she tried to corrupt him by handing him an army of Cybermen to force his ideas of peace of the universe, and he realised that he was simply \"an idiot with a box and screwdriver\" who went around helping where he could. However, the fallout of Missy's plan left the Doctor and Clara deciding to part ways. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nAfter they were reunited in an attack by the Dream crabs, the Doctor and Clara experienced dreams of what their lives would be like without the other and decided to take a second chance with adventuring together, (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) with the Doctor showing his goofier side more clearly (TV: The Doctor's Meditation [+]Steven Moffat, Prequels (BBC America, 2015).) and forging a closer bond with Clara as they faced machinations from the likes of Davros, (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Missy (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and the Fisher King. (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nHowever, the threat of a mythical creature called the Hybrid would haunt their travels, (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) as the Doctor combined Mire technology to render a Viking girl named Ashildr immortal, (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and she would continue to watch him and Clara from the shadows of history, (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) as they stopped a Zygon rebellion (TV: The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and saved Jess Collins from the Corvids at Highgate Cemetery. (COMIC: The Highgate Horror [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Eventually, Ashildr would make her move against the Doctor at the behest of Rassilon, and Clara was killed (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) as the Doctor was trapped in a Confession Dial and forced to endure four-and-a-half-billion years of torture to get him to confess what he knew of the Hybrid. After he manged to escape, (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) the Doctor ousted Rassilon from Gallifrey and tried to resurrected Clara with an extraction chamber, but only succeeded in retrieving her from the seconds before her death. Fleeing Gallifrey to the end of the universe, the Doctor retrieved Ashildr to help him erase Clara's memories of him to hide her from the Time Lords, but ultimately had his memories of her erased with the neural block, leaving Clara and Ashildr to travel the universe while he continued his solitary exploits. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nNow content with being \"an old man messing about in time and space\", (PROSE: Haunted [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor was reunited with Gabby Gonzalez by the Moment, (COMIC: The Good Companion [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017-2018).) and joined forces with his previous companions to take down Josiah W. Dogbolter. (COMIC: The Stockbridge Showdown [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2016).) He also enjoyed some adventures with guitarist Hattie Munroe, (COMIC: The Twist [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and spend some time living with Jess's family when his TARDIS was left recovering from an implosion. (COMIC: The Pestilent Heart [+]Mark Wright, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2016).) After seeing to the formation of the Coal Hill defenders at Coal Hill Academy, (TV: For Tonight We Might Die [+]Patrick Ness, Class television stories series 1 (BBC Three, 2016).) the Doctor accidentally gifted superpowers to Grant Gordon with the Hazandra gemstone, (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).) helped the Osumaran Jata return to Osumare, (COMIC: From the Horse's Mouth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and was assisted in solving a mystery with Alex and Brandon Yow. (AUDIO: The Lost Angel [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile relaxing on Mendorax Dellora, the Doctor was reunited with River Song by her assistant, Nardole, and the pair had their fated final night on Darillium, which lasted for twenty-four years. (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nOnce his night on Darillium ended, the Doctor was joined by Nardole, (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).) when he was charged with guarding Missy in a vault at St Luke's University, with the Doctor working to rehabilitate her so they could mend their old friendship. (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) However, despite Nardole trying to keep him grounded, the Doctor would find reasons to sneak away from the Vault to adventure in his TARDIS, which happened even more frequently when he began tutoring Bill Potts by Christmas 2016. Once he decided to make her an official companion after saving her from some sentient oil, (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) the Doctor and Bill fought Emojibots at Gliese 581d, (TV: Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) saved a sea serpent during the 1814 Frost fair (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and faced off threats from the Dreamspace being sent by Fey Truscott-Sade. (COMIC: The Phantom Piper [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter a rescue mission on Chasm Forge left him blinded from exposure to vacuum of space, (TV: Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) the Doctor was unable to stop an invasion by the Monks when Bill brokered a deal with them to restore his sight, (TV: The Pyramid at the End of the World [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and had to endure six months of undercover work to exile them from the Earth, though found that his absence had caused Missy to undergo self-reflection. (TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) When she later saved him from Mars, (TV: Empress of Mars [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) the Doctor granted her access to the TARDIS so that she could watch him, Bill and Nardole adventure against light-eating locusts and show her a better way of living. (TV: The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) However, a final test on Missy's rehabilitation on a Mondasian colony ship resulted in Bill becoming a Cyberman, (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Missy leaving with the Saxon Master, and Nardole having to be left behind. As he was left mortally wounded in the battle against the Cybermen, the Doctor resisted the regenerative process, having grown weary of constantly changing personas and losing companions, (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) but was encouraged to regenerate by glass avatars of Bill and Nardole after he crossed paths with his first incarnation and the Testimony Foundation. Accepting his impending regeneration and his responsibility to life itself, the Doctor used his last moments to give his successor some words of advice before finishing his regeneration into a female body. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor was portrayed by actor Peter Capaldi in the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who, who was cast in 2013; (PROSE: A Letter from the Doctor 464 [+]A Letter from the Doctor (Panini Magazines, 2013).) an advert which had an obscured image of Capaldi in his role was applied to the side of a bus (TV: In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) in November 2014; (PROSE: \"Assessing the Risk\" [+]Justin Richards, BBC Books (2015).) in October 2015, Capaldi was in the ninth series of Doctor Who; (WC: The Zygon Isolation [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (BBC, YouTube, 2020).) and on 29 April 2016, Capaldi wrote a letter to be printed in the 500th issue of Doctor Who Magazine. (PROSE: A Letter from the Doctor 500 [+]A Letter from the Doctor (Panini Magazines, 2016).) The Eleventh Doctor also saved Capaldi from a Mandrel. (COMIC: The Girl Who Loved Doctor Who [+]Paul Cornell, 2013 Doctor Who Special (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nBurdened with an unending anger, (COMIC: Doorway to Hell [+]Mark Wright, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2017).) and a fear of what his rage was capable of, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Twelfth Doctor started his journey as a gruff yet compassionate man, (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) who struggled with the inner turmoil of his questionable morality (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and how his action could lead to devastating consequences (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) even as he embraced a goofier side of himself. (TV: The Doctor's Meditation [+]Steven Moffat, Prequels (BBC America, 2015)., The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) He eventually made peace with himself, (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).) embracing his role as both warrior and protector (TV: Empress of Mars [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) to become a true paragon of kindness and hope. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) Though he grew lax enough to use the contemporary slang (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016)., Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) he had previously looked down upon, (COMIC: Terrorformer [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).) the Doctor never softened from his harsh attitude to those he saw as impulsive and reckless due to their short-sightedness, (TV: The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) but would try to inspire his foes to better themselves when he could. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nWith his main impetus for many adventures being to stimulate his scientific curiosity, (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Doctor would be forever enthralled by the strange beauties he found in a universe that birthed grand creations. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) However, beneath the fierce determination and adventurous persona, the Twelfth Doctor was a weary man who would succumb to despair when pushed to the brink, (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) feeling ostracised from a universe that didn't \"see\" him. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nBlunt to the point of insensitiveness, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and reluctant to lie to alleviate a situation, (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Doctor would allow actions to prove a point instead of false praise, (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) though he knew the importance of giving people the hope they needed to ensure their survival, (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and would have them focus on their chances of survival, however slim, to encourage them to prevail. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Though he tried to avoid pessimism, (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Doctor would not give his sympathies lightly. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He could also be oblivious to his faults, while criticising the same faults he saw elsewhere. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nHe struggled to disguise himself in the mundane world, failing to hide his alien nature by openly calling people \"humans\", (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Empress of Mars [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and had a tendency to resolve his problems with explosions, (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Pyramid at the End of the World [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) which he chalked up as a \"childish impulse\". (TV: Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) While he would not run from danger, (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) he would hide from his shame, (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and shirk his responsibilities to indulge in more excitable activities, (TV: The Doctor's Meditation [+]Steven Moffat, Prequels (BBC America, 2015)., Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) having trouble ignoring the call for adventure. (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor also hoped to one day find Gallifrey and reacted with devastation when his hope of finding it turned out to be a false lead. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) When he finally did manage to find his way to Gallifrey after enduring \"4.5 billion years\" of torture within his confession dial, he first returned to his old barn hideaway in the Drylands and then lead a coup against Rassilon to banish him and the High Council for their part in escalating the Last Great Time War. After using the Time Lords' technology to save Clara from the Quantum Shade, the Doctor fled from Gallifrey once again. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nStarting his life as a cynical man with a dry, acerbic wit, brutal honesty and fierce internalised anger, the Twelfth Doctor adopted a less caring attitude and a more practical nature, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) even claiming that he brought Clara with him to care for others for him (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and to nod along with his ideas. (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Despite coming across as uncaring, with a complete disregard for social niceties, he would fight to protect those in his care and would react with devastation if harm befell them (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) or if he caused them emotional grief due to overestimating how they could handle a situation. (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) He would also regret the deaths of good people, especially if the survivors displayed an unpleasant attitude. (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nPreferring to keep his softer side hidden under a \"reputation [of] grumpiness\", (COMIC: The Hyperion Empire [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) the Doctor would make people keep their emotions in check while they were distressed, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) making him come across as callous and dismissive, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) which he refused to be apologetic for. (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) He himself tried to avoid his own emotions by preferring to talk about subjects he enjoyed during emotional moments. (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) However, behind his cold exterior, he was extremely self-reflective, to the point where he even questioned whether he was a good man, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) knowing that he often found himself in situations that forced him to make terrible decisions. (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Clara felt that \"there were several layers to the Doctor's emotions.\" (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nUnlike his immediate predecessor, the Twelfth Doctor was not an affectionate individual, failing to return hugs, or protesting against them, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) believing they were just another way to hide one's face. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) He also expressed a dislike of holding hands with others, though made an exception for Clara and Shona McCullough, (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) but he drew the line at performing a high five with Clara. (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) He was also uncomfortable with kissing, (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) with even a peck on the check stunning him. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) However, he pecked Missy on the lips in gratitude for forcing him into self-reflection, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) kissed Clara's forehead while complimenting her brilliance in a moment of excitement, (COMIC: The Big Hush [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and gave Meghan, a donkey he had befriended, a kiss on the head when he thought no one was looking. (PROSE: All the Empty Towers [+]Jenny T. Colgan, The Scientific Secrets of Doctor Who (2015).)\n\nWhile he identified himself as a civilian, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Doctor did not hide how superior he felt with his intelligence, (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) unafraid to put people down with harsh comments upon meeting them, (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) even claiming to have laughed at Orson Pink's name. (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) While his personal views caused him to make unfavourable judgments of people upon meeting them, (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Doctor knew not to be judgmental of alien behaviour, (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and was quick to bond with fellow rebels. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) However, he was not above saying how funny he found humans' \"small brain[s]\" (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and telling them to panic over their \"short lifespan\", (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) though he was quick to call out his own idiocy when he realised he had made a mistake. (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nBecause names were \"not [his] area\", (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Doctor could neglect to ask for names when he met someone, (TV: In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) as he often chose to forget people, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) or didn't have time to remember individual names. (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) As such, the Doctor made a habit of assigning nicknames to others based on their appearance, an accessory they carried or their profession, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and would insist on addressing them as their nickname, such as calling Maths teacher Danny Pink \"P.E.\" due to him being a former soldier, (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) though he dropped the nickname after Danny died. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) He also continued to address Rigsy as \"Local Knowledge\" when he was standing in front of him, (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and when they reunited years later, only dropping the nickname when he learned Rigsy's life was in danger. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) He would also start addressing people by their real names instead of nicknaming them when they earned his respect. (COMIC: The Eye of Torment [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHowever, after embracing the idea of being \"just a bloke in a box\", (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) the Doctor employed a wackier demeanour, (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) wearing more casual clothing, (TV: The Doctor's Meditation [+]Steven Moffat, Prequels (BBC America, 2015)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and relaxing by playing his guitar in the TARDIS. (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) He made a better effort to be nicer through the use of apology cue cards (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) in order to live up to the idea of who he thought \"the Doctor\" should be.

(TV: Sleep No More [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) However, he did not entirely abandon his pragmatic ideology, (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and would resume being hostile when angered.

(TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) While he retained his crossness, (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015)., Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) being against \"cheerful[ness]\" and \"charm\", (TV: Knock Knock [+]Mike Bartlett, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) he was more willing to laugh at the silliness he found in his travels (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).) and would be deliberately pedantic in the face of danger.

(TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).)

(TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016)., Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) While he \"never notice[d] the tears\", (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) he was better at making friends, (TV: Knock Knock [+]Mike Bartlett, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) even playing the part of a playful jokester with Bill, (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) as he tried to avoid being serious. (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).)\n\nThough he remained reluctant to initiate a hug at first, (COMIC: The Good Companion [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017-2018).) the Doctor accepted being a hugger by the time he reunited with Maxwell Edison, giving an affectionate one to Max, (COMIC: The Stockbridge Showdown [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2016).) and also embraced the chance to hug Bill after losing her in a conflict with the Cybermen. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nHaving accepted that \"times end\", the Doctor found the courage in himself to finally face his night on Darillium with River Song, embracing the bittersweet \"happy ever after\" for them that had previously been too hard to bear. (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).) After he left Darillium, the Doctor allowed Nardole to accompany him to avoid being lonely. (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).) While normally in control of himself and disciplined in his actions, (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) the Doctor's longing to travel again while guarding the Vault at St Luke's University led him to indulge in more impulsive and reckless actions that left his guard down.

As he \"hardly ever listen[ed] when other people [were] talking\", (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).) the Doctor tended to stop listening to ongoing conversations when he lost interest, (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) as he saw only himself as being \"someone worth talking to\".

(TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor also showed a strong compassionate streak, willing to put himself in a dangerous situation in the place of a stranger as equally as a dear friend, (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and make enormous personal sacrifices simply to liberate others from suffering.

He would also try to avoid harming those who were not in control of their actions, as well as defend them from their captors or those who would cause them further harm. (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., The Crawling Terror [+]Mike Tucker, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) He was just as quick to forgive those that had wronged him, (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and try to make peace with even his oldest enemies, (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) believing that while \"passion [fought], [it was] reason [that won].\" (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nWhile he described himself as having had \"sophistication and timeless sartorial elegance\" restored, (COMIC: Terrorformer [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).) the Twelfth Doctor was not above acting childish by competing with others, (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014)., The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) or deliberately annoying someone. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) He also let down his gruff guard to do a victory dance after moving the shrunken TARDIS off a train line with his hand, (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and ecstatically steer Santa Claus's sleigh. (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) Kevin Alperton noted that, while the Doctor looked old, he had an energy to him that made him seem younger and different.

(TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nEnjoying the \"deep and lovely dark\", the Doctor enthusiastically tried to find out the cause of his childhood nightmares, (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) was delighted when he finally saw the Foretold, (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) got giddy over possibly finding out the existence of ghosts, (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) was eager to explore a mysterious house (COMIC: Playing House [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and gleefully laughed as he sped a ship into British waters.

He was also easily annoyed by swashbucklers who did not take things seriously and insisted on fighting pointless battles, (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and was disgusted by businesspeople who valued profit above anything else, (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Sleep No More [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) including politicians.

He thought that \"hardly anything [was] evil, but [that] most things [were] hungry\", and that \"hunger look[ed] very [much] like evil from the wrong end of the cutlery\". (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He also didn't believe in dragons. (COMIC: The Dragon Lord [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHaving a liking for \"quick learners\", (COMIC: Spirits of the Jungle [+]Jonathan Morris, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2015).) the Doctor believed that education came quickest in life threatening situations, and claimed that begging \"wasn't [his] style\", (COMIC: Terrorformer [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).) unless his friends were threatened. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) While he believed that \"a good death [was] the best anyone [could] hope for\", (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) he didn't think it was possible to \"die well\". (TV: For Tonight We Might Die [+]Patrick Ness, Class television stories series 1 (BBC Three, 2016).) When giving life advice, the Doctor would say to laugh hard because everything was \"always funny\", to run fast because people always needed to, to never fail at being kind, and to always make amends if they acted cruel and cowardly. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nEven though he identified himself as a pacifist (COMIC: Terrorformer [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).) and believed necessary evils to be a last resort, (COMIC: The Fractures [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) the Twelfth Doctor was unafraid to trade blows with others. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Though he initially stated that murder was against his \"programming\", (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Doctor knew there were \"situations when the options available [were] limited\" and death was unavoidable, (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and was willing to allow a few inevitable deaths if it meant saving the majority, acting like a pragmatist that would not hesitate to abandon someone whose fate was already sealed, nor mourn for an ally until his objective had been reached. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Sleep No More [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) However, the Doctor was still willing to go out of his way to try and save people if their deaths were not an immediate inevitability, even if it was the life of a caged bird. (WC: A Hero like the Doctor [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.\n\nThe Doctor was practical regarding death, being quick to recover what he could when there was nothing he could do to save someone, instead focusing on what he could control when all hope seemed lost, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) even being willing to sacrifice others when he had broader goals in mind, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) sometimes even devising a plan in which others' skills would prove useful. (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nWhile he was adamant not to kill out of hatred, (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) especially when conflicts could be resolved diplomatically, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) the Doctor was willing to kill to spare others from the burden of taking a life, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) or when acting in extreme selfishness and being assured they could recover with a regeneration. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) He once gave permission for UNIT to engage Zygons with lethal force, so long as they kept fatalities to a minimum, (TV: The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and left Ron Cordell and some Skinks to be devoured by a black hole after tampering with the black hole drive's containment field. (COMIC: Pirates of Vourakis [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He also viewed certain creatures as expendable, as he wanted to kill a Kantrofarri to save Clara from slowly being devoured by it, (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) and crushed a Love Sprite under his heel to prevent it attacking him. (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhile he did not dwell on the subject much, the Twelfth Doctor was still haunted by the War Doctor's actions in the Last Great Time War, and claimed to hear \"more screams than anyone could ever be able to count\" whenever he closed his eyes. When he learned that all Bonnie truly wanted was a pointless war between humanity and the Zygons, he went into a furious and grief-stricken tirade by telling her that he knew what war was really like and that he would not allow her to lead others to their deaths. (TV: The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) While he disliked guns, (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) he noted that it was foolish to disregard them when they were useful, (PROSE: The Crawling Terror [+]Mike Tucker, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) and was willing to utilise them when he felt the need to, but would immediately discard them once they were no longer needed. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhile he could forget the consequences of time travelling when carried away, (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Twelfth Doctor was unwilling to alter the Web of Time, (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) fearing that the ramifications from the tiniest changes could be catastrophic, spreading \"carnage and chaos across the universe like ripples on a pond,\" (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) though he preferred to create \"ripples\" instead of \"tidal waves.\" (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nHe believed it was okay to send people to their deaths if history recorded them as deceased, (PROSE: The Crawling Terror [+]Mike Tucker, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) and told Mason Bennett that he \"[couldn't] just go back and cut off tragedy at the root because [then] [he'd] find [him]self talking to someone [he'd] just saw dead on a slab, [and] then [he] really [would] see ghosts\". (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) However, he knew \"to hold [himself] to the mark\" on how to save a single soul despite the Web of Time due to Donna Noble's words to his tenth incarnation at Pompeii, (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and was willing to change certain points he encountered if \"even a ghastly future [proved] better than no future at all\". (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Emotionally broken after the death of Clara, the Doctor used an extraction chamber on Gallifrey to save her from the Quantum Shade, and also attempted to prevent her from returning to her death, despite it being a fixed point in time, (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and engineered events to prevent Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart and a German soldier from killing each other, claiming that \"a couple fewer dead people on the battlefield\" would not \"hurt\". (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nDiagnosed with \"Attention Deficit [Disorder]\" by Clara, (TV: The Doctor's Meditation [+]Steven Moffat, Prequels (BBC America, 2015).) the Doctor would include mundane outcomes in his summarisation when explaining the consequences of actions taken, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Pyramid at the End of the World [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) had trouble recognising people's age group, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014)., The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).) forgot people he had only recently met, (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) and was also shown to have a poor concept on the passage of time. (TV: The Doctor's Meditation [+]Steven Moffat, Prequels (BBC America, 2015)., The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nHe claimed that taking charge was his \"superpower\", (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and listed \"investigating\", \"playing with time\" and \"resistance\" among his specialities, (COMIC: Terrorformer [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014)., The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015)., The Fractures [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) with Clara also adding \"interfering and infuriating\" to the list. (COMIC: Terrorformer [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).)\n\nInitially thinking he was \"overbearing, manipulative and consciously aware of his own intelligence\", (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Twelfth Doctor came to see himself a \"scary, handsome genius from space\" (TV: Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) who was \"adorable, hugely intelligent, but still approachable\". (TV: The Pyramid at the End of the World [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nAccording to Affinity, the Twelfth Doctor kept his predecessors \"lodged in his head\", and held a low opinion of them and himself, (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) even comparing a Multi-Doctor Event to The Krankies. (WC: Doctors Assemble! [+]James Goss, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).) While he reflected that the First Doctor was \"not much fun\", (POEM: Full Stop [+]James Goss, Now We Are Six Hundred (Harper Design, 2017).) the Twelfth Doctor was delighted by some of his habits when he encountered him at the South Pole, such as still calling the TARDIS \"the ship\". However, he was embarrassed by the First Doctor's habit of making comments that were inappropriate in the Twelfth Doctor's eyes, especially when he threatened to give Bill a \"jolly good smacked bottom\" if she kept on swearing. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) Additionally, he was, at times, critical of his previous incarnations' clothing, thinking that his fourth incarnation's scarf \"looked stupid\", (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and regarded the Eleventh Doctor's fondness for bow ties as \"a bit embarrassing\", (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) though complimented the Zygon Osgood's bow tie as \"nice\". (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor had a frosty accord with the Tenth Doctor, who refused to consider the twelfth incarnation as a future possibility until the Blinovitch Limitation Effect confirmed he was indeed the Doctor. Conversely, the Eleventh Doctor was willing to accept him as his next incarnation and was happy to know he had more life in the future. While he degraded them as \"manic pixie dream Doctors\", the Twelfth Doctor expressed concern that the two would come to know him as the \"scary Doctor\". He held the Ninth Doctor in higher regards, saying the Continuity bomb could not find a timeline where he wasn't \"fantastic\". (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) In a later encounter with his tenth incarnation, the Twelfth Doctor referred to him as \"Bambi\", being dismissive of how overtly emotional he had been and having some embarrassment for his obsession with Rose Tyler, but seemed to retain a fondness for the Tenth Doctor's life. (COMIC: Vortex Butterflies [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).) Even after gaining a more positive outlook at St Luke's University, the Twelfth Doctor still disliked the Tenth Doctor for his \"excited puppy routine\". (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nThough he preferred him to other incarnations, (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) the Twelfth Doctor disliked the Eleventh Doctor for his enjoyment of bow ties and fezzes, and overuse of the word \"cool\". (COMIC: Terrorformer [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).) However, upon seeing Adrian Davies, a teacher at Coal Hill School with a resemblance to his eleventh incarnation, the Doctor, mistaking Adrian as Clara's boyfriend, arrogantly assumed that Clara was dating Adrian because of his uncanny resemblance to \"a certain dashing young time traveller\", reflecting more favourably on his predecessor. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nFeeling it was his house, (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and method of escaping his troubles, (COMIC: Theatre of the Mind [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor redecorated his console room to have bookshelves, chairs and workbenches. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) He told Bill Potts that the TARDIS was a \"technological marvel\", \"science beyond magic\", and \"the gateway to everything that ever was, or ever can be.\" (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He did, however, occasionally enact violence against his TARDIS out of frustration, striking its column with his fists hard enough to damage it after discovering Missy's coordinates to Gallifrey had been a lie, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and later struck the console with enough force to believe he had broken a finger. (PROSE: Deep Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAs with his previous incarnations, the Twelfth Doctor relied on his companions to keep him from succumbing to his darker nature, and actively praised them for it, even claiming that Clara Oswald needed a \"raise\" for dealing with him, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and telling Bill Potts that people like her encouraged him to put up with the rest of humanity. (TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He also enjoyed it when his companions asked him obvious questions, claiming that it helped him think, (PROSE: The Blood Cell [+]James Goss, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) but disliked it when they pointed out mistakes he made, (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).) and identified them as his \"social interface with the human race\", (COMIC: The Fractures [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) and the main reason he didn't need an army. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) However, he was willing to place his companions in danger if it meant appeasing his curiosity, often leaving them out of the details in his plans, or using them to distract attention away from himself. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) But, if he believed the situation was too dangerous for them, the Doctor would send his companions to the safety of the TARDIS while staring down the threat alone. (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nHe held deep affection for Clara Oswald, considering her to be his best friend, (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and cared for her to the point that her betraying him couldn't make a difference to how he felt about her. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) His connection with her was so deep that, after her death by Quantum Shade, he respected her wishes to not target Ashildr for her role in Clara's death. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) However, after spending four billion years in a temporal loop mourning her, (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) he became unhinged, deciding no one would stop him bringing Clara back, threatening all who tried to prevent him restoring her to life, even forcing the Eleventh General to regenerate, until events forced him to lose his memories of Clara. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) When his memories of her were restored, he was delighted, thankful he could finally remember her face. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nAlthough he tended to be dismissive of Nardole, (TV: Knock Knock [+]Mike Bartlett, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) the Doctor still took his advice in stock (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016)., Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and chose to sacrifice his own life so Nardole could escape certain death. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Doctor also grew close with Bill Potts, making her his personal student while at St Luke's University, even going back in time to obtain pictures of her mother as a Christmas gift in gratitude for her gifting him a carpet, (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) even though he did not like the carpet. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) He confided in Bill about his concerns over Missy and made it his personal mission to save Bill from death at the hands of the Cybermen. (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He also didn't like Bill seeing him physically vulnerable, going as far as not telling her about his blindness, (TV: The Pyramid at the End of the World [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) or his impending regeneration. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nSeeing them as \"stupid, brilliant, [and] brave semi-sentient monkeys\", (COMIC: The Eye of Torment [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Twelfth Doctor claimed to the Half-Face Man that the people of Earth \"[were] never small to [him],\" and, unlike his tenth incarnation, he didn't think he deserved a reward or a \"promised land\" because he had \"already [gone] a very long way\" to protect the people (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) becoming a lost soul beyond redemption. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Though he liked them for their optimism, (TV: Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) the Doctor would insult humans when he saw them being slow-minded, greedy and violent, dubbing Earth the \"planet of the pudding-brains.\" (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Nonetheless, he tolerated the company of those who could engage with him intellectually, (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014)., Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Pyramid at the End of the World [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) unless they got on his bad side first, (COMIC: The Fractures [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) and claimed to respect humanity enough to allow it to determine its own future without any interference from him, (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) giving insight and knowledge to those who would listen, while still leaving the decision up to them. (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) As with his previous incarnation, the Twelfth Doctor also liked people who got straight to the point. He though that someone who wasn't scared in a life-threatening situation was \"an idiot\", (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) though was aware that giving in to fear \"[did]n't help\". (TV: Knock Knock [+]Mike Bartlett, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He also cared for mortal lives, (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) however brief they seemed to him. (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nBecause of his more celibate nature, (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Doctor failed to notice when someone was asking him if they looked attractive, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) but did call a female Tyrannosaurus rex a \"big sexy woman\" while in a post-regenerative state. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) He also considered Rona Bellows to be \"sexy\", (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) and shared a mutual attraction with River Song. (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).) He didn't care about sexuality, instead being bothered by people hating each other, and didn't approve of revenge either. (COMIC: The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nDespite his grumpy nature, the Twelfth Doctor had a soft spot for children, (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) trying to help them to overcome their fears, (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) build them up when they thought little of themselves, (TV: In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and help their education. (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) He would stop to help them when he saw them in need, (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and would feel regretful if he felt he had let them down, (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) as well as great fury when finding babies unattended. (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor's hatred toward the Dalek species was rigid, with Clara describing it as \"prejudice\", (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) though he did stop to mourn Lumpy, a Dalek that had deceived him into friendship. (GAME: The Doctor and the Dalek [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He believed Daleks were incapable of change and was closed-minded as he dealt with their presence, and would refuse to help a Dalek unless his interests were peaked. After his act of fixing a malfunctioning \"good\" Dalek caused it to revert to \"bad\", the Doctor was almost pleased that his belief of there being \"no such thing as a good Dalek\" was vindicated. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Despite his hatred of them, the Doctor admitted to the Governor that the Dalek Emperor \"[was] nothing compared to your average mobile phone sales assistant\". (PROSE: The Blood Cell [+]James Goss, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).)\n\nHe also held a disregard for the Cybermen, unceremoniously flattening two with his TARDIS. (GAME: The Doctor and the Dalek [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He knew to be cautious around them, (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) though he would try to reason with the ones that were \"fresh out the factory\". (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nWhen Rusty the Dalek looked into the Twelfth Doctor's mind, he saw hatred and noted that the Doctor was \"a good Dalek\", while Clara believed the Doctor was trying to be a good man, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and claimed that he \"always care[d]\" by the time of her death. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) When questioned by Lisa Foster, Clara reluctantly admitted she thought the Doctor was \"kind of [cool], in a strange sort of way\", which Lisa interpreted as meaning \"an uncool sort of way\". (COMIC: The Fractures [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) Bill Potts once described the Twelfth Doctor as \"part-cool professor, [and] part-cat chasing [a] laser pointer\", (COMIC: The Promise [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) while Keira Sanstrom felt he was \"all showmanship\". (AUDIO: Never the End Is [+]Ben Tedds, You Only Die Twice (The Twelfth Doctor Chronicles, Big Finish Productions, 2024).)\n\nWhile Ashildr considered the Doctor to be a \"passionate and powerful Time Lord\", (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Perkins noted his inability to decide whether the Doctor was a genius \"or just incredibly arrogant\", (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) with Danny Pink, in complete bitterness for his need to feel the pain he inflicted, compared the Doctor to a \"blood-soaked old general\". (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe Oracle described the Twelfth Doctor as \"a man of taste and discrimination,\" (PROSE: The Blood Cell [+]James Goss, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) while Orestes Milton believed the Doctor \"affect[ed] an air of ignorance and indifference, but beneath it [were] undercurrents of knowledge and curiosity\". (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Daughter of Mine considered him \"the worst\". (WC: Shadow of a Doubt [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nMuch as his tenth incarnation expressed, the Twelfth Doctor associated regeneration with death, recalling Snowcap as \"the place where [he] died\". He viewed the process as \"huge, [and] terrible\", with his self-preservation keeping his memories of the experience from consuming him. (COMIC: Blood and Ice [+]Jacqueline Rayner, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2015).) He also believed that regeneration was to be used only when completely necessary, and to use it to fix a broken toe was \"a waste of a life\". (PROSE: The Blood Cell [+]James Goss, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) Despite his beliefs, when pushed to extremes, the Doctor was willing to force a fellow Time Lord to regenerate if it benefited him. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhen faced with the prospect of dying without regenerating while combating the Fisher King, the Doctor, though initially appearing distraught, quickly dismissed any concern, saying that he \"had a good innings\", and calling himself a mere \"clerical error\" of a regeneration. (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) When cornered by the Veil, the Doctor admitted that he was afraid of dying, (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) but was unafraid to sacrifice himself for the greater good. (TV: The Pyramid at the End of the World [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nAfter the regeneration progress was triggered by an attack from a CyberMondan, the Doctor, angry at the idea of constantly \"being other people\", refused to change into his next body. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) When confronting the glass avatars of Bill Potts and Nardole, the Doctor confessed he was \"tired of losing people\" and, feeling \"there [had] to be an end\", seeing his long life as \"[an] [empty] battlefield, because everyone else [had] fallen\". After a final cuddle with the glass avatars, the Doctor decided it was \"time to leave the battlefield\", and entered the TARDIS alone. Upon looking at the \"silly old universe\" on the TARDIS scanner, the Doctor, realising that the \"more [he] save[d] it, the more it need[ed] saving\", decided that \"one more lifetime wouldn't kill anyone\". Giving instructions to his successor to \"never be cruel, [and] never be cowardly\", that \"hate [was] always foolish, and [that] love [was] always wise\", to \"never fail to be kind\", and to never reveal their name, the Doctor \"let [himself] go\" and regenerated into a female body. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nMuch like his seventh incarnation, the Twelfth Doctor spoke with a Scottish accent, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) which was noted to be Glaswegian by Bernice Summerfield. (PROSE: Big Bang Generation [+]Gary Russell, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2015).) Fully embracing his Scottish accent as an entitlement to complain about things, the Doctor would put down the English, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and was known to \"go all Scottish\" when annoyed. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWith his accent, he was prone to boasting about himself, (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016)., Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Pyramid at the End of the World [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) making intimidating threats, (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) or just stating the apparent ineffectiveness of others' actions in a subtle tone. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) However, when truly angered, the Doctor would quietly hiss with a rage hidden behind unnerving tranquillity. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhen proposing a theory or plan, the Doctor would use words such as \"question\", \"proposition\" or \"proposal\", and would begin his conclusion with \"answer\", \"conjecture\", \"conclusion\" or \"plan\". (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) After working out the important questions and the answers in his head, he waited for others to come to the same conclusion, only to give out the answer after they proposed the wrong reactions. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014)., Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Sleep No More [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Smile [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nDuring his early life, the Twelfth Doctor would often accuse things, even other people, of developing faults, errors and malfunctions when he didn't think they were working the way he though they were meant to, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and would call people \"pudding-brains\", or \"pudding headed\", when he found them slow-minded or stupid. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nWhen in a moment of realisation or thinking intensely, the Doctor would often tell people to \"shut up/it\", regardless of if they were speaking or not. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He would also issue the instruction to those who had earned his ire, regardless of their status, occupation or how petty the ire was, (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014)., The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).) and when he wished to avoid a subject of conversation.

(TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Never one to miss the chance for a quotation, the Doctor often reciting quotes and scriptures that matched his current predicament, be they from media, music or literature.

(TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)

(TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) He typically stood with one leg stretched forward and his hands rested together in front of him.

Commonly, he would stick out his index and pinky fingers with his thumb and lower his middle and ring fingers, with the gesture being so associated with him that it was depicted as his stance on a wanted poster drawing (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and an advertisement poster designed by Zip Betterblast. (COMIC: Time and PR in Space [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn a deviation from his stagnant posture, he would wring his hands together in a fidgety manner, (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014)., The Doctor's Meditation [+]Steven Moffat, Prequels (BBC America, 2015)., The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016)., The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) but also kept his fingers interlocked together when explaining or contemplating something.

He was also capable of repeatedly striking a wall of Azbantium with his fists after breaking every bone in his hand, and was still able to use his hands to pull a lever afterwards. (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) However, his durability was not absolute, with the Doctor being easily knocked to the ground when taken by surprise from behind, (TV: The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and unable to escape the grip of a CyberMondan without assistance.

(PROSE: The Blood Cell [+]James Goss, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) He was also able to perform accurate post-mortems, (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., The Crawling Terror [+]Mike Tucker, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) and attach a Lothan prosthetic leg to Ram Singh.

(TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Sleep No More [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)

He also claimed that he knew semaphore, which had left British Sign Language \"erased\" from his mind, though he could still sign, just without the knowledge of what he had signed. (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) He eventually learnt how to sign properly again. (TV: Merry Christmas from See Hear [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nA credited escapologist, (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) the Doctor boasted at teaching Harry Houdini \"everything he [knew]\", (COMIC: The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).) and was repeatedly able to escape from his cell at the Prison. (PROSE: The Blood Cell [+]James Goss, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) He was also a talented gambler, being able to win $800,000 in less than an hour using \"simple mathematics\", (COMIC: Gangland [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and dancer, with Clara noting that he could apply for Strictly Come Dancing. (COMIC: Trust [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) His performing abilities extended into acting, notably in how he fooled the Monks into believing that he wanted to assist them as a figurehead for their propaganda, even fooling Bill. (TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nDespite believing himself not to be suited for the task, (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor had a talent for holding a crowds' attention, (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Oxygen [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) having a strong sense of showmanship, (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).) and quick comedic timing. (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nSimilar to his ninth incarnation, the Twelfth Doctor could slow down his perception of time by locking himself in a secure location in his mind, embodied as his TARDIS control room with his companion present, where he could take the time to re-evaluate the predicament he was in to his companion and find a way out of it. (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nSimilar to his tenth incarnation, the Twelfth Doctor had a measure of control over his regeneration energy, being able to summon a small amount for Davros, (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and fake a regeneration to fool Bill. (TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) After being electrocuted by a CyberMondan, the Doctor managed to resist regenerating for two weeks, though was unable to walk properly without assistance for periods of time. Even as his regenerative process instinctively triggered itself after he was further damaged by another Mondasian Cyberman's energy blaster and the destruction of Floor 0507, the Doctor forced it back further despite the strain it placed on him. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He managed to hold it back for several more hours until he decided to regenerate. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nBeing of a light build, (COMIC: Chime Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Twelfth Doctor was a tall, thin-faced man with a tousled mop of silver-grey hair, (PROSE: The Crawling Terror [+]Mike Tucker, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) and intense blue eyes framed by unruly, expressive eyebrows, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) which he called \"attack eyebrows\" that could \"take bottle tops off\" and were \"ready to secede and set up their own independent state of eyebrows\". (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) He also had a hooked nose, with big ears. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) Recognising that he had \"seen [his] face somewhere before\", (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Doctor eventually realised that he had the same face as Lobus Caecilius, a man whose family his tenth incarnation had saved from the destruction of Pompeii on Donna Noble's insistence, and concluded that he had subconsciously chose Caecilius' face to remind himself that he always \"save[d] people\". (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) At some point, the Doctor appeared to have had his left earlobe pierced, as he had visible scarring on his ear by the time he extracted Clara from her timeline. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nUpon first seeing his reflection, the Twelfth Doctor described his face as being \"absolutely furious\", though he later admitted that it was \"all right up until the eyebrows\". (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) He also described himself as a \"distinguished gentleman with [a] twinkle in his eye\", (COMIC: The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).) and considered his intimidating eyebrows as both a major contributor to his gravitas, (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and the reason many viewed him as a hostile. (COMIC: The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor was called a \"boney rascal\" and a \"desiccated man-crone\" by Robin Hood, who also described him as being \"pale as milk\", (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) with Shona McCullough calling him a \"skeleton man\". (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nWhile she once noted that the Doctor's face \"always looked serious\", (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Clara Oswald described him as looking like a \"grey-haired stick insect\", (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and even used such an image for him on her caller ID, (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) with Sontaran commander Kygon Brox also comparing the Doctor to a stick insect. (COMIC: The Instruments of War [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nThe Governor believed the Doctor had \"a face for fury\", and that it was \"made up of storms\" and \"[boiled] away like a dying star\". (PROSE: The Blood Cell [+]James Goss, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) Ross McNamara compared the Doctor's \"craggy\" face to \"the surface of the Moon.\" (PROSE: Haunted [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile one account showed a different face, (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) in the account of the Doctor's trial on Gallifrey where he was shown his future incarnations as potential direct successors for his forced regeneration, the Second Doctor rejected the Twelfth Doctor's appearance for being \"too old\". (TV: The War Games in Colour [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, adapted from The War Games (Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke), Doctor Who season 6 (BBC Four, 2024).)\n\nShortly after their regeneration, the Thirteenth Doctor described her predecessor as \"a white-haired Scotsman\". (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor's hair was a silvery shade of grey, kept short and combed down, (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013)., Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) though occasionally styled into a coif. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) However, he later let his hair grow out, and become curlier, (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014)., The Doctor's Meditation [+]Steven Moffat, Prequels (BBC America, 2015)., Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., For Tonight We Might Die [+]Patrick Ness, Class television stories series 1 (BBC Three, 2016).) but had it cut down by the time he met River on Mendorax Dellora. (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).) After he left Darillium, (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) his hair had grown back to its old length. (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016)., The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) When his body began to regenerate, his regeneration energy caused his hair length to grow out immensely. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nAiming for \"minimalism\", (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) the Twelfth Doctor initially donned a navy blue Crombie covert coat with crimson lining and matching cardigan with a white collared shirt, midnight blue trousers, and black brogue shoes. On his left hand ring finger, he had a pair of gold rings, a normal gold band and a second ring with a greenish amber setting that rested atop the first band, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) which the Doctor considered to be a wedding ring that symbolised his marriage to River Song. (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Occasionally, the Doctor would replace his cardigan with a single-breasted waistcoat, with colours ranging in dark blue and plain black, (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and change his dark blue trousers to black. (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) His socks were either decorated with cartoon animals (PROSE: The Blood Cell [+]James Goss, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) or were plain black, (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and his underpants reportedly had question marks. (TV: The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) While Clara noted his clothes made him look Victorian, (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor believed he looked like a magician. (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThough his Crombie coat remained a constant staple of his appearance, he would wear them in a variety of colours and materials, with additional colours coming in black, (COMIC: The Eye of Torment [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) lapis blue, (COMIC: The Hyperion Empire [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) maroon, (COMIC: The Highgate Horror [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) black velvet, (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).) and worn-out grey. (TV: Extremis [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) To go with his maroon Crombie coat, the Doctor also owned a scarlet waistcoat with matching trousers and shoes. (COMIC: The Highgate Horror [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor would also wear variations of his attire, switching from vested garments with a snowy shirt for a simple dress shirt on its own, coloured in burgundy, (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) dark navy blue, (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) or black with a white polka dot pattern. (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Other times, he would dispense with the shirts as well and don a black crew neck jumper (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) with small star-shaped sparkles on the front that helped him see in the dark, (PROSE: Royal Blood [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and later began wearing a zip up hoodie under his coat, with colours ranging in plain black, (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) ocean green, (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and marine blue. (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Under his jumper, he wore a white, (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) red, (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) or grey T-shirt. (COMIC: Time and PR in Space [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) On one occasion, he wore a burgundy ladder jumper. (TV: The Return of Doctor Mysterio [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2016 (BBC One, 2016).)\n\nAround the time he began to regularly play his electric guitar, (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) the Doctor, though he continued to wear his hoodie under his Crombie coat, replaced his jumper with an ivory T-shirt and a pair of baggy plaid trousers similar in style to those of his second incarnation, either in a gunmetal grey design, (TV: The Doctor's Meditation [+]Steven Moffat, Prequels (BBC America, 2015).) a Prussian blue design with an alabaster plaid pattern, (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015). a navy blue tartan pattern with crimson stripes, (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) or a bottle green colour. (COMIC: The Ministry of Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) His vest wear included a dusty pink Henley top underneath a Misty Mountain T-shirt, (TV: The Doctor's Meditation [+]Steven Moffat, Prequels (BBC America, 2015).) a Negative Flower T-shirt, (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) a plain white T-shirt, (COMIC: The Ministry of Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and a black T-shirt with a shark on it. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nDuring his time at St Luke's University, the Doctor began wearing a single-breasted raven black velvet frock coat with a cornflower blue lining, while the rest of the his outfit came with many variations. Accompanying the frock coat would be a puce, dark green or black hoodie, an ocean green ladder, black distressed or blue paint splatter jumper, a white shirt or longline burgundy, blue or black t-shirt, (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., The Eaters of Light [+]Rona Munro, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) and a blue or black waistcoat with notched lapels and brown buttons. (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) On one occasion, he dispensed with the waistcoat and wore a simple scarlet dress shirt. (TV: The Pyramid at the End of the World [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) He also began keeping the cuffs of his sleeves unrolled. (TV: The Lie of the Land [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nFollowing his regeneration, the Doctor was placed into a Victorian nightshirt and slippers by the Paternoster Gang to help him rest. While investigating reports of spontaneous human combustion, the Doctor exchanged his old watch for a coat from a vagabond, which he wore over his nightshirt. After infiltrating Mancini's Family Restaurant, the Doctor stole a Clockwork Droid's suit in order to masquerade as one to get close to the Half-Face Man. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) The Doctor would continue to don a black double-breasted suit jacket, black trousers and low-rising waistcoat, his black brogue boots, a white dress shirt and an ebony black cravat tie for formal wear. (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhen going into \"deep cover\" as Coal Hill School's temporary caretaker, the Doctor donned an ocher brown warehouse coat over his black crew neck jumper, (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and was photographed wearing the same coat while brandishing a mop at some point before 5 March 2005. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nAfter returning to Gallifrey, the Doctor discarded his waistcoat and velvet Crombie coat in favour of a black overcoat, which he found in his old barn. When he returned to his TARDIS, he resumed wearing a new Crombie coat that had been left for him by Clara as a parting gift. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhen he took Bill Potts to the frost fair of 1814, the Doctor wore his velvet frockcoat, but favoured more Regency era clothing in the form of navy trousers, an azure blue brocade waistcoat, a sapphire blue cravat, a white shirt, black gloves and a navy top hat that he later swapped for a black one. (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nWhile imprisoned in the Prison, the Doctor was fitted with a standard orange uniform. (PROSE: The Blood Cell [+]James Goss, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) While visiting 1963 Las Vegas, the Doctor donned a blue Fedora at Clara's urging. (COMIC: Gangland [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) When Zip Betterblast gave him a \"re-design\" for his TV appearance, the Doctor received blue jeans, a cap with a \"DW\" logo, and yellow sleeveless V-neck top with a palm tree island image on it.
