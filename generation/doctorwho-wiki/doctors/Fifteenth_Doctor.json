  "content": "Full of a lust for life that left him unafraid to show his emotions, the Fifteenth Doctor had an unrelenting need to fix the problems he found in his travels across time and space as he moved to help those he found in danger.\n\nBenefiting from the rehab his preceding incarnation had undertaken, the Fifteenth Doctor was freed from the emotional baggage and deteriorating mental state of his predecessors, and journeyed the universe with reinvigorated optimism following a fabled bi-generation that saw him help the Fourteenth Doctor defeat the Toymaker, though not without the threat of the Toymaker's legions \"coming\". Soon after the bi-generation, the Doctor became acquainted with Ruby Sunday, and together they defeated the Goblins that were abducting and eating children, before she joined him on his further adventures. After many adventures together, they encountered the Doctor's old nemesis Sutekh. Upon undoing the God of Death's annihilation of life throughout the universe, the Doctor separated from Ruby so she could spend time with her mother and father.\n\nFollowing Ruby's departure, the Doctor travelled on his own for a time before seeking out Belinda Chandra. Mysteriously unable to bring Belinda home, the two set out across time and space using a Vindicator to return to 24 May 2025, only to learn that the Earth had been destroyed on that date. Faced with his old enemies the Rani and Omega, the Doctor joined forces with UNIT and his former companions to save the Earth, before sacrificing his life and willingly triggering a regeneration to save the existence of one innocent girl.\n\nWhen the Thirteenth Doctor encountered the embodiment of Time, they restored the Doctor from being scattered across three bodies at once, declaring that she would be \"reunified\", but then questioned \"how long\" the Doctor would remain \"unified.\" (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nAfter they teamed up in a game against the Toymaker, the Fourteenth Doctor was told by his fifteenth incarnation that he would only find peace after settling down to heal from his traumas, quipping that they were \"doing rehab out of order\" by having the Fourteenth Doctor see how well adjusted his next incarnation was. The Fifteenth Doctor was also recognised by Donna Noble as being older than the fourteenth incarnation due to being from the future. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAtop the helipad attached to UNIT HQ in the City of London in late 2023, the Toymaker shot the Fourteenth Doctor with UNIT's Galvanic beam, due to his desire to play their next game with \"the next Doctor\", initiating a regeneration. However, as Donna Noble and Melanie Bush rushed to his side, the Doctor felt that he wasn't regenerating as he typically would and asked them to pull on his arms, causing the Fifteenth Doctor to split out of the Fourteenth Doctor in a bi-generation, a process previously believed to be a myth. Despite coming into being while the Fourteenth Doctor still existed, the Fifteenth Doctor was still older than his preceding incarnation, with Donna commenting it was \"because [he] came after him\", and the Fifteenth Doctor also had knowledge of events yet to come for the Fourteenth Doctor.\n\nAfter the Fifteenth Doctor cracked his new neck, and flirted with Mel, the Toymaker interrupted him, wanting to continue forcing the Doctors to bi-generate, but the two Doctors instead challenged him to a game of catch, and the Toymaker relented to accept the challenge. The game was then played, with the Fifteenth Doctor ultimately playing the winning throw after the Toymaker failed to catch the ball. As his prize, the Fourteenth Doctor chose to banish the Toymaker from existence, but he warned the Doctors that his legions were still \"coming\". The Fifteenth Doctor and Donna consoled the Fourteenth Doctor over the deaths caused by the Toymaker, with the Fifteenth Doctor giving his predecessor a reassuring hug, before walking back into the UNIT HQ. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAs he was given a tour of their TARDIS, the Fifteenth Doctor told the Fourteenth Doctor that he needed a break, with Donna agreeing that he was \"running on fumes.\" As he convinced his fourteenth incarnation to settle down by listing their traumas, the Fourteenth Doctor confided that he couldn't leave the TARDIS behind while living on Earth. However, the Fifteenth Doctor realised that for a brief moment, the lingering powers of the Toymaker's domain were still in their reality. He used it to bring back a future TARDIS with a mallet. The Fifteenth Doctor entered the future TARDIS, with the Fourteenth Doctor and Donna following him in to say goodbye after he tried sneaking off. Giving them a fond farewell, the Fifteenth Doctor then left to travel the universe. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nDeciding that the attire of his previous incarnation \"wo[uld]n't do\" anymore, the Doctor chose his new clothing in the TARDIS, selecting sturdy boots and a new hat. (POEM: Contents [+]James Goss, Now We Are Six Hundred (Harper Design, 2017). Page 16.) The Doctor then thought on how a new chapter in his life was beginning, as he had friends to make and adventures to go on, with new threats and enemies to face with \"no idea what [they'd] let themselves in for.\" (PROSE: \"Heroes of Time\" [+]Part of Whotopia: The Ultimate Guide to the Whoniverse, Simon Guerrier, Una McCormack and Jonathan Morris, BBC Books (2023).)\n\nThe Doctor arrived outside the Time Bubble containing Nora Wicker's home on 16 December 2033. The Eleventh Doctor had secured his help after deciding to free Nora following the forty-six years she spent inadvertently trapped inside, each day looping over and over, as the Eleventh Doctor miscalculated the size of the bubble when he erected it to contain the seed of the World Tree that had landed in her garden on 19 August 1987. After exiting his TARDIS, the Fifteenth Doctor waved to Nora and the Eleventh Doctor, then readied himself to use his sonic screwdriver at the same time as the Eleventh Doctor to produce a precise frequency to create a crack in the bubble. However, at the last possible moment, Nora confided to the Eleventh Doctor that she wanted to remain in the bubble to look after the tree, distracting the Eleventh Doctor and causing the sync to fail. The Fifteenth Doctor lowered his screwdriver and returned to the TARDIS, planning to return the next day, but ultimately did not to respect Nora's wishes. (AUDIO: The World Tree [+]Nick Slawicz, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2022).)\n\nThe Doctor landed his TARDIS next to Tower Bridge while it was painted pink, (PROSE: Come on TARDIS, let's go party [+]Doctor Who exhibits (BBC, 2023).) was photographed at some point prior to 5 March 2005, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018). Edition: 2023 Illustrated Edition.) co-hosted an episode of Match of The Day with Gary Lineker and Ian Wright, (WC: The Doctor takes Match of the Day on a trip through time?!! [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and announced the airing of Eastenders, Pointless and The One Show in an ident on BBC One. (TV: Untitled [+]BBC idents series 14 (BBC One, 2024).)\n\nAfter travelling alone for \"a while\", (PROSE: Space Babies [+]Alison Rumfitt, adapted from Space Babies (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2024).) the Doctor found himself watching a band perform a gig at a pub in London on 22 December 2023, but their performance was stopped when the keyboardist, Ruby Sunday, had her keyboard unplugged by a Goblin. The next day, the Doctor was enjoying himself at a nightclub when he bumped into Ruby again, and realised she was being victimised by the Goblins after saving her drink from being spilled, and later interfered in the Goblins' attempt to drop an inflatable snowman on her taxi ride, after which he told the responding policeman that his girlfriend was bound to accept his marriage proposal.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the Doctor caught up to Ruby while she was trying to save Lulubelle from being taken to the Goblin ship, and joined her in rescuing Lulubelle from being fed to the Goblin King whilst participating in the Goblins' song and escaped back to the Sundays' home using his intelligent gloves, where he met Ruby's adopted grandmother, Cherry, and then her adopted mother, Carla. While listening to Carla gush over Ruby to cheer her up after being told that Davina McCall was unable the find her biological family, the Doctor opened up to them about being a foundling himself, (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) having felt emboldened by the Sundays' openness to be open himself, (PROSE: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, adapted from The Church on Ruby Road (Russell T Davies), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2024). Chapter Fifteen; Page 110.) accidentally invoking a set of a coincidences and allowing the Goblins to crack the timeline by stealing Ruby as a baby. The Doctor then went back in time to the day she was abandoned at the church on Ruby Road in 2004 to stop the Goblins from stealing her by using his intelligent gloves to force the Goblin ship into the church spire, killing the Goblin King and causing the ship to disappear, (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) as though the Goblins had been erased from existence or pulled back into another world. (PROSE: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, adapted from The Church on Ruby Road (Russell T Davies), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2024). Chapter Eighteen; Page 137.)\n\nAfter he watched Ruby's mother walk away, the Doctor returned to his TARDIS to make sure Ruby had been restored in 2023 and, after a brief side-track to save Davina from a falling Christmas tree, waited for Ruby to joined him in the TARDIS. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He then updated his diary to include his new adventures. (PROSE: First Day of the Doctor [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (Penguin Group, 2023). Page 31.) calling the Goblin adventure bizarre. (PROSE: TARDIS Data File: Ruby Sunday [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nImmediately upon being joined by Ruby, the Doctor brought her to the Jurassic Period to demonstrate the time travel capabilities of the TARDIS. While there Ruby accidentally stepped on a butterfly, causing her timeline to change, becoming a reptilian humanoid named Rubathon Blue. The Doctor promptly revives the butterfly, restoring her timeline, and shortly after he remembers to turn on the \"butterfly compensation switch\" of the TARDIS.\n\nNext the Doctor offers to take her to the future, with Ruby suggesting a year from random numbers off the top of her head, resulting in 21506. The TARDIS materialises on a space station baby farm orbiting Pacifico Del Rio, finding it in disrepair, abandoned, and with one level infested by a Bogeyman. They discover intelligent babies and the station's former accountant, Jocelyn Sancerre, have taken over the station operations, though the latter disguises herself as an AI called Nan-E. Throughout this adventure the Doctor ponders the connection between Ruby and babies and discovers snowflakes physically manifest if her past is dwelt on.\n\nUltimately the Doctor is able to restore the station's functionality enough to take it to the fifth planet in the system Mondo Caroon. He's also able to save the Bogeyman from death, with him and Ruby revealing to Jocelyn that it was never a threat and simply a result of the computer system's literal interpretation of factors required for healthy baby rearing and showing her it was a new lifeform that deserved a chance as much as the Space Babies. As they departed, the Doctor told Ruby that, even if she asked him too, he couldn't take her to see her mother leave her at Ruby Road to preserve her timeline, but Ruby instead asked him to take her home to see Carla. (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) Once she was caught up to speed, Carla made the Doctor promise to keep Ruby safe while she travelled with him, (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) as he prepared to face things he had \"never encounter[ed] before.\" (PROSE: TARDIS Data File: The Doctor [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nArriving atop the Jason Orange Plaza in Mancopolis 2424, the Doctor and Ruby dodged being run over by a tram, only to be arrested by the Care Force for being \"tram raiders\". A weather orb, noticing they weren't smiling, began raining on them. After stopping the orb, the mayor of the city, Mary Mulberry, communicated to them via the windows of a tower which also functioned as screens, believing them to be auditors sent by the Galactic Central Exchange; she ordered Zhi, one of the Care Force, to bring them to her, and, on the journey to the Mancopolis City Hall, she explained to them how Mayor Mulberry saved the city and its population after the 2399 Event.\n\nEntering the Mayor's office, the Mayor vocalised her belief that they had been a deliberate distraction to enable the Exchange to sneak an assault ship into the city, which she promptly had destroyed. She offered a negotiation, but, after realising they weren't non-humans since they weren't going shift into another form, she threatened to dismember one of them. As they tried to escape through a lift, she had the duo teleported to a dark space filled with \"massive people-eating silkworms\". (COMIC: Mancopolis [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Magazines, 2024).)\n\nThe Doctor and Ruby landed on a wrecked luxury liner on the asterion field and came across Navitrix Ortega. They encountered a Kua'Mara but were able to freeze it and escape. (GAME: Fragmented Cosmos [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).)\n\nFollowing an alien distress call to Lake Peipus in 1242, the Doctor and Ruby met Ranavere Rentara who was attempting to escape her family of mercenaries. Whilst trying to make peace between her and her sisters who had arrived to force her to fight as ordered, they discovered the Genetrix, a parasitic enemy of the Rentara, was also on Earth and was spreading its parasites among Novgordian soldiers. After a failed mental contact, the Doctor finally located the Genetrix as it latched onto his TARDIS on the frozen lake and managed to separate it, forcing it back into hibernation beneath the ice. With peace now established between the sisters, he left them to guard the lake against any return of the Genetrix when the ice thawed, choosing not to tell them he actually intended to use the TARDIS to take it off-world as he wanted them to use the time to bond. (PROSE: Ruby Red [+]Georgia Cook, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2024).)\n\nRuby asked to see the Beatles record their first album at Abbey Road studios. Upon arriving in 1963, they discovered something was wrong with music as the Beatles, Cilla Black, and other musicians were producing bad music, making him immediately realise something was wrong. The Doctor realised this extended to a wider change in history, such as a Soviet Union offensive against Finland. Investigating, he had Ruby play one of her band's songs on a rooftop, attracting Maestro, the entity of music that was causing the drastic changes to history. He used a trick to stop all sound, helping them escape. He worried about Maestro's power, realising they were a child of the Toymaker. To prove this to Ruby, he took her to 2024, showing a devastated world after a nuclear war caused by the lack of music. He theorised they could banish Maestro using the lost chord. During a music battle, the Doctor found most of the notes but hit a wrong note at the end. Paul McCartney and John Lennon helped find the final note, rescuing the Doctor from being trapped in a Timpani drum. With music restored, the Doctor and Ruby sang and danced with those at the studio before leaving. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nThe Doctor and Ruby encountered a Shreek in 2024 that had escaped from its hive. It covered Ruby in its pheromones before being sent back to its hive by the Doctor, the Doctor then explained to Ruby that the pheromones mark you down as future prey before giving her the antidote and they returned to the TARDIS talking about the Beatles they meet half a hour ago. Unbeknownst to the two, they were observed by Conrad Clark who had also gotten covered in the creature's pheromones. (TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nLanding on Kastarion 3 to show Ruby a new planet's sky, the Doctor heard a scream and ran out of the TARDIS to investigate. In his haste, he stepped on a landmine but didn't fully set off the trigger, needing to confirm the Doctor was alive. He balanced his weight enough to stop the countdown temporarily. When Ruby arrived, he asked her to find something heavy to help balance and trick the mine's algorithm. She brought what she thought was an urn, but he realised it was a smelted body. They discovered it belonged to John Francis Vater when his AI hologram appeared. They learned Vater was killed by the Villengard Ambulance's algorithm as a mercy killing due to his temporary blindness reducing his operational efficiency. When Vater's daughter, Splice Alison Vater, arrived, the Doctor tried to prevent her from getting too close, spiking his adrenaline and accelerating the countdown. An ambulance sensed conflict but couldn't treat the Doctor due to his alien biology. Ruby tried to distract the machine but was shot by Canterbury James Olliphant. The Doctor, distraught, realized the conflict was perpetuated by Villengard's profit motive. He asked the Vater AI to infiltrate the ambulance computers, surrendering the systems, stopping the war, and deactivating the landmine. It worked, and he and Ruby safely left the planet as the conflict finally ended. (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nArriving on a new planet, the Doctor and Ruby encountered Chirracharr who was looking for aliens who'd abducted her once before. They discovered drones monitoring the planet and found an observatory set up by those aliens. After Ruby was taken to the Aliens' planet, the Doctor helped Chirracharr organise her people to defend against an onslaught of drones sent to clear the planet colonisation, until Ruby was able to stop the settlement plans. Reunited, the Doctor and Ruby left with the alien scientists openly meeting Chirracharr's people. (PROSE: Caged [+]Una McCormack, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2024).)\n\nThe Doctor and Ruby landed on Chemical Beach, Seaham 1958, meeting another familiar woman, who warned them to get off the beach. Drawn through a rift in a cave structure, they ended up on Ghost Beach, were they met Reginald Wormsley. They immediately started to gain other memories. Finding the Reginald's dead body in a forest, they realised that an immensely powerful alien creature known has the Kassif had been extracting the memories and forcing them into their minds and onto the planets. Once Kassif had been stopped, they had moments to escape before the closing of the rift. (AUDIO: On Ghost Beach [+]Niel Bushnell, Audio Originals (BBC Worldwide, 2024).)\n\nAfter the Doctor and Ruby arrived in South Wales on 9 November 2024, (PROSE: 73 Yards [+]Scott Handcock, adapted from 73 Yards (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2024).) he asked if she had been to Wales before, to which she replied she had been there three time. He started to tell Ruby that he loved the Welsh but started to warn her about Roger ap Gwilliam, before realising it was a spoiler as she had not lived through 2046 yet. Ruby stopped him from talking to point out an old woman in the distance, but the Doctor did not see her. He moved to walk on but Ruby called out to him to not go further. Looking down, the Doctor saw he had nearly walked into a fairy circle (TV: 73 Yards [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) made out of cotton. (PROSE: The Life Of Ruby Sunday [+]Paul Lang, adapted from 73 Yards (Russell T Davies), Doctor Who The Official Annual 2025 (BBC Children's Books, 2024).) Ruby went to read the attached notes, but the Doctor told her not to, out of respect. They pressed onwards, the Doctor asking Ruby when was the third time she had visited Wales, but Ruby struggled to remember. (TV: 73 Yards [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nDiscovering the existence of a Sasquatch species in Washington state, the Doctor and Ruby learnt of an attempting earth invasion by the Sleekers. During this period, Ruby recognised one of the victims as a \"greyish-blonde woman\", whom she found familiar. With the help of the Sasquatches and Dixie's antihistamine's, the Doctor managed to kill off the Sleekers nest, saving those they had taken over and further saving the world from potential Sleeker control. (AUDIO: Sting of the Sasquatch [+]Darren Jones, Audio Originals (BBC Worldwide, 2024).)\n\nThe Doctor and Ruby travelled to Finetime in the distant future. While there, the Doctor learned the residents were being eaten alive by mantraps designed by the system's AI to kill them all in alphabetical order. With Ruby's help, the Doctor was able to alert the residents within and help them escape, notably Lindy Pepper-Bean and Ricky September, (TV: Dot and Bubble [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) though he had arrived too late to save anyone whose surnames began with A and B. (PROSE: Welcome To Finetime [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2025 (BBC Children's Books, 2024).) However, upon Lindy and several others escaping, they refused the Doctor's offer to take them to a safer planet in his TARDIS because of his skin colour. Devastated, the Doctor shouted in frustration, breaking down as the group sailed off into the wilderness. (TV: Dot and Bubble [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nAdventuring to 1813, the Doctor and Ruby joined a ball at a manor in Bath, England and took part in the dance, (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) where they were photographed. (GAME: Spot The Difference [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2025 (Penguin Group, 2024).) However, the Doctor sensed an alien presence, soon learning that the time-travelling bounty hunter Rogue was trying to kill the Chuldur family impersonating the guests in the manor. Though Rogue at first believed the Doctor was a Chuldur, he was able to prove to Rogue he was not a Chuldur by having his ship scan him while he was struck in a triform, revealing himself to be a Time Lord, (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and telling the unwilling guests to run. (PROSE: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, adapted from Rogue (Kate Herron and Briony Redman), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2024).) However, when Ruby was accidentally caught in the trap due to the Doctor thinking the Chuldur had killed her, Rogue took her place, banishing himself and the Chuldur to a random dimension, devastating the Doctor. However, the Doctor still possessed Rogue's ring that he had gifted to him after the event, putting it on as he and Ruby departed in the TARDIS. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nArriving in 19th century Copenhagen, the Doctor and Ruby met Hans Christian Andersen and encountered the Snedronningen. After the entity kidnapped Ruby when she defended Hans, the Doctor followed them through a sub-dimensional fissure with Hans. They encountered soldiers led by Hans' captive father, who decided to turn on their master after she took Hans. With their aid the Doctor reached Ruby and together they realised they could defeat Snedronningen by having everyone assert that they did not believe in her. Her realm then disappeared, returning them all to Copenhagen. (COMIC: The Hans of Fear [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Magazines, 2024).)\n\nThe Doctor and Ruby arrived in COHurtCotm's focus groups facility for creating monsters for armies. (COMIC: The Monster Makers [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Magazines, 2024-2025).)\n\nHearing a sound as the TARDIS flew through the Time Vortex, the Doctor followed it to a variety of planets he'd had bad experiences on and finally leading to Yorkshire in 1739. There he found Dick Turpin had been gifted Cyber-technology and stopped him escaping his execution using it. Studying the weapon, the Doctor found it programmed with coordinates which Ruby suggested was meant a trap. (COMIC: Untitled [+]Dan Watters, Doctor Who: The Fifteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2024).) Nevertheless, thee two of them followed the coordinates to Sanctum Shopping & Dining, the last shopping mall on Earth in the 29th century. There they encountered a Battalion of Cybermen, Which turned out to be a construct of the Scream Sommelier, a being from outside of the universe who fed on screams. (COMIC: Everyone Must Go! [+]Dan Watters, Doctor Who: The Fifteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2024).)\n\nAfter encountering more versions of a woman distinctively identical across their adventures, the Doctor took Ruby to UNIT headquarters to see if they could help identify her. Kate and her team revealed they had been monitoring Susan Triad. Speculating she could be his granddaughter Susan Foreman hidden through regeneration, the Doctor delayed meeting her and instead ordered Kate to let him use their secret time window technology so Ruby could try to learn the identity of her mother by projecting the memory of Ruby's abandonment captured a VHS tape. However, during the attempt, Ruby's mother somehow managed to avoid the pair and an entity was revealed to be hidden in the TARDIS. Giving in, the Doctor let Melanie Bush take him to meet Susan at her studio. While there, the entity in the TARDIS revealed itself as Sutekh and that Susan was under its control. Panicked, the Doctor could only stand in shock as the entity reached out to him. (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nAs Sutekh's disciples unleashed the dust of death, the Doctor and Mel fled back to UNIT headquarters to reunite with Ruby. Using the time window, they summoned a remembered TARDIS. Sutekh appeared but the Doctor swore he would stop his actions, the trio fleeing in the TARDIS with the time window's monitor. They then watched in Earth's orbit as Sutekh's dust of death massacred the universe's population. Realising his travels through time and space had enabled Sutekh's victory, the Doctor broke down in despair.\n\nSometime later, the Doctor met a kind woman on a deserted planet, gaining a metal spoon from her before she turned to dust. Back at the memory TARDIS, the Doctor used the spoon to boost the power of the time window so Ruby's questions about her mother were answered. He realised Sutekh needed to know who Ruby's mother was too. Learning they could visit 2046 to find her DNA records, the group did so. However, just as they managed to access the records, Sutekh consumed Mel into one of his disciples, taking the Doctor and Ruby hostage. Teleported back to UNIT, Sutekh subdued the Doctor and ordered Ruby show him the DNA results, but she instead wrapped intelligent rope around him which she and the Doctor then used to restrain him and, using a whistle, regain control of the TARDIS. The Doctor then transported Sutekh across all of time and space to undo his dust of death and then banished him into the time vortex to die.\n\nAfter defeating Sutekh, the Doctor and Ruby went their separate ways so that Ruby could enjoy life with her family, including her newly found birth mother whom UNIT had located. However, the Doctor promised his friend that he would see her again someday. As the two parted, she told him that she loved him. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nThe Doctor once welcomed an individual into the TARDIS in London. (EXHIBIT: Travel Through Time and Space)\n\nThe Doctor returned to the Federation universe and stood among several of his other incarnation, as well has various captains. He held a communicator next to Jean-Luc Picard, who was holding the Doctor's sonic screwdriver. (GRAPHIC: Friendship is Universal)\n\nThe Doctor landed on Grey Grieving, pretended Ruby was still with him. He was chased by It and hunters trying to kill it as a game. When the Doctor's chase led to It's re-imprisonment, the hunters threatened to kill him, but he was saved by Grey Grievants attacking the hunters for attempting to kill It, a being they protected. (COMIC: Run [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Magazines, 2025).)\n\nArriving in New York in 1977, the Doctor encountered the Hypnotising Cat who led him to Beatie, an alien from the Beatine Dimension of Dance seeking to rule Earth. Beatie challenged him to a dance off for the fate of the planet, however the doctor began to lose and turn to stone until the cat tripped Beatie over. With Beatie banished back to his dimension by the cat, the Doctor was left wondering which one of them had really saved the day. (COMIC: Dance Till You Drop [+]Jason Quinn, John Freeman and Mike Collins, DWM Comics (Panini Magazines, 2025).)\n\nAfter finding out UNIT was recruiting new employees. (PROSE: We're Recruiting... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor helped The Vlinx with a test for new recruits at UNIT by temporally giving them his TARDIS and a few fake ones for the new recruit to guess which was the right one. (GAME: Assessment [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2025 (Penguin Group, 2024).)\n\nThe Doctor got the audience at BBC Proms 2024 to clap loudly to defeat Maestro. (TV: Bad Music [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC Two, 2024).)\n\nThe Doctor wrote about prehistoric incursions on earth that he dealt with. (PROSE: \"Prehistoric Incursions Battling in the past so you don't have to\" [+]Part of The Gold Archive: Invasions of Earth: A Secret History, Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor also wrote about alien incursions on Earth before UNIT was formed.

Global Threat Evaluation\" [+]Part of The Gold Archive: Invasions of Earth: A Secret History, Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor Landed in Nigeria 1965 where he met Oma Esosa a fire started as soon as he arrived and a injured 13-Year old girl known as Blue on the floor from a gun shot wound by soldier's, while trying to stop the bleeding he got Oma to continue so he could take Blue to the TARDISES healing pod and simultaneously putting out the mass fire with a hose, The Doctor then put Blue after she finished healing to bed, he then asked Oma when he could get more information to which Oma replied by saying his Dad's barber shop in Lagos. (PROSE: What I Did On My Holidays By Omo Esosa [+]Inua Ellams, Doctor Who online short stories (Doctor Who website, 2025).)\n\nFollowing a signal to find milk, the Doctor found himself in the Time Hotel in 4202, tracking a Silurian holding an unusual briefcase. There, he enlisted the assistance of one of the hotel's staff, Trev Simpkins, learning that the hotel contained time portals throughout human history. He gained a Customer ID \"7214\". (GAME: Welcome to the Time Hotel [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)  He learned furthermore that the hotel was, at the moment, doing a special, \"Christmas everywhere all at once,\" meaning that at the moment the portals each connected to Christmas within their respective eras.\n\nGoing undercover, the Doctor placed a room service order for a ham and cheese toastie and pumpkin latté, which in accordance with the hotel's practises were delivered to him almost immediately, having been sent from 30 minutes in the future. He then travelled through a number of the hotel's portals under the guise of serving this as a room service delivery before finally discovering the Silurian in the room of Joy Almondo in the Sandringham Hotel in 2024.\n\nThe Doctor confronted the Silurian, trying to get him to explain the contents of the briefcase, but the Silurian would only state \"The star seed will bloom and the flesh will rise.\" He attempted to get the Doctor to take the briefcase to find out for himself, but the Doctor refused. Meanwhile, Joy, annoyed by the refusal of both of them to explain anything, declared that she would take the case and did so, at which point a chain appeared, latching the briefcase to her. She then repeated the Silurian's statement that the star seed would bloom and the flesh would rise and when he asked what he should do, told him that he would shortly be dead.\n\nThe Doctor, stunned, told the Silurian that he could not die, that the Silurians were the proudest race he knew and that he would not have that. Nevertheless, the Silurian disintegrated in a burst of yellow light. The Doctor then warned Joy that what had happened to the Silurian would happen to her, but she only repeated the line about the star seed. The Doctor told her that she was being mansplained by the briefcase, but she argued that he was the one who had been doing the mansplaining.\n\nDetermined to get to the bottom of the matter, the Doctor opened the briefcase, revealing the glowing star seed inside. This, however, triggered a warning that if the briefcase was not closed within 20 seconds, the current holder would be disintegrated. The Doctor closed the briefcase just before this could happen. This, however, resulted in the appearance of a control panel and a new warning that the holder of the briefcase would be disintegrated in 15 seconds if the correct four-digit code was not input. Shortly before the timer was set to expire, another version of the Fifteenth Doctor appeared in the room, revealing the code, thus allowing his counterpart to enter it and save Joy.\n\nDue to time travel not being possible within the Time Hotel, the Doctor was forced to live for one year in Joy's room in the Sandringham Hotel in order to complete the bootstrap paradox and provide himself with the code. He therefore spoke with the hotel's proprietor, Anita Benn, securing work at the hotel as a waiter and caretaker among other tasks in order to pay for his room and board. During this time, the two of them grew close to each other. They began a regular tradition known as \"Chair Night\" in which they would spend time together, doing things such as playing games like Twister or Cluedo. Eventually, however, one year later, the Doctor would leave Anita in order to complete the paradox. She admitted that she had always known he would eventually leave, but told him to look after himself and to not be alone, that she would be waiting.\n\nThe paradox complete, the Doctor explained to Joy that he had figured out the nature of the star seed. A corporation desired to have a custom-built star and needed the Time Hotel in order to send it back into the past to provide enough time for it to bloom. He explained this to Joy, who remained largely uninterested, due to the briefcase's control over her. He thus was forced to make her angry in order to break the conditioning, revealing in the process that her mother had died on Christmas Day during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Doctor discovered that it was his old enemy, Villengard, who had created the star seed. He was still confused, however, as to how they could accomplish their plan using a hotel linked to human history, as it did not go back very far. He and Joy, however, then discovered that the hotel, in fact, had a portal leading over 65 million years back, to the time of the dinosaurs. He realised that the eruption of the star seed would destroy the entire planet, something Villengard would have prevented by sending a telepathic signal to the holder of the briefcase. This signal, however, had been disrupted when he severed Joy's connection to the briefcase.\n\nWith the help of Trev Simpkins, whose consciousness had been absorbed by the star seed, the Doctor devised a plan to hurtle the star seed into space using his TARDIS, connecting various time periods using rope. Joy, however, realised that the plan would not succeed. She therefore took the star seed, now outside Villengard's control, into her own body, filling the prophecy that the star seed would bloom and the flesh would rise. The Doctor pleaded with her not to do it, that she would die, but she told him that she would not, that she was simply changing and becoming something wonderful. Before rising into the sky of Bethlehem, she told the Doctor that he needed to find a friend. Seeing her as the Christmas star in the sky, the Doctor realised she had become the Star of Bethlehem. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nThe Doctor once stood in his TARDIS as it was pulled forward through the sky by two Reindeer. (GRAPHIC: Joy to the World, Honey!)\n\nThe Doctor was depicted alongside Joy Almondo in an advertisement for Doctor Who, stating that it could be watched at Christmas. Around this time, The Doctor's TARDIS was flown nearby. (WC: The TARDIS is landing just in time for Christmas! [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter Joy Almondo told the Doctor to find a friend he did just that. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nThe Doctor faced the Apocalypse Device on Goth. (COMIC: No Signs of Life)\n\nAfter learning that Conrad Clark had used Ruby to get to UNIT, the Doctor visited him in prison, pulling Conrad into the TARDIS to confront him. The Doctor berated Conrad for his selfish actions, but Conrad was unphased, stating that the Doctor had had a lot of friends and asking if he had met Belinda Chandra yet. Confused by the question but furious, the Doctor told Conrad that he would die in a prison cell of heart failure at age 49, boiling in anger and poison, \"alone and unloved. Forgotten.\" The world was going to carry on and get better while Conrad wouldn't even be a footnote in history. Conrad rejected the Doctor's words and ordered him to put him back in prison and get off of Earth. With a snap of his fingers, the Doctor sent Conrad back, but he was freed by Mrs Flood moments later. (TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nIntrigued by the mention of Belinda, the Doctor attempted to save her from robots from Missbelindachandra One, but got pulled into a Time Fracture, landing on the planet six months before Belinda. The Doctor helped the locals form a rebellion against the AI Generator, only to learn that it was actually Alan Budd, Belinda's ex-boyfriend, who had also been taken by the robots but landed years earlier due to the time fracture. By combining her star certificate from two different time periods, Belinda created a temporal paradox that killed Alan, but the Doctor was able to save her life. However, Belinda was uninterested in becoming his companion and requested that the Doctor return her to 24 May, 2025. When the Doctor tried, the TARDIS bounced off of that date, meaning that they would have to find another way back. Unbeknownst to the Doctor and Belinda, the Earth had apparently been destroyed on 24 May, 2025. (TV: The Robot Revolution [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Doctor told Belinda Chandra that they would have to go the long way around. They landed in multiple locations including an office, The Queen Victoria, The Gladiators and The Traitors. (TV: The Doctor's TARDIS lands in iconic BBC shows)\n\nUsing a Vindicator to take the long way around back to Belinda's time, the two landed in 1952 Miami where they faced off against Lux Imperator, another member of the Pantheon of Discord. The Doctor and Belinda were able to free Lux's victims and the god grew so large that he dispersed into the form of light throughout the universe. (TV: Lux [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nNext, the Vindicator took the Doctor and Belinda 500,000 years into the future where they joined a group of troopers investigating mysterious activity at Colony Base 15 on Planet 6-7-6-7. After learning that the planet was once called Midnight, the Doctor realized that the entity that he had faced in his tenth incarnation was responsible. The entity revealed that it knew the Doctor's real name and killed most of the troopers before seemingly being trapped on the planet once again thanks to the sacrifice of Shaya Costallion. The Doctor ordered that Midnight be nuked from orbit and for no one to ever return to the planet in an attempt to trap or destroy the creature for good. However, in the process, the Doctor and Belinda learned that no one had ever heard of Earth or the human race in the future which the Doctor was unable to explain. (TV: The Well [+]Russell T Davies and Sharma Angel-Walfall, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Vindicator took the Doctor and Belinda to New Year's Day, 2007, where they briefly met a young Conrad Clark. In the process, Conrad learned Belinda's name, creating a temporal paradox as he would later tell a younger version of the Doctor about Belinda, leading to their first meeting. (TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Vindicator took the Doctor and Belinda to 1656 where they decided to explore before getting lost and the Vindicator being stolen. (COMIC: His Mad Pranks)\n\nThe Doctor took Belinda to Lagos, Nigeria in 2019 where he used the Vindicator and then visited Omo Esosa's barber shop. The Doctor fell into the trap of the Barber who sought to destroy the Story Gods in revenge for what they did to him, discovering that the Barber's companion Abby was actually Abena, the daughter of Anansi who the Fugitive Doctor had won in a bet and left behind. The Doctor made amends with Abena and destroyed the Story Engine, convincing the Barber to put aside his revenge and settle into a new life on Earth. (TV: The Story & the Engine [+]Inua Ellams, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Doctor took Belinda to the 803rd Interstellar Song Contest where a revenge plot by Kid resulted in the Doctor and 100,000 other people being blown into space. The Doctor was awakened by a vision of Susan Foreman in the TARDIS who urged her grandfather to go back and find her. With three trillion lives in danger, the Doctor gave into his darker instincts, torturing Kid as he stopped the planned genocide despite Susan reappearing to plead with her grandfather to stop. After Belinda stopped him from torturing Kid further, the Doctor was able to save everyone who had been blown into space and attended the concert.\n\nAfterwards, the Doctor admitted to Belinda that he had scared himself, but Kid's plan had reminded the Doctor of the Spy Master's genocide of the Time Lords. Despite having had several visions of Susan, the Doctor seemingly laughed off the idea of her having survived. A hologram of Graham Norton revealed to the Doctor and Belinda that Earth and humanity were destroyed on 24 May, 2025. The Doctor and Belinda were finally able to use the TARDIS and the Vindicator to return to that date, only to have the Cloister Bell and other alarms go off before the TARDIS doors exploded inwards. (TV: The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThroughout these adventures, the Doctor was stalked by Mrs Flood, (TV: Lux [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025)., The Well [+]Russell T Davies and Sharma Angel-Walfall, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025)., Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025)., The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) the mysterious neighbour of both Ruby (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and Belinda. (TV: The Robot Revolution [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) An incarnation of the Rani who had survived the Master's genocide of the Time Lords, Mrs Flood underwent a bi-generation after the events at Harmony Arena and plotted with her next incarnation to use the readings collected by Mrs Flood from the Doctor's Vindicator to bring \"absolute terror\" to her old enemy. (TV: The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Doctor and Belinda were captured by the Rani and trapped in Conrad's World, an altered version of 23 May 2025 created by the Rani and Conrad Clark. In this world, the Doctor and Belinda were the married couple John and Belinda Smith with Poppy as their daughter. However, the amnesiac Doctor experienced doubts as well as a message from Rogue warning him about the nature of the world. Taken to the Bone Palace, the Doctor got his memories back and learned that the Rani was trying to release Omega before being sent plummeting towards the ground as the world disappeared at midnight on 24 May. (TV: Wish World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Doctor was saved by Anita Benn who pulled him into the Time Hotel and showed the Doctor that time had been looped back to 7:00am on 23 May and had done so hundreds of times. The Doctor explained that the Rani was repeating the same day over and over again so that it would get thinner and thinner until reality snapped and she could find Omega. With Anita's help, the Doctor was able to restore the memories of Belinda and his friends at UNIT, including Melanie Bush and Rose Noble who had been erased from existence in Conrad's World. The Rani teleported to the Tower to try to entice the Doctor to join her in freeing Omega to use his body as a gene bank, revealing that the genetic explosion caused by the Spy Master had rendered them sterile, ensuring the extinction of the Time Lord race. Poppy was merely a construct of the wish rather than actually being the Doctor's daughter. However, the Doctor refused and had Susan Twist build a Zero Room to protect Belinda and Poppy while he stopped the Rani and Omega.\n\nThe Doctor was able to steal the Rani's hoverscooter and fly it to the Bone Palace, breaking the Threshold so that Ruby could transmat in and get Desidirium. The Doctor joined the Ranis as Omega was released from the Underverse, only to have him emerge as a demonic beast who consumed the bi-generated Rani while Mrs Flood teleported away. Finding his Vindicator hidden in plain sight, the Doctor used its power -- equal to a billion supernovas -- to blast Omega and force him back into the Underverse. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nWith Ruby having used Desidirium's powers to restore the correct reality, the Doctor located his TARDIS which had been disguised as Conrad's room and reunited with Belinda and Poppy, throwing Belinda's star certificate into space to ensure that the robots from Missbelindachandra One would find it now that the Earth wasn't going to be destroyed. However, Poppy disappeared soon afterwards, leaving only Ruby with memories of her. As Anita returned to the Time Hotel, she passed on a message that the Boss said hello and UNIT discovered that reality had been restored with some \"glitches.\" Ruby revealed the existence and disappearance of Poppy to the Doctor and Belinda and everyone present reminded the Doctor of how he had saved them all countless times.\n\nWith only one thing powerful enough to shift reality one degree and bring Poppy back, the Doctor took off into the Time Vortex where the Thirteenth Doctor appeared in the TARDIS in a failed attempt to dissuade the Doctor from going through with his plan. Triggering his next regeneration by sheer force of will, the Doctor punched the Time Vortex with a ton of regeneration energy, jolting it enough to shift reality slightly.\n\nThe Doctor awakened outside of Belinda's house where he discovered that Poppy was now the daughter of Belinda and Ritchie Akingbola and his companion had been trying to return to 24 May for her daughter. Privately, the Doctor sadly admitted to Poppy that he couldn't have children, but if he could, he would wish for them to be exactly like her. Belinda was unwilling to travel anymore and risk Poppy and the Doctor said goodbye, hoping to return someday when Poppy was older. The Doctor promised Belinda that his love for her and Poppy would never change before departing. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nNot wanting to regenerate alone, the Doctor piloted the TARDIS into space close to the Star of Bethlehem where the TARDIS turned off the interior lights for him. Standing in the TARDIS doors, the Doctor spoke to Joy Almondo, telling her that his life had been an absolute joy. The Doctor released a massive amount of regeneration energy that shot out into space in all directions and regenerated into a form who resembled Rose Tyler, the former companion of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nIn the Daft Dimension, the \"new Doctor\", as mentioned by one fan, was among the exciting new developments of Doctor Who. (COMIC: The Daft Dimension 579 [+]Lew Stringer, The Daft Dimension (Panini Comics, 2022).) This Doctor and his companion were on the front cover of an issue of Doctor Who Magazine. (COMIC: The Daft Dimension 600 [+]Lew Stringer, The Daft Dimension (Panini Comics, 2024).)\n\nIn an alternate timeline, the Doctor went to Wales in 2024 with Ruby Sunday. He told her about Roger ap Gwilliam and his actions in 2046. However, he then stepped on and broke a fairy circle made out of cotton by accident. (PROSE: The Life Of Ruby Sunday [+]Paul Lang, adapted from 73 Yards (Russell T Davies), Doctor Who The Official Annual 2025 (BBC Children's Books, 2024).) Worried, he bent down and apologised. However, as Ruby read the notes attached to it, the Doctor was banished from existence and his TARDIS subsequently sealed itself off. Ruby then lived out the rest of her life with the Doctor banished, eventually aborting the timeline when sent back from 2089 to just before the Doctor stepped on the circle. (TV: 73 Yards [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nA champion to life itself, (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) the Fifteenth Doctor enjoyed the feeling of being himself, (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) and embracing the thrill of being alive in memory of fallen friends who could not, (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) preferring to live \"in the moment.\" (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) Good at deescalating high tensions, (TV: The Well [+]Russell T Davies and Sharma Angel-Walfall, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) he sought to comfort those he knew were in distress, even offering himself as a shoulder to cry on for his fourteenth incarnation (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and as an ear for Rogue to air his grief. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) He would encourage scared people to overcome their fears with positive encouragement.

(TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) He would put the safety of others before his own wellbeing, (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., The Well [+]Russell T Davies and Sharma Angel-Walfall, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) but would act rashly when driven by his emotions.

(TV: The Story & the Engine [+]Inua Ellams, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nHe acted more on instinct than thought, which could leave him flabbergasted by his own actions. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) He described himself as being a \"visual person,\" and thus felt the need to see things to aid his thinking process regarding them. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) He could also be over personal with people he just met, causing him to act without proper consent, though he would apologise when he was called out for his actions. (TV: The Robot Revolution [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nNot wanting to show off his intelligence, (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) but still aware of his \"genius\", (TV: The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) the Fifteenth Doctor had the humility to not think himself a genius, instead prioritizing the love he had experienced in his long life as inspiration for his ideas. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) He would laugh at the weirdness of the universe. (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe liked to work at his own pace, and would drown out others while on task. He was not above what some would consider menial labour and worked as both waiting staff and as a caretaker to earn money to pay for his stay at the Sandringham Hotel. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe would behave amiably with people in general, trying to greet everyone in a room when meeting them and even compliment their appearances, such as admiring Christofer Ibrahim's improved physique, (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and tried to accommodate to a person's prefered methods of communication when he could. (TV: The Well [+]Russell T Davies and Sharma Angel-Walfall, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) However, he would prefer to sneak off without a farewell, (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) as they made him emotional. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) He strived to be respectful towards the customs of the lands he visited. (TV: 73 Yards [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) However, when presented with someone mysterious, the Doctor could get too caught up in their mystery to treat them as people. (TV: The Robot Revolution [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) He could also be playfully disobedient, such as correcting himself to \"hun\" when it was pointed out that calling an officer \"babes\" was inappropriate. (TV: The Well [+]Russell T Davies and Sharma Angel-Walfall, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nEnjoying the freedoms that came with his nomadic travels, (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) he displayed an optimistic and adventurous outlook towards the future, (PROSE: \"Heroes of Time\" [+]Part of Whotopia: The Ultimate Guide to the Whoniverse, Simon Guerrier, Una McCormack and Jonathan Morris, BBC Books (2023).) having been freed from the emotional baggage of his past, following the Fourteenth Doctor's rehab on Earth, allowing him to be accepting of his losses, while fondly remembering his past loved ones. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor did not seem to suffer from embarrassment, striding confidently around without trousers after bi-generating, (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and ecstatically dancing to his own rhythm in a nightclub. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) This even stretched to his encounters with Rogue, openly flirting with him and revelling in the chance to commit \"scandalous\" actions in the Regency era together, despite the people of the time detesting them dancing together. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nNot without \"ice in [his] heart[s]\", (TV: The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) the Doctor had little mercy for the \"relentless noise\" that was caused by those he battled \"on behalf of everyday people, who just want to get through their day, and feel safe, and warm, and fed.\" He got especially exhausted with those who \"stamp[ed] on the truth, choke[d] [the] bandwidth and shred[ed] [people's] patience\" by \"weaponising lies, taking people's insecurity and fear and making it currency\" to \"wear [them] down.\" (TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) Similarly, though greatly diminished, he retained the ruthless streak that had periodically become prominent in his other post-Time War incarnations, viciously lashing out at his enemies if they sufficiently angered him, to the point of torturing Kid for the Hellion's disregard towards the lives of everyone on Harmony Station and, as he believed at the time, killing Belinda. However when he calmed down upon seeing Belinda safe, he was horrified at his actions. (TV: The Interstellar Song Contest)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor thought himself as being \"the best\" amongst his other incarnations, (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) and was indignant when his fans favoured a Tenth Doctor adventure over any of his own. (TV: Lux [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nIn a moment of self-reflection, he hesitated to invite Ruby Sunday aboard the TARDIS, thinking he was \"bad luck\", (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and later confessing to Kate Lethbridge-Stewart that he saw himself as someone who \"bring[s] disaster\" wherever he went. (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nWanting to \"move on\" without lingering, (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) he believed that he was a man who was always moving and being positive, even when faced with tragedy, (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) doing his best to avoid seeing people again for fear of bringing harm to them. (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) When Ruby tried to urge him to take some time after the loss of Rogue, the Doctor told her that he was forever moving onwards and upwards to new horizons. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nWhen he was subjected to racial prejudice from the Finetime community, despite having saved them from the mantraps, the Doctor, upon realising that they were racist, having previously not noticed their microaggressions, still asked them to let him save them. When they still rejected him out of fear they would be \"contaminated\" by him, the Doctor initially laughed off the whole situation, before erupting into a primal scream out of frustration that he wouldn't be able to convince them to come with him in the TARDIS simply due to his skin colour. (TV: Dot and Bubble [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) After finding comfort in the community of Lagos, where he faced no judgment for his skin colour, (TV: The Story & the Engine [+]Inua Ellams, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) the Doctor accepted that there were simply places he would not be as welcomed in as he was before, electing to focus on the business at hand when he skirted around segregation laws, opting to \"live in\" the moment and \"shine\" as he waited for the people to \"topple their world[view]\". (TV: Lux [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor was a lover of music, believing that \"without music, the human race [would go] sour.\" He was particularly a fan of the Beatles, Cilla Black, (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and Kylie Minogue. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) He would sometimes speak in a singing tone, (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., The Robot Revolution [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) and would sing to himself when he needed to keep calm. (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe liked to learn new things, particularly new ways of looking at the universe, (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and also loved learning about new locations. (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) He enjoyed skies \"ripe with constellations\", (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and loved New Year's Day for the \"hopes and possibilities\" it inspired. (TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nHe disliked having to wait. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe had a macabre sense of humour when infiltrating the Goblin ship in spite of the open risk of the Goblins eating him, (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and laughed at the fate of Alan Budd. (TV: The Robot Revolution [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) He was likewise so enthralled by the sight of the Goblin band that he overlooked that Lulubelle was about to be eaten by the Goblin King, (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and momentarily overlooked Belinda's distress at Earth's disappearance when he got distracted by the idea of a giant moth being involved. (TV: The Well [+]Russell T Davies and Sharma Angel-Walfall, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nHis favourite places in time and space included the 1960s (TV: Untitled [+]BBC idents series 14 (BBC One, 2024).) and Wales, (TV: 73 Yards [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and his favourite species included the Ood. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) He also held a respect for the Silurians. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe retained his eleventh incarnation's enjoyment for fish fingers and custard, (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and took his coffee with fresh milk. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe would abolish those who used their faith to justify their rash actions in the absence of proof, but admitted his dislike for faith did not mean he would belittle it. (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe believed uniqueness was a superpower, (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and thought songs about soldiers \"should be sad.\" He felt that life was defined by death, with \"only the best part[s]\" surviving when someone \"melt[ed] away\", (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and that love persevered \"in and out of the slipstreams of time, [where] beautiful things [could] be forgotten and gone.\" (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nWhile he was normally fearless, (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) the Fifteenth Doctor feared the powers of the Pantheon of Discord, reacting with terror when he realised Maestro was one of \"the gods\", struggling to hold on to hope of stopping them, even belittling his victory over the Toymaker as an act of pure chance. However, he was able to regain his nerve against Maestro for Ruby's sake (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and talk down to Sutekh when he gained the upper hand. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nSeeing himself as a representation of life, the Fifteenth Doctor believed that killing his enemies would make him \"a monster\", (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) though he would express joy in making his foes suffer if they harmed those close to him. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025)., The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor took pride in his status as a time traveller, taking offence when Ruby called the goblin's time travellers, telling her that their time-surfing capabilities were a mere \"bimble\" in comparison to \"cool\" time travellers like himself. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He playfully laughed off UNIT's attempt to create a time window as \"rough\" compared to his form of time travel with the TARDIS, (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) but marvelled at the Time Hotel's operations. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe knew to be careful when it came to meddling with time, even forbidding himself and Ruby from visiting her abandonment at the church on Ruby Road due to its status as an important fixed point in time, despite their shared fascinated by the mystery of the event, (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and knew it could be dangerous to visit himself in the past. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nWhile his immediate predecessors would dwell on lives lost in a crisis, the Fifteenth Doctor knew he \"[couldn't] save everyone\" and instead chose to move on. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He also chose not to dwell on his tragedies, lightly telling Ruby Sunday he had no family left, and then quickly resuming the task at hand. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) However, when telling her of Gallifrey in the comfort of his TARDIS, the Doctor was more wistful, (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and could still be triggered when painfully reminded of his destroyed homeworld. (TV: The Interstellar Song Contest [+]Juno Dawson, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) He also reflected sombrely on the abandonment and adoption of the Timeless Child when seeing Carla Sunday shower Ruby with affection, (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and also tried to warn Ruby that her reunion with her biological mother, Louise Miller, could end negatively, specifically pointing out how she never tried to find Ruby and how \"unfair\" it could be on Louise for Ruby to approach her after using time travel to find her, though he was happy when the reunion was embraced by Louise. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe could get caught up in his excitement to the point that he risked sabotaging his own efforts (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and get too into the thrill of explaining a situation to take account of how he was scaring his audience, (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and also fail to notice when he was in danger until it was in front of him. (COMIC: Mancopolis [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Magazines, 2024).) He could also be thrill-seeker, opting to detour on his flight to the Rani's Bone Palace to fly under London Bridge and through a Bone Beast that was under fire from a Galvanic beam for no clear reason beyond fun. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nWhile he moved to protect bystanders from harm, he was not above criticising their choices or begrudging the circumstances he found himself in. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) Even though he was dismissive of the policeman that questioned him regarding an accident with an inflatable snowman, the Doctor stopped during his exit to reassure the man that his girlfriend would accept his marriage proposal, because his decision to buy an engagement ring before the sales was proof of character, and happily wished him a \"Merry Christmas\" before he left. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He similarly gifted Trev Simpkins his spare mug after dismissing his attempts to confront him for stealing guest only milk from the Time Hotel. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nNo longer wishing to be a \"great enigma\", (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) as he considered his need to be \"mysterious\" as the reason behind his isolation, (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) the Doctor would prefer to speak hard truths than try to falsely alleviate even the bleakest situations by lying. (TV: Dot and Bubble [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., The Well [+]Russell T Davies and Sharma Angel-Walfall, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Doctor embraced his newfound status as a foundling, even proclaiming that it ultimately did not matter where he came from because he was \"absolutely lovely\" the way he was. (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor recalled his third incarnation as being a \"great enigma\". (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) He professed a love for the Thirteenth Doctor, (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) and was sympathetic about the Fourteenth Doctor's struggles and urged him to retire. When they parted ways, they hugged each other and saluted at one another with affection. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nHe agreed with his predecessor that being separated from his TARDIS would \"hurt\", and also apologised to his ship after he struck it with a mallet to divide it. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He also took umbrage when someone took his ability to control his TARDIS from him. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe remembered Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart as being \"the best of men\", and maintained a strong friendship with Kate Lethbridge-Stewart and her UNIT team. (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) He also maintained that he \"loved\" Mel Bush, (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and extended that love to the rest of his friends in the UNIT family. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nComparing her to his \"amazing friend\" Sarah Jane Smith, (TV: Pyramids of Mars [+]Russell T Davies, Tales of the TARDIS (BBC Four, 2024).) whom he still \"loved\" in the same way as Rose Tyler, (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) the Doctor considered Ruby Sunday to be his best friend. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) When she left the TARDIS to get acquainted with her biological parents, the Doctor thanked Ruby for helping him to talk about his family \"in a way that [her] never did before\", and silently agreed with her when she proclaimed her love for him. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nWhile spending a year at the Sandringham Hotel, the Doctor struck up a friendship with the proprietor, Anita Benn, telling her he made his stay \"amazing\" as he bid her farewell, telling her people would be \"lucky\" to know her, (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and was happy when she settled down to start her own family, though regretted having to learn she had secretly fancied him, feeling he had done her a disservices. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor was open about his attraction towards men, being encapsulated by Ricky September, (TV: Dot and Bubble [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and being particularly enamoured with Rogue. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nHe thought that children were \"the most precious gift[s] of all\", and made it his mission to protect them, breaking down in tears if he realised that a child had come to harm. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nWhen describing the process of regeneration to Ruby Sunday, the Fifteenth Doctor told her that a Time Lord would remain the same person despite changing their appearance, even comparing it to taking on a disguise in an opportunity to hide away with a new face. (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nWhen he realised he could use his own Regeneration energy to \"jolt [reality by] one degree\" by releasing it into the Time Vortex in order to restore his daughter, Poppy, back into existence, the Doctor bemoaned how much he had enjoyed his fifteenth incarnation, but decided to focus on saving Poppy instead of despairing, even defending his choice as being \"[one] life for a life\" that was expensed as a result of saving the world, and deeming it \"no world at all\" for such a price. Though he was \"terrified\" that the pain would \"eat [his] soul\", and wished he could of had \"longer\", he was ultimately accepting of giving his own life for Poppy, and kept the process at bay in order to ensure she and Belinda were safe. While he was saddened to learn Poppy had been fathered by another in the new reality, he accepted her survival as a victory and expressed his love for her and Belinda as he departed. Not wanting to face the end alone, the Doctor went to the Star of Bethlehem, where he realised he could best describe his life as having been \"an absolute joy.\" (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor spoke with a unique accent, which became more prominent when he raised his voice, (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., Dot and Bubble [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) with a Scottish accent also flaring up from time-to-time.

(TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor showed advanced control over his regeneration process when compared to his previous incarnations, having been able to use the remaining regeneration energy from their Bi-Generation to heal themselves at one point(TV: Lux).

A thin black moustache rested on top his upper lip, and he had a faint scar around his right eye.

(TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nBecause he had an enjoyment for dressing up, (TV: Lux [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) the Fifteenth Doctor made a habit of alternating his main attire with a variety of clothing, such as switching out his trenchcoat for a leather jacket, his trousers for a kilt, his shoes for boots, and his polo-cardigans for tank-tops (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and polo-shirts.

(TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nAn alternative outfit, that the Doctor thought represented his true self, (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) consisted of pinstriped denim waistcoat, (TV: The Robot Revolution [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) sometimes covered by a tartan bomber jacket, (TV: Bad Music [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC Two, 2024).) with a white t-shirt, and a pinstriped denim kilt kept up with black suspenders and accompanied by navy joggers that went down to a pair of black laced-upped boots.

(TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nUpon emerging from the bi-generation, the Fifteenth Doctor retained the Fourteenth Doctor's dress shirt, tie, pants, socks and shoes. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) However, believing them to be \"off-the-peg\", he soon chose an outfit of his own after pondered on wearing a frilly shirt and a scarf. He settled on wearing sturdy boots, that he believed would be handy on the Moon, and a \"nice\" new hat (POEM: Contents [+]James Goss, Now We Are Six Hundred (Harper Design, 2017). Page 16.) in the form of a bolero. (PROSE: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, adapted from The Church on Ruby Road (Russell T Davies), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2024). Chapter Three; Page 15.)\n\nWhile leisuring around in his TARDIS, the Doctor would don a plaid dressing gown. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nWhilst visiting 1963 Abbey Road, he wore a blue pinstriped double-breasted suit, with a grey necktie and white collared-shirt, and wore a pair of black Cuban heeled boots, with a wig in the style of a mini-afro with sideburns. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nWhen visiting a party in 1813, the Doctor wore a velvet tailcoat with a white shirt under a matching brass buttoned waistcoat with an ivory cravat, accompanied by ivory breeches and white tight socks and slippers. He also donned a curly black ponytail. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nWhile working at the Sandringham Hotel, the Doctor removed his jewelry, save for Rogue's pinky ring, in favour of donning yellow work gloves to go with his blue polo-shirt and navy chinos trousers kept up with a black leather belt, which carried a brown toolbelt when the Doctor worked as a handyman. He occasionally donned a yellow baseball cap as headwear and wore black trainers for footwear. To cope with the colder times during his stay, he wore a microfleece zip vest. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nWhen he became the Royal Historian on Missbelindachandra One, the Doctor donned a standing collared jacket, high top sneakers and trousers coloured in light yellow, with a golden tank top. (TV: The Robot Revolution [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) After he found the TARDIS has landed in 1952 Miami, the Doctor changed into a blue, notch collared sharkskin suit with matching trousers paired with a slim brown belt, a white dress shirt with a pink bow tie, and two-tone brown and white dress shoes. (TV: Lux [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nWhen visiting 2019 Nigeria, the Doctor wore a sleeveless burgundy jacket over a golden dashiki, with some orange pleated details, and matching trousers, a beaded Yoruba necklace, a gray kufi cap, and taupe ribbed socks. (TV: The Story & the Engine [+]Inua Ellams, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nWhilst trapped in Conrad's World as \"John Smith\", the Doctor wore a three-piece navy pinstriped suit with wide white stripes, a geometric tie on white dress shirt under a cropped suit vest patterned the same as the suit in the same way his trousers did, with black leather dress shoes. His accessories included a wedding ring, a wristwatch, a bowler hat and a black umbrella. (TV: Wish World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe BBC announcement revealing Ncuti Gatwa's casting as the Doctor was worded ambiguously, with Gatwa's Doctor only described as \"the new Doctor\", without explicitly stating him to be the Fourteenth Doctor, or even the successor to Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor.[1][2] Nevertheless, numerous news outlets presumed that Gatwa's incarnation would be the Fourteenth Doctor and incorrectly reported as such.[3][4][5][6]\n\nHowever, Whittaker's final episode, The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022)., depicted the Thirteenth Doctor regenerating into a new incarnation once again portrayed by Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant. After Power of the Doctor's broadcast, Russell T Davies confirmed that Tennant's new incarnation was the Fourteenth Doctor, and that Gatwa's would follow as the Fifteenth.[7]\n\nStrangely, Gatwa was again incorrectly identified as the Fourteenth Doctor by the Channel 5 documentary Doctor Who: 60 Years of Secrets and Scandals which aired on 25 November 2023, shortly following the premiere of The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., the first full episode of Tennant's run as the Fourteenth Doctor.\n\nWith the casting of Rwandan-Scottish actor Ncuti Gatwa, the Fifteenth Doctor became the first \"main\" ordinal incarnation of the Doctor in the programme's history to be played by a black man.[3][8] However, other black Doctors have previously appeared in the Doctor Who universe;\n\nGatwa has the distinction of being the first openly queer actor to portray a mainline ordinal incarnation of the Doctor,[9] though queer actor Mark Gatiss previously portrayed a non-ordinal Doctor in the parody skit The Web of Caves [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., while queer actor Geoffrey Bayldon portrayed an alternate universe Doctor in the Doctor Who Unbound audio series.\n\nCo-star Neil Patrick Harris has described Gatwa as \"the first gay Doctor\".[10] The question of which incarnation constitutes the \"first gay Doctor\" is a matter of debate; the friendship between the Thirteenth Doctor and Yasmin Khan became romantically tinged towards the end of the Chris Chibnall era, though the pair never explicitly expressed their attraction to one another, while the Eighth Doctor was implied to be non-heterosexual in the Eighth Doctor Adventures series of novels, as was the Fourteenth Doctor just one episode prior to Gatwa's debut, who was surprised to discover that he found Isaac Newton \"hot\". Furthermore, many stories released in the 1990s and beyond reiterate that the Time Lords' concept of gender differs to that of humanity.\n\nContinuing the trend set by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Doctors, the Fifteenth Doctor appeared multiple times in expanded media before his television debut.",
