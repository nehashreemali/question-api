  "content": "The Eighth Doctor was inherently a happy adventurer, falling in love with companions Grace Holloway and Charley Pollard, and was not averse to experiencing and appreciating very human emotions, from kissing Grace to providing psychological support for Izzy Sinclair. A playful man who wanted the universe to be a peaceful and beautiful place, even when met with disaster, he was not averse to cheekily giving people hints about their futures as he revelled in life and living, but his lifetime was equally defined by some of the nastiest circumstances possible, from him constantly being captured and tortured to witnessing many senseless deaths. In the later years of his life, he turned colder and angrier and less willing to take on companions when it became clear that a terrible tragedy was brewing in the universe.\n\nAn optimist and romantic at his core, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) the Doctor tried to remain a cheerful and pacifistic adventurer in spite of a universe that grew ever increasingly hostile around him, (AUDIO: To the Death [+]Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2011).) eventually culminating in the eruption of the Last Great Time War between the Time Lords and the Dalek Empire. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Despite his efforts to avoid the conflict, (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) the Doctor was often forced into involvement by outside intervention, (AUDIO: The Starship of Theseus [+]John Dorney, The Eighth Doctor: Time War: Volume One (The Eighth Doctor: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2017)., Planet of the Ogrons [+]Guy Adams, The Eighth Doctor: Time War: Volume Two (The Eighth Doctor: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2018)., Darkness and Light [+]David Llewellyn, Rage of the Time Lords (The War Master, Big Finish Productions, 2019).) through he himself was adamant to keep his distance from the centre of the battle. (PROSE: Ghost of Christmas Past [+]Scott Handcock, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).)\n\nAfter the end of the Time War, the Ninth Doctor emerged, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and some sources and spectators indicated that the Eighth Doctor had regenerated directly into him. (PROSE: Have You Seen This Man? [+]various authors, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Doctor Who and the Time War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).) However, a far greater number of sources suggested that the Eighth Doctor chose to regenerate on the planet Karn, while abandoning his name, into the War Doctor when he succumbed to despair after failing to save a single life during the Time War. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWith an carefree exterior (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) and a belief that it was never too late, (PROSE: All Flesh is Grass [+]Una McCormack, Time Lord Victorious release order (BBC Books, 2020).) the Eighth Doctor was an enthusiastic figure who explored the universe for the sheer love and experience of it, (COMIC: By Hook or By Crook [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1997).; AUDIO: The Silver Turk [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) craving open spaces and natural things, such as trees, grass, birds and animals, (PROSE: The Novel of the Film [+]Gary Russell, adapted from Doctor Who (Matthew Jacobs), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 1996).) and relishing in the unpredictability of his travels. (AUDIO: Echoes of Extinction [+]Alfie Shaw, Time Lord Victorious (Big Finish Productions, 2021).) Thriving on the activity of righting wrongs, (COMIC: Descendance [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (Radio Times, 1996).) and safe guarding the future, (COMIC: Coda [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (BBC Magazines, 1997).) the Eighth Doctor was a direct, sympathetic and emotionally accessible individual, (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).; COMIC: Beautiful Freak [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2001).) but these traits were balanced by his occasional feelings of self-doubt and weariness of his endless battles to maintain order, (PROSE: Longest Day [+]Michael Collier, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998)., Legacy of the Daleks [+]John Peel, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998)., Interference: The Hour of the Geek [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).; COMIC: Where Nobody Knows Your Name [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003).; AUDIO: Scherzo [+]Robert Shearman, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003)., To the Death [+]Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2011).) with the Doctor commenting to Fitz Kreiner that his travels had made him \"appreciate the beauty and delicate sadness of the interconnectedness of all things.\" (PROSE: Dominion [+]Nick Walters, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) While he did not object to being called British, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) the Doctor \"consider[ed] [himself] primarily a citizen of the galaxy\", (PROSE: Vanderdeken's Children [+]Christopher Bulis, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) and believed that \"nothing [was] alien\" to a \"citizen of the universe\". (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).)\n\nNot wanting to be \"burdened by [his] past\", (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) and believing it to be his job, (COMIC: The Road to Hell [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 1999).) the Doctor would always make an attempt to save a life if he could, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) believing that any life was worth saving, (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) even the life of his Imagineum doppelganger, (COMIC: Endgame [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1996).) and even risked the Web of Time by warning his seventh incarnation about his regeneration. (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) He felt guilt when reflecting on the lives he had been forced to take, (PROSE: Revolution Man [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and strove to compensate for the lives he had taken by saving just as many. (PROSE: Fallen Gods [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).)\n\nBeing a \"free spirit\", (AUDIO: Horror of Glam Rock [+]Paul Magrs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2007).) the Eighth Doctor was full of the joy of life, possessing the willpower to hold off a cyber-conversion on a mental plane, (COMIC: Dreadnought [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (BBC Magazines, 1996).) make his body scream while his soul was in the psionic plane, (COMIC: Bad Blood [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003-2004).) and was unable to surrender against the odds. (AUDIO: Neverland [+]Alan Barnes, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) He was also something of a thrill-seeker, hitting the fire alarm of the ITAR building simply to \"liven things up\" during his and Grace's escape, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) sneaking into the Gorolith's sphere after he pointed out that he didn't need too, (COMIC: Ophidius [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2001).) enjoying the feeling of not knowing where the TARDIS had landed, (AUDIO: The Chimes of Midnight [+]Robert Shearman, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) and once indulged in multiple adventures simultaneously for the sheer fun of it. (PROSE: The Wickerwork Man [+]Paul Magrs, Short Trips: Farewells (Short Trips short stories, 2006).)\n\nAlthough full of spirit and humanity, the Eighth Doctor did have a dark side within him, especially when the forces of evil tried to unbalance the laws of the universe, but he still held on to his belief in mercy, offering to save the Bruce Master from the Eye of Harmony, even after he attacked him for killing Grace and Lee. (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) However, he warned Ice Lord Artix that he was \"very dangerous when roused\", (COMIC: Ascendance [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (Radio Times, 1996).) spoke in an icy tone when confronting Niroc about the Sixth Doctor's trial, (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) and tried to strangle Qixotl in retaliation for past betrayals. (PROSE: Alien Bodies [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) He also gave the Preacher Master a particularly violent punch to the face while denying their similarities during their duel for the Glory, (COMIC: The Glorious Dead [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2000).) became more abrupt and short-tempered after Izzy got kidnapped due to being in Destrii's body, (COMIC: Uroboros [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2002).) and slaughtered an entire Cyber-Fleet with the power of the Time Vortex after they had angered him. (COMIC: The Flood [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2004-2005).) After Lucie's death, the Doctor took his frustration out on the Monk for his part in the tragedy, (AUDIO: To the Death [+]Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2011).) and later felt frustration at the Reborn Master for leaving the Ramossans to die at the hands of the Eminence, hitting the TARDIS in frustration and trying to avert the creation of the Eminence despite the Laws of Time. (AUDIO: The Reviled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAs a coping mechanism, (AUDIO: Zagreus [+]Alan Barnes and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) the Doctor would react to threats of death and torture with dark humour, such as mocking the Master's affection for Chang Lee while he was strapped to a gurney, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) calling the Cybermen unimaginative during their attempt to cyber-convert him, (COMIC: Dreadnought [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (BBC Magazines, 1996).) getting sarcastically formal with the Dalek Supreme, (COMIC: Fire and Brimstone [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1997).) jesting with Eric Rawden until he could no longer stand the interrogation, (AUDIO: Something Inside [+]Trevor Baxendale, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) bitterly asking his torturers for some more pain, (AUDIO: Memory Lane [+]Eddie Robson, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) cracking jokes when aboard a crashing spaceship, (AUDIO: Masterplan [+]Matt Fitton, Dark Eyes 3 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2014).) and brashly listing hobbies he could indulge in after Ohila informed him he had four minutes left to live. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) The Ice Warriors believed he did so to \"suppress his fear\". (AUDIO: The Resurrection of Mars [+]Jonathan Morris, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2010).)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor was willing to help anyone he came across regardless of his connection to them, (AUDIO: Orbis [+]Alan Barnes and Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2009)., Prisoner of the Sun [+]Eddie Robson, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2011).) and sacrifice himself for the sake of others, as his was the only life he felt he had the right to give, (AUDIO: The Resurrection of Mars [+]Jonathan Morris, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) to the point that even his TARDIS began scolding him for it. (AUDIO: Zagreus [+]Alan Barnes and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) He told Grace to leave him at the Master's mercy so she could reroute the power of the TARDIS and close the Eye of Harmony, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) ran back into Adisham to save its residents from the Red Death, (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) was going to kamikaze a helicopter to destroy Donald Stark, (COMIC: The Fallen [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 1998-1999).) and was willing to surrender his life so the Cybermen would copy his regenerative pattern and abandon their invasion of Earth. (COMIC: The Flood [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2004-2005).)\n\nIn contrast to his scheming predecessor, the Eighth Doctor had little patience and could not stay on one train of thought for more than a few seconds, getting distracted by the comfort of his new shoes while recalling his childhood, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) reading books too fast to realise what he was reading, (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) forgetting to eat for days on end, (PROSE: Camera Obscura [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) and slipping into soliloquies while in conversation. (PROSE: The Face-Eater [+]Simon Messingham, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).; AUDIO: Seasons of Fear [+]Paul Cornell and Caroline Symcox, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) He also bored of things quickly, only making an omelette for Anji Kapoor before suddenly proclaiming his boredom and stopping. (PROSE: Timeless [+]Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003).) Sam theorised that the Doctor took on companions because he \"couldn't think in a straight line without [them]\", (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) but he was able to make sound decisions when the need called for it, (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) and was both aware and annoyed that he \"[kept] missing the important bits\". (PROSE: Placebo Effect [+]Gary Russell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).)\n\nThough he felt that talking helped him to concentrate, (AUDIO: Prisoner of the Sun [+]Eddie Robson, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2011).) he would sometimes naively say and do things without taking the situation in, such as suddenly reaching into his pocket for a jelly baby in front of an armed motorcycle policeman, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) unironically telling Detective Inspector Foster he was a Time Lord while being interrogated for drug possession, (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) stopping to oink at pigs in the company of Inspector Bengt Nordenstam, (PROSE: Dominion [+]Nick Walters, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and almost ruining his cover story by pointing out the brilliance of his interrogator's deduction. (COMIC: The Road to Hell [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 1999).)\n\nWhile he usually acted like an eccentric gentleman, the Eighth Doctor also had moments of certifiable insanity, with him describing himself as an \"ethnomethodologist\", (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) and Compassion noting that he was \"prone to flights of fancy\". (PROSE: Frontier Worlds [+]Peter Anghelides, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) While he dismissed Julya's question of his madness as him being \"very, very clever\", (PROSE: The Janus Conjunction [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) he believed he \"must be insane\" when asked by Anji, (PROSE: Eater of Wasps [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) and Fitz Kreiner worried that the Doctor was aware of his breakdowns, just unconcerned by them. Both the Doctor and Fitz shared a worrying moment when they realised the Doctor seemed to be \"unbalanced\" to the point of schizophrenia. (PROSE: The Slow Empire [+]Dave Stone, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nThe Doctor was a fan of Marvel Comics' X-Men, (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) Transformers, (PROSE: The Taking of Planet 5 [+]Simon Bucher-Jones and Mark Clapham, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) model train sets, (PROSE: The City of the Dead [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) Thunderbirds (PROSE: Trading Futures [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) and Zap Daniel, (PROSE: The Tomorrow Windows [+]Jonathan Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) but disliked Babylon 5 (PROSE: Escape Velocity [+]Colin Brake, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) and the Aggrotron! comics. (AUDIO: Izzy's Story [+]Alan Barnes, The Company of Friends (Main Range, Big Finish Productions, 2009).) He enjoyed reading Victorian literature, such as The Time Machine, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) Sherlock Holmes novels, (PROSE: The Bodysnatchers [+]Mark Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) The Strand magazine, (PROSE: Genocide [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, (PROSE: Option Lock [+]Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) and Cold Comfort Farm, (PROSE: All Flesh is Grass [+]Una McCormack, Time Lord Victorious release order (BBC Books, 2020).) and had a liking for the opera.

Orson Welles' films, (AUDIO: Invaders from Mars [+]Mark Gatiss, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).)

(AUDIO: World of Damnation [+]Matt Fitton, Ravenous 1 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Ravenous, Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nBy his own admission, the Doctor had a \"pink bunny slipper fetish\", (PROSE: Grimm Reality [+]Simon Bucher-Jones and Kelly Hale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) and enjoyed the dark, seeing it as \"[enhancing] the mystery.\" (AUDIO: The Chimes of Midnight [+]Robert Shearman, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) He also enjoyed Winnie the Pooh, with his favourite character being Tigger, (AUDIO: Caerdroia [+]Lloyd Rose, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) but disliked cats so much that he removed one from the TARDIS on sight, (AUDIO: Nevermore [+]Alan Barnes, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) though did enjoy petting them. (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) Among his favourite times and places were late 19th century England, (PROSE: The Banquo Legacy [+]Andy Lane and Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) the city of Florence, (PROSE: Fear Itself [+]Nick Wallace, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) and Edward the Confessor's reign. (AUDIO: Seasons of Fear [+]Paul Cornell and Caroline Symcox, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) He appreciated the smells of freshly-mowed grass (AUDIO: World of Damnation [+]Matt Fitton, Ravenous 1 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Ravenous, Big Finish Productions, 2018).) and arriving on a \"fresh new planet\". (PROSE: Steps [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHe hated \"long goodbyes\", (PROSE: The Bodysnatchers [+]Mark Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) pastel colour schemes, (PROSE: Dominion [+]Nick Walters, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) commercial airplanes, (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) getting pins and needles, (PROSE: The Taking of Planet 5 [+]Simon Bucher-Jones and Mark Clapham, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and rats. (PROSE: The Banquo Legacy [+]Andy Lane and Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) He also disliked \"pointless things\". (AUDIO: Lies in Ruins [+]James Goss, The Legacy of Time (Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nThe Doctor \"wouldn't have minded being a bus conductor\", (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) and saw rocket trails and animal shapes in the clouds when looking up at the sky. (PROSE: Frontier Worlds [+]Peter Anghelides, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) His lucky stars were a couple of red dwarves in Pavo. (PROSE: To the Slaughter [+]Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) He prided himself on \"being able to find a quick fix, [and] an easy solution to any problem\", and would fall into despair when he couldn't help someone. (COMIC: The Way of All Flesh [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2001).) The Doctor revelled in arriving on new worlds, thinking them as \"fresh blank pages\" that became his \"stage\". (POEM: Steps [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor enjoyed jelly babies, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) preferring them to Liquorice Allsorts, (PROSE: The Tomorrow Windows [+]Jonathan Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) with his favourite being the red ones. (AUDIO: Scaredy Cat [+]Will Shindler, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) He also got very excited about 99 Flakes, (AUDIO: Memory Lane [+]Eddie Robson, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) cotton candy and chunky monkey ice cream. (AUDIO: Terror Firma [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) Being a vegetarian, (AUDIO: Relative Dimensions [+]Marc Platt, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) he rarely touched meat, (AUDIO: Seasons of Fear [+]Paul Cornell and Caroline Symcox, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) but did like bacon sandwichs. (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) He claimed apricot jam calmed him down. (COMIC: By Hook or By Crook [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1997).)\n\nHe also liked turkish delights, (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).)

(PROSE: Casualties of War [+]Steve Emmerson, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) He also liked to have his tea with milk and either two sugars (PROSE: Thinking Warrior [+]Huw Wilkins, Short Trips: 2040 (Short Trips short stories, 2004).) or six sugars, (AUDIO: The Zygon Who Fell to Earth [+]Paul Magrs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2008).) but preferred it white without sugar. (AUDIO: The Eight Truths [+]Eddie Robson, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2009).)

(PROSE: The Ancestor Cell [+]Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor believed that \"the universe [hung] [on] such a fragile thread of coincidences\" that it was \"useless to meddle with it\", unless the meddler was a Time Lord, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) but he later confided in Grace that even he shouldn't meddle in the affairs of others, (COMIC: The Fallen [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 1998-1999).) but maintained that it was good to change the universe for the better. (COMIC: Tales of the Dark Times [+]Comic Creator (Scary Beasties, 2020).) He also didn't believe in ghosts, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) or curses. (AUDIO: The Stones of Venice [+]Paul Magrs, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).) As he disbelieved in coincidences, (COMIC: Fire and Brimstone [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1997).) he thought that everything happened for a reason. (AUDIO: The Traitor [+]Nicholas Briggs, Dark Eyes 2 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2014).)\n\nThough he would pray to \"whatever gods he [had]\" every day, (AUDIO: Seasons of Fear [+]Paul Cornell and Caroline Symcox, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) the Doctor didn't have a \"faith\", (PROSE: Placebo Effect [+]Gary Russell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) claimed not to understand the idea of gloating, (PROSE: History 101 [+]Mags L. Halliday, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) and insisted he was psychologically incapable of experiencing survivor's guilt. (PROSE: The Gallifrey Chronicles [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) He though that honour was a matter of \"recognising your mistakes and being aware that you [had] to fix them\" regardless of the consequences. (COMIC: The Road to Hell [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 1999).)\n\nHe deemed \"class war[s]\" to be \"stupid\", (COMIC: Descendance [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (Radio Times, 1996).) was a firm believer in manners, (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) thought that \"pride and stupidity [were] indistinguishable\", (PROSE: The Bodysnatchers [+]Mark Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) tried to keep an open mind, (COMIC: The Glorious Dead [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2000).) didn't view himself as a family man, (AUDIO: Other Lives [+]Gary Hopkins, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) claimed to hold a distain for clairvoyants (COMIC: Uroboros [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2002).) and an admiration for \"enquiring mind[s]\", (COMIC: The Curious Tale of Spring-Heeled Jack [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003).) and hated being \"cooped up in one place for so long\", (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) such as when being locked up. (PROSE: EarthWorld [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nHe considered eight to be his \"lucky number\" (COMIC: The Glorious Dead [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2000).) due to it becoming an infinity symbol when turned. (PROSE: The Knight, The Fool and The Dead [+]Steve Cole, Time Lord Victorious (BBC Books, 2020).) He was not against theft if he saw it in his power to return what he stole, (PROSE: The Novel of the Film [+]Gary Russell, adapted from Doctor Who (Matthew Jacobs), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 1996).) but would avoid stealing if he thought it would cause more trouble than it would solve. (PROSE: Dominion [+]Nick Walters, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nDespite his enthusiasms, the Doctor had a fear of heights, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) hospitals, (PROSE: Kursaal [+]Peter Anghelides, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998)., The Ancestor Cell [+]Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) spiders, (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) and his TARDIS being shattered into a million shards. (AUDIO: Faith Stealer [+]Graham Duff, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) He also disliked diving because he \"[didn't] like the constriction of being cocooned in a diving suit.\" (PROSE: The Infinity Race [+]Simon Messingham, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) He could be deeply unnerved when imprisoned, (PROSE: Seeing I [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998)., Interference: The Hour of the Geek [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and acknowledged that he was corruptible when he realised how much he wanted the Glory. (COMIC: The Glorious Dead [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2000).)\n\nLike his previous incarnations, the Eighth Doctor stood against wanton violence, (PROSE: The Novel of the Film [+]Gary Russell, adapted from Doctor Who (Matthew Jacobs), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 1996).) and was insistent on solving solutions in a peaceful manner, (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997)., Revolution Man [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).; COMIC: Endgame [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1996).) but knew that that would not be an option all the time, and was not above resulting to violence when needed, even attacking the Cyberman Kroton with lethal intend on-sight, (COMIC: The Company of Thieves [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (1999).) and massacring some Torajenn during their attack on Coyoacan. (COMIC: The Way of All Flesh [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2001).) He killed a pair of vampires, commentating on how melodramatic it was, aware that he couldn't try anything less fatal due to the vampires' strength and healing abilities. However, Romana II noted the regret in his eyes, (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) and the Doctor later remarked that he killed them due to \"[not knowing himself] well enough at the time\" to know different. (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).)\n\nHe later talked Anton la Serre to death for his part in the deaths on the Dreamstone Moon, (PROSE: Dreamstone Moon [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) and killed Ed Hill with a gun to prevent the imminent destruction of the Earth, and in part to save Fitz from having to bear the responsibility of killing him. (PROSE: Revolution Man [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) When his memories were gone, he pushed murderer Roger Nepath to his death without remorse while Nepath pleaded for his life, (PROSE: The Burning [+]Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) allowed a guard to be shot in his place, telepathically convinced his interrogator's heart to stop beating, (PROSE: Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) and killed Hilary Pink to save him from possession. (PROSE: Eater of Wasps [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) He didn't complain when he thought someone being attacked deserved the retribution, (COMIC: The Final Chapter [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1998).) or hold any qualms about destroying a non-living entity. (COMIC: The Road to Hell [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 1999).)\n\nWhile he sometimes \"yearned\" for the ability to \"hit a rewind button\" and fix the pain he had seen, the Doctor knew he couldn't undue the pains of the past, and that he had to accept time's impact as it \"move[d] through [him]\". (COMIC: Beautiful Freak [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2001).) However, he allowed Liv to \"stuff the ethics\" and give antiseptic to a woman whose son had been attacked in 1639 Florence. (AUDIO: The Galileo Trap [+]Marc Platt, Doom Coalition 1 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2015).)\n\nIn touch with his feminine side, the Doctor was sometimes called a \"ponce,\" (PROSE: The Turing Test [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).; AUDIO: Blood of the Daleks [+]Steve Lyons, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) or a \"poof\" on one occasion, (PROSE: Timeless [+]Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003).) and had a maternal urge to see to it that everyone around him was well-fed, even carrying food around in his pockets to give to his companions on a moment's notice. (PROSE: The Year of Intelligent Tigers [+]Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) He often got teary-eyed around his adopted daughter, Miranda Dawkins. (PROSE: Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nThough it was thought[who?] that he was trying to distract himself from its sudden loss, (PROSE: Coldheart [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) the Doctor allowed himself to become a darker and angrier person with the loss of his TARDIS in the dimensional barrier between Earth and Avalon, and his reliance on Compassion as a means of travel, (PROSE: The Shadows of Avalon [+]Paul Cornell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) with Fitz noting the Doctor's tendency to throw himself into others' problems to avoid facing his own. (PROSE: The Space Age [+]Steve Lyons, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nDuring his time stranded on Earth following Gallifrey's destruction, the Doctor fell into a deep state of depression due to his failure to get off the planet, (PROSE: Endgame [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) and often dreamt of his TARDIS, (PROSE: Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) though he reacted with terror when offered the chance to have his memories restored. (PROSE: Endgame [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) Throughout his time on Earth, the Doctor was unable to feel \"at home\", knowing that he didn't belong on the planet. (PROSE: Fear Itself [+]Nick Wallace, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) Once he adopted Miranda Dawkins, he decided to improve his situation in order to be able to provide for her, such as working as a business consultant and taking up beekeeping. (PROSE: Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) The Doctor would later realise his behaviour was similar to the symptoms of Albrecht's Ennui, (PROSE: The Book of the Still [+]Paul Ebbs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) and would come to look back on his time stranded with fondness, (PROSE: The Deadstone Memorial [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) but did not wish to be stranded a second time. (PROSE: History 101 [+]Mags L. Halliday, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) Once he was able to travel off Earth, the Doctor was keen to encounter \"monsters\" again. (PROSE: Vanishing Point [+]Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nAfter being able to leave Earth in his TARDIS, the Doctor became more open to violent acts, (PROSE: Eater of Wasps [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001)., Mad Dogs and Englishmen [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) and would have brief periodic spells of frailty. (PROSE: Grimm Reality [+]Simon Bucher-Jones and Kelly Hale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) He felt he no longer had the right to interfere in the affairs of the universe due to him no longer having the authority of a Time Lord. Seeing it as the only way for him to continue righting wrongs, the Doctor decided to become \"Earth's Champion\" and planned to marry Juliette Vierge in a symbolic ceremony in which he would root himself on Earth, until Juliette was lured away by Sabbath Dei. (PROSE: The Adventuress of Henrietta Street [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) After the loss of his second heart to Sabbath, the Doctor became an even darker, though more humane, person. (PROSE: Hope [+]Mark Clapham, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002)., Anachrophobia [+]Jonathan Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002)., History 101 [+]Mags L. Halliday, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002)., Camera Obscura [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) He felt weaker on his feet, worried about his lifespan shortening, (PROSE: Hope [+]Mark Clapham, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) felt greater frailty, (PROSE: Anachrophobia [+]Jonathan Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) had chest pains when in close proximity to his severed heart, (PROSE: Anachrophobia [+]Jonathan Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002)., History 101 [+]Mags L. Halliday, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) and panic attacks brought on by the single pulse in his body, but felt that the \"hollow absence\" was the worst of the side effects. (PROSE: Camera Obscura [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) He thought that losing his heart to Sabbath was his \"biggest regret\". (PROSE: Anachrophobia [+]Jonathan Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) Though he eventually regrew a second heart after Sabbath removed the original from himself, (PROSE: Camera Obscura [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002)., Time Zero [+]Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) Fitz noticed that its long absence had left a change in the Doctor. (PROSE: Reckless Engineering [+]Nick Walters, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003).) After Miranda's death, (PROSE: Sometime Never... [+]Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) the Doctor became angry at anything that reminded him of her, (PROSE: Halflife [+]Mark Michalowski, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) but ultimately chose to move on for the sake of his adopted granddaughter, Zezanne. (PROSE: The Gallifrey Chronicles [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nThough he vowed that he would never travel alone again as he did not want to forget how precious life was after his predecessor's manipulative nature isolated him, (AUDIO: The Resurrection of Mars [+]Jonathan Morris, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) after the deaths of his great-grandson, Alex Campbell, and his companions, Tamsin Drew and Lucie Miller, at the hands of the Daleks, the Doctor decided to travel on his own to limit the deaths that came in his wake. (AUDIO: To the Death [+]Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2011).) Lucie's death left the Doctor in such a state that he went to the end of the universe just to see what would happen. However, he started having hope again after meeting Molly O'Sullivan, (AUDIO: The Great War [+]Nicholas Briggs, Dark Eyes (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2012).) not wanting her killing herself to stop the Daleks' plan because he didn't want to lose anyone else to the Daleks, (AUDIO: X and the Daleks [+]Nicholas Briggs, Dark Eyes (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2012).) though he did get annoyed when he found Molly squatting in his house. (AUDIO: The White Room [+]Alan Barnes, Dark Eyes 2 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2014).) Even after Liv Chenka joined him in his travels, (AUDIO: Time's Horizon [+]Matt Fitton, Dark Eyes 2 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2014).) the Doctor greatly missed Molly when Narvin forced them apart. (AUDIO: A Life in the Day [+]John Dorney, Dark Eyes 4 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2015).)\n\nTowards the end of his life, the Doctor began to reminisce about his adventures with previous companions. (PROSE: The End [+]Alexander Leithes, Short Trips: Life Science (Short Trips short stories, 2004).; AUDIO: Mary's Story [+]Jonathan Morris, The Company of Friends (Main Range, Big Finish Productions, 2009).) He also developed an extreme distaste for war, (COMIC: Music of the Spherions [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) with River Song claiming that the outbreak of the Last Great Time War brought down his optimism and robbed him of the joy in his travels. (AUDIO: Lies in Ruins [+]James Goss, The Legacy of Time (Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nWhile disguised as the Clocksmith on the Crucible of Souls, the Doctor playfully embraced his ego by describing himself as \"a remarkably clever man, [as well as] a force to be reckoned with, [and] handsome, too.\" (AUDIO: The Crucible of Souls [+]John Dorney, Doom Coalition 3 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor remembered his first incarnation as a \"fierce old man\", his second incarnation as a \"gentle little fellow who had sacrificed his own freedom so that others might be free\", his third incarnation as an \"elegant dandy struggling bitterly against the chains of his exile but unable to resist defending the planet that had become his prison\", and his fourth incarnation as a \"casual bohemian\" who \"dared to take on the evil that stalk[ed] the dark\". (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor had no love for the Third Doctor, describing him to Josie Day as having \"no appreciation of art,\" and that he \"spent all his time taking things apart and leaving bits lying about,\" concluding that Josie wouldn't like him. (COMIC: The Pictures of Josephine Day [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) However, he had a fondness for the Fourth Doctor, sharing a lot of his tastes in common, and the two got along easily, (AUDIO: The Light at the End [+]Nicholas Briggs, Big Finish Doctor Who Special Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2013).) though he did not enjoy the idea of seeing his fourth incarnation when George Litefoot brought it up, (PROSE: The Bodysnatchers [+]Mark Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) and still held his hesitation to avert the creation of the Daleks against him. (AUDIO: Blood of the Daleks [+]Steve Lyons, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) Also, while he found the Sixth Doctor obnoxious and embarrassing, he had a great deal of respect for him. (AUDIO: The Light at the End [+]Nicholas Briggs, Big Finish Doctor Who Special Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2013).)\n\nHe viewed his seventh incarnation as a \"terrible old duffer who wouldn't tell [anyone] what was going on, would shout [at someone] as soon as look at [them], would expect [his companions] to be quiet and do what [he] said, and be there to untie [him] in cellars and scream out when [they] saw danger heading [their] way\", (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) and also bemoaned him for his hubris and his arrogant certainty of his prowess and intellect. (AUDIO: Ship in a Bottle [+]John Dorney, Doom Coalition 4 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) He distastefully looked at the Seventh Doctor as being \"a man with the master plan\" working for the \"greater good\" under the belief of the ends justifying the means, unfavourably comparing him to the Monk in that regard, (AUDIO: The Resurrection of Mars [+]Jonathan Morris, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) but believed he could \"barely win a game of snakes and ladders\". (AUDIO: Ship in a Bottle [+]John Dorney, Doom Coalition 4 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) His resentment was such that, when the Curator explained the seeds of the solution to Robin Bright-Thompson's evil were contained within the problem, the Doctor mockingly compared him to their seventh incarnation for being \"meddlesome and cryptic\". (AUDIO: The Keys of Baker Street [+]Roy Gill, Stranded 4 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Stranded, Big Finish Productions, 2022).)\n\nWhen meeting his ninth, tenth and twelfth incarnations, the Eighth Doctor was pleased to see them acting \"as childish as ever.\" (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nThe Doctor had \"intrinsic faith\" in his friends, (PROSE: The Blue Angel [+]Paul Magrs and Jeremy Hoad, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and took their well-being as his primary concern, (COMIC: Perceptions [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (Radio Times, 1996-1997).) almost giving the TARDIS to the Cybermen to protect Stacy Townsend, (COMIC: Dreadnought [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (BBC Magazines, 1996).) helping Izzy adjust to Destrii's body, (COMIC: Beautiful Freak [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2001).) giving up the power of the Time Vortex the second he noticed Destrii needed his help to escape an exploding Cyber-ship, (COMIC: The Flood [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2004-2005).) and stealing the Master's TARDIS to save Liv Chenka and Molly O'Sullivan from the Dalek Time Controller at a Dalek retreat on the Eye of Orion. (AUDIO: Eye of Darkness [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Not wanting to repeat the mistakes of the Seventh Doctor, the Eighth Doctor did not order his companions around. (PROSE: Interference: The Hour of the Geek [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) He still felt regret for giving Katarina hope after taking her away from her home, only for her to be killed shortly afterwards. (AUDIO: The Last [+]Gary Hopkins, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor showcased his love for humanity by admiring how they \"always [saw] patterns in things that [weren't] there\", (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) and how they were \"one of the most adaptable, versatile, [and] adventurous species in the galaxy\", (PROSE: Halflife [+]Mark Michalowski, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) but also was aware that some were \"barbarians\" (PROSE: Dreamstone Moon [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) who \"never lost their inability to learn from their mistakes\", (PROSE: Halflife [+]Mark Michalowski, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) degrading them for heading towards an Ice Warrior ship \"like moths to the flame\", (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) and found a police officer's refusal to believe him as \"typical\". (COMIC: Doctor Who and the Nightmare Game [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003).)\n\nDue to his regeneration \"[shaking] up his molecules so comprehensively that certain aspects of his character had come to the fore that had previously been buried so deeply within him they had seemed virtually nonexistent\", (PROSE: The Bodysnatchers [+]Mark Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) the Eighth Doctor was a romantic at heart, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) though he thought it an \"unpleasant problem\" to fall in love with humans. (PROSE: Legacy of the Daleks [+]John Peel, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) It was during his eighth incarnation that the Doctor began feeling a desire for romance — \"the excitement of being close to someone, the need to exchange ideas on a more personal level, to be able to tell someone what you really believe\". While he told I.M. Foreman it would be unfair to get sexually involved with his companions, (PROSE: Interference: The Hour of the Geek [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) the Doctor shared an experience with Bernice Summerfield, (AUDIO: Benny's Story [+]Lance Parkin, The Company of Friends (Main Range, Big Finish Productions, 2009).) and also proclaimed his love for Charley Pollard, (AUDIO: Neverland [+]Alan Barnes, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) but later claimed that his declaration was merely an urge brought on by his belief that she was about to die when she tried to broach the subject. Although uncomfortable with Charley's \"yearning\" for him, the Doctor did later admit to loving her, but then told her that they couldn't pursue a romantic relationship, opting to remain friends instead. (AUDIO: Scherzo [+]Robert Shearman, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) For a time, Sam Jones had a crush on the Doctor, (PROSE: Longest Day [+]Michael Collier, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998)., Dreamstone Moon [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998)., Seeing I [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) something that he was aware of. (PROSE: Placebo Effect [+]Gary Russell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) Alan Turing likewise developed feelings for the Doctor, (PROSE: The Turing Test [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) who would later recall being \"more than friends\" with Turing. (PROSE: The Domino Effect [+]David Bishop, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003).) During his time in 1951, the Doctor became to desire of Penny, a waitress at the Café des Artistes, with spy Guy Burgess also eyeing him up. (PROSE: Endgame [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) On one occasion, he was described by Daqar Keep as someone who used flattery to deceive. (AUDIO: The Next Life [+]Alan Barnes and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).)\n\nViewing them as \"the worst thing [one] [could] possibly imagine,\" the Doctor saw the Daleks as \"cold, ruthless killers\", (COMIC: Fire and Brimstone [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1997).) believing that they \"[had] no interest in anything but conquest and war,\" with \"art, decoration, poetry, music all [being] irrelevant to them.\" He also had no qualms with killing Daleks with high frequency shock waves. (PROSE: War of the Daleks [+]John Peel, adapted from War of the Daleks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) His hatred of the Daleks escalated after they started to pursue him and Molly through time, (AUDIO: Fugitives [+]Nicholas Briggs, Dark Eyes (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2012).) though he considered a war between the Daleks and the Time Lords to be a ridiculous thought. (AUDIO: Tangled Web [+]Nicholas Briggs, Dark Eyes (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2012).) However, when he thought that the Eminence was a greater threat to the universe, he decided to ally himself with the Dalek Time Controller. (AUDIO: Eyes of the Master [+]Matt Fitton, Dark Eyes 2 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2014).) After their alliance ended, (AUDIO: Time's Horizon [+]Matt Fitton, Dark Eyes 2 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2014).) they resumed their animosity with each other, with the Doctor being particularly angry with the Time Controller's plans to make a New Dalek Paradigm from the artists of Montmartre. (AUDIO: The Monster of Montmartre [+]Matt Fitton, Dark Eyes 4 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2015).)\n\nHe also saw the Cybermen as \"evil, rapacious creatures.\" (COMIC: Dreadnought [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (BBC Magazines, 1996).) During his extended time on Baker Street, the Doctor came to think that a Time Lord was \"a puffed-up name invented by puffed-up people who think, just because they [had] found a way to cheat death, that the universe owe[d] them something.\" (AUDIO: Crossed Lines [+]Matt Fitton, Stranded 4 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Stranded, Big Finish Productions, 2022).)\n\nSam Jones described the Eighth Doctor as a \"hero\" who \"never [did] anything wrong\", (PROSE: Revolution Man [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and Charley Pollard referred to him as \"an unbelievable, impossible, marvellous man.\" (AUDIO: The Fall of the House of Pollard [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Destrii described the Doctor as \"quite the package\" due to him possessing \"brains, buns and barrel-loads of bravado\". (COMIC: Ophidius [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2001).) While Lucie Miller originally took against the Doctor, describing him as a \"patronising git,\" and a \"spineless fish\", (AUDIO: Blood of the Daleks [+]Steve Lyons, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2006)., The Skull of Sobek [+]Marc Platt, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2008).) she claimed that he was \"the best bloke [she'd] ever met\" just before her death. (AUDIO: To the Death [+]Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2011).) Helen Sinclair considered the Doctor to be \"the best man [she'd] ever known,\" (AUDIO: Ship in a Bottle [+]John Dorney, Doom Coalition 4 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2017).) refusing to believe he had committed the atrocities claimed of him by Gemma Houlbrooke. (AUDIO: The Long Way Round [+]John Dorney, Stranded 2 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Stranded, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nThe Doctor's first TARDIS described the Eighth Doctor as \"the idealist\". (AUDIO: Prisoners of Fate [+]Jonathan Morris, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2013).) While the \"Katy Manning\" Iris called him a \"dilettante fop\", Jo Grant thought he was \"very dashing\". (AUDIO: The Elixir of Doom [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Evelyn Smythe observed that the Eighth Doctor looked \"charming and relaxed\" when watching two versions of him from afar, telling the Sixth Doctor that his future incarnation looked as if he had all the time in the world. (AUDIO: The 100 Days of the Doctor [+]Paul Cornell, 100 (Main Range, Big Finish Productions, 2007).)\n\nJacob Hynes believed that, \"despite his weird nineteenth-century costume, [the Doctor] had the air of a man from the Golden Age\". (PROSE: Genocide [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) Upon staring into the Doctor's eyes, Daniel O'Ryan saw \"the alienness of [the] so often warm and human-seeming [Doctor].\" (PROSE: Dreamstone Moon [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) A Kulan assumed the Doctor to be \"some sort of congenital idiot\". (PROSE: Escape Velocity [+]Colin Brake, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) The Headhunter, though initially calling the Doctor a \"puffed-up, contrary little oik\", begrudgingly admitted the universe could not do without him. (AUDIO: Orbis [+]Alan Barnes and Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2009).) The Monk considered the Doctor a \"Gallifreyan flunky\" and expressed relief at him not being a \"hypocrite\". (AUDIO: The Resurrection of Mars [+]Jonathan Morris, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) Caleera criticised the Doctor for being \"a rogue [and] a renegade\" who had shirked the responsibilities she believed were inherent to all Time Lords. (AUDIO: The Sonomancer [+]Matt Fitton, Doom Coalition 2 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2016).) When he had a tarot card reading, the Eighth Doctor was identified as \"the Magician\". (PROSE: The City of the Dead [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nBy his own admittance, the Doctor \"mustn't\" think about death, (PROSE: Longest Day [+]Michael Collier, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) and wished to die alone. (AUDIO: Scherzo [+]Robert Shearman, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) Unafraid to die due to having \"died many times before\", the Doctor could think of no better epitaph than to have inspired others to hold back death and go forward in all their beliefs. (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) When faced with execution, the Doctor confided in Izzy that one of his few regrets was being unable to show her more of the universe's wonders. (COMIC: By Hook or By Crook [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Marvel Comics UK, 1997).) When he though he felt a regeneration coming, he likened the feeling to \"a caterpillar wrapping itself in a chrysalis\". (PROSE: Fear Itself [+]Nick Wallace, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nWhen the Eighth Doctor met his demise, he had been thoroughly broken by the breakout of the Time War, to the point that he decided to remain onboard a crashing spaceship, pleading with Cass Fermazzi to put aside her hatred of the Time Lords for him to save her. When it ended in failure, the Doctor died in the crash, having lost the will to regenerate until the Sisterhood of Karn temporarily restored him to life. Though he continued to refuse joining the Time War, seeing Cass' lifeless body caused the Doctor to finally lose all hope, claim her bandolier and abandon the title of \"Doctor\" with extreme disparity after being coaxed by Ohila to embrace his regeneration into a warrior, expressing bitter delight when informed the change would hurt him. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) Thinking back to times he was not alone to comfort himself, (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018). the Doctor saluted his past companions, and apologised to Cass, before drinking the Elixir. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nIn an account where he fought to the very end of the Time War, the Doctor was driven to destroy the Time Lords and the Daleks with the Moment, and feared he had \"fixed\" his existence by using the Moment, though was content to permanently die. As he found comfort in being \"home\" in the TARDIS, the Doctor found that the Restoration had reset his life-cycle, enabling him to regenerate. While he first thought that \"last words [were] useless\", as he began to regenerate, the Doctor spoke his final words aloud. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Time War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor made a habit of randomly kissing or getting kissed by others, such as Grace Holloway, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) Bernice Summerfield, (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).)

(AUDIO: Scherzo [+]Robert Shearman, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).) He also kissed Anji Kapoor when she and him were possessed by the spirits of Hanstrum and Elizabethan. (PROSE: EarthWorld [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) Much to Charley's annoyance, the Doctor himself had a penchant for platonically kissing people on the lips when excited. (AUDIO: Enemy Aliens [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nBecause he was a Time Lord, (PROSE: The Queen of Eros [+]Trevor Baxendale, Short Trips and Side Steps (Short Trips short stories, 2000).) the Doctor occasional had \"flashes\" of people's future, (PROSE: Dominion [+]Nick Walters, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., The Shadows of Avalon [+]Paul Cornell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) and made a habit of giving people hints about their future, while not expressing outright the nature of that future, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).; PROSE: The Bodysnatchers [+]Mark Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997)., Option Lock [+]Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998)., Placebo Effect [+]Gary Russell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998)., Timeless [+]Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003).; AUDIO: The Stones of Venice [+]Paul Magrs, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).) though he dropped this habit after Grace called him out on being cryptic about her future (COMIC: The Fallen [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 1998-1999).) and to respect the privacy of his friends' futures. (AUDIO: Hooklight [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He could also see into someone's past, at least in the case of Guy Adams. (PROSE: Timeless [+]Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003).)\n\nOften repeating himself due to his enthusiasms, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) the Eighth Doctor was unafraid to raise his voice when he needed to be heard or was unable to contain his emotions, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996)., The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) though his voice would turn \"icy\" when he was taking authority over someone. (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) He would often lean towards making a sarcastic quip, especially when in the company of Lucie Miller, leading her to nickname him \"Sarcasmo\". (AUDIO: The Vengeance of Morbius [+]Nicholas Briggs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2008).)\n\nHe would often utter, \"blazes\", when annoyed or surprised, (COMIC: The Fallen [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 1998-1999)., The Company of Thieves [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (1999)., The Glorious Dead [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2000)., Ophidius [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2001)., Beautiful Freak [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2001)., The Land of Happy Endings [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2003).) and was also known to say \"good grief\".

McIntee, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).; AUDIO: Fugitives [+]Nicholas Briggs, Dark Eyes (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2012).) steal a space shuttle, (PROSE: Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) drive a motorbike with a sidecar, (PROSE: EarthWorld [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) drive a tractor, (PROSE: Eater of Wasps [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) fly a Mobox flyer, (COMIC: Uroboros [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2002).) pilot a lifeboat, (PROSE: Rip Tide [+]Louise Cooper, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).) commandeer a bus, (COMIC: Doctor Who and the Nightmare Game [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003).) and pilot and land an Overseer craft with no prior experience. (COMIC: The Body Politic [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) He could also ride a horse and a dragon unaided. (PROSE: The Shadows of Avalon [+]Paul Cornell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).; COMIC: Bad Blood [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003-2004).)\n\nThe Doctor was also an accomplished chef, making cocoa for Benny and the Brigadier, (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) cooking an English breakfast on board Iris Wildthyme' bus, (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) stress-baking a Lady Baltimore cake with \"very complicated icing\", (PROSE: Camera Obscura [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) making a massive picnic for his friends, holding several dinner parties in his flat on Hitchemus, (PROSE: The Year of Intelligent Tigers [+]Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) and cooked baked salmon with a classic English parsley sauce for the McKeown family. (PROSE: The Deadstone Memorial [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) However, his attempt to make ratatouille once threatened to cause a devastating fire. (AUDIO: Wild Animals [+]John Dorney, Stranded 1 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Stranded, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nThe Doctor could sing in Italian, and sing the Venusian lullaby, (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997)., Longest Day [+]Michael Collier, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) speak Esperanto, (PROSE: Legacy of the Daleks [+]John Peel, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) Martian, (PROSE: Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) and Russian, (AUDIO: The Natural History of Fear [+]Jim Mortimore, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) and sign in the language of the Delphon. (PROSE: Beltempest [+]Jim Mortimore, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) He also claimed to be skilled in speaking the \"local patter.\" (AUDIO: Invaders from Mars [+]Mark Gatiss, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).)\n\nThe Doctor could deduce his location by studying his surroundings, (AUDIO: Mary's Story [+]Jonathan Morris, The Company of Friends (Main Range, Big Finish Productions, 2009).) and how fast a spaceship was travelling by feeling its vibrations. (AUDIO: Sword of Orion [+]Nicholas Briggs, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).)\n\nBeing a Time Lord, the Doctor could will his respiration, heartbeat, brain activity, lindal gland, and reflex response systems to shut down, though he would require a few days to fully recover to full strength afterwards. (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) He could also sense fissures in time, (AUDIO: Benny's Story [+]Lance Parkin, The Company of Friends (Main Range, Big Finish Productions, 2009).) and will his hearts to shut down (AUDIO: Death in Blackpool [+]Alan Barnes, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2009).) as well as half of his body. (AUDIO: Nevermore [+]Alan Barnes, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2010).)\n\nHe could imitate others' voices, (PROSE: Dominion [+]Nick Walters, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) juggle, (PROSE: EarthWorld [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) escape handcuffs with ease, (PROSE: Trading Futures [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) and stitch up his clothing. (PROSE: Fallen Gods [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).) He also admitted to being an \"inveterate doodler\". (AUDIO: World of Damnation [+]Matt Fitton, Ravenous 1 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Ravenous, Big Finish Productions, 2018).) However, he was not good at playing video games, finding them easy at the beginning, then increasingly difficult as the consequences of his errors piled up. (AUDIO: What Just Happened? [+]John Dorney, Stranded 3 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Stranded, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nThe Doctor had an eidetic memory, (PROSE: Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) and was able to remember all the Liverpool F.C. strikers and goals from 1964-1965 and 2013-2014, (AUDIO: The Next Life [+]Alan Barnes and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) as well as the inspirational fifth victory of European Cup by Liverpool's football club in 2005. (AUDIO: Something Inside [+]Trevor Baxendale, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nUpon meeting the Eighth Doctor, Bernice Summerfield thought \"his long face was angular, with a jutting chin and aristocratic nose, but it was softened by a mass of dark brown hair that swept back down all the way from his high forehead to his broad shoulders\". (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) He weighed approximately 180 pounds, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) and was ambidextrous. (PROSE: The Turing Test [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) It was claimed that he smelled of \"sandalwood\", (PROSE: Dominion [+]Nick Walters, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) \"old exitronic circuitry\", (PROSE: The Taking of Planet 5 [+]Simon Bucher-Jones and Mark Clapham, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and honey. (AUDIO: Seasons of Fear [+]Paul Cornell and Caroline Symcox, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) He initially looked like a man that Grace Holloway thought was in his mid-thirties, (PROSE: The Novel of the Film [+]Gary Russell, adapted from Doctor Who (Matthew Jacobs), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 1996).) but Lucie Miller described him as looking like he was in his forties when they met. (AUDIO: Blood of the Daleks [+]Steve Lyons, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor had blue eyes after he regenerated. (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) However, due to Faction Paradox interfering with his biodata, his eye colour was changed to green, (PROSE: Alien Bodies [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) before reverting to blue after the majority of Faction Paradox was erased from the timeline. (PROSE: The Ancestor Cell [+]Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).) During his travels with Mary Shelley, his eyes were ice blue, the left eye being slightly darker than the right. (AUDIO: The Silver Turk [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) When asked about where he came from, the Doctor's eye colour would change between grey and blue, (PROSE: Mad Dogs and Englishmen [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).) and they sometimes appeared as brown. (COMIC: A Matter of Life and Death [+]George Mann, Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) When discussing it, Adrienne Kramer and Carolyn McConnell were unable to agree on what colour the Doctor's eye were. (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).)\n\nHe once wore blue eye-shadow, (PROSE: Growing Higher [+]Paul Leonard, Short Trips: Zodiac (Short Trips, 2002).) and had a tattoo of a man transforming into a jaguar. (PROSE: The City of the Dead [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nAs the Time War reached its height, the Doctor's face showed prominent crow's feet and some wrinkling as a result of his fatigue. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nCarolyn McConnell described the Eighth Doctor as \"tall, dark, [and] handsome\", (PROSE: Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) with Constance Clarke also finding him attractive. (AUDIO: The End of the Beginning [+]Robert Valentine, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2021).) Coldicott, in comparisons to his other incarnations, described the Eighth Doctor as \"the Young Edwardian version\". (PROSE: Interference: Shock Tactic [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) While experiencing a high brought on by an overdose of Dextro-7, Audacity Montague compared the Eighth Doctor to a sad uncle who had taken something he shouldn't. (AUDIO: The Gloaming [+]Lauren Mooney and Stewart Pringle, Deadly Strangers (Big Finish Productions, 2024).)\n\nThe First Doctor described his eighth incarnation as the \"younger, handsome one, with hair dangling to his shoulders\". (PROSE: Five Card Draw [+]Todd Green, Short Trips: Zodiac (Short Trips, 2002).)\n\nThe Doctor had long, wavy hair after his regeneration, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) but, after falling in the ocean at Dunkirk, he had his wavy hair cut short. (AUDIO: Fugitives [+]Nicholas Briggs, Dark Eyes (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2012).) He later grew it out so that he again had curls. (AUDIO: The Eleven [+]Matt Fitton, Doom Coalition 1 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2015)., The Gift [+]Marc Platt, Doom Coalition 2 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nTowards the end of his life, the Doctor's hair started to go grey, (PROSE: Father Time [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001)., Not in My Back Yard [+]Eddie Robson, Short Trips: The History of Christmas (Short Trips short stories, 2005)., DS Al Fine [+]Simon Guerrier, Short Trips: Time Signature (Short Trips short stories, 2006).) and, after cutting his hair again, (PROSE: Natural Regression [+]Justin Richards, The Scientific Secrets of Doctor Who (2015).) he had regained enough length to form messy curls drooping over his forehead. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nHe grew a beard shortly before his wedding to Scarlette, (PROSE: The Adventuress of Henrietta Street [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) but later shaved it. (PROSE: Hope [+]Mark Clapham, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).)\n\nAfter walking around with a white sheet following his regeneration, the Doctor stole a Wild Bill Hickok costume from Ted Kriechel's locker at Walker General Hospital. Though he discarded the cap and gunbelt, he kept the double-breasted frock coat made from forest green velvet with peaked lapels, double breasted waistcoat of silver grey paisley with 10 gold buttons and a shawl collar, golden fob watch, white dress shirt with a high collar, battleship grey cravat with a bronze pin, and moss green trousers. After walking around the hospital barefoot, he was given a pair of black ankle boots by Grace Holloway that originally belonged to her ex-boyfriend, Brian. (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) He also took to wearing question mark-fashioned boxer shorts, (PROSE: Seeing I [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).; COMIC: The Glorious Dead [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2000).) and would occasionally discard the cravat and leave his top buttons undone. (COMIC: Uroboros [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2002)., Doctor Who and the Nightmare Game [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003)., The Land of Happy Endings [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2003).) The Doctor had replacement jackets, (PROSE: The Bodysnatchers [+]Mark Morris, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) made for him by a tailor on Savile Row in 1892. (PROSE: Genocide [+]Paul Leonard, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997)., Seeing I [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).)\n\nThe Doctor varied the colour scheme of his costume, such as wearing a navy blue frock coat, a violet purple waistcoat, an indigo cravat, mauve trousers, (COMIC: Dreadnought [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (BBC Magazines, 1996).) a plum purple cravat, (COMIC: Descendance [+]Gary Russell, Radio Times comic stories (Radio Times, 1996).) an amber cravat, a hunter green frock coat, (AUDIO: Storm Warning [+]Alan Barnes, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).) an olive green frock coat, a cream waistcoat (COMIC: Ophidius [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (2001).) a gold cravat, an ochre waistcoat, (AUDIO: The Stones of Venice [+]Paul Magrs, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).) a lime green waistcoat, (AUDIO: Caerdroia [+]Lloyd Rose, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) sapphire blue trousers, (AUDIO: Time Works [+]Steve Lyons, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) fern green trousers, (AUDIO: Absolution [+]Scott Alan Woodard, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2007).) a jade green waistcoat, (AUDIO: The Battle of Giant's Causeway [+]Lizzie Hopley, Sontarans vs Rutans (Big Finish Productions, 2024).) a burnt orange waistcoat, (AUDIO: Audacity [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) a burgundy cravat, and a maroon waistcoat. (AUDIO: Twenty-Four Doors in December [+]John Dorney, In the Bleak Midwinter (Big Finish Productions, 2023).)\n\nImmediately following the War in Heaven, the Doctor began to wear a shirt and trousers, but felt that they did not suit him, and soon changed back into his Wild Bill Hickok clothes. (PROSE: The Burning [+]Justin Richards, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nDuring his travels with Fitz and Trix, (PROSE: We Can't Stop What's Coming [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor took on another outfit that was more rugged and unkempt than his Wild Bill outfit, (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) which the War Doctor described as being \"swashbuckling\". (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018). The look consisted of a double-breasted overcoat of moleskin with peaked lapels coloured in either bottle green (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) or Prussian blue; (AUDIO: He Kills Me, He Kills Me Not [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) with a single-breasted waistcoat, with a gold fob, watch done in bronze brown brocade, (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) mustard yellow velvet, (COMIC: The Pictures of Josephine Day [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) wine brocade, (AUDIO: He Kills Me, He Kills Me Not [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) or vermillion brocade. (AUDIO: Meanwhile, Elsewhere [+]Tim Foley, Cass (The Eighth Doctor: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2023).) In place of a cravat, he wore an ascot tie of dupioni done in midnight blue, (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) flaxen yellow, (COMIC: The Pictures of Josephine Day [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) eggplant purple, (COMIC: A Matter of Life and Death [+]George Mann, Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) dark teal, (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) azure blue, (AUDIO: Cass [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) or ebony black. (AUDIO: Meanwhile, Elsewhere [+]Tim Foley, Cass (The Eighth Doctor: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2023).) He left the points of the shirt's collar drooped across his shoulders as he left it open-necked and wore the ascot crookedly on his own naked neck. He also sported wrinkled tan trousers haphazardly secured by a slouching belt only buckled by an S-link chain, with a pair of caramel brown British Army Calvary boots with a set of matching gaiters of gingerbread leather strapped across his shins, all of which were loosely laced and knotted improperly. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) After a period of wearing his Wild Bill Hickok costume, (PROSE: Ghost of Christmas Past [+]Scott Handcock, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).) the Doctor continued to wear his swashbuckling outfit throughout the Time War and to the end of his life, the clothes growing battered and frayed from action and abuse. (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAfter ruining his clothes during World War I, the Doctor began wearing an alabaster t-shirt under a double-breasted peacoat of navy blue leather with anchor symbols three golden buttons, with dark blue jeans and sandy-brown trainers. He also took to carrying a mahogany brown satchel, wearing the single strap over his left (AUDIO: Fugitives [+]Nicholas Briggs, Dark Eyes (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Dark Eyes, Big Finish Productions, 2012).) or right shoulder. (AUDIO: The Eleven [+]Matt Fitton, Doom Coalition 1 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2015).)\n\nWhen bathing, the Doctor would wear a baggy, all-in-one, stripy outfit. (PROSE: Kursaal [+]Peter Anghelides, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).)\n\nDuring his holidays, the Doctor wore long shorts and a straw cap in Egypt, (COMIC: The Power of Thoueris! [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003).) a black tie and top cap with his blue coat and yellow-grey double-breasted waistcoat in Victorian London, (COMIC: The Curious Tale of Spring-Heeled Jack [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003).) and a black leather duster coat, a cream neckerchief, with a stetson cap, boots and gloves in America. (COMIC: Bad Blood [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003-2004).)\n\nHe also owned a black velvet coat (PROSE: Vanishing Point [+]Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) that he won in a bet with a member of Faction Paradox. (PROSE: The Book of the War [+]Lawrence Miles, et al., Faction Paradox novels (Mad Norwegian Press, 2002).) He wore this coat with a green waistcoat and boots in Marpling in 1933. (PROSE: Eater of Wasps [+]Trevor Baxendale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) After having his clothes ruined in the Slow Empire, the Doctor put on a dark suit and a greatcoat. (PROSE: The Slow Empire [+]Dave Stone, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nWhile forcibly recruited by Kim Philby in 1951 during his amnesic \"exile\", the Doctor wore an old brown corduroy suit, but soon changed into a brown checked sports jacket, grey flannel trousers and an old cloth cap, before again changing into a dark suit, white shirt and tie, with a bowler hat and an umbrella. (PROSE: Endgame [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nWhen the Doctor first arrived on Hitchemus, he wore a dark brown frock coat with metallic green highlights, buff flannel trousers, low-heeled boots and a grey silk cravat. He later wore a loose white shirt over hemp trousers and a black waistcoat embroidered with orange designs. (PROSE: The Year of Intelligent Tigers [+]Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nIn New Orleans, he wore a dark shirt and trousers with a dove grey coat made out of an alien synthetic, (PROSE: The City of the Dead [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) and changed into a dark red coat and shorts whilst in Barcelona. (PROSE: History 101 [+]Mags L. Halliday, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).)\n\nWhile visiting a village on the Cornish coast in 2003, the Doctor dressed in a loose cotton shirt and trousers, with a floppy white sun-hat, but later changed into a white shirt and jeans. (PROSE: Rip Tide [+]Louise Cooper, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).) While in India, he wore a grey homburg cap with scarlet trousers, stout boots and a linen jacket. (PROSE: The Eye of the Tyger [+]Paul McAuley, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).)\n\nWhile infiltrating Hulbert Logistics as a new member of the board, the Doctor wore a blue suit he found in a wardrobe. (AUDIO: Human Resources [+]Eddie Robson, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2007).)\n\nOccasionally, the Doctor wore a top hat, (COMIC: The Curious Tale of Spring-Heeled Jack [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003).; AUDIO: Other Lives [+]Gary Hopkins, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) and, along with Fitz, once wore wide-brimmed hats. (PROSE: Camera Obscura [+]Lloyd Rose, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).)\n\nWhen intending to travel to Egypt, the Doctor wore a fez so he could fit in with the locals. (COMIC: Doctor Who and the Nightmare Game [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2003).)\n\nDuring the early hours of his life, the Eighth Doctor remarked that he was half-human on his mother's side, a statement that was reaffirmed by the Bruce Master when he saw the Doctor's retinal structure, (TV: Doctor Who [+]Matthew Jacobs, Doctor Who Television Movie (Fox Broadcasting Company, 1996).) though one source claimed the Eighth Doctor had been made to believe he was half-human due to the Seventh Doctor using a Chameleon Arch for a plan to trick the Master. (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).) However, the Doctor would affirm several times that he was indeed half-human. (PROSE: Alien Bodies [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997)., The Infinity Doctors [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Books (1998)., Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., The Shadows of Avalon [+]Paul Cornell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000)., Grimm Reality [+]Simon Bucher-Jones and Kelly Hale, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).; COMIC: The Fallen [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 1998-1999).)\n\nSince his past was being rewritten simultaneously by the Faction Paradox, the Matrix Rassilon, the Enemy, (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) the Doctor had memories of both being loomed and having parents. (PROSE: The Shadows of Avalon [+]Paul Cornell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000)., Autumn Mist [+]David A. McIntee, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) Patriarchal psychic river jellyfish-like creatures on the planet Hyspero once told him that he only thought he had a human mother, having actually been loomed in reality. (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress [+]Paul Magrs, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).) Later, it was suggested the Doctor subconsciously made himself half-human in order to better experience life and reject the Seventh Doctor's role as Time's Champion. (PROSE: The Blue Angel [+]Paul Magrs and Jeremy Hoad, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) Changes made to his biodata such as this would have rewritten his history, (PROSE: Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) with Flavia mentioning the Eighth Doctor's heritage from \"his mother's side\" in her book Tales from the Matrix - True Stories from TARDIS Logs Retold for Time Tots. (PROSE: Apocrypha Bipedium [+]Ian Potter, Short Trips: Companions (Short Trips, 2003).)\n\nRichard Griffiths, who once expressed interest in playing the Fifth Doctor before having to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts, was the BBC's top choice to play the Eighth Doctor, had the show continued after 1989. He was later approached for the role of the Eighth Doctor in the TV movie, but was unavailable. Ian Richardson was also a popular choice for the proposed Eighth Doctor. In the early 1990s, Verity Lambert was approached by the BBC to revive the series, with her choice for a new Doctor at the time being Peter Cook, but she eventually declined involvement.\n\nTim Curry was the first choice for role and expressed interest in the part, as he was keen to take on a character that wasn't a villain, but he turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with Muppet Treasure Island.\n\nPhilip Segal had discussions with both Michael Crawford and Michael Palin about playing the role.\n\nChristopher Bowen, Liam Cunningham, Anthony Head, Robert Lindsay, Mark McGann, Tim McInnerny, Nathaniel Parker, John Sessions, Tony Slattery and Peter Woodward all auditioned for the role. Cunningham was deemed the favourite, but he was unavailable.\n\nHarry Van Gorkum came close to being cast and met with the approval of Fox and Universal but was vetoed by the BBC.[1]\n\nFuture Doctor actors Christopher Eccleston and Peter Capaldi were offered the chance to audition for the role, but both declined.[2]\n\nOther candidates included Rowan Atkinson, Chris Barrie, Sean Bean, Jeremy Brett, Jim Broadbent, Pierce Brosnan, Simon Callow, Martin Clunes, Robbie Coltrane, Billy Connolly, Russell Crowe, Timothy Dalton, Alan Davies, Alexis Denisof, Trevor Eve, Rupert Everett, Ralph Fiennes, Matt Frewer, Jeff Goldblum, Hugh Grant, Richard E Grant, Rutger Hauer, John Hurt, Eric Idle, Chris Isaak, Derek Jacobi, Ben Kingsley, Hugh Laurie, Kyle MacLachlan, Ian McKellen, Rik Mayall, Alfred Molina, Eddie Murphy, Sam Neill, Peter O'Toole, Jonathan Pryce, Aidan Quinn, Julian Sands, Gary Sinise, Patrick Stewart, Donald Sutherland, Arnold Vosloo, David Warner and Peter Weller.[3]\n\nBoth Fox and Univeral Studios wanted a big name star in the role. Their three top choices were Tom Hanks, Harrison Ford, and Jim Carrey, all three of whom turned it down. Hanks felt that an American playing the role would not do the show's legacy any justice, Ford didn't want to work in television and Carrey felt it would cause outrage amongst fans if the role was played by someone who wasn't a fan of the classic series.\n\nAlthough the Eighth Doctor only appeared onscreen once before his replacement by Christopher Eccleston's Ninth Doctor, he was the de facto \"current Doctor\" from 1996 to 2005, and naturally became the focus of attention in all non-televised media, including a nine-year tenure as the star of the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip, an eight-year 73-book novel series, and, beginning in 2001, regular releases from Big Finish Productions.\n\nIndeed, the Big Finish situation was particularly favourable to McGann, as their license with the British Broadcasting Corporation at the time did not allow them to use any incarnations of the Doctor who originated from BBC Wales series. Consequently, McGann was their \"current\" Doctor, and effectively made the \"first amongst equals,\" with his adventures treated as ongoing, and eventually giving him his own series. Unlike the other Doctors, most of his Big Finish releases were deliberately organised into \"seasons\" and his annual output was typically greater than that afforded to the others.\n\nHis adventures with Lucie Miller received far greater exposure than any of Big Finish's prior output, due to the fact that they were commissioned by BBC Radio and employed Sheridan Smith, an actor who already had a following from her work in mainstream British comedy. Four series were made in all, with most stories eventually being broadcast on radio and the internet. Given that the web broadcasts were not region locked, they had the potential to reach the most people worldwide of any performed Doctor Who adventures ever made.\n\nThe Eighth Doctor's adventures after the TV movie took place across three different branches of media: comics in the form of the Doctor Who Magazine and Radio Times comic strips, prose in the form of a Virgin New Adventures novel, the BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures and a BBC Past Doctor Adventures novel, and audio adventures from the Big Finish series. The continuity between these three separate mediums, however, remains complicated to integrate.\n\nThe second BBC Books novel Vampire Science [+]Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997). established that the Doctor left his companion, Sam Jones, at a rally for a few hours from her perspective while he travelled for approximately one year without her. The stories The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997). and the Radio Times comic strips were all referenced within the novels as taking place during this gap.\n\nBig Finish Productions' Eighth Doctor stories, which were published after the start of the EDAs in 2001, initially made subtle references to the continuity of the books, including a reference in Minuet in Hell [+]Alan W. Lear and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001). to a companion named Sam. This approach suddenly changed with Zagreus [+]Alan Barnes and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003)., which placed the other ranges in alternate universes, only converging with this one on occasion, and later going so far as to make the Minuet reference uncertain by retroactively inserting a new companion called Samson. However, later audios The Next Life [+]Alan Barnes and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004). and The Zygon Who Fell to Earth [+]Paul Magrs, Eighth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2008). made references to the events of the DWM strips and the EDAs, respectively.\n\nThe 2009 audio Mary's Story [+]Jonathan Morris, The Company of Friends (Main Range, Big Finish Productions, 2009). offered some detail on the extent of these convergences, depicting a \"future\" Eighth Doctor directly referring to comic strip and novel companions. Going through a list of his previous companions in chronological order, he places novel companions before audio ones. However, the comic strip companion Destrii was later mentioned separately to the others, still leaving the placement of the comic strips in relation to the EDAs uncertain. In addition, the anthology The Company of Friends [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW. contained the stories Fitz's Story [+]Stephen Cole, The Company of Friends (Main Range, Big Finish Productions, 2009). and Izzy's Story [+]Alan Barnes, The Company of Friends (Main Range, Big Finish Productions, 2009)., firmly establishing the books and comics as part of the same continuity as Big Finish's releases.\n\nHowever, there are many cases where the significant contradictions in the Eighth Doctor's media were embraced by the continuity of the BBC Books. Throughout their encounters in the novels, Faction Paradox often altered the Doctor's history, or at the very least his perception of it. Lance Parkin's The Infinity Doctors [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Books (1998)., while supposedly set in an alternate universe, featured many important lore connections with the BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures, subtly proving Omega's belief in the novel that contradictions and alternate timelines still coexisted with their opposites and melded together in a single universe. Kate Orman and Jon Blum's Unnatural History [+]Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999)., a spiritual successor to Parkin's novel, showed that all of the Doctor's conflicting origins and adventures exist in differing degrees of temporary priority within strands of his biodata. In Lance Parkin's The Gallifrey Chronicles [+]Lance Parkin, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2005)., the Time Lord Marnal established that the Eighth Doctor's life was so tangled due to paradox and temporal manipulations that no one could make sense of it. Many of these stories, intentionally or not, managed to make the concept of the Eighth Doctor's inherent media contradictions part of his narrative.",
