  "content": "Starting her adventures by falling to Sheffield in time to save Ryan Sinclair, Yaz Khan and Graham and Grace O'Brien from the Stenza Tzim-Sha, though unable to prevent Grace being killed by a Gathering coil, the Doctor accidently brought Graham, Yaz and Ryan along with her as she searched for her TARDIS (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) on Desolation, and made it a priority to return them home once she found her ship, (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) though they ended taking many detours, such as one where they had to protect Rosa Parks from the time-traveling racist Krasko. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) However, these detours endured them to TARDIS travel, and they elected to join her official after they made it home, with the Doctor calling them Team TARDIS and considering them her \"fam\". (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Wanting to show them the wonders of the universe, (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) the Doctor took them to places such as the Partition of India, (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Kerb!am warehouse (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and 17th century Lancashire, (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) with an encounter with the Solitract in Norway strengthening the familiar bond between Graham and Ryan, (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and rematch with Tzim-Sha giving them closure over Grace's death. (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nAfter helping Ryan make peace with his wayward father while fighting off the Reconnaissance Dalek, (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) Team TARDIS enjoyed a series of carefree travels that saw them come against the Hoarder and Stilean flesh eaters with the Time Agency, (COMIC: A New Beginning [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2018-2019)., Hidden Human History [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and become acquainted with the Sixth Corsair. (COMIC: Old Friends [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThese carefree travels came to end, however, with the arrival of the Spy Master, who teased a secret to the Doctor after he caused the second documented destruction of Gallifrey. (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) As she processed her home being lost again, the Doctor encountered the Fugitive Doctor for the first time (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) since her mind was wiped by the Division, a secretive organisation founded on Gallifrey, cluing her into a secret history predating her alleged first incarnation. As her history began to unravel, the Doctor was finally told the truth by the Master when they reunited on the ravaged Gallifrey during the Doctor's chase of the Lone Cyberman. The Master told the Doctor she had once been the Timeless Child, found by Tecteun, the Other of the Founders of Gallifrey, who had experimented on the Child to uncover the secrets of regeneration before handing them over to the Division. Separating herself from her friends to protect them from the Master, the Doctor was imprisoned in a Judoon prison before she could fully digest what she had learned about the Timeless Child. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nAfter she was rescued by Jack Harkness, the Doctor returned to her friends, but arrived ten months after they last saw her, and Graham and Ryan decided to continue with their lives on Earth, while Yaz decided to continue her adventures with the Doctor, having had trouble readjusting to a normal life after being fully immersed in the Doctor's world. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) Though she treated Yaz as her co-pilot, the Doctor kept her in the dark as she tried to find evidence of the Division to get answers regarding her stolen memories.\n\nAfter finding a lead in the Lupar Karvanista, the Doctor and Yaz pursued him to Earth as he went to collect Dan Lewis, the human he was species-bonded too, in order to protect him from the Flux, a force which would take apart the very structure of the cosmos, bringing about the end of the universe. (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nWith old foes resurfacing from a past forgotten and remembered, the Doctor and Yaz, joined by Dan, forged alliances with new and old friends in order to bring an end to the Flux, (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021)., Village of the Angels [+]Chris Chibnall and Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) which culminated in the Doctor finding Tecteun in the gap between universes, where she found her stolen memories within a Biodata module and learnt that the Division, led by Tecteun, had unleashed the Flux to destroy the universe as they prepared to leave for \"Universe Two\". However, Tecteun was swiftly killed by the Ravagers (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) and, as the Doctor's allies neutralised the Flux, they brought her before the personification of Time, who disintegrated them for their failure and allowed the Doctor to leave, but warned her of her looming fate. (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nNow knowing her end was nearing, (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) the Doctor contemplated her feelings for Yaz as they escaped the likes of Dalek Executioners (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) and Sea Devils, until they talked over their feelings for each other, electing to maintain their platonic friendship after realising a romantic relationship wouldn't last, (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) with the Doctor ultimately forced to regenerate by the Master in a plot to take over her body, though Yaz was able to reverse the regeneration and bring the Doctor back. However, the Master, unable to accept defeat, fatally wounded the Doctor using the energy beam of a Qurunx, and she regenerated into her next incarnation after amicably parting ways with Yaz. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nIn a potential future, the Doctor found herself trapped inside the Catastrophia. Due to the Catastrophia's warped temporal laws, the Doctor's timeline was split into two outcomes; One where she never escaped and become the Herald due to losing her mind, and another where she took shelter inside the logic cube and became the Sanity. (COMIC: Herald of Madness [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., Mistress of Chaos [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn the aborted timeline, the Saxon Master killed the Doctor by throwing her into the heart of a star, after she escaped from being shackled in its orbit. (AUDIO: Masterful [+]James Goss, Masterful (audio anthology) (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nAfter the Security Drone Incident, (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) Dan Lewis was read a horoscope by his friend which foretold many things that all came true, such as the letter D being important and thirteen being his lucky number. (TV: Welcome to the TARDIS... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nPlayful to the end, (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) the Thirteenth Doctor was a kid at heart, (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) looking for even the most mundane ways to have fun in the universe, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) having \"never been a fan of growing up\". (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) Though she enjoyed having many friends, (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) and disliked being alone, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) the Doctor was wary about getting attached due to knowing the pain that came with endings. (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nInfluenced by the parting words of the Twelfth Doctor, (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) the Thirteenth Doctor was more invested in the personal welfare of others, (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) taking the time to remember their names upon meeting them as a show of friendship, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and encourage them to overcome their challenges. (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) However, being the \"private type\", (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) she was evasive with her friends when questioned about her past and motives, (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021)., Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) having \"so much [she] want[ed] to forget\" about her past, (AUDIO: Vampire Weekend [+]Tim Foley, The Thirteenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2025).) especially following the death of Grace O'Brien, whom she had been more open with. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) Indeed, when her friends weren't around, or the situation became too dire, the Doctor could become cold and intimidating. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018). Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) She was also displeased to be reminded of being an outcast, (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and emphasised with Nikola Tesla for feeling \"out of place\" among other people. (TV: Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nFeeling \"a duty to others [that] might be in trouble\", (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) the Doctor would be drawn to those that appeared in distress to offer a helping hand, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) making it a priority to save everyone she could that was in danger, including people she had either only just met or never met at all, even if it was detrimental to her stopping larger issues, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021)., The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) seeing everyone in the universe as her family. (WC: Message from the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).) She frequently put herself between her friends and danger, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and would do her best to ensure that she was alone when taking risks to prevent harm befalling a bystander or to keep track of those under her protection. (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Village of the Angels [+]Chris Chibnall and Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nWhile she thought endless happiness was \"meaningless\" and \"fake\", (COMIC: The Everlasting Summer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor felt discomfort when put in a situation where she could only be unhappy, (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018). The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021)., The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) and tried to hide her negative emotions by shutting down when faced with hard questions or serious conversations, (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021)., Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) making her come across as emotionally distant. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) However, she tried to avoid focusing on negatives to not \"kill the vibe\", (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and sought to keep an open mind that was unclouded by sheer assumptions, (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) even being willing to rescind her disbelief in ghosts when Graham told her about his supernatural encounter, concluding that ghosts didn't exist \"unless they [did]\". (TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nFast to take the helm in a moment of crisis, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) she disliked being told what to do, (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and insisting on being in charge when others' leadership resulted in counterproductive results, (TV: War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) believing that she had \"all the authorisation [she could] ever need\", (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) as she saw her authority to be \"mountainous\". (TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) Even while trying to act incognito, the Doctor had no patience for others' claims of authority, especially when the authority was misused and unearned by the authoritative figure. (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) She preferred to \"get on with the job\", (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and would become dismissive of those around her when focusing on the task at hand. (TV: Praxeus [+]Pete McTighe and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Ascension of the Cybermen [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021)., Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nShe would keep her discoveries hidden from others with the mind-set of protecting them from a harmful realisation, (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and was not above being cryptic, handing Missy an annotated map of 14th century Venice without explaining it, and leaving Missy to discover for herself what the annotations meant, while also not divulging her true identity to Missy. (PROSE: The Liar, the Glitch and the War Zone [+]Peter Anghelides, The Missy Chronicles (2018).) However, she would be upfront with her feelings when letting people know when she was afraid or no longer feeling a certain way, (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018). The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021)., The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) unless it was a subject she was still adjusting too. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nStriving to have the moral high ground, (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) the Doctor was unsympathetic to those that wanted murderous revenge on past tormentors, (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) and did not take kindly to being threatened. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She was also more passive than her predecessors, being willing to leave a situation to its historical fate if it couldn't be stopped, (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018). Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and would allow others to step in to quell a situation in her place with little resistance. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nA self-proclaimed \"nutter\", (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) though one that was never \"ridiculous\", (TV: Village of the Angels [+]Chris Chibnall and Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) the Doctor had a ruthless side to her, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021)., Village of the Angels [+]Chris Chibnall and Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) and could quickly turn short tempered and snappish, with not even her friends being sparred from her outbursts. (TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Ascension of the Cybermen [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021).) When her friends tried to talk back to her, she would defensively try to change the subject by reminding them of the nice places she took them too. (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nWhile she was unconcerned with her reputation, (COMIC: Mistress of Chaos [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) she did have a bit of an ego, showing enjoyment at showing off her intelligence, (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) not being afraid to brag about her talents, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) wanting people to be impressed by her, (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) and becoming gleeful when the Reconnaissance Dalek recognised her as the Doctor. (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) She was more concerned about being embarrassed by being wrong instead of more fatal consequences, (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and could get self-defensive over how others described her, being offended when she was accused of having a \"small mind\", (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) taking umbrage with being called \"little\". (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and feeling offended when she misunderstood why Bel was calling her \"unstable\". (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor had a love for talking, (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) as it helped her to focus her mind, (AUDIO: The Return of the Doctor [+]Rory Thomas-Howes, The Thirteenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2025).) frequently rambling to distract herself or others from her worries, or to inspire hope in herself, (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018). Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) and to distract her foes so she could have time to think. (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) She once admitted she could talk to herself without fear of isolation, believing that another person in a conversation would just \"get in the way\". (TV: Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) However, when she starred down an adversary, the Doctor would cease rambling to become a confident and direct speaker, often acting in a passive aggressive manner to antagonise her opponents into exposing their shortcomings and take control of their interaction. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nDescribing herself as \"socially awkward\", (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) the Doctor was capable of inadvertently coming off as rude with her blunt word choices, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Praxeus [+]Pete McTighe and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) openly pointing out the ineffectiveness of others' aid, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) being clear with her feelings towards someone for their past actions, (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) voicing her frustrations when people in danger were unprepared for defensive combat, (TV: Ascension of the Cybermen [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and calling Nikola Tesla a \"big fat liar\" after he tried to deceive her. (TV: Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) When Graham opened up to her about his fears of his cancer returning, the Doctor openly stated her uncertainty on how to respond, instead electing to narrate her movements and admit she would later think of something she should have said to him, which did make Graham chuckle. (TV: Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) Like previous incarnations, the Thirteenth Doctor enjoyed it when people underestimated her, deliberately using her awkwardness to make herself seem \"smaller\", but found it disappointing when people continued to dismiss her after she threw off the persona. (PROSE: The Shadow Passes [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThough she claimed \"a good countdown\" helped her focus, (COMIC: Mistress of Chaos [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Thirteenth Doctor retained the absent-mindedness of her previous incarnation, tending to forget how many times she did something, (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) forgetting whether she was awarding points or gold stars to her companions, (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and only remembering she was holding an item of importance after asking for its whereabouts in a state of a panic. (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) She could forget when someone was still next to her, (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and fail to notice when her companions were absence, even when they had been missing for some time, (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and not check if her instructions were understood before sending them off on an assignment, (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) with a self-admitted tendency to confuse \"meaning to say something\" with \"actually saying it\". (TV: Praxeus [+]Pete McTighe and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nShe also retained her predecessor's veneration of the dead, (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) holding a respect for all living beings, even if they caused harm due to their nature, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and sought to offer even the deadliest of her foes the chance to retreat, (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) but would offer no second chances to those that truly irked her. (TV: Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nUpon seeing Gallifrey in ruin, the Doctor reacted with devastation. After discovering the Spy Master was responsible for the act in retaliation for \"the lie of the Timeless Child\", the Doctor was left in a foul mood, (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) that lasted for some time. (TV: Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) Even after some time had passed, the Doctor was still sore on the subject of dead planets. (TV: Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) She would occasionally revisit Gallifrey. (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) After the Master revealed that she was the Timeless Child of legend before the Division had redacted the memories of her earlier lives, the Doctor had a brief identity crisis, until a conversation with the Fugitive Doctor in the Matrix convinced her that, rather than being reduced to less, she \"contain[ed] multitudes more than she ever thought\". (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) However, even after having \"decades\" in prison to dwell on her discovery, she admitted to Ryan that she was continuing to struggle with who she really was. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) The Doctor then became desperate to seek answers on her forgotten past, (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021).) but, once she held all the answers in her hand, she elected to leave them for another day when she reflected on what she had already learnt. (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor retained her eleventh incarnation's fondness for fezzes, (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) enjoyed wearing plumed headgear, (TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) admired Ryan for how well he looked in a beanie hat, (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) and wore a Panama hat while relaxing on a beach. (COMIC: Fear of the Future [+]Jacqueline Rayner, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022).) She once noted that when working on something, she liked to lay out all she needed on a table in front of her, allowing her to have a complete view of the task at hand. (PROSE: TARDIS Tour [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nShe also liked holograms, \"big locked doors\", (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) the musical Hamilton, (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) \"a good rescue\", (COMIC: The Warmonger [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Kerb!am Man, (TV: Kerblam!

(PROSE: Dæmons in Levenshulme [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Hong Kong was among her favourite places in time and space. (COMIC: The White Dragon [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile she once claimed to \"love a conspiracy\", (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) she disliked ones that resulted in information being purposely withheld from her, (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and she especially hated \"not understanding\" something. (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) She disliked dealing with people who tried to deny the extraordinary and unexplainable, even after they had witnessed it, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) and, while she gave quick hugs for greetings and farewells, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021)., The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) she did not usually enjoy physical contact with others. (TV: Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) She also disliked having empty pockets, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) bullies, and people in danger. (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nThe Doctor enjoyed tea (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and biscuits, (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) with custard creams being a particular favourite, (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and Yorkshire Tea being her preference. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).) She liked to have cereal and croissants for breakfast, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and enjoyed fried egg sandwiches, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) milkshakes, (COMIC: The Piggybackers [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2020).) and fizzy Vimto. (PROSE: Dæmons in Levenshulme [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) However, she disliked bourbon biscuits, (PROSE: Chasing the Dawn [+]Jenny T Colgan, Star Tales (2019).) and olives. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).)\n\nSeeing morality as a strength, (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) the Thirteenth Doctor stated that love was central to her \"faith\", believing it to be the better source of belief. (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018). The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) While she didn't believe in perfection, (COMIC: The Everlasting Summer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) she was also a strong believer in hope, (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and thought that the meaning of life was to continuously try to achieve goals with friends made along the way. (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) She voiced the opinions that \"where there [was] risk, there [was] hope\" (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and that there was \"always a way out\" of a crisis. (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) She also stood against prejudices, but masked her disgust with gentle comments of acceptance, (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) as she though that hate would only spread if left unopposed, (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) and that \"true knowledge [had] to be earned\". (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nSeeing herself as an \"expert\" on running towards and away from danger, the Doctor believed that running was sometimes the bravest option, either as an act of defiance on giving up or a proof of agency against letting the \"monsters\" decide one's fate, (COMIC: Hidden Human History [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) though she didn't think being \"a little bit scared [was] a bad thing.\" (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She used jokes to defuse tension, (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) believing that the \"bad ones\" were the best to use. (WC: Message from the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nFearful of the destruction that threatened species' ability to build and live, and seeing that \"life must win\" to justify itself, (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) the Thirteenth Doctor would view individuals as the source of the problems with the established systems, rather than point fault at the systems themselves, (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) sympathising with how scary new things could be. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor disliked weaponry, (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) opting instead to use her intellect and environment to her advantage, (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) even voicing her disapproval when someone resorted to using a weapon, (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) though she admitted this was a \"flexible creed\", as anything that could be rebuilt was \"fair game\" to be destroyed. (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Specifically, the Doctor believed guns \"made things worse\" by agitated attackers, (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and that only \"idiots\" carried knives. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) After Leon Perkins threatened her with a gun, the Doctor favoured serving him tea over imprisoning him, hoping to come to a common understanding with him. (COMIC: A New Beginning [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2018-2019).)\n\nBelieving against how \"the ends justified the means\", (COMIC: Herald of Madness [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Thirteenth Doctor was passionately against killing, always trying her best to subdue her opponents in a non-lethal fashion, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and would be particularly outraged if an enemy was killed after they had already been defeated. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) She was deeply disturbed when she was forced to indirectly be responsible for the loss of life, (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) seeking confirmation from her friends that she had given every opportunity for a better outcome when she resorted to killing her foes. (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) While she was prepared to unleash the death particle on Gallifrey to stop the Spy Master and the CyberMasters, she was ultimately unable to detonate the device. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) However, when facing opponents that posed a great threat to innocent lives and history, the Doctor was more willing to lead them to their deaths. (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021)., War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) When her patience and rage reached their zenith, the Doctor would resort to psychically attacking the one she was enraged with. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nShe retained the guilt demonstrated in her prior incarnations over the events of the Last Great Time War. Visiting Cass Fermazzi prior to her death, the Doctor expressed her regret over Cass' fate and noted that saving her was impossible as \"[she] was too wrapped up in [the Doctor's] timeline\". (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Like her immediate predecessor, she believed that \"no one ever [won] at war\", (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).) and also thought that \"soldiers [paid] the price for their commanders' mistakes.\" (TV: War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nAdmiring machines that fulfilled a great purpose, (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) the Doctor would scold those who used the power to create in their efforts for destruction. (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She also held a great admiration for those who crafted things for themselves and made their own inventions, praising both Ada Lovelace and Nikola Tesla for their ingenuity and forward thinking, seeing the lack of recognition each received as trivial in comparison to their accomplishments. (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) She also admired Amelia Earhart for taking the world on and pushing it forward. (PROSE: Chasing the Dawn [+]Jenny T Colgan, Star Tales (2019).) In contrast, she admonished those who only took power and recognition through ownership alone, claiming that people who never created things themselves were destined to be forgotten by history. (TV: Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor claimed that she enjoyed making \"trip[s] into the past\" for research purposes, but knew to be cautious when making such trips, even writing a note that chastises Missy for her lack of caution in meddling with time. (PROSE: The Liar, the Glitch and the War Zone [+]Peter Anghelides, The Missy Chronicles (2018).) However, she was annoyed about how rarely history lined up with historical documentation. (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) She took her devotion to the preservation of history so seriously that she described herself and her companions as its \"guardians\", (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) even excluding historical figures from her missions when she could, (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) though would still acknowledge that time \"[was]n't always fixed\". (TV: Village of the Angels [+]Chris Chibnall and Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) She considered the \"cruel truth\" of time was that \"people who [made] history [were] also claimed by history\", and that price for traveling in time was having to watch legends and their mortality. (COMIC: The White Dragon [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Her protectiveness of the timeline extended to reality, with the Thirteenth Doctor showing annoyance with her fifteenth incarnation when he was preparing to create a time schism to \"shift\" the timeline, though she eventually agreed with his reasoning. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nWhile she was careful not to tamper with established history, (TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) the Doctor found herself willing take her companions to visit their own family history with little persuasion, though warned her friends to \"tread softly\" on their own history. (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) At times, the Doctor's sense of justice got the better of her, making her intervene in past events if she believed them to be minuscule enough to not impact history in too great a detail. (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She would still show signs of distress if preserving history meant letting injustices stand and go unpunished. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) After Graham and Ryan left, the Doctor briefly contemplated travelling back in time to get more time with them, but did not act on the idea. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nShe implored those around her to ask questions about a situation, and showed no irritation on how off topic the questions got, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) even showing gleeful excitement when the right questions were asked, (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) especially with applied \"deductive thinking\", (COMIC: The Power of the Mobox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) but would clarify when \"the wrong question\" to a situation was being posed. (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) However, she showed displeasure in handling multiple questions simultaneously, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) and would refuse to answer questions asked of her if the person did not answer any questions she asked first. (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She also excused her solo trips to the destroyed Gallifrey by claiming that Team TARDIS \"ask[ed] too many questions\" about her private affairs. (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nThriving on the gleeful excitement of unpredictability, (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) the Thirteenth Doctor would run into a situation without a strategy in mind, hoping to come up with a plan in the heat of the moment, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021)., Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) claiming to be \"good in a tight spot\" (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and to enjoy throwing a \"curveball\" into the situation, (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) but would take precautions when she knew how dangerous a situation was, (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., Ascension of the Cybermen [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) even using her seemingly unfocused planning to hide a contingency she had prepared in advance. (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)

(COMIC: A Little Help from My Friends [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2020).)\n\nWhile she believed in a trial and error format to solving problems, (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) the Doctor rarely learnt from her experiences, such as needing to reassure herself of her identity as \"the Doctor\" (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) after already being reassured of it by the Fugitive Doctor, (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and continuing to withhold information from Yaz (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) after promising to be more forthcoming with her. (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nWhile she felt some superiority to her other incarnations, (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) the Thirteenth Doctor affectionately saw her previous incarnations as her \"fam\", and especially enjoyed the company of the Seventh Doctor, singling him out as being \"on [her] team\" during a Multi-Doctor Event. She also teasingly invited herself to the \"wedding\" of her bickering second and third incarnations. (WC: Doctors Assemble! [+]James Goss, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nShe conceded that the Fifteenth Doctor was the \"best male [Doctor]\", and gave him comfort as he prepared to regenerate, telling him he was \"gorgeous\", but was taken aback when he told her he \"love[d]\" her. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nThe Fourteenth Doctor remembered his predecessor being a \"really brilliant woman\". (TV: Destination: Skaro [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2023).)\n\nThe Doctor considered Graham O'Brien, Yaz Khan and Ryan Sinclair to be her \"best friends\", (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) and tried not to play favourites with them. (COMIC: The Power of the Mobox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She was encouraging with them, especially when they made a connection or deduction, showed prowess, acted well in a crisis, or came up with a good plan of action.

Nevertheless, when one of her friends had a \"bad idea\", she did not shy away from saying so, (COMIC: A New Beginning [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2018-2019).) being stern with Graham when he expressed his intent to kill Tzim-Sha to avenge Grace, warning him he would not be invited back into the TARDIS if he carried it through, and expressed her pride in him when he chose not to murder Tzim-Sha. (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She would also get agitated with them when she was in a poor mood, (TV: Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Ascension of the Cybermen [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021).) and was slightly miffed when Ryan suggested that being away from the TARDIS had been good for him. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nWanting to keep them safe above all else, (TV: Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021).) to the point that seeing them in danger could help her focus her mind, (COMIC: Herald of Madness [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor always gave her friends the chance to walk away or stay behind when faced with danger, (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) or would order them to retreat if the dangers proved too severe, (TV: Ascension of the Cybermen [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) and preferred to face an enemy alone. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).

(TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nLike her early incarnations, the Thirteenth Doctor was not openly interested in romance, (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) but retained a respect for it, (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) even describing herself as a \"romantic\", (TV: Praxeus [+]Pete McTighe and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) though she disliked being flirted with. (TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) She purposely distanced herself away from the idea of being romantic to spare herself the pain that came with outliving her lover, preferring to \"live in the present\" and enjoy the relationships she had, though she admitted that she would date Yaz, were it not for her inability to \"fix [her]self to anything\", (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) having secretly fallen in love with her. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nAccording to Graham O'Brien, when reflecting on her attitude after seeing a ravaged Gallifrey, \"one minute [she was] all smiles, [and the] next minute [her] mind [was] somewhere else\", but he still believed that the Thirteenth Doctor was \"the best person [he knew]\". (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nWhen helping the Fifteenth Doctor prepare to regenerate, the Thirteenth Doctor advised him \"[not to] go in fear\", but to instead face the end with a \"lovely smile\", while agreeing with him on how he wished he could of \"had longer\". (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nWhen the Doctor was warned about her impending regeneration, she reacted with shock and worry, (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) and reacted with immense fear when the Dalek Executioners were about to kill her. (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) Though she wished she could \"go on forever\", (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) and raged that she \"want[ed] more time\" when her regeneration was triggered by the Spy Master redirecting a Qurunx energy beam, the Doctor was quick to compose herself to comfort Yaz, whom she treated to ice cream as a parting gift, telling her of her love for her companions and how she \"loved being [herself]\". Ultimately, the Doctor chose to regenerate alone, enjoying a sunrise on top a cliff, telling her next incarnation they were \"tag[ged]\", though she was saddened not to \"know what happen[ed] next\". (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor had some trouble adjusting to perceptions around her new gender, taking some time to get used to people calling her \"Ma'am\" and \"Madam\". (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) While she would become frustrated when facing judgement because of her new form, (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) she saw advantages in \"[looking] like a girl\" in interactions with others, (PROSE: Chasing the Dawn [+]Jenny T Colgan, Star Tales (2019).) and openly enjoyed getting opportunities she never had when she was a man. (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) The Doctor would occasionally slip up when referring to herself, forgetting to account for the change in her gender identity, (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) as she did not consider herself to be a man or a woman \"in the way that [humans] understand\" such things. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).)\n\nLike her ninth incarnation, the Thirteenth Doctor spoke with a Northern accent, (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) and also used \"Oi\" to get someone's attention, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) when beginning a counter-argument, (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).

[+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nAfter struggling to find the right term of affection to refer to her companions as, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) the Doctor eventually settled on calling them her \"fam\", (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Ascension of the Cybermen [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) after twice testing the waters with it, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and would call a larger ensemble of her friends the \"extended fam\". (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) She even addressed all her previous incarnations as her \"fam\" when bidding them farewell. (WC: Doctors Assemble! [+]James Goss, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nWhen she came to a realisation, the Doctor would utter, \"oh\", as the information dawned on her, (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., Kerblam!

(AUDIO: Lionesses in Winter [+]Lisa McMullin, The Thirteenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2025).)\nShe could also decode steganography images. (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nLike her predecessors, the Thirteenth Doctor was a skilled escape artist, crediting it to the teachings of Harry Houdini. (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She could quickly calculate the length of time it would take her to do something, and act with quick succession, (COMIC: The Warmonger [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and recite the entirety of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone from memory. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor resembled a woman in her mid-thirties, with hazel-coloured eyes surrounded by crow's feet wrinkles. She had jaw-length blonde hair with dark roots parted to her right and curled around her ears, (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) though her hair became straightened by the end of her imprisonment in the Judoon prison. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) To her annoyance, she was shorter than her previous incarnation. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).)\n\nIn preparation for Umbreen's wedding to Prem, the Doctor had henna tattoos temporarily applied to her arms by Hasna. She also had a flower tucked behind her left ear during the ceremony. (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nImmediately after seeing her reflection for the first time, the Thirteenth Doctor deemed her new face to be \"brilliant\", (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) though she was oblivious to the fact that she had changed from male to female until informed by Yaz Khan. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) She described her counterpart the Herald as \"good-looking\", (COMIC: Herald of Madness [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and thought herself as being \"cute\" when she was saw herself in the flesh. (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nPatricia thought that the Thirteenth Doctor's face conveyed a constant, unashamed amazement, (PROSE: The Rhino of Twenty-Three Strand Street [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) with Lee Clayton also recognising the intelligence conveyed in her eyes. (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nLucy Wilson described her as a \"beautiful woman\", (PROSE: Avatars of the Intelligence [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) with James I commenting on her \"alluring form\", (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) the Sixth Corsair also voiced her approval upon meeting the Doctor. (COMIC: Old Friends [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile one account showed a different face, (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) in the account of the Doctor's trial on Gallifrey where he was shown his future incarnations as potential direct successors for his forced regeneration, the Second Doctor rejected the Thirteenth Doctor's appearance for being \"too young\". (TV: The War Games in Colour [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, adapted from The War Games (Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke), Doctor Who season (BBC Four, 2024).)\n\nAfter going clothes shopping at a charity shop, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) the Thirteenth Doctor took to wearing a hooded, lilac trenchcoat with midnight blue interim, apart from the sleeves, which had lavender insides, and a rainbow pattern along the edges. (GRAPHIC: And Introducing... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She was very fond of her coat, (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and would try to avoid damaging it, (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) though she had to rip part of it to help history go undisturbed from Krasko's meddling, but had the tear repaired by seamstress Rosa Parks. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nUnder her coat, the Doctor wore a variety of similarly designed t-shirts with rainbow stripes running across their chest, such as a low collar midnight blue shirt, (GRAPHIC: And Introducing... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) a rose pink low collar shirt, (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) a magenta crew collar shirt, (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) a Prussian blue crew collar t-shirt with a smeared rainbow pattern, (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) a royal blue crew collar shirt, (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) a burgundy crew collar shirt, (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) and a rust orange crew collar shirt. (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) Under her shirt, she wore a white, long-sleeved undershirt. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) On occasion, she would disperse with the t-shirt entirely and instead wear a navy blue jumper, (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) a cobalt blue jumper, (TV: Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) or a sapphire blue, buttoned-up, sleeveless waistcoat with lapels and a clock pattern. (TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nOn her legs, she wore a pair of high-waisted teal culottes (COMIC: The Many Lives of Doctor Who [+]Richard Dinnick, The Many Lives of Doctor Who (Titan Publishing Group, 2018).) kept up by braces, (GRAPHIC: And Introducing... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) coloured in either mustard yellow (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) or dark midnight blue. (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) For footwear, she wore blue, striped socks with brown, laced-up boots. (COMIC: The Many Lives of Doctor Who [+]Richard Dinnick, The Many Lives of Doctor Who (Titan Publishing Group, 2018).)\n\nShe also wore golden-ringed ear cuffs at the top and at the lobe of her left ear. The top cuff was a series of eight joint stars, and the bottom cuff was in the shape of two hands holding each other. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).)\n\nWhen performing maintenance on her TARDIS, or building a new device, the Doctor would wear a pair of protective goggles, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022)., The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) and, similar to her fourth incarnation, she occasionally wore a scarf around her neck, with either a full rainbow pattern or a navy blue scarf with a rainbow pastern on the ends. (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019)., The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor had a liking for headgear, and would wear a hat of some kind at the first opportunity. (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) She also once wore a navy blue bum bag around her waist to carry her sonic screwdriver and psychic paper, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and also owned a handbag at some point. (POEM: Contents [+]James Goss, Now We Are Six Hundred (Harper Design, 2017).)\n\nDuring her brief employment as a packer at Kerb!am, the Doctor wore the standard purple hi-vis vest for packers over her jacket. (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) When gatecrashing Daniel Barton's casino themed party, the Doctor wore a white shirt with a black bow tie with golden dots, black capri trousers, black braces, black boots and socks, and a long black moleskin overcoat. (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) While searching for the Flor de la Mar, the Doctor discarded her coat and shirts in favour of an azure and crimson brocade blouse with frog buttons. (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nWhile masquerading as the \"Masked Assassin\", the Doctor hid her face behind a mask with a question mark on it and wore stilettos, with a cloak that spelled the number \"13\". (POEM: The Death List [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor was the first official incarnation of the Doctor in the programme's history to be played by a woman, though the idea of a woman Doctor had been explored as early as 1980, when Tom Baker exited the role of the Fourth Doctor, and told the press, \"I certainly wish my successor luck, whoever he—or she—might be.\"[1][2] When Peter Davison decided to retire from the role of the Fifth Doctor, John Nathan-Turner told the Daily Star that \"the hunt for a new Doctor starts today and it's quite feasible it will be a woman\".[3]\n\nSecond Doctor actor Patrick Troughton was quoted in 1983 as approving of the idea of a woman playing the Doctor.[4] In 1986, series creator Sydney Newman suggested that \"at a later stage Doctor Who should be metamorphosed into a woman\", offering Joanna Lumley as the potential candidate for the Seventh Doctor, with Frances de la Tour and Dawn French also being mentioned.[5] Lumley would ultimately portray  a Thirteenth Doctor in the 1999 Comic Relief special The Curse of Fatal Death [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who television episodes (BBC One, 1999)..\n\nThe 1999 BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures novel Interference - Book Two [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999). was the first time it was commented on Time Lords switching genders during a regeneration, with I.M. Foreman twice stating to have had a female tenth incarnation. The 2002 Big Finish audio Seasons of Fear [+]Paul Cornell and Caroline Symcox, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002). had the Eighth Doctor allude to the possibility of regenerating into a woman while in discussion with Sebastian Grayle, telling Grayle he was \"not a glamorous woman at the moment\".\n\nThe 2003 Big Finish Doctor Who Unbound story Exile [+]Nicholas Briggs, Doctor Who Unbound (Big Finish Productions, 2003). starred another female Doctor, played by Arabella Weir. In the context of the story, which was set in another universe, it was established that suicide was necessary for a \"sex-change regeneration\", which was also considered a crime by the Time Lords. This suggestion garnered much criticism[6], and was not picked up by any following story.\n\nWhile discussing casting for the 2005 continuation, Jane Tranter wanted the Ninth Doctor to be the first female incarnation, played by Judi Dench.[7][5] A cut line in The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005). would have had Gabriel Sneed remark to the Ninth Doctor, \"I thought you'd be a woman\", to which the Doctor would respond, \"No, not yet.\"[source needed]\n\nWhen David Tennant first announced his intention to leave the role of the Tenth Doctor in 2007, the UK Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology wanted the Eleventh Doctor to be female. [5] When the Eleventh Doctor, played by Matt Smith, made his first appearance in 2010's The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010)., he briefly thought he had regenerated into a woman after examining his long hair, but quickly realised his mistake on finding his Adam's apple.\n\n2011's The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011). was the first television story to make direct reference to a Time Lord changing gender through regeneration, with the Doctor talking about the Corsair. 2014 saw Steven Moffat introduce audiences to Missy, who was revealed to be the first female incarnation of the Master in Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., marking the first time an already established character had changed genders after regenerating. However, it was not until 2015 that audiences directly experienced such a regeneration, first in the Big Finish audio story The Black Hole [+]Simon Guerrier, The Early Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2015). with Pavo, and then in television story Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015). when the General regenerated.\n\nIn 2019, two years after the announcement of Whittaker's casting, Christopher Eccleston, speaking at Rose City Comic Con, said that the Ninth Doctor should have been female, and even claimed that Rose Tyler-actress Billie Piper should have been the Doctor instead of him, stating that \"It's ridiculous we weren't thinking of a female Doctor at that time. In 2004, in me they picked yet another white skinny male to be the Doctor\".[8]\n\nIn 2020's Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Jo Martin was introduced as an unknown incarnation, with The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020). establishing that the Doctor had, in fact, lived through multiple incarnations before the First Doctor. Of these forgotten incarnations, of which Martin's is suggested to have been one, at least four were female, including the earliest known incarnation, cementing that the Thirteenth Doctor had not, in fact, been the first female Doctor chronologically.\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor is unique amongst her previous incarnations by having appeared multiple times in the official expanded media before her television debut in The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., a fact that is acknowledged in the reference book Sheffield Steel: Essays on the Thirteenth Doctor by Sam Maleski.",
