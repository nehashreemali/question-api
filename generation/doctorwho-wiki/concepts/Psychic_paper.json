  "content": "Psychic paper was a blank, white card that had special properties.\n\nWhen shown to a person, it could usually induce them to see whatever the user wished them to see printed on it. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) The Tenth Doctor explained that it “assigned authority based on the reader’s perceptions”. (AUDIO: Cycle of Destruction) It was often used by the Doctor to gain entrance, confidence or trust with strangers, especially from their ninth incarnation onwards. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., et al.)\n\nHowever, the paper proved useless on geniuses such as William Shakespeare, (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) those with basic psychic training, (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and those with feeble imaginations. (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) It also wouldn't work if the user was trying to claim something too unbelievable. (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) While one account showed that the paper could work on those who were illiterate, (COMIC: The Futurists) another account showed otherwise. (COMIC: Hidden Human History)\n\nPsychic paper was made from the psychic trees of Boda. The trees were harvested following their deaths, and the paper retained their psychic properties. (PROSE: Paper Moon)\n\nThe Second Doctor was given psychic paper while employed as an agent by the Time Lords' covert organisation, the Celestial Intervention Agency, which had developed the technology. He and the Time Lady Serena used it to attend the Duchess of Richmond's ball to keep an eye on the Duke of Wellington. (PROSE: World Game) The Eighth Doctor carried it on a few occasions. (AUDIO: The Turn of the Screw, Dead Time, Baker Street Irregulars, The Starship of Theseus) The War Doctor used it in the Last Great Time War, (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost) but preferred the feel of a gun in his hands. (COMIC: The Organ Grinder)\n\nThe Doctor, in their ninth, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005). et al.) tenth, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., et al.) eleventh, (TV: The Eleventh Hour, et al.) twelfth, (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., et al.) and thirteenth incarnations (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., et al.) habitually carried it, as did Captain Jack Harkness during his rogue days. Jack said that the paper was a new technology put into use by the Time Agency which had employed him. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nAt least some Weeping Angels had access to psychic paper, which according to the Eleventh Doctor, was \"child's play\" for them. (PROSE: Touched by an Angel)\n\nWhen the Thirteenth Doctor was locked in prison and unable to help them, Team TARDIS lamented the fact that they didn't have psychic paper to help them out. Later, when Ryan Sinclair and Graham O'Brien decided to leave the TARDIS, the Doctor gave them each their own psychic paper, one for Ryan and one for Graham. She stated that it \"might come in handy\". Hearing of possible alien sightings, the two decided to use their psychic papers to help them investigate. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).) Graham later attempted to use his psychic paper on Ace, but it only displayed his true thoughts and Graham commented that \"I can't get the hang of this.\" (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nWhen the Fourteenth Doctor had recently regenerated from his previous form as a woman, the psychic paper needed some time to adjust to him being male again. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor showed his psychic paper to Ruby Sunday to convince her he was of \"Health and Safety, gin and tonic division.” (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) He later used it on Rogue's scanner in his ship to show his various incarnations to prove he was a Time Lord that regenerated. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) When forced to live at the Sandringham Hotel for a year in order to complete a bootstrap paradox, he worked as waiting staff and used it to anticipate customer orders before they had even made them. However, it was confused by a woman who desired the food that he attempted to serve her, but was on a diet. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nUsually, it showed what the holder of the paper wanted the person reading the paper to see, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) or vice-versa. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) The psychic paper could change what the user wanted to display in rapid succession. (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) However, if the user wasn't specific about what they wanted the reader to see, instead using a broad idea like \"worst nightmare\", what turned up on the psychic paper would always be a surprise. (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) It could be used to show the reader the credentials of someone they had already been expecting, without any prior knowledge by the user of whom that might be. (AUDIO: Baker Street Irregulars) If the user wanted to present credentials as a \"higher authority\" without specifics, what appeared was a surprise. (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Empress of Mars [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017)., Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) This even included situations where the user was speaking unrelated babble. (COMIC: The Fountains of Forever)\n\nMessages on psychic paper appeared in the reader's handwriting. (PROSE: Touched by an Angel) The message could also be signed with a kiss, something Donna teased the Tenth Doctor about. (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nIt could even be used to open doors in place of a keycard (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and the Tenth Doctor once used it in lieu of an Oyster card to pay before boarding a bus in 2009 London. (TV: Planet of the Dead [+]Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Easter Special 2009 (BBC One, 2009).) It could also be used like a credit card; Amy told the Eleventh Doctor to hand her the psychic paper when they landed in New York so she could go shopping. (PROSE: The Forgotten Army) The Eighth Doctor informed his companions Liv Chenka and Helen Sinclair that, since he'd left his psychic paper aboard the TARDIS before getting stranded in 2020, they would not be able to use it as a credit card in place of local currency. (AUDIO: Lost Property) Mischief-making Courtney Woods swiped it, also using it to shop, and as a fake ID to get into clubs. (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe psychic paper essentially allows the user to steal whatever they want; since they aren't paying with any currency.\n\nPsychic paper could receive messages from beings with sufficient psychic ability, no matter where the Doctor was in time and space, such as the Face of Boe, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) the Atraxi, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Tenzas, (TV: Night Terrors) and, to his initial surprise, River Song. (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., GAME: The Eternity Clock) The Doctor explained this function to Amelia Pond as taking \"a dandy little message\" when the Atraxi sent him a message, warning about Prisoner Zero's escape. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Kate Stewart and UNIT managed to contact the Doctor through the psychic paper. (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) It could receive untraceable messages from Psychic Paper Inc, which registered as \"junk mail\". (COMIC: Psychic Paper Inc Claims Department)\n\nTime Lords like the Doctor could psychically connect with the paper. The Eleventh Doctor did this to lead Amy to where he was being held captive by Vykoids. However, the link was faulty and lingered even after the Doctor didn't need it. (PROSE: The Forgotten Army) When used by an individual with psychic powers, the psychic paper would sometimes bounce the individual's powers back on them. When used by Waechter, it allowed him to see his own future. (PROSE: The Weeping) It could also display text messages from mobile phones the Doctor upgraded to allow communication with him and the TARDIS. (COMIC: The Fountains of Forever)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor also once used the psychic paper as a truth telling device by having Constantine Ethelred Gurney hold the blank paper and then reading off who he was, where he was from, his crimes, and his Volag-Noc release date. (TV: The Infinite Quest)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor at some point set his psychic paper to Temporal News Feed, and was alerted via the sound of a horn honking. (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAccording to the Twelfth Doctor, if there was any trouble at the Vault he would receive a message on his psychic paper. (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nIn the hands of untrained users, the paper was prone to displaying facts they subconsciously wanted the reader to be aware of. This could be quite embarrassing, such as in Rose Tyler's case, when it betrayed her interest in Jack Harkness: he likewise previously gave away that he was single and liked to work out. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Graham O'Brien similarly tried to pass himself off as a volcano inspector under a fake name to Ace, but the paper instead displayed his real name, his friendship with the Doctor and what he worried about. Graham grumbled that he was unable to get the hang of using it. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Similarly, if the user was aroused while flirting with someone, the message would instead display what the user was thinking, as what happened when the Fifteenth Doctor tried to use it on Rogue only for the credentials to read \"You're hot\". (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nIf the intended reader had a particular bias, such as being sexist, the psychic paper would only display credentials of which the reader believed the owner capable. (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nWhen the intended thought was too unbelievable, the psychic paper would only display wavy lines. The Eleventh Doctor explained that such a lie — in his case, that he was universally recognised as a mature and responsible adult — shorted it out because it was \"too big\". (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nAccording to Shadovar, psychic paper primarily worked on people with \"weak minds\". (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost)\n\nThe paper did not work on people of genius, such as William Shakespeare, making him one of the first people the Doctor met who was naturally immune to it, (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) or on people who had \"a serious lack of imagination\". (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) It also didn't seem to work on some species, such as Saturnynians; though Rosanna Calvierri didn't say she was immune. (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nThe psychic paper did not work on humans with powerful psychic abilities, like Adriana Jarsdel, (AUDIO: The Bleeding Heart) or whose minds had already been manipulated by another source - the minds of the inhabitants of a 1982 nuclear bunker were manipulated by giant cockroaches, so the psychic paper did not work on them. (AUDIO: Day of the Cockroach)\n\nThe \"basic psychic training\" that was standard at Torchwood One was enough to distinguish psychic paper from real. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nOne could distinguish psychic paper from real paper by looking for \"fractal lines\" on the former. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nWhen wet, the psychic paper acted rather differently and was unable to translate the Tenth Doctor's thoughts properly, (PROSE: Wetworld) and didn't display anything when drenched in rain when presented to George Byron, Mary Shelley, Claire Clairmont and John Polidori by the Thirteenth Doctor. (TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nWhen a parking inspector signed the Eleventh Doctor's psychic paper, he believed it wouldn't work, until Amy Pond turned it around the other way, causing messages to appear back to front. (PROSE: Apollo 23)\n\nThe paper could also only work effectively on civilisations that had invented writing — when the Eleventh Doctor attempted to use it in the Viking era it remained blank before eventually displaying an image of a rabbit (of which there were thousands around), implying that he was a \"Rabbit Inspector\". (PROSE: Dark Horizons) If a civilisation had the concept of writing, the paper could work on a level beyond written language, such as one man being able to read the message on it even when he himself was illiterate. (PROSE: The Silent Stars Go By)\n\nNot everyone was affected by the psychic paper. People, or groups, known to be immune to its illusions included Shadovar, a Technomancer who viewed even Time Lord technology to be inferior; (AUDIO: Legion of the Lost) Adriana Jarsdel, due to her psychic abilities; (AUDIO: The Bleeding Heart) Torchwood One personnel, due to psychic training; (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) William Shakespeare, apparently due to his incredible mind; (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Ernest Shackleton, due to how determined he was; (COMIC: The First) Eve; (PROSE: The Last Dodo) Morret and other veterans of the Telepath Uprising; (PROSE: Judgement of the Judoon) GateBots; (COMIC: Attack of the GateBots!) Rosanna Calvierri; (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Frederick Abberline; (COMIC: Ripper's Curse) Stella; (PROSE: Prisoner of the Daleks) the Anglican Marines of the Church, who trained themselves for the Battle of Demons Run; (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Ood; (COMIC: Psychic Paper Inc Claims Department)  Fenton, due to having a highly unimaginative mind; (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.
