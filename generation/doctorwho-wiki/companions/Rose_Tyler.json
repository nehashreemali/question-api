  "content": "Living in a London council estate, Rose was raised (and emotionally shaped) by her mother, a widow who told Rose stories about her father whom she had no memory of. While Rose had a relatively happy young life, dating with neighbour Mickey Smith, it took a bad turn when she fell in love with a young musician, and subsequent to moving in with him and dropping out of education, her future prospective plummeted. After the relationship failed and Rose found herself working in retail, seeming to be destined to have a life of mundanity and further retail work, she met the Ninth Doctor in early 2005.\n\nInstead, the Doctor blew up her workplace and they began travelling together soon afterwards. She helped the Doctor work through some of the pain he had as the sole survivor of the Last Great Time War. When she met the Doctor, she was again Mickey's girlfriend, but that relationship immediately began to decay after she started travelling in the TARDIS. As Mickey himself noted, she transferred her romantic attention to the Doctor.\n\nA major facet of her travels in the TARDIS was her assuming the identity of the \"Bad Wolf\". In order to get back to the Doctor, after he sent her and the TARDIS together to protect them from a Dalek attack, she was forced to stare into the heart of the TARDIS, which enfolded her in Time Vortex energy and turned her into a new and seemingly omnipotent being that could rescue the Doctor. She also caused a temporal paradox by leaving herself a trail of clues throughout history, she was able to recognise, leading her back. But it also nearly killed her. The Ninth Doctor absorbed the Time Vortex energy and transferred it back to the TARDIS — triggering a regeneration. She thus became one of three companions — along with Peri Brown and Wilfred Mott — to be the proximate cause of a Doctor's regeneration.\n\nThe end of her time with the Doctor came after she was pulled into a parallel universe during the Battle of Canary Wharf, where she became trapped, as travel between universes had become mostly impossible after the death of the Time Lords. She spent years trying to find a way back to the Doctor. She found one, and returned to her original universe in time to help the Doctor stop the Daleks one last time. In the process, the Meta-Crisis Doctor was created, and after their victory the Doctor took him and Rose back to Pete's World, explaining that his meta-crisis identity needed her, just as he had, when they first met, and that, being part human, he could also grow old with her. She remained in her new universe with her mother, brother and that universe's Pete Tyler. Her closest contact with the Doctor, for a period of her life, arrived when another companion of the Doctor fell into her universe specifically to comfort her. Settling into her new life with the Meta-Crisis Doctor, Rose later became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter. Years later, she was briefly transported to her original universe and met the Eighth and Eleventh Doctors, after which she returned to her family.\n\nRose was born in London (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) to Jackie (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and Pete Tyler (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) around, or in, 1986, (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., PROSE: Rose Tyler [+]BBC webteam, U.N.I.T. (BBC, 2005).) or on 27 April 1987, as her father died on 7 November 1987, when he was hit by a car while she was six months old.

Page 38.)\n\nRose and her mother lived at 48 Bucknall House, Powell Estate, London, (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) SE15 7GO. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) She played in the garden at the estate. (AUDIO: The Last Days of the Powell Estate [+]Timothy X Atack, The Ninth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2025).) She attended Jericho Street Junior School, and won a bronze medal as part of the gymnastic team. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) At some point, she joined the Girl Guides, expressing pride as an adult in having done so. (AUDIO: Infamy of the Zaross [+]John Dorney, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nSometime in Rose's childhood, a cat wandered into Rose and Jackie's apartment. Despite many attempts to get rid of it, the cat stayed and they gave in, with the cat living for five more years. This cat turned out to be Mitzi, the first cat in Hyperspace, who Rose and the Tenth Doctor encountered in the future on the planet Phostris. Recognising her pet, Rose and the Doctor went back to the Powell Estate and dropped Mitzi off, who would go on to live with Rose and Jackie, being renamed Puffin. (PROSE: The Cat Came Back [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Storybook 2007 (Doctor Who Storybook, 2006).)\n\nSeveral times during her childhood, she was, unbeknownst to her, visited and watched over by her future friend, Captain Jack Harkness, who was stranded on Earth after having been left on Satellite Five. Jack did not say hello, in order to avoid damaging their timeline. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nWhen Rose was eight, her mother took her to France via a ferry. At the same age, she suffered a bad case of stage fright when playing the Angel Gabriel at a school pantomime, an experience that left her with a distaste for live performances. (PROSE: He's Behind You [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).) Other accounts, however, stated that Rose had only ever been to Tenby and Paris, France, the latter on a school trip when she was thirteen in around 2000. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005)., COMIC: Art Attack [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (2005).)\n\nWhen Rose was either eight or nine years old, her grandfather Prentice passed. Though the funeral was a sombre affair, the lively wake would stick with Rose for years as a celebration of her grandfather's life. (AUDIO: The Last Party on Earth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen Rose and her friend Shareen were ten, they planned to sneak out to Danny Fennel's party and pinched a bottle of wine from Jackie's kitchen cupboard to get them in the mood. After a glass each they fell asleep, missed the party and got scolded by Jackie. (PROSE: The Stone Rose [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2006).)\n\nWhen Rose was twelve, she begged her mother for a red bicycle for Christmas, but Jackie couldn't afford it. The Doctor later heard this story from Rose and went back in time to buy her the bicycle for Christmas. (PROSE: The Red Bicycle [+]Gary Russell, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).)\n\nWhen Rose was thirteen, in 2000 or 2001, Rose went on a school trip to (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) Paris, (COMIC: Art Attack [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (2005).) in France, with Shareen Costello. They were meant to go to the Musee de Louvre (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) to see the Mona Lisa, (COMIC: Art Attack [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (2005).) but they \"escaped\" their teachers, and caught a train to Parc Asterix. They were caught by the police when they were waiting the queue for the Menhir Express. They were sent home, accompanied by Mrs Kissock, ruining her trip as well. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) Because they flunked off, they never got to see the Mona Lisa. (COMIC: Art Attack [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (2005).) Also when Rose was thirteen, she had a boyfriend who she later described as a \"master\" of food fights. (PROSE: The Monsters Inside [+]Stephen Cole, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nWhen Rose was fourteen she had a crush on Jay Selby, the brother of her clubbing friend Keisha. Rose spent many nights awake dreaming of Jay. She'd never really been able to talk to him properly until five years later when she helped him to escape the Waterhives. (PROSE: The Feast of the Drowned [+]Stephen Cole, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2006).) Around this time, in 2002, Rose began going out with Mickey Smith, though she maintained that \"it [was] nothing special\"; (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) however, Rose's mother, Jackie, was \"delighted\" by their relationship. (AUDIO: Flight Into Hull! [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nWhen Rose was fifteen, she was suspended from Jericho Street Comprehensive for persuading the school choir to go on strike for three days. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).)\n\nRose was a babysitter for Cleo Proctor. (AUDIO: Salvation [+]Juno Dawson, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).)\n\nIn September 2002, when Rose was fifteen (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) or sixteen, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) when she met twenty year old Jimmy Stone, the bass guitarist in the band No Hot Ashes, which was local to the Powell Estate. He had a reputation of being the \"Fittest Boy\" on the estate, and Rose fell \"head over heels\" in love with him. Rose dumped her current boyfriend, Mickey Smith, and dropped out of school and her A levels, and moved into a bedsit with Jimmy. Jackie was unimpressed with Rose's choice, (AUDIO: Flight Into Hull! [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018).) though Rose still moved out. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).)\n\nFive months later, by February 2003, their relationship broke apart, Rose returned home, heartbroken, and £800 in debt. Meanwhile, Jimmy had travelled to Amsterdam with a woman named Noosh in a camper van. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) According to another account, they broke up after being together for a year, sometime in late 2003. When he left, Rose told him that \"he'd come to no good one day\", as he stole her second-hand computer which he stashed inside his car. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Jackie prided herself on helping Rose get over the relationship. (AUDIO: Flight Into Hull! [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018)., PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) Some time after, Jackie was once again delighted when Rose rekindled her relationship with Mickey, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) who was \"patient and uncomplaining and forgiving.\" (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).)\n\nAccording to one account, Rose began working at Henrik's Department Store after Jackie called in a favour from an old boyfriend, at least six months after Rose broke up with Jimmy. Rose worked her way up from the stock floor to the shop floor, and, while the job admittedly bored her, she felt it necessary \"to pay her mother rent and earn her way in the world.\" (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) According to another account, Rose began working for Henrik's some months prior to the end of her relationship with Jimmy, seemingly getting the job herself. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nAt one point, she was asked by Mickey's friend Vic to pose for photographs. However, as he wanted her to pose in just her knickers, Rose declined. (PROSE: The Stone Rose [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2006).)\n\nWhen she was about nineteen, Rose had her first encounter with the Doctor just after midnight on 1 January, 2005. Whilst walking home with her mother, Rose heard the Tenth Doctor, who was dying from radiation poisoning after defeating the Master and saving Wilfred Mott, from behind her, (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) but she was unable to see his face due to the shadows and snow. Mistaking him for a drunk, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) she asked if he was all right and told him the date when he asked. The Doctor told her that 2005 was going to be a great year for her. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) Trusting the kind, joyful voice that seemed tailored for her, Rose believed him (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) and returned the smile before continuing on to the estate. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nAs the year continued on, Rose found that she did not have the great experience the supposed drunk had promised her. However, she continued to believe what he said, despite not believing the claims of the many other drunken men she had met in her life. As such, she kept waiting for the \"great year\" to begin for her. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nOn 4 March, 2005, at the end of her day's work shift, Rose was asked to give lottery winnings to Henrik's chief electrician, Wilson. Unable to find him in the store's basement, Rose wandered into a storage room, where she was almost killed by living plastic creatures called Autons, when the Ninth Doctor pulled Rose away and ran with her. Escaping together inside a lift, he pulled an Auton's arm off, tossing it to her. The Doctor warned Rose he was going to use explosives against the relay transmitting to the Autons and told her to run for her life. The Doctor destroyed the store shortly after Rose escaped, leaving her jobless. That night, Rose had Mickey throw it in a bin.\n\nMeeting the Doctor again the next day when he tracked her down to her flat, Rose was attacked by the arm from the store that had returned of its own volition. The arm latched onto her face, and after a small skirmish, the Doctor deactivated it and left, telling Rose to forget him. After searching for online information about the Doctor on Mickey's computer, and coming across a website titled Doctor Who? Rose met with its webmaster, Clive Finch, who showed her clippings of the Doctor's appearances throughout history, though she ended up dismissing him as a conspiracy freak. She returned to Mickey's car, where, unbeknownst to her, he had been replaced with an Auton duplicate, and they went out to get pizza at a restaurant. There, the duplicate of Mickey ignored Rose's musings about her future employment and repeatedly attempted to question her about the Doctor, until the Doctor himself arrived and pulled his head off in a scuffle.\n\nEscaping from the duplicate's attacking body, the Doctor and Rose entered the TARDIS, where the Doctor used the Auton's head to trace the signal of the Nestene Consciousness. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However, according to one account, they were pursued by Autons disguised as living statues before making their way into the Consciousness's base beneath the London Eye, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) where they found the real Mickey alive. When the Consciousness refused to leave Earth and began the invasion instead, the Autons took the Doctor prisoner and confiscated the anti-plastic he was holding.\n\nUnable to escape the Nestene Consciousness's base without access to the TARDIS, Rose used her gymnastic skills to kick the Autons, and the anti-plastic, into the vat containing the Nestene Consciousness. This saved the Doctor's life, and destroyed the Consciousness, foiling the invasion. Escaping with Rose and the real Mickey to safety in the TARDIS, the Doctor asked Rose to travel with him. She initially declined, until he returned to state that the TARDIS also travelled in time, causing her to kiss and thank Mickey goodbye before running into the TARDIS. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nAccording to one dissenting account, Rose first met the Ninth Doctor when he was fighting the Autons with Jack Harkness. She helped them take out the Autons by throwing cabbage at them, and then had tea in the TARDIS. (PROSE: Dr. Ninth [+]Adam Hargreaves, Dr. Men (Puffin Books, 2017).)\n\nFor her first trip through time, the Doctor took Rose to Platform One in the year 5,000,000,000, to observe the end of the Earth as it was consumed by the sun. Rose was introduced to several alien guests that had come to witness the event for \"fun\", which intimidated her. To help her cope with the culture shock, the Doctor upgraded Rose's mobile phone so that she could speak to her mother, Jackie, five billion years in the past. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) On that Wednesday in 2005, John Smith received a wrong number call from Rose, who he dismissed as a nutter. (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) After the entire platform shook, the Doctor went off to investigate the maintenance ducts with Jabe of the Forest of Cheem, leaving Rose to chat with the \"last human\", Lady Cassandra. The encounter ended acrimoniously, with Rose insulting Cassandra for undergoing so much plastic surgery that she had no humanity left.\n\nIn retaliation, Cassandra sent the Adherents of the Repeated Meme to knock Rose unconscious and drag her into a viewing gallery, where a sun filter was descending and the unblocked sunlight would kill her. The Doctor reversed the filter just in time, but the door was left jammed from the heat. As part of her fraudulent murder scheme, Cassandra deactivated the platform's safety measures and teleported away, expecting to profit from the guests' rivals' shares upon their deaths. The Exoglass in Rose's gallery began to crack and let in sunlight as the heat reached critical levels, but the Doctor managed to reactivate the force-fields just before the sun consumed the Earth.\n\nRose made it out of her room in time to see the Doctor reverse the relay in Cassandra's teleport and bring Cassandra back to the station. Without her surgeons to moisturise her, Cassandra's skin graft dried out and exploded, (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) though her brain-meat survived. (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Platform One was closed for maintenance and the Doctor returned Rose to London in 2005, where he told her of the Last Great Time War, and revealed he was the last of the Time Lords. They then went to get chips (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and were spotted by dalek, who later reported the sighting to Who is Doctor Who?. (PROSE: Rose sighting confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nAiming for 1860s Naples but arriving instead in 1869 Cardiff, the Doctor and Rose found a deceased woman possessed by a Gelth, a creature turned to gas by the Time War. Rose chased after undertaker Mr Sneed and his servant Gwyneth, who had taken the woman's corpse into their hearse. Rose was chloroformed and taken to Sneed and Company, where other \"zombies\" had also been animated by the Gelth. The Doctor chased after Rose along with Charles Dickens, arriving just in time to rescue her. Rose later befriended Gwyneth, who had been born with clairvoyant abilities and saw the future in Rose's mind.\n\nIn the morgue, the Doctor had Gwyneth try and pull the Gelth through the Rift using her psychic connection to it from a young age. The Gelth, numbering in the billions rather than just a few, wished to wipe out humanity and take over their bodies. The Doctor, Rose and Dickens were able to escape from the Gelth by filling the room with gas, sucking out the Gelth from the cadavers. Gwyneth, who had already died from contacting the Gelth, lit a match and ignited the gas, trapping them and saving the world. (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Rose and the Doctor were seen in the background of a photograph taken of Dickens, (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Rose sighting confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) although another account showed that the photograph was just of Rose and the Doctor. (PROSE: Mickey's Blog [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013).)\n\nWhile the Doctor and Rose were investigating a time puncture in 2005 Toronto, they became embroiled in a Causubus plot to feed off the time energy of Count Nikolai Artem Livosich when their investigation led them to 1812 St Petersburg. The Doctor was able to placate the Causbus by giving them a time ribbon filled with his temporal energy, and then used the TARDIS to \"plug\" the time puncture. (PROSE: Rose and the Snow Window [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nPer her request, Rose was taken home. However, instead of arriving twelve hours later as the Doctor promised, Rose found she had been away for an entire year and that Mickey had been blamed by Jackie for her disappearance. While Rose attempted to calm her mother, an alien spacecraft crashed through Big Ben and into the River Thames. After UNIT were alerted to the Doctor's presence by Rose's mother, Jackie, they escorted the Doctor and Rose to 10 Downing Street to help deal with the state of emergency. While the Doctor convened with other alien experts to discuss the crisis, Rose was left with the MP Harriet Jones to look after her. In the Cabinet Room, Harriet showed Rose the skin suits the Slitheen were using to disguise themselves, having murdered various officials to infiltrate Downing Street. They were surprised by Indra Ganesh, then by Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen, who revealed her true form and strangled him. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nAfter Indra was killed, the Doctor was able to save Harriet and Rose from the same fate using an electrified ID badge to remotely electrocute the rest of the Slitheen family. He later found them and distracted the Slitheen before Harriet guided them all to the Cabinet Room. Inside, the Doctor shut them behind a steel barrier. Under siege in the Cabinet Room, the Doctor learned the spaceship belonged to the Slitheen, who planned to reduce Earth to radioactive waste to sell as cheap fuel on the intergalactic market, using nuclear launch codes held by the United Nations. The Doctor contacted Mickey on Rose's phone, directing him to launch the Harpoon missile, UGM-84A, at Downing Street from the HMS Taurean.\n\nLeaving the Slitheen to be destroyed by the missile, Rose found a small, sturdy cupboard inside the Cabinet Room which she, the Doctor and Harriet used to safely ride out the explosion and emerge from the rubble unharmed. Much to her surprise, Rose learned from the Doctor that Harriet would become Prime Minister for three successful terms for Britain's Golden Age. Packing some belongings to continue travelling with the Doctor, Rose promised her mother that the next time she'd see them, it would be ten seconds later (unknown to Rose, however, she would not return when she said she would). (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor and Rose travelled to London in 1966 to the site of Rose's estate before it was built. They had discovered someone had been changing history, and a housing development called Brandon Mews had been built on the estate's future, even though there should have been nothing there except fields. The Doctor went to a pub to check the Daily Mirror for any other alterations to history, and discovered the football score in the World Cup had England scoring an extra goal against West Germany.\n\nWhile the Doctor had learnt from Charlotte Cobb that her husband Peter Cobb had mysteriously died after being followed by Lend-a-Hand girls, Rose had gone to Lend-a-Hand House and found that humans were also being converted into Lend-a-Hand girls. While the Doctor discovered Igrix' plans to destroy the Moon and prevent humanity from venturing out into space, killing any scientist who would create things \"that would make people unhappy\", Rose went to Peter's office to find out why he could have been murdered, discovering Peter's work on DNA resequencing. Igrix' first major step was to destroy the Moon in 1966, preventing any staging post from which to break out into space. With the help of Peter's papers, the Doctor created a virus containing genetic instructions from Rose in the form of perfume, which Rose threw at the Lend-a-Hand girls, which were initially made up of female humans, but later included biotechnology grown from Kustollon genestuff, making them humans with human instructions.\n\nThe Doctor and Rose climbed to the top of the Post Office Tower to stop Igrix using his spaceship to fire at the Moon. The Doctor did this by spraying the human virus at his biotech ship. The ship refused to take orders from Igrix, and flew into space to explore and spend some \"quality time\" with Igrix. Setting history back on course, the Doctor used his sonic screwdriver to destroy the housing development, and make them start over and build Rose's future home. (COMIC: The Love Invasion [+]Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman, DWM Comics (2005).)\n\nThe Doctor took Rose to see the Mona Lisa at the grand opening of the Oriel, a transdimensional art gallery in the 37th century, only for the Doctor to find that all the humanoids in the gallery, including Rose, had been enslaved by an artist called Cazkelf. Cazkelf used the psychic energy of the visitors to send a distress signal to his people so he could return home, but the Doctor freed Rose and set up a feedback loop, returning the stolen psychic energy back to its owners. The signal was still successfully sent, but Cazkelf's people did not arrive at the Oriel. The Doctor took Cazkelf to his homeworld, which had been devastated by a disaster. Afterwards, Cazkelf returned to Earth. Expecting to face consequences, the materialisation of the TARDIS before the visitors made them believe this was all part of a performance art piece. The Doctor advised Cazkelf to \"delight and amaze\" them. (COMIC: Art Attack [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (2005).)\n\nThe Doctor took Rose on a cruise on 22nd century Mars, where the two were stowaways on the cruise ship holding a private wedding party of 143-year-old plutocrat Alvar Chambers. When Alvar ordered the Doctor to be thrown into the Martian sea, the Doctor's body was taken over by a body-stealing entity that ate people by feeding on their worst fears, putting them into a state where their identities would dissolve within it while they were dreaming. The entity tormented Rose with a nightmare of what felt like her entire lifespan where the Doctor came back too late in Rose's life for her to be a companion and stole her daughter in this dream world, Susannah to travel with him as his own companion. Rose saw through this illusion and found the real Doctor trapped within the entity, tasking her with freeing its surviving victims while the Doctor dealt with the actual creature, although Alvar and his new wife Susannah didn't make it. As the creature required a stable image refracted in the air to sustain itself, the Doctor used the artificial air inside the cruise ship's air bubble to create a \"tornado\". The Doctor believed that it was still out there, waiting to happen again, but hoped this meant the humans would start treating Mars with respect now. (COMIC: The Cruel Sea [+]Robert Shearman, DWM Comics (2005).)\n\nThe Doctor and Rose travelled to a Vandosian ship, saving Phil Tyson from execution by the Vandos Tribunal. While escaping, Phil saved the Doctor and Rose from the Bailiffs and made it to the TARDIS. The Tribunal threatened to destroy Great Britain if Phil wasn't handed over to them. They fired, but thanks to the Doctor's earlier efforts, the ship backfired on itself. Returning Phil home, the Doctor explained that Shogalath was, in fact, the leader of a peaceful revolt against the Imperium and a \"hero\". Phil departed their company with a new lease on life, seeking to make a good future for himself. (COMIC: Mr Nobody [+]Scott Gray, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor and Rose met Emily Brontë. (AUDIO: The Window on the Moor [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nTracking a distress signal, the Doctor and Rose arrived in 2012 Utah, in an underground alien musueum called the Vault owned by billionaire Henry van Statten. While the Doctor, unbeknownst to Rose, was being interrogated for his alien knowledge, Rose was shown various pieces of alien technology by one of van Statten's young researchers, Adam Mitchell, who had always dreamed of seeing the stars. They discovered the living creature in van Statten's Cage, which he called a \"Metaltron\", being tortured. Rose rushed to its attention, unaware that it was a Dalek, a survivor from the Time War and one of the Doctor's deadliest foes. Feeling pity for the Dalek, who claimed it was dying, she touched its casing.\n\nBy extrapolating Rose's DNA, which contained radiation from the Time Vortex, the Dalek was able to regenerate itself and escape the cage. With no orders, it chose to destroy everyone inside. The Doctor was released in an attempt to fight off the Dalek, but as Rose and Adam tried to escape, the Doctor was forced to close the bulkhead door with Rose trapped on one side to keep the Dalek from slaughtering all of humanity. The Dalek found itself unable to kill Rose, and the Doctor let it through, not wanting to risk losing her again.\n\nThe Doctor armed himself with alien weaponry and prepared to kill his oldest enemy, which he claimed had destroyed his home and people, once and for all, but Rose stood in his way. To the Doctor's shock, the Dalek's personality had changed after absorbing Rose's DNA. Considering its new feelings \"sickness\", it committed suicide, leaving the Doctor the only survivor of the Time War. With van Statten deposed by his second-in-commmand, Rose offered to invite Adam (who was out of a job as the Vault was being filled with cement, and didn't have anyone else) into the TARDIS, and the Doctor left the ship's doors unlocked for him to wander inside as it dematerialised. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Some time following this encounter, Rose told her mother about the Daleks; when Jackie saw one herself the following year, she said that Rose was \"terrified\" of them. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThe Doctor initially attempted to return Adam home but found the TARDIS knocked slightly off course by a temporal tsunami as they arrived in Birmingham 2012. Rose would soon find herself temporally displaced to 1922, forcing the Doctor, who was himself sent to 1894, to wait 28 years to catch up with her. When Adam proved his worth by assisting in defeating the Bygone Horde which caused the anomalies, the Doctor accepted him as a companion alongside Rose and set a course for the far future. (AUDIO: The Other Side [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn Adam's first trip in the TARDIS, the Doctor took his two companions to the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire to see the human race at its zenith. Pretending to be management on Earth's orbiting news broadcaster, Satellite Five, the Doctor and his companions found the Empire had been manipulated; its development stunted, and the technology being decades behind what it should have been. Adam, who was suffering from severe culture shock, was left on his own to \"acclimatise\". After hacking into the computer system, the Doctor and Rose found that the unusual levels of heat on the Satellite were due to the cooling systems being vented up to Floor 500. The Editor, discovering their interference, gave the Doctor and Rose the key to reach him on Floor 500 and imprisoned them. He revealed the Mighty Jagrafess was manipulating the information distributed by Satellite Five to control humanity, even having them develop backwards technology to assist in this matter.\n\nThe Jagrafess and the Editor tried stealing the TARDIS key from Adam, whom Rose had lent it to, but thanks to one of the workers who learned the truth, the safety was breached, freeing the Doctor, Rose and Adam and rerouting the heat to Floor 500 to destroy the Jagrafess. The Doctor believed that this would have accelerated the human race's development, \"all back to normal\". Upon finding out Adam was trying to learn about the future of the 21st century's technology for his own gain, the Doctor promptly \"evicted\" him from his TARDIS travels and took him home. (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhen the Doctor took Rose to the monument of Drake Ayelbourne of Altair VII, the man abducted Rose. Though he claimed it was due to Rose reminding him of his deceased wife, it soon transpired that Ayelborune simply thought himself entitled to Rose, the Doctor soon collapsing the monument. As the two prepared to leave, Adam Mitchell, years having passed for him, returned, seeking vengeance on the two, rendering both of them unconscious and taking Rose. (COMIC: Mystery Date [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) Along with all of the Doctor's other companions, Rose was then kept in suspended animation, (COMIC: The Choice [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) before being released by Frobisher to fight the Tremas Master's Auton army. After Adam Mitchell had given his life to stop the Master's plan, Rose and the Doctor returned to their proper place in time. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor then took Rose to Justice Alpha, the first alien planet she had ever stood on. The pair were arrested for trespassing, and Rose was incarcerated on Justice Beta while the Doctor was sent to a non-human prison on Justice Prime. Rose soon uncovered that the whole prison system had been infiltrated by the Blathereen family, who intended to use the prisoners as resources for their own devious plan. Eventually Rose and the Doctor were reunited on Justice Delta, and with the help of some prison inmates and a trio of Slitheen, were able to thwart the Blathereen plot. (PROSE: The Monsters Inside [+]Stephen Cole, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nTaking Rose home once again, the Doctor saved the Powell Estate from Zargath and his invasion force by making it rain with the sonic screwdriver. Rose realised that Zargath's militia was allergic to water. (COMIC: Death to the Doctor! [+]Jonathan Morris, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2007).)\n\nAt Rose's request, the Doctor took her to her mother and her father, Pete Tyler's, wedding. After this, he took her to the church where Stuart Hoskins and Sarah Clark were to be wed on 7 November, 1987, not far from where Pete died. Rose crossed the path of her past self, who was unable to go to Pete as he died, and saved Pete from a hit-and-run death. Rose's actions caused damage to the timeline and the inside of the TARDIS to be thrown off into the time vortex. Enraged by her reckless behaviour, the Doctor suspected that she had only agreed to travel with him to save Pete, though Rose insisted she hadn't planned it but simply saw an opportunity to save Pete. The Doctor was so angry that he demanded the TARDIS key from her and walked away, threatening to abandon her in the past.\n\nRose, keeping her true identity secret from her father, was invited over to his flat, and realised he wasn't the successful inventor she thought he was (but could have been, given time). Pretending to be a wedding guest, she then accompanied him to Stuart and Sarah's wedding and was further disappointed to see Pete and Jackie's own marriage had become rocky. The wedding was then attacked by creatures from outside time, that were assailing the Earth to seal off the paradox Rose had created. Under siege inside the church with the other wedding guests, (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) with someone recording a wedding video, (PROSE: Essay Competition [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) the Doctor and Rose eventually reconciled; the Doctor admitting he wouldn't have really left. He started working on a way to repair the damage to the universe while leaving Pete alive for Rose.\n\nThe Doctor attempted to use his TARDIS key, which was still linked to the ship's interior, to bring the TARDIS back. However, after Pete accidentally made Rose hold her infant self, the Doctor was forced to sacrifice himself to the creature brought inside the church by the paradox and the creature was zapped by the key, interrupting the TARDIS' return. Pete, who realised that his survival of the hit-and-run was what caused the creatures' attack in the first place, said his goodbyes to his wife and daughter and ran in front of the car (which was stuck in a time loop outside, awaiting him). The Doctor and everyone else was brought back, and thanks to these events, the new timeline had Rose be there for her father when he died. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nTo cheer Rose up, the Doctor took her to a Parisian café in 1923, playing with the salt and pepper shakers. Unbeknownst to either, they were observed by the Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors along with their companions, from afar. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor took Rose to meet Althea Bryce. (AUDIO: Her Own Bootstraps [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe TARDIS was forced down to London because of the presence of two Shadeys from another dimension, whom had brought Robert Greene, a rival playwright of William Shakespeare's, four hundred years into the future. After realising that Shakespeare was remembered in the future while Greene was not, Greene used the powers granted to him by the Shadeys, powered by his \"negative energy\", to spread rot across London. When the Shadeys discovered the Doctor's presence, they decided to toy with the Doctor by meddling with time and have Greene kill Shakespeare in 1592. Going back in time to protect the famous playwright and actor, Rose tried distracting Shakespeare away from his performance on stage while the Doctor took his place, but Greene discovered them, and Rose and Shakespeare ran back to the Doctor's performance in Richard III to warn him they were right behind them. In return for relinquishing the power of the Shadeys and saving the world, the Doctor and Rose promised to remember Greene, and Green banished the Shadeys, returning to his deathbed where he was dying of plague. The Doctor lamented that the fate of being forgotten seemed to be unavoidable for anybody, but Rose gave him the reassurance no one would ever forget him. (COMIC: A Groatsworth of Wit [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2005).)\n\nOne night, the Doctor told Rose the story of Godfather Death. She thought Death, when talking about how deaths were fixed, sounded like him. (PROSE: The Knight, The Fool and The Dead [+]Steve Cole, Time Lord Victorious (BBC Books, 2020).)\n\nThe TARDIS arrived in the Dark Times in the midst of the Eternal War, and the Doctor and Rose were captured by Gallifreyan forces led by Rassilon. They escaped during an attack of Cucurbites, but Rose was snatched by a Vampire. She was taken to a coffin ship, where Friar Grystok, an acolyte of the Three Mad Sisters, was intrigued by her, as humans did not exist this early in the universe. She was ordered to get changed and refused, however relented when Centia, a slave sent to help her, said she'd be punished if Rose didn't comply. Rose was taken to the Sisters, who attacked her and turned her into a Vampire, exhausting themselves in the process. The Doctor tracked her down and was taken to her. Under Vampiric influence, she attacked him, but a Gallifreyan attack on the coffin ship distracted her, enabling the Doctor to send her to sleep. He used synth-blood to treat her infection, knowing she would need some time to rest. She awoke some time later on a moon, being cared for by Centia. The Doctor was present when she awoke and they embraced. He explained how he had freed the Vampire slaves and together they returned to the TARDIS and left the Dark Times. (COMIC: Monstrous Beauty [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2020).)\n\nThe Doctor and Rose visited Jackie, who had become a very successful saleswoman on the Powell Estate selling Glubby Glubs: objects which helped people sleep for a full eight or nine hours. However, it turned out that the Glubby Glubs were taking energy from their users and passing it on to the seller. With Jackie's help, the Doctor stopped the corporation responsible and ended the Glubby Glub fad. (AUDIO: Retail Therapy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Rose tracked a \"mauve and dangerous\" object through the vortex to 1941 London. After landing, Rose spotted a mysterious boy in a gas mask on a nearby roof, asking for his mother. She climbed a rope to reach him, but it was the rope of a barrage balloon which had come loose and she was carried off into the Blitz-torn sky. The ex-Time Agent Jack Harkness rescued Rose from falling, bringing her aboard his invisible warship and, believing she and the Doctor were Time Agents, offered to sell them the object they were chasing, which he called \"the last Chula warship in existence\".\n\nJack and Rose followed the Doctor to Albion Hospital, not far from the crash site at Limehouse Green station, where living dead creatures, with gas masks fused to their face and identical symptoms, including a scar on the hand in the same place as the child that Rose had seen, were being kept. Jack, upon realising the Doctor and Rose weren't Time Agents but freelancers like himself, revealed he was conning them and the object was a Chula ambulance, which Jack himself had used to attract one of the agency as part of a con to sell half of the object right before a German bomb hit it, instead bringing the attention of the Doctor and Rose. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWith the hospital overrun by gas-masked creatures, Jack teleported the Doctor and Rose to his warship, and together they went to the bombsite near the hospital, where they realised the truth: Jack had believed the object to be empty space junk, but in fact, the ambulance contained nanogenes. Having never encountered a human before, the nanogenes took the gas mask to be the child's face and fused it to him, spreading to other people who touched him and also transforming them into undead gas-masked creatures. The ambulance activated its emergency protocols, calling the creatures, who had been armed as \"Chula warriors\", and were ready to \"tear the world apart\" to find the boy's mother.\n\nAs every patient and soldier at the bomb-site converged on the Doctor, Rose and Jack, the Doctor was able to fix the nanogenes' mistakes by comparing the DNA of the child and Nancy, who was his mother, thus restoring the infected zombies to normal. Jack in turn prevented the bomb from hitting the bomb-site by placing it in stasis inside his warship and when everyone got to safety, the Doctor destroyed the ambulance, making sure that history said that a bomb hit that location. The Doctor rescued Jack from his Chula warship just before it exploded, taking him aboard the TARDIS as his latest companion. (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nDuring an adventure with the Doctor and Jack, Rose accidentally married a pre-historical human called Tillun, and she became a widow when Tillun lived out his human life in his own time period. (PROSE: Only Human [+]Gareth Roberts, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor took Rose and Jack to where the planet Excroth should have been, but found it was gone. The TARDIS was taken aboard a Lect spaceship, but the Doctor and Jack escaped after it was attacked by Unon. Rose was blasted into the Time Vortex, but was protected from the time winds by the tachyon inhibitor she found. She was pulled into the time scoops of Glom's ship, and subsequently spent four days working on Glom's stall at the Fluren Temporal Bazaar. The Doctor called the attention of the Unon, but attracted the Lect who attacked one another, and which subsequently led to the emergency protocol being triggered, dissipating the time bubble protecting Fluren's World. Rose was taken by the Lect to serve them, and discovered they were Excrothians from Excroth, and the Unon had destroyed their home planet with an entropy engine.\n\nRose tricked the Doctor into revealing the co-ordinates of the Perpetual City, and had him taken aboard the Lect command ship to get him out of there. With the Lect seeking revenge, the Doctor took Grand Prelon Marleth to destroy the entropy engine, telling a disagreeing Rose that it was Marleth's choice to do so. When the Doctor took as many Unon as they could, telling them that the universe had to look after itself and not be controlled by the Unon, Rose told them it was a fresh start. (COMIC: Weapons of Past Destruction [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor, Rose and Jack visited the Eye of Orion, where they encountered the famous geohacker Taggani. (COMIC: Hacked) Not long after, the Doctor brought Rose back to 2006 to catch up with her mother. (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nOn an adventure to Melakeenia Beta, Rose flew the TARDIS while the Doctor pulled Jack back inside, having her piloting criticised by her fellows. (COMIC: Secret Agent Man [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).)\n\nWhen the three continued to search for leads on Jack's missing memories, they were brought to Gharusa Prime in the 38th century where Doctormania was a popular television show. When the Doctor had been arrested for identity theft, Rose used the psychic paper to enter the television studio where she found that the false Doctor was Slist Fayflut Marteveerthon Slitheen, who rendered her unconscious and planted a bomb in her arm. Despite the explosive, when Slist took the stage on Clix, Rose exposed her as an impostor which wound up implicating her as well in the eyes of the Raxas Alliance. Made the target of a hunt, Slist and Rose fled into the jungle, hiding from acid rain that had melted part of Slist's skin before Jack and the Doctor arrived. After having the bomb removed, Rose and Slist made their way to weather control to expose Gleda Ley-Sooth Marka Jinglatheen's treachery. After the Senior Envoy had been arrested, the group left Clix, the Doctor directing Rose to the waterfall room to clean herself. (COMIC: Doctormania [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nOnce she and Jack were cleaned up, they saw that the TARDIS had landed in San Francisco, Rose eagerly running out to see the city. She met the superhuman Deano, and, infatuated, tried to get his attention by standing on a tall building only to slip. However, instead of falling, she discovered that she too could fly, and she joined the other superhumans. When the superhumans began abusing a frightened gargoyle however, Rose stood up for it until Dean began mutating into a gargoyle himself. When Jack caught up with her, he revealed that their mutations were caused by the energy of a wormhole, Rose boldly leading her fellows through it to confront the aliens on the other side before the Doctor managed to collapse the portal. Back in San Francisco, Rose noted that Dean was missing, and the Doctor reassured her that they would find him when they got the TARDIS back. (COMIC: The Transformed [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2016).)\n\nTracking Dean down to Blaise Castle in the 1970s (or possibly the 1980s), the group met Tara Mishra before the castle was demolished by a monster and UNIT arrived to take Dean into custody as the monster vanished. Brought back to UNIT HQ, the Doctor, Rose and Jack were informed that giant monsters were terrorising England. Initially staying by Dean's side, Rose joined the Doctor in the field when Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart returned, where the Doctor used a sonic cannon to destroy an aquatic monster where Albion Defense was contracted to take over UNIT operations. When Rose freed Dean from Albion's cage, she was taken to their base. Meeting the imprisoned Harry Sullivan, Rose revealed the hidden sonic screwdriver in her boot and the two exposed Albion as the ones responsible for creating the monsters, which were nothing more than illusions. After UNIT was reinstated and Dean set free, the TARDIS trio followed a lead to the 17th century on Jack's missing memories only for Tara Mishra to have boarded the TARDIS. (COMIC: Official Secrets [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nArriving in Brazil in 1682, Rose was teased by Jack for her obvious jealousy at Tara's quick bond with the Doctor before they ran across the Bandeirante, Portuguese slave traders. Still jealous, Rose joined Jack in investigating a Time Agency safehouse where they found a record that Zloy Volk, a man whom Jack had executed, was still alive. After saving the Doctor from the Lpupiara, an ashamed Jack said goodbye to the group, using his vortex manipulator to find answers on his own. (COMIC: Slaver's Song [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen patients of the Hesguard Institute in the 53rd century began relapsing, the Doctor framed himself for Tara's murder so he could infiltrate the facility, Rose posing as an Earth Examiner. When the Institute attempted to transfer the Doctor's negative emotions into a Sin-Eater, his telepathic abilities interfered with the process, creating a misshapen being driven by his self-loathing and memories of his previous incarnations. After the Doctor had banished the being to the Void along with the facility's Matryoshka drive, Rose informed Tara that such a quick getaway was standard for them. (COMIC: Sin-Eaters [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).)\n\nAfter the Doctor had gotten a lead on Jack, he, Rose and Tara flew to Nomicae in the 54th century. No sooner had they located Jack did they fall into a trap set by Addison Delamar who had masterminded the trail of Jack's memories to harvest the Doctor's memories. Given an experience sphere, Rose was detained within the Memgram experience network. Just as she, Jack and Tara reunited, the Cybermen began attacking, triggering Rose's memory of a negated timeline that overloaded the spheres. After the Cybermen had been defeated, the Doctor openly broadcasted the grief he felt about the Time War, driving away the other auctioneers before Jack duped Delamar into leaving. When the time came to leave however, Tara stayed behind to help Nomicae rebuild. (COMIC: The Bidding War [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nWhen Jack eventually went back for Tara, Rose and the Doctor went to 1886 where Rose met Vastra and Jenny Flint. When they were shipwrecked, the four found themselves on an island populated by Silurians of the scholar caste who carried a deadly plague but served as emissaries of the Fourth Doctor to deliver a message to the Ninth about a malignant white energy. After escaping the Silurians who had fallen prey to the energy, the Doctor deposited everyone at Vastra's house in Victorian era London while he left to handle the crisis, later returning for Rose once it had been solved. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS became powerless to travel through time, the Doctor went to 2006 Cardiff so the ship could refuel via a scar in the rift that was closed by Gwyneth. Whilst in Cardiff, the Doctor and his two companions, joined by Mickey, captured Blon, the sole Slitheen survivor of the attack on Downing Street, who had since become Lord Mayor. Though Blon tried to flee, the Doctor reversed her teleportation device several times until she gave up, and took her prisoner aboard the TARDIS until he could return her to Raxacoricofallapatorius to face execution after her family had already been sentenced to death in their absence. In the process, he and Jack confiscated her extrapolator to use as a \"power-booster\" in the TARDIS console.\n\nMeanwhile, Rose reconnected with Mickey, who offered to spend the night with her at a hotel but later claimed to be seeing Trisha Delaney in her absence. The two got into an argument; Rose felt he was lying about the woman he was supposedly with, while Mickey was fed up with Rose taking him for granted. While trying to reconcile with Mickey, Rose ran for the TARDIS when earthquakes started hitting Cardiff; Blon tried to tear the TARDIS and the Earth apart by making the extrapolator lock onto an alien power source that was refuelling on the rift, using the extrapolator as an interstellar surfboard to escape the Earth. After Blon looked into the heart of the TARDIS and was regressed back into an egg, Rose left Mickey behind to start a new relationship with someone else. Because of her time with the Doctor, she realised her relationship with Mickey could not be salvaged, and believed he deserved someone better. Hoping to offer Blon a \"second chance\" in life, the Doctor decided to drop her off in the hatchery on her homeworld. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Meanwhile, on Earth, Mickey came to terms with his relationship with Rose ending. (PROSE: World Saved. Who Cares? [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nAfter an adventure in 1336 Japan, the Doctor, Rose and Jack escaped into the TARDIS when a transmat beam broke inside the ship. Rose was brought to the Game Station, the new name of Satellite Five, in 200,100 and was forced to play a version of The Weakest Link where the contestants were supposedly disintegrated by the Anne Droid. Even though she answered very few questions correctly, Rose was kept in the game because of fellow contestant Rodrick tactically voting so that he could win the cash prize.\n\nRose discovered that the corporation running the games on the Game Station was called the Bad Wolf Corporation, a set of words which had been following the Doctor and Rose in their travels. After Rodrick won the final round, Rose was blasted by the Anne Droid just as the Doctor and Jack broke into the studio. Instead of dying, however, she was transmatted on board the Dalek flagship. The Doctor discovered the Daleks were hiding at the edge of the solar system and promised to rescue Rose and destroy the Daleks, despite having no plan. (TV: Bad Wolf [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nUsing the TARDIS to breach the Dalek flagship, the Doctor and Jack rescued Rose and encountered the Dalek Emperor, who had survived the Time War and constructed an army of Daleks out of dead human tissue salvaged from the transmatted contestants on board the Game Station. As the Daleks began their invasion of Earth, the Doctor, believing his death was inevitable, tricked Rose into taking the TARDIS back to her home place and time to keep her out of harm's way. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) From Mickey's perspective, it had been months since they last saw each other. (PROSE: Mars [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) Seeing the words Bad Wolf as graffiti around her housing complex served as a message to Rose; she realised she herself was crucial to the event and had to return to the Doctor. With the help of Mickey and her mother, Rose broke into the TARDIS console and looked into its heart, which enabled her to transcend into the Bad Wolf.\n\nAs this goddess-like figure, Rose returned to the Game Station, where she vaporised the Dalek fleet and brought Captain Jack back to life (unknowingly making him immortal), after paradoxically spreading the words \"Bad Wolf\" through space and time to create the message that would bring her to this moment. However, in becoming the Bad Wolf, Rose had absorbed the Time Vortex into herself, which would destroy her body, cell by cell. The Doctor took those energies into himself by kissing her, sacrificing his ninth incarnation and regenerating before Rose's eyes into a new incarnation. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) According to one account, the kiss was actually a quality known as the Restoration, something which was fatal to the giver, previously given to his predecessor by a woman on Gallifrey, (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Time War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).) although the Doctor would lie about this, saying it was because he absorbed the energy of the time vortex, which no one was meant to do. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nOriginally, the Doctor had planned to take Rose to the planet Barcelona; however, Rose was left deeply confused at what had just happened, believing that the man in front of her had somehow teleported aboard and taken the Doctor's place, being unfamiliar with regeneration. The Doctor confirmed his identity by recalling their first adventure together and the first word that he said to her: \"Run.\" He also told Rose, much to her disappointment, that he couldn't reverse the process; the Doctor she knew was gone. Instead, the newly-regenerated Doctor steered the TARDIS back to the Powell Estate on Christmas Eve 2006, (TV: Born Again [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who (BBC One, 2005).) crash-landing in the process after impulsively going too fast, before collapsing on the spot from post-regenerative trauma.\n\nRose was distressed that the Doctor had changed in appearance and personality, and had apparently left her, Mickey and Jackie to face the ensuing Sycorax invasion alone. When the TARDIS was taken aboard the Sycorax spaceship, she attempted to negotiate with them by referencing creatures from her past travels, but the Sycorax leader just laughed at her words. The Doctor ultimately revived, however, and defeated the Sycorax leader in a sword duel; Rose also later witnessed him cause the downfall of Prime Minister Harriet Jones for shooting down the fleeing Sycorax ship. He celebrated Christmas with Rose's family, and she resolved to continue travelling with him. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nFor the first of their new adventures together, the Doctor took Rose to New New York on New Earth in the year 5,000,000,023, where he had been summoned to a hospital via a message on his psychic paper. Taking a separate lift from the Doctor up through the hospital, Rose was unwillingly showered in disinfectant and diverted down to the basement. There, she discovered Lady Cassandra, who had survived their previous encounter and used a psychograft to implant her consciousness onto Rose's own, gaining full control over her body with the intent of stealing it to live on for centuries.\n\nCassandra attempted to pass herself off as a more seductive version of Rose for a while - at one point even surprising the Doctor with an enthusiastic kiss - but her lack of empathy ultimately gave her away when she and the Doctor discovered the feline Sisters of Plenitude who ran the hospital were experimenting on human subjects to develop cures. They exposed the Sisters and freed the carriers, with Cassandra body-swapping between the Doctor and Rose several times along the way. Once she helped the Doctor cure the infected new humans, though, she eventually went into the dying body of her servant Chip, freeing Rose at last. (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThe Doctor and Rose, dressed for 1979 Sheffield, mistakenly landed in 1879 Scotland, where the Doctor unwittingly became a protectorate for Queen Victoria, who was targeted by the Brethren. They stayed at Torchwood House, where the Brethren wanted to place the bite of the Lupine Wavelength Haemovariform into Queen Victoria to put the wolf on the British throne. Rose and several of the house's staff were imprisoned in the cellar to be fed to this werewolf, but Rose co-ordinated their escape (and scolded the Doctor when he finally arrived to help for taking so long). After the Doctor used the Koh-i-Noor and the house's light chamber to destroy the wolf with moonlight, the Doctor and Rose were knighted (with Rose dubbed Dame Rose of the Powell Estate), but immediately banished as a threat to the British Empire. On the way back to the TARDIS, the Doctor and Rose discussed the possibility of Victoria having become infected, joking that the Royal Family were all werewolves. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) This incident prompted Queen Victoria to found the Torchwood Institute to address future alien threats — including the Doctor. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThe Doctor attempted to take Rose to the Galápagos Islands, but the TARDIS landed in Twycross instead. The Doctor suddenly noticed a large gathering of monkeys, and used a bunch of bananas to lead them into the TARDIS. Travelling just outside the monkey enclosure at the Twycross Zoo, the Doctor discovered that a group of five humans had been trapped inside. After freeing them and learning that they had been trapped by the \"Zoo mascot\" in \"the lizard suit,\" he took Rose to the Reptile House. There, they discovered that the reptile zookeeper was, in fact, a Silurian named Wanda who had trapped the humans in the enclosure because she believed that they were monkeys. After teaching Wanda about many of the differences between monkeys and humans, the Doctor and Rose again departed for the Galápagos Islands. (COMIC: Untitled [+]Rachael Smith, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor backup comic stories (2017).)\n\nWhen the Doctor brought Rose to see The Saga of the Time Lords, the psychic paper identified her as the galaxy's pre-eminent expert on Gallifreyan culture, triggering an Auton trap for Time Lords. When the Doctor deduced that the script was now part of the Autons, he had Rose finish the play, ending their threat. (PROSE: He's Behind You [+]Dave Rudden, The Wintertime Paradox (2020).)\n\nThe Doctor attempted to take Rose to the moon, but the TARDIS veered off course and landed in a pub in Winchelham. The pair were then separated when the TARDIS took the Doctor to Crediton Vale. Rose sat on the village green, where she saw Kate Yates appear to heal herself after being hit by a car. Rose took Kate to see the Doctor at Crediton Vale, where they discovered that Kate had been overtaken by Dalek factor released by a recently-excavated Dalek. Rose and Kate then hitch-hiked away from the Dalek casing in an attempt to weaken the Dalek factor's effects, but Kate succumbed again and crashed the lorry they were inside in Twyford. When the newly-active excavated Dalek came looking for Kate, and massacred people in Twyford on the way, Rose reminded Kate of her humanity and ultimately caused her to betray and destroy her new Dalek master. (PROSE: I Am a Dalek [+]Gareth Roberts, Quick Reads (BBC Books, 2006).)\n\nIn 2007, Mickey brought the Doctor and Rose to Deffry Vale High School, which had had suspiciously high exam results and UFO sightings. While the Doctor posed as a physics teacher, Rose went undercover as a dinner lady and ate the school's chips, which were coated in an intelligence-increasing oil. After two days on shift, she witnessed one of the dinner ladies being burned by the oil. While investigating the school that night, Rose met a previous companion of the Doctor, Sarah Jane Smith, an awkward situation Mickey described as \"the missus and the ex\". Both women felt jealousy and tension, which they subsequently resolved. Rose became worried the Doctor would one day abandon her, but the Doctor promised her — \"Not to you\".\n\nThe Doctor repaired K9 Mark III, who identified the oil as Krillitane oil and the school's new staff as Krillitanes. The Krillitanes were using the children's minds to construct the Skasis Paradigm, a computation that could rebuild the fabric of the universe. The Doctor recognised the Krillitanes from a previous adventure, where they resembled people with long necks. K9 destroyed the Krillitanes (and the school) by blowing up the inflammable oil barrels. Mickey joined the TARDIS, to Rose's disapproval. Before Sarah and Rose parted ways, the former told the latter to stay with the Doctor despite being unsure what to do as she claimed that \"some things are worth getting your heart broken for.\" (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nOn the SS Madame de Pompadour in the 51st century, the Doctor, Rose and Mickey travelled into a time window to 1744 France and met Reinette Poisson, who was being stalked by the ship's repair droids at various points in her life. Tracking one of the droids through the ship armed with fire-extinguishers, Rose and Mickey discovered the ship's repair droids had been using the ship's crew as components to repair the ship. Their final \"part\" was the brain of Reinette, who wasn't yet \"complete\". Rose and Mickey were later captured by the droids and nearly vivisected themselves, before being saved in time by the Doctor.\n\nWhen the droids found Reinette at the correct part of her life, Rose travelled through a time window into 1753 to warn her of an oncoming attack sometime after her 37th birthday in 1758, explaining to Reinette that this wasn't how history was supposed to happen. The Doctor later saved Reinette as the droids attacked Versailles, though destroyed the link between France and the ship in the process. Luckily, after keeping Rose and Mickey waiting for five-and-a-half hours, the Doctor was able to get back using the fireplace, which had been removed from its original location, therefore being disconnected when the link was destroyed. However, the time differential between both periods meant that tragically, Reinette had already died in 1764 before the Doctor could return for her. (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nRose and the Doctor met the 63rd iteration of the band Pakafroon Wabster aboard a Magellan-class star cruiser. The ship was caught in a time loop, replaying the few hours leading up to its destruction by sabotage. The Doctor and Rose worked with the band to identify the saboteur and find a way of breaking the time loop. (COMIC: Interstellar Overdrive [+]Jonathan Morris, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).)\n\nRose showed signs of jealousy when the Doctor was attracted to Reinette. (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) The Doctor exploited this jealousy to save her life when her mind was invaded by a creature called the Iagnon. (COMIC: The Green-Eyed Monster [+]Nev Fountain, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).)\n\nWhilst travelling through the vortex, the Doctor, Rose and Mickey fell through a crack in time, ending up on a parallel Earth more technologically advanced than their own; the TARDIS died as it had no power from their universe to get back. However, the Doctor managed to power a surviving piece of the TARDIS, although it meant giving up ten years of his life. The Doctor considered this kind of world \"like a gingerbread house\" and \"full of temptation\", but the piece of the TARDIS required a twenty-four-hour recharging cycle before the TARDIS could restore itself. When Rose found her father Pete Tyler was alive in this world and a successful businessman, the Doctor cautioned her against making contact, as he wasn't actually her father.\n\nWhile Mickey searched for the parallel version of his grandmother, the Doctor eventually gave in to Rose's request to attend the birthday party of her parallel mother and meet her \"father\" again. Posing with the Doctor as servers, Rose learnt that her parallel parents had recently separated; she also learnt that her parallel counterpart was a dog named Rose, which the Doctor couldn't help but laugh at. She tried asking her mother to give Pete another chance, but Jackie called her out for overstepping her boundaries. Cybermen, which had been newly created on this world, \"crashed the party\" of Jackie's mansion and demanded that humans inside either be upgraded or deleted. The Doctor and Rose escaped, with Pete tagging along, but were then trapped on the lawn when Cybermen surrounded them and the Preachers (with Mickey). (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nAfter escaping the Cybermen with the help of the Preachers, Rose and Pete infiltrated the front entrance of Cybus Industries at Battersea Cyber-factory to find Jackie and stop the Cybermen. They found Jackie had survived the attack on her party but was one of the first to have been upgraded into a Cyberman. Upon being discovered, instead of being converted, Pete, who had worked with Cybus, was taken with Rose to the creator of these new Cybermen, John Lumic, now a Cyber-Controller.\n\nThe Doctor, confronting Lumic, bought time by trading philosophical ideas with him while subtly telling Mickey to hack the Lumic family database to find the cancellation code to the Cybermen's emotional inhibitors. Mickey texted Rose the code, and the Doctor connected her phone with the code to deactivate the Cybermen's inhibitors. The Cybermen began exploding, along with Cybus Industries, and Mickey rescued the Doctor, Rose and Pete from the burning factory in Lumic's zeppelin. When it came time to leave, an overwhelmed Pete refused to accept Rose as his daughter while Mickey chose to stay behind to fight Cybermen worldwide, as he didn't fit in with the Doctor and Rose's close relationship. Even though this meant the Doctor would have to seal the crack between universes, separating Mickey from them and his universe forever, the Doctor and Rose honoured Mickey's wishes and returned to their universe. Visiting Jackie at the Powell Estate, Rose broke down in tears on seeing her mother alive and well. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nTaking a break on Askenflatt Minor, the Doctor, and Rose were teleported aboard Hasval the Destroyer's spaceship. Rose was locked in a cell, and threw a banana peel at Hasval, making him slip over. One of Hasval's cannon's blasted a hole in the bars of Rose's cell, freeing her, and Rose pointed the hologram projector at the Doctor, unwittingly creating hundreds of duplicated projections of the Doctor. The Doctor, along with his duplicates, warned Hasval to leave this sector of space and renounce war. When Hasval agreed, the Doctor and Rose then returned to Askenflatt Minor. (PROSE: The Hero Factor [+]Stephen Cole, Doctor Who Files (2006).)\n\nThe Doctor and Rose travelled to Bath in 1840 to pick up the first Penny Black stamp. They discovered the inkers at the printing presses had been hypnotised by a Hobothy, who intended to use the ink in the stamps to channel its hypnotic powers. Rose pushed the Hobothy into a printing press, and the Hobothy was crushed by the press operator Thomas Scott. The Doctor explained that without the Hobothy, the ink was now harmless. The Doctor then sent a letter Rose wrote about this adventure to Rose's mother with a squashed Hobothy stamp on the envelope. (PROSE: Stamp of Approval [+]Jacqueline Rayner, Doctor Who Files (2006).)\n\nRose discovered a Slitheen scout in a funfair who, after trying out the rides, planned to make a twisted version of the fair where humans would be hunted. The Slitheen chased Rose down a water slide, where at the bottom, the Doctor had filled the water in the pool with vinegar from a chip van, causing the Slitheen to explode. (PROSE: No Fun at the Fair [+]Jacqueline Rayner, Doctor Who Files (2006).)\n\nIntending to see Elvis Presley at the Ed Sullivan Show, the Doctor instead ended up taking Rose to Muswell Hill on the eve of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953. When they discovered people had been mysteriously taken from their homes, the Doctor and Rose did the \"domestic approach\", and went on house calls. At the home of Eddie and Rita Connolly and their son Tommy, the Doctor found Grandma Connolly's face had been completely removed. Tracking the origin of the Connollys' television set to Magpie Electricals to confront the owner, Mr Magpie, Rose had her face and essence consumed by the Wire as part of her plan to use the coronation to become manifest. Before it could do this, the Doctor transferred the Wire into a video cassette, which he planned to record over, restoring everyone, including Rose and Grandma Connolly, back to normal. (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nJackie called her when the Zaross invaded Norwich. She thought that the Zaross looked weird and that the drones were important for something. Upon entering the mothership, she scrambled and released the force field in which the captured humans were trapped. She was later captured by the Zaross and used as a bargaining chip. Rose tried to raise Jess Ellmore's self-esteem and stopped her mother Marge Ellmore from bullying her. (AUDIO: Infamy of the Zaross [+]John Dorney, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nThe Doctor decided to take Rose to Slough to visit a telescope. She roped the Doctor into a fencing match with Chevalier D'Eon. After travelling to Christopher Dalliard's house, she spent her time trying to find the aliens that the Doctor had located. She was then enchanted by Joxer and Hempel to be sold as a slave. She managed to escape the ship and rescued Darcy and the rest of the slaves. (AUDIO: The Sword of the Chevalier [+]Guy Adams, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nRose had asked the Doctor to take her skiing. After arriving on Coldstar, she worked out that something had broken out of the ice, not into it. She tried to reassure Callum Volta and Lorna when the Ice Warriors arrived. She recognised the Doctor's plan as escape plan 29. She worked out that she could use the bin were Lorna was planning to take the waste of ship. Using the pirate wreckers, she piloted it to Callum Volta's ship. She explained to Brona Volta how her son died. After Hasskor died, he set his suit to self-destruct and clamped on to her. The Doctor managed to unclamp her and throw the bomb out of the TARDIS. (AUDIO: Cold Vengeance [+]Matt Fitton, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nThe Doctor and Rose landed inside Sanctuary Base 6 on Krop Tor, a planet that was in perpetual orbit around the black hole K37 Gem 5; following an earthquake, the TARDIS fell below the planet's surface, devastating the Doctor and seemingly ending his travels. The humans of Sanctuary Base 6 had come to Krop Tor to discover the source of power emanating from the planet's core which allowed the planet to orbit the black hole. They refused to divert their drill to collect the TARDIS, but allowed the Doctor to join the expedition down to the centre of the planet. Rose stayed on the surface as the Doctor descended to the core, and the Ood, the base's servants, began attacking after the Beast possessed them. (TV: The Impossible Planet [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nWhen the Doctor and Ida Scott were trapped below and lost contact, Rose encouraged the rest of the crew to think of a means of escape and disabling the Ood. Danny Bartock came up with the idea of emitting a \"flare\" that would disrupt the telepathic field. They traversed the maintenance tunnels to find the central computer to emit the flare; Mr Jefferson sacrificing his life to get Rose, Danny and Toby Zed to safety. When Rose re-established contact with Ida, she told her the Doctor had fallen into the pit. Rose wished to stay behind even if he did die, but Zach forcibly put her aboard the Sanctuary Base 6 rocket.\n\nThe Doctor, who had actually survived the fall, broke the gravity funnel keeping the planet in place, pulling the planet and the body of the Beast into the black hole. As the rocket wasn't yet out of the funnel, it was pulled towards the black hole. Discovering the Beast's mind was possessing Toby, Rose shot the rocket's window with Zach's bolt gun and ejected Toby into space. The Doctor, having found the TARDIS and saved Ida before she ran out of oxygen, towed the rocket to safety, before joyfully reuniting with Rose. (TV: The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nRose and the Doctor later encountered the Vashta Nerada at Lake Windermere. (COMIC: Untitled [+]Rachael Smith, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor backup comic stories (2017).)\n\nWhen Elton Pope used Jackie in his efforts to make contact with him, the Doctor tracked him down on Rose's behalf so Rose could tell him off for upsetting her mother. Following the defeat of the Abzorbaloff, however, Rose quickly felt sorry for Elton after losing Ursula Blake, seeing how much she meant to him, and witnessed the Doctor partially restore her in a paving slab. (TV: Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThe Doctor and Rose went to London in 2012 to see the Olympics, five years ahead of Rose's time. Investigating children's disappearances in Dame Kelly Holmes Close, they met a girl named Chloe Webber who was possessed by a lone Isolus and had been trapping other children from her street in drawings to make the Isolus feel less lonely. Despite trying to help the Isolus, the Doctor was also trapped in a drawing, along with the TARDIS. Inside the drawing, the Doctor was able to draw a depiction of the Olympic torch and pointed at it to aid Rose. Realising that the Isolus pod was drawn to heat, Rose used a pickaxe to dig up the street's freshly-tarmacked road and unearth it.\n\nOnce Rose tossed the pod into the Olympic flame to recharge it with warmth and love, the Doctor and those taken by the Isolus were freed from the drawing. The Doctor then took the place of the winded runner, lighting the Olympic flame himself and allowing the Isolus pod to leave Earth. Reuniting with Rose as London celebrated the opening of the Olympic games, the Doctor warned her that he felt a \"storm\" coming when she said that no-one would ever separate them. (TV: Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nOn a routine visit to see Jackie at the Powell Estate, the Doctor and Rose found the entire planet was being visited by beings believed to be ghosts; at first, Rose thought her mother had lost it as she mentioned granddad Prentice was coming to visit, only to see a ghost that Jackie claimed was him. The Doctor tracked the signal to Torchwood Tower in Canary Wharf and was taken prisoner with Jackie by Yvonne Hartman, leader of the Torchwood Institute who had spent over a hundred years trying to track him down ever since his adventure with Queen Victoria in 1879. The ghosts were a side effect of the \"ghost shifts\", a means of Torchwood obtaining power for the British Empire after a tear in reality caused by void ship.\n\nAttempting to pose as a Torchwood employee using the Doctor's psychic paper, Rose sneaked into the room where the void ship was undercover, but her ruse was quickly discovered by Rajesh Singh. Two computer technicians, secretly under the control of Cybermen, restarted the ghost shift. The ghosts, who were actually Cybermen, came from the parallel world where the Doctor and Rose had left Mickey. In the void ship room, Rose discovered Mickey working undercover as a Torchwood employee, believing the void ship to be Cyberman technology. As the Cyberman invasion of Earth began, the void ship opened, revealing the Cult of Skaro, a group of Daleks with a Genesis Ark. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nRose used her knowledge of the Dalek Emperor and the Time War to stop the Daleks from killing her and Mickey, though they were held prisoner. The Daleks forcibly gained knowledge of the Cybermen from Singh's brainwaves and waged war against them. With the help of a short alliance with the Cybermen and the Preachers, the Doctor, along with the Pete from Pete's World, rescued Rose and Mickey from their imprisonment by the Daleks. In the confusion, Mickey accidentally opened the Genesis Ark and released millions of Daleks (though the Doctor claimed he did them a favour as opening it by force would've blown up the Sun). The group then saved Jackie from being upgraded by the Cybermen, and Rose witnessed her mother and father reunite at last.\n\nTo save both dimensions from annihilation and defeat his two deadliest enemies, the Doctor planned to open the Void. This would suck anything covered in \"Void stuff\" into it and seal off the two universes for good. Realising that Rose was also covered in Void energy, the Doctor sent an unwilling Rose, along with Mickey, Pete and Jackie, back to the parallel Earth, where they would be safe. Rose, however, refused to leave the Doctor. Knowing she would never see her family again, she returned; though the Doctor protested, Rose simply told him that she had made her choice \"a long time ago\". Together, they opened the Void and the Daleks and Cybermen, along with the Genesis Ark, were sucked inside. The plan initially went smoothly until Rose's lever malfunctioned, threatening to halt the operation. Rose secured the lever, but couldn't hold on and was almost pulled into the Void herself. She was saved at the last second by her parallel father and taken back across to the other universe, separating her from the Doctor forever. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nRose lived with Pete Tyler, Jackie, and Mickey in their home on Pete's World. She received a dream-like contact from the Doctor, which guided her to Dårlig Ulv Stranden (Bad Wolf Bay) in Norway. The Doctor sent his final farewells through the closing crack between the worlds, burning up a star to send the signal through. He informed her that on her Earth, Rose was officially dead. Rose informed the Doctor that she now worked for Torchwood and that Jackie was again pregnant. Rose finally broke down and confessed her love for the Doctor, but the Doctor did not have a chance to reciprocate his feelings as he was cut off abruptly. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Some time later, Jackie gave birth to Rose's baby brother, Tony. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nRose eventually crossed paths with another ex-companion of the Doctor, when a capsule containing a feline also named Rose fell into Pete's World while searching for a broken heart in need of comforting. Rose-the-Cat knew of Rose Tyler, and asked if she was a fan of Chums. (COMIC: A Rose by Any Other Name [+]Rachael Smith, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor backup comic stories (Titan Comics, 2014-2016).)\n\nAfter Torchwood developed the dimension cannon, Rose insisted on being the first volunteer to use it, (AUDIO: The Endless Night [+]Jonathan Morris, The Dimension Cannon (Rose Tyler, Big Finish Productions, 2019).) aiming to find the Doctor to warn him about the oncoming darkness. (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nAs the dimension cannon was imprecise, Rose was forced to search through different universes to determine if they were getting closer to the Doctor's universe, with Pete acting as Control back in Pete's World. In the first parallel universe, which was doomed to extinction as its own sun was about to be extinguished, Rose found the counterpart of Clive Finch, also a conspiracy theorist, albeit one who knew nothing of the Doctor. Through him, she found the counterparts of her mother and father, whom had broken up after only a year and so had no children, however, their encounter with Rose led to them rekindling their love in the remaining time they had. Acting against Pete's orders, Rose took a risk to bring Clive back with her despite the dimension cannon not being guaranteed to accommodate more than one person at that point. (AUDIO: The Endless Night [+]Jonathan Morris, The Dimension Cannon (Rose Tyler, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nRose justified her actions as Clive accompanied her on her expedition to the second universe, where she met the widowed counterpart of her father, who did not have a daughter but a son, Rob Tyler, who was in a relationship with Mickey Smith as Rose had been. There, the Earth had been struck by extreme global warming believed to have been covertly caused by aliens; despite a regression of technology in an attempt to slow it, it was predicted that humanity would become extinct within seventy years. (AUDIO: The Flood [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nFor the third expedition, Rose was accompanied by Pete while Clive served as Control. In this universe, Rose and Pete discovered that the latter's counterpart, Sir Pete Tyler, was responsible for SoulTech, which allowed the consciousness of deceased humans to live on in the soul machines. (AUDIO: Ghost Machines [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn the fourth universe, Rose was accompanied by Jackie, and they found themselves at that world's Powell Estate as the human race faced impending destruction at the hands of planetoid EK56. A common factor of these four universes, observed by Rose Tyler, was that there was no trace of the Doctor, or of the high-profile alien incidents which had threatened the Earth of N-Space. (AUDIO: The Last Party on Earth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nInitially, Rose thought only the Doctor could help, but later she realised \"the both of [them,] the Doctor and Donna, together\" were needed to stop the stars from going out, after Rose discovered readings showing reality had bent around Donna, since the day Donna was born. (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nIn the 2000s,[nb 1] after preventing a million Londoners from being forcibly converted into Adipose, Donna asked a woman to tell Donna's mother Sylvia that Donna left her car keys in \"that bin there\". The woman turned out to be Rose, who walked off and faded away. (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhen the Doctor and Donna were conversing with two psychics in 79 AD Pompeii, one of them, Lucius Petrus Dextrus, noted, \"she is returning\", a foreshadowing of Rose's return. (TV: The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhen Donna Noble was in the TARDIS, which had been taken aboard the Sontaran command ship, Rose's face popped up on the screen for a moment, silently calling for the Doctor. Donna did not notice however. (TV: The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nOn the planet Midnight, Rose appeared on a screen in the Crusader 50 shuttle-bus, silently shouting, \"Doctor!\" However, the Doctor was turned away from the screen and did not see Rose. (TV: Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhen Donna Noble had a parallel world created around her, Rose met her several times. She said she could travel between worlds, and had done so many times, searching for the Doctor. She appeared several times, including on Christmas Eve 2007, when the Doctor, lacking Donna to pull him back, was killed defeating the Racnoss.\n\nIn 2008, the night Donna was sacked by Jival Chowdry, Rose told Donna to use her raffle ticket to stay out of London that Christmas, which was when London was scheduled for destruction by the Titanic. Donna and Rose also met on the evening the Sontaran attack of the Earth with ATMOS was thwarted by Torchwood Three at the cost of their lives. Three weeks later as the stars started to disappear, Donna followed Rose to a UNIT base, where technology from the Doctor's dying TARDIS revealed the Time Beetle on Donna's back.\n\nObeying Rose's instructions, Donna was sent back to force her past self to turn left on Little Sutton Street, heading for the Chiswick High Road, and not right, towards Griffin's Parade, on that fateful day in June 2007, so that she would work at H.C. Clements and meet the Doctor six months later. When the parallel world Donna did so, at the cost of her life, Rose held her as she died and whispered a message for the Doctor: \"Bad Wolf\". (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nRose teleported to her native world in the 2000s, finding it being invaded by Daleks and transported across the universe. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhile she was in the universe, an older version of K9 Mark IV diverted her to Gallifrey using his vortex manipulator circuit. There, she and Sarah Jane Smith were reunited in the Panopticon, going unnoticed thanks to perception filters, and discussed the crisis. Rose was surprised to learn Sarah Jane had just been fighting the Daleks, too, on Skaro with another point in the timeline's Tenth Doctor. (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).)\n\nBack on Earth at last, Rose found Sylvia Noble and Wilfred Mott, saving them from a Dalek, hoping they knew where the Doctor and Donna were. Harriet Jones appeared on Wilf's computer; Rose assumed Harriet was trying to contact her, but when she tried to reply, found it impossible as there was no camera or microphone on the computer; Harriet spoke to Sarah Jane, Jack and Martha Jones (who Rose quickly grew jealous of). Rose watched on as they brought the Doctor to Earth, then used her transmat device to lock onto the TARDIS and teleport to him.\n\nShe arrived in a deserted street with the Doctor and Donna at the other end. Reunited at last, the Doctor and Rose ran to embrace each other, but a Dalek fired upon the Doctor, mortally wounding him. With Donna and Jack's help, Rose got him in to the TARDIS where he began to regenerate. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Doctor managed to keep his tenth incarnation by pouring the regeneration energy into his severed hand. This, with the help of Donna, eventually created a new, part-human Doctor. While inside the TARDIS, the Doctor, Jack, Rose and Donna were taken aboard the Crucible, where Rose and the Doctor were subsequently held in the Vault to fulfil Dalek Caan's prophecy. There, Rose met Davros, the creator of the Daleks, who had constructed a New Dalek Empire in a final masterplan to annihilate creation itself using a reality bomb. She was also reunited with Sarah Jane, who along with Mickey, Jackie and Martha were transmatted to the Vault after failing to hold the Daleks to ransom. After Donna and the newly created Meta-Crisis Tenth Doctor defeated the New Dalek Empire, the Doctor returned Rose and her mother to Bad Wolf Bay on the parallel Earth but this time without Mickey, who had grown estranged from Rose and decided to return home.\n\nThe original Doctor exiled the new Doctor on the parallel Earth; he was bred in battle, and to fulfil Dalek Caan's prophecy, he had killed all of the Daleks, and was too dangerous to leave on his own. He told Rose she was the only one who could make him a better man, as she had before with him. Rose was reluctant to stay but the original Doctor said that the new Doctor had all his memories and thoughts, and was \"him,\" albeit part human. The part-human Doctor had only one heart, and would never regenerate but age instead. He told Rose he could spend his life with her, if she wanted him to, and they could grow old together. Rose asked both Doctors what the last thing they would have said to her would have been when she was first trapped on the parallel Earth. The original Doctor asked, \"Does it need saying?\", but the Meta-Crisis Tenth Doctor whispered into her ear that he loved her. Hearing the words, Rose flung herself on the Meta-Crisis Doctor in a passionate embrace and the original Doctor left with Donna. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nNot much is known about her life after she returned to Pete's World with the human Doctor. One account posited that the two lived in Canticum beside the French Channel. She became pregnant with the Doctor's child and went into labour, (PROSE: The Turning of the Tide [+]Jenny T Colgan, The Target Storybook (2019).) giving birth to a girl the couple named Mia. (COMIC: Empire of the Wolf [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who (2020) (Titan Publishing Group, 2021-2022).)\n\nThe couple joined UNIT after President Harriet Jones combined the Preachers and Torchwood to create the organisation. Pete and Jackie also joined. (AUDIO: The Siege of Big Ben [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018).) After Jackie and the Meta-Crisis Doctor fell out, Rose and Pete conspired to put them together on a zeppelin flight to Hull to force them to talk to each other. (AUDIO: Flight Into Hull! [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nIn Mia's teenage years, Rose began to form a psio-temporal link with her counterpart from the timeline where the Sea Devils ruled Earth, who had now become an empress in N-Space. As the visions of the empress' life became clearer, Rose was pulled back into N-Space where she was found by the Eighth Doctor. Scanning her, the Eighth Doctor set course for Creerm, finding the empress' signal to be there. Upon landing Rose reunited with the Eleventh Doctor. The two Doctors decided to try and show Empress Rose the error of her ways while Rose would pose as her counterpart and have the army stand down. After speaking to the troops, Rose was overthrown by D'Pau who had allied with the Sontarans the Eighth Doctor was tracking since the Blitz. When the Eleventh Doctor and the Empress returned, D'Pau launched with a portion of the Empress' space fleet. After the Doctors deduced that the paradox had allowed the Sontarans access to Creerm, they piloted the TARDIS to the center of the fleet and had the two Roses touch, the Blinovitch Limitation Effect sending the Sontaran army away. After the Empress went off to devote herself and her forces to peace, Rose said a goodbye to the Eleventh Doctor, asking him to find a new companion after learning he had just experienced loss again. The Doctors then used their TARDISes, sending her back to Pete's World, arriving three hours after she'd left. (COMIC: Empire of the Wolf [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who (2020) (Titan Publishing Group, 2021-2022).)\n\nIn a timeline created by the Cybermen's alliance with Rassilon, Rose fell victim to the techno-virus, an airborne strain of the Cyber-conversion process, becoming a Cyber-Warrior, killing Jack Harkness. When the Doctor's TARDIS had been drained of power, Rose broke down the door and led her fellow units within before this timeline was undone by a remorseful Rassilon with help from the Twelfth Doctor. (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nIn an alternate timeline in which the Sea Devils had conquered Earth centuries before 2020, Rose was the leader of a resistance against them. Her actions against them had been so great that her face was featured on \"wanted\" posters throughout London. After aiding the Tenth and Thirteenth Doctors in successfully restoring the timeline to normal, Rose, who was able to survive the rewrite due to her brief travels in the Time Vortex, decided to continue fighting on other conquered planets. (COMIC: Alternating Current [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who Comic (2020) (Titan Comics, 2020-2021).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor and Rose Tyler went to Serac where they were captured by Sontaran troops from the Betrothal of Sontar, under the command of the maniacal Colonel Snathe who was kicked from the Imperial Sontaran Fleet for a failure. Rose met and befriended Commander Lerox, a Sontaran with pacifistic genes, and teamed up with him to foil Snathe's plan to use Thantos, a doomsday weapon. Lerox risks his own life for Rose and gets wounded by Snathe, proving his species worth saving and causing Thantos to stop destroying Sontar. When Lerox takes command of the Betrothal of Sontar which the Doctor suggests renaming 'The Hope of Sontar', Rose said a fond farewell. (COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar [+]John Tomlinson and Nick Abadzis, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).)\n\nThe Tenth Doctor and Rose once visited Sunset Strip, a trading post on what Rose described as \"a planet of gangsters\", where they became involved in a struggle between Don Corpulone and Doll Corpulone over possession of a glitterbird egg. (COMIC: Gangster's Paradise [+]Alan Barnes, DWA comic stories (BBC Magazines, 2006).)\n\nAt some point, Rose was taken to the Black Archive by UNIT to have her record as a companion of the Doctor taken. Her memories of the visit were subsequently erased and she was sent on her way. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhile most readers of Clive Finch's website Doctor Who? initially documented the Ninth Doctor travelling by himself, some of the readers also encountered Rose. Matt was knocked over by the Ninth Doctor when he and \"some girl\" were running down a street. At some point, Mark encountered the Ninth Doctor in a supermarket when he was begrudgingly buying spam and corned beef for Rose. Rose was also threatened with being put on the rack if the Doctor didn't return a cache of Tudor parchments that cast doubt on Henry VIII's right to the throne. (PROSE: Have You Seen This Man? [+]various authors, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2005 Dummy Massacre, Mickey Smith, the site's new owner, received a number of responses when he put out a request for sightings of the then missing Rose. SharonValerii saw Rose outside of University the other day, seeming a bit preoccupied alongside the Ninth Doctor. Artie D said that she looked like a girl he entirely failed to get off with at a party in Islington since she \"swan off\" after this other chap came up and said something about a different planet. Steve Woolfall reported seeing Rose at the Grosvenor Museum in Chester that afternoon with a chap that reminded him of that Casanova bloke. Emma.Walters saw Rose in a shopping centre called meadowhall at 9:00am, raiding the coffee. Eden saw Rose walking out of a lush shop with 20 bathboms alongside a man with short brown hair. Steve met Rose in 1987. SkipN saw Rose walking in Boston near the Charles River in 2004. Jonny Hall saw Rose, screaming with bruises all over, roaming the streets of Linclon at half past nine, rushing and running with a man, following an incident at 8:00 pm. David Mc Giveron, whilst on an outing to the Lake District met Rose in an abandoned quarry, asking him if he had seen the Doctor before running off. David Collins Rose saw in a school history lesson from a photo taken in 1806. Richard Hawton commented on Rose's strong resemblance to a student teacher he had in 1976. Scott Nisbet presumed Rose to share a lineage with a girl in a white dress he saw in an early 19th century drawing from a history textbook. bobby spotted Rose, the Doctor and the TARDIS in the Bayeaux Tapestry. Mark Young found a family portrait, pointing out that her face had only appeared in the picture since yesterday. Alexander saw Rose and the Doctor walking towards the TARDIS in an old family wedding photo from the 1920s. Nigel Dawson reported seeing Rose the previous day outside Wetherby Whaler, eating something out of a newspaper and walking towards the bridge. Mr Mystery reported seeing Rose, but could not say where or when. Ryan Daly saw Rose walking up his street at 8:00pm, spitting out some gum and running off after Ryan shouted \"Hey you!\" polly loughlin saw Rose in a photo at her friend's house; when she asked her how she knew Rose, her friend thought she had gone mad. S C Wallace was amazed when they saw Rose outside a WHSmith. (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nFurther sightings were reported when the site revealed a photograph of the Doctor and Rose with Charles Dickens. Luci Ernaga saw a girl wearing a tracksuit and trainers sitting on a bench behind her grandmother's dog in a photo from the 1920s. Natasha Richardson saw the Doctor and Rose under the clock in Guildford, noting that the Doctor had changed his jumper. Cara and Matt spotted the Doctor and Rose whilst on holiday in Margate in 2005, appearing to investigate a large, suspicious-looking sand castle. Reginald Jones claimed that, as he posted, he was stalling the Doctor who sitting in the other room, supposedly disconnecting the antenna from his television, after offering him a spot of tea. Reginald saw no sign of Rose and was afraid to ask. timetunnel saw the Doctor and Rose hanging around the Great Tower of London, which the Doctor was looking around. suresh kumar saw the Doctor and Rose ordering a hamburger at Tasy Bite on Kingsley Road in Hounslow. Brandon Lightloafer saw the Doctor and Rose at the Goat pub in the town of Berkhamsted, muttering something about saving the town castle from being destroyed. nu reported a sighting at Dundee. kayley reported a sighting at Bognor Regis Pier. (PROSE: Rose sighting confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nThe video taken of (PROSE: Essay Competition [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) Stuart Hoskins and Sarah Clark's wedding on 7 November 1987 (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) was eventually was owned by Jackie Tyler. She lent this video to Mickey, who wrote about it on his website. (PROSE: Essay Competition [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) Meeting Jackie, Jack Harkness summarised Rose as \"amazing\" and \"a tribute to her planet and to her mother\". (AUDIO: Wednesdays For Beginners [+]James Goss, The Lives of Captain Jack (The Lives of Captain Jack, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nAfter losing Rose, the Tenth Doctor was devastated. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Despite maintaining a generally cheerful demeanour and energetic persona, the Doctor was noticeably more dour when reminded of Rose's absence. Immediately after trading farewells with Rose, the Doctor was shocked when a woman in a wedding dress somehow appeared in the TARDIS control room, much to their mutual bafflement. The woman, Donna Noble, soon found one of Rose's shirts hanging on a railing, prompting her to angrily accuse the Doctor of having \"abducted\" various women. In response, the Doctor manner-of-factly explained the shirt belonged to a friend he had lost; later, he divulged to Donna that the friend's name was Rose. After the Doctor flooded and executed the Racnoss, Donna was stunned by the Doctor's brutality. She advised the Doctor to \"find someone\", as sometimes, he \"need[ed] someone to stop [him]\". (TV: The Runaway Bride [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2006 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThe Doctor built a shrine to Rose in the TARDIS as he became a recluse. He also decided to name his new Cat after her. On one occasion, the Doctor had a nightmare in which Rose suddenly returned to him without reasoning. During the encounter, she began to stuff her hair into his mouth. He suddenly awoke to find the Rose-the-Cat had been sleeping on his face. Because of this, he ordered that she could no longer sleep in his room. (COMIC: A Rose by Any Other Name [+]Rachael Smith, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor backup comic stories (Titan Comics, 2014-2016).)\n\nThe Doctor's next companion, Martha Jones, would feel the effect of Rose's departure. Though offering her a trip, the Tenth Doctor asserted \"not that you're replacing [Rose]\". (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) In their first adventure, the Doctor openly lamented that \"Rose'd know\" and \"right now, she'd say exactly the right thing\" while Martha was a \"novice\". While the Carrionite Lilith attempted to use Rose's name against him, the Doctor told her that she had made a \"big mistake\", as that name kept him \"fighting\". (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Learning that the Doctor had previously visited New New York with Rose, Martha asked him if he knew the word \"rebound\". (TV: Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) In the original New York, Martha confided to Tallulah her feeling that the Doctor didn't \"[see] her\" when he looked at her, and was \"just remembering [Rose]\". (TV: Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor's Chameleon Arch-induced human persona, John Smith, included Rose in his work, A Journal of Impossible Things, written from the Doctor's dormant memories which surfaced as dreams. Seeing Rose's image in the book, Joan Redfern noted he had \"quite an eye for the pretty girls\". Smith insisted that \"she was just an invention\" who \"seem[ed] to disappear later on\". (TV: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) When the Saxon Master was taunting Martha as a \"disappointment\", he mentioned that the Doctor used to have companions who could \"absorb the time vortex\". (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nUpon encountering the Slitheen family for the first time, Sarah Jane Smith repeated the words Rose had said about them during their first meeting, citing them as \"something a friend said once\". (TV: Revenge of the Slitheen [+]Gareth Roberts, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 1 (BBC One and CBBC, 2007).)\n\nWhen the Doctor discovered what the Manus Maleficus was capable of doing, he was momentarily tempted to use it to tear down the barriers between worlds so he could see Rose again. (COMIC: The Crimson Hand [+]Dan McDaid, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2009-2010).) When he was undoing the damage that George Sheldrake's time portals had done, he noted that he could use them to reunite with everyone whom he had lost before the Nun convinced him that such an act would ultimately be pointless. Agreeing, the Doctor apologised to Rose much to the Nun's confusion. (AUDIO: The Wrong Woman [+]John Dorney, Dalek Universe (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nWhen the Tenth Doctor was dying and on his reunion tour, he visited Rose last out of every companion he had ever had, going back to before she even met him. The Doctor intended for her to never know he was there, but groaned in pain from holding in his regeneration, causing her to notice him. Rose thought the Doctor was just a drunk and, after she told him the date, he tearfully told her she'd have a great year. She then left and, along with Ood Sigma, was the last person his tenth self saw before regenerating. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nThe Doctor remembered Rose and felt guilty about what he had done to her, well into his eleventh incarnation. (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) One of the Doctor's memories of Rose was stolen by the Scream, the pain of it causing the Silent distress. (COMIC: The Scream [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) While offering Dorium Maldovar examples of how \"time is not the boss of me,\" this Doctor briefly mentioned the thought of helping Rose with her homework as a child, before they ever met. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe physical form of Rose Tyler was used as a telepathic interface by the Moment as a means to comfortably communicate with the War Doctor on the final day of the Time War, attempting to persuade him against activating the weapon to destroy Gallifrey. Rose Tyler's image was chosen for her significance to the Doctor but as the Moment recognised companions from both the Doctor's past and future, the impact was lost on the War Doctor. The Moment was also aware of her experience as the Bad Wolf entity. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAlice O'Donnell, a native of the year 2119, knew of Rose, Martha and Amy as past companions of the Doctor due to her work in military intelligence. When the Twelfth Doctor took her back to 1980, O'Donnell voiced her doubt that Rose would have vomited following her first trip in the TARDIS as her colleague Mason Bennett had done. (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) When meeting with his tenth self, the Twelfth Doctor queried who his earlier incarnation was travelling with, asking if it was \"blondie\" and casually assuring his past self that he would get over her. (COMIC: Vortex Butterflies [+]Nick Abadzis, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).) When the Twelfth Doctor later encountered the Mindmorphs, they briefly roused his memories of Rose. (COMIC: Invasion of the Mindmorphs [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Shortly before his regeneration began, the Twelfth Doctor dreamt of Rose saying his name. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) A Time Lord author learnt of Rose and her experiences as the Bad Wolf while doing research for his book and briefly considered that she might have been the Hybrid of Gallifreyan legend but ultimately dismissed the idea as her story didn't fit the prophecy. (PROSE: A Brief History of Time Lords [+]Steve Tribe, BBC Books (2017).)\n\nIn 1900s Bern, the Thirteenth Doctor used \"Rose\" as an alias. (PROSE: Einstein and the Doctor [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) During his second meeting with Team TARDIS, Jack Harkness explained to the three his initial death at the hands of the Daleks on the Game Station in 200,100, and how Rose managed to resurrect him but that she was now trapped on a parallel world. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nAlthough Donna Noble's memories of her own travels in the TARDIS were erased, including her encounters with Rose, Donna's daughter shared Rose's name (PROSE: We Are Family [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (Penguin Group, 2023). Page 35.) because, when she transitioned, she was subconsciously influenced by Donna's memories, having inherited a part of the DoctorDonna from her mother. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nThe Fifteenth Doctor listed Rose as one of the people that they had lost to the Fourteenth Doctor. The Fifteenth Doctor openly stated they loved her, along with Sarah Jane Smith. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nWhen the Fifteenth Doctor regenerated, his apparent successor took on the form of Rose. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nRose was a resourceful, brave, benevolent, curious and kind-hearted young woman. According to the Ninth Doctor, she was always asking the right sort of questions, (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and was quick to adapt to strange events. When she travelled back to the 1980s when she was just a baby, her father recognised her mother Jackie's acerbic wit and propensity for speaking her mind. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nEven before she met the Doctor, Rose was already a woman of firm convictions and high ideals, with clearer and less-compromised morals than her mother. After the explosion at Henrik's destroyed her job, she dismissed out of hand Jackie's suggestions to claim compensation or sell her story to the newspapers. Rose also had ambition, baulking at the idea of working at the butcher's or dishing out chips in the hospital canteen - an unappealing prospect which would later come back to haunt her when she went undercover as a dinner lady at Deffry Vale High School. (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) In stark contrast to Jackie, who believed that her daughter's job as a shop girl at Henrik's was giving her \"airs and graces\", she appeared to regret leaving school and considered taking some A-levels. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nIn many ways a very modern young person, Rose's worldview was firmly idealistic. She appeared profoundly uncomfortable with the notion of privilege founded on distinctions of class or wealth, instinctively taking against vain, entitled individuals like Cassandra and Henry van Statten who revelled in their fantasies of social status; she reacted with disgust at the former's pretensions of human purity in the face of \"mongrels\", and gave the latter short shrift when he discussed Rose as if she wasn't there (The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).). Like the Doctor, Rose had little patience for the rituals of hierarchy: on Platform One she was visibly shocked when the plumber Raffalo told her she needed to be given permission to speak, was similarly shaken by Gwyneth's low pay and expectations as a servant girl (The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).), and joined the Doctor in his humiliation of Eddie Connolly after witnessing his paternalistic grip on his household. (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Like the Doctor, Rose showed no interest in money or recognition, dismissing her mother's suggestion of knighthoods after the Slitheen invasion (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) though she did not object when presented with that same honor by Queen Victoria. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nRose fell easily into the role of the Doctor's companion, showing assertiveness, curiosity, and great courage in the face of danger. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) She was occasionally prone to screaming when under attack by large creatures such as the Reapers (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) or a werewolf, (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) but was also very capable of holding her nerve when confronting psychological and alien threats such as Daleks (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) including the Emperor (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and Black Dalek Sec, (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Cybermen, (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) including John Lumic as a Cyber Controller, (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Sontarans including the maniacal Colonel Snathe, (COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar [+]John Tomlinson and Nick Abadzis, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).) Ice Warriors including Lord Hasskor and Commander Slaan, (AUDIO: Cold Vengeance [+]Matt Fitton, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).) the Master in his \"Tremas\" incarnation, (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) Raxacoricofallapatorian criminals including Slitheen (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and renegade Blathareen, (PROSE: The Monsters Inside [+]Stephen Cole, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) the Nestene Consciousness and its Autons, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) the Beast, (TV: The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and the Daleks' creator Davros. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nShe was also willing to kill if she had to; using the power of the time vortex to wipe out the Emperor Dalek and his fleet, (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) forcibly ejecting the possessed Toby Zed into space, (TV: The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and blasting members of the New Dalek Empire apart with a large energy gun during their invasion of the Medusa Cascade. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Trapped in Downing Street by the Slitheen with the Doctor and Harriet Jones, she suggested using the emergency protocols at their disposal to \"launch a nuclear bomb at them\", prompting Harriet to remark she was \"a very violent young woman\". (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Suspicious of Chip's intentions as he lured her into the basement of the New New York Hospital, Rose picked up a metal rod to defend herself, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and would likewise brandish a chair at a group of advancing Ood she and the Doctor initially believed to be hostile. (TV: The Impossible Planet [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nRose cared deeply about the Doctor, although she originally denied any romantic feelings towards him despite indications to the contrary. (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) However her feelings for him grew quickly and significantly. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Impossible Planet [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) In what seemed their final meeting on the beach of Bad Wolf Bay, she tearfully admitted to the Doctor that she loved him; he began to reply, but only got out the words, \"Rose Tyler\", before he was cut off. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nOn one occasion, Rose began to question her personal romantic taste in men when she discovered that a rock band which she \"fancied\" turned out to be incredibly violent neanderthal-like mutants known as the Primords, who would set-up their shows often by attacking those near the stage and setting some on fire. As the Doctor attempted to find a way to help the group be less violent, Rose noted a direct correlation between if she still \"fancied\" them and if they were still exhuming primal energy. (COMIC: Untitled [+]Rachael Smith, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor backup comic stories (2017).)\n\nRose cared a great deal for those close to her, remaining fiercely devoted to her mother and Mickey. More than once, the Doctor was forced to accept that Rose's concern for Jackie overrode all other considerations. Despite dire warnings, she couldn't resist trying to intervene in her parents' affairs, making a botched attempt to patch up their differences in 1987 (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).), and later bestowing the same attentions on their counterparts in the parallel universe, only to discover that the alternative Pete and Jackie were products of their circumstances, neither resembling the ones she knew in her own dimension. (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) When Elton Pope upset Jackie, the Doctor tracked him down for her so she could scold him, forgoing a confrontation with the Abzorbaloff to tell Elton that \"No one upsets my mum!\" (TV: Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) After meeting the Doctor, it was clear that the romantic relationship between her and Mickey was all but gone as Rose was falling in love with the Doctor. However, she and Mickey still remained good friends; when the Doctor forced her to return to Earth so he could face the Dalek Fleet alone in 200,100, Mickey consoled Rose and helped her return, even after their relationship had irreparably fallen apart when they previously met in Cardiff. When Mickey volunteered to stay on Pete's World to fight the Cybermen, he and Rose shared a teary farewell. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nRose proved capable of great forgiveness and boundless compassion, with a capacity to care for individuals who had done wrong and accept others for their differences. Her first instinct upon meeting the abused, tortured Metaltron Dalek was not fear but pity, and she felt sorry enough for it to defend it from the Doctor even after it killed 200 of Van Statten's staff. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Even after being nearly burned alive by Cassandra on Platform One, she quietly appealed for the Doctor to \"help her\" as she desiccated in the heat (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).). When Cassandra subsequently invaded Rose's body on New Earth, it was her sudden lack of empathy for the infected human experiments which gave her façade away to the Doctor. Despite enduring a day's worth of physically and psychologically taxing possession, Rose was shown to be genuinely sorrowful for Cassandra's death. (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Even though Adam Mitchell tried to kill them out of revenge and the Tremas Master's deceit, Rose chose to appeal to him and later mourned his death. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) She gave comfort to Elton Pope even after he had upset her mother due to to the Abzorbaloff's puppetry, (TV: Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) accepted Commander Lerox as a friend in spite of him being a Sontaran from the same group as Colonel Snathe, (COMIC: The Betrothal of Sontar [+]John Tomlinson and Nick Abadzis, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).) and was sympathetic to Silurian Hunter Vastra when she heard about her tragic past from Jenny Flint. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) While others cowered before the otherworldy Host in its cage, Rose's first instinct was to learn from it, promising she and the Doctor could help it get back home. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) She convinced Tommy Connolly to part with his dad on good terms even after his betrayal of his family, perhaps mindful of her own family's painful separations (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and questioned the necessity of enslaving Ood. (TV: The Impossible Planet [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nRose could also prove to be heavily impatient. On one occasion, she continuously pestered the Doctor about their intended destination of the Galápagos Islands while he was attempting to solve a mystery. (COMIC: Untitled [+]Rachael Smith, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor backup comic stories (2017).)\n\nRose was willing to call the Doctor out if she thought he was wrong. When the Doctor brushed aside the danger that Jackie was in when faced with a Slitheen, Rose reminded him the woman he was discussing was her mother. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) She was horrified the Doctor would allow the Gelth to use human corpses as a vessel for their consciousness; the Doctor's failure to listen to Rose's human plea of respect for their dead led to two deaths when the Gelth proved to be malicious and deceptive. (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) She also pointed out to the Doctor how his lust for revenge on the lonely, battle-scarred Metaltron was turning him into the very thing he had sworn to stop. In doing so, she reawakened the similarly lonely and battle-scarred Doctor to the virtues of empathy and humanity. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nRose had a morbid fascination with the subjects of reality television, to the point where she purchased the magazine Yikes Mag to keep up-to-date while she was travelling with the Doctor. The Doctor did not share her passion, but Sil was equally emphatic about the sufferings of those on the show. (COMIC: Untitled [+]Rachael Smith, Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor backup comic stories (2018).)\n\nRose had a jealous streak when it came to the Doctor. She and the Doctor's former companion, Sarah Jane Smith, traded barbs over who was the \"best companion\" but they became good friends afterwards, and happily greeted each other at their reunion on the Crucible. (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Rose acted hostile towards Tara Mishra, calling her a stowaway. (COMIC: Slaver's Song [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) While she denied that she felt jealous, she indeed confessed that she hadn't felt the same way when Jack had joined the team. (COMIC: Slaver's Song [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) When Martha said she couldn't reach the Doctor on her phone, Rose's reaction was \"Nor me, and I was here first!\", despite knowing the Doctor had had companions before her. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nShe also tended to be impulsive, acting on her own desires only to learn the hard way about the consequences of doing so. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Her headstrong approach to decision-making had a tendency to land her in peril: her precipitate choice to rescue a gas-masked child from a rooftop led her to hanging from a barrage balloon over Blitz-torn London in the middle of an air-raid (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).), while her investigation of Sneed's funeral hearse caused her to be chloroformed and kidnapped (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).). She also admitted when world-threatening situations ended up being her fault and was willing to apologise. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nBut such recklessness sometimes had its rewards; on both occasions it took her to the heart of the crisis. In her very first adventure, Rose's initiative enabled her to save the day, a pattern that was to be repeated many times: she deduced how to withstand the missile strike on Downing Street using her knowledge of how to survive earthquakes (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).), saved the bickering Doctor and Captain Jack from the gas-masked zombies in Albion Hospital by blasting a hole in the floor (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).), and enlisted Mickey's help to open the TARDIS console (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).). In the midst of the Sycorax invasion, Rose stepped forward to confront the Sycorax leader alone and spoke for the Earth in the absence of the Doctor. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nShe showed further examples of gutsy fortitude in facing down a succession of menaces during her travels with the Tenth Doctor: rallying the prisoners to break free of their chains as the Host transformed into a werewolf (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).), investigating Magpie's electrical shop on her own (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).), and joining Pete in infiltrating Lumic's Cyber-factory through the front entrance (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).). With the Doctor stranded in the pit on Krop Tor, it was Rose who took command at Sanctuary Base Six on the surface, urging each team member to play to their strengths. (TV: The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) During the Battle of Canary Wharf, she stayed by the Doctor's side to save the world from both Daleks and Cybermen even when faced with the prospect of never seeing her mother again, risking an eternity in the Void with an ultimate act of courage. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nRose Tyler had grown well since becoming a mother. Although she was eager to get back to her family, she was willing to stop her parallel self from spreading war and oppression. She was initially shocked by the Eighth Doctor but warmed up to him, especially when they both smirked on the idea of adventure. She accepted the Eleventh Doctor quickly and hugged him. She kept stopping the Eighth and Eleventh Doctors from quarrelling, knowing they'd only waste time needed to end the madness. She remained calm even though Sontarans were threatening them, and helped her parallel self to fight rebels. After it was over, she asked the Eleventh Doctor to find a companion. Eagerly, she kissed her husband when she returned. (COMIC: Empire of the Wolf [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who (2020) (Titan Publishing Group, 2021-2022).)\n\nA missing ad from 2005 described her as \"19 years old, 5'4\" in height, slim build with brown eyes and shoulder-length blonde hair\". (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) The Moment, perfectly imitating Rose, was 151 cm tall and weighed 121 pounds. She was almost never seen without her trademark hoop earrings.\n\nThe War Doctor noted that she was pretty. (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor) Henry Van Statten also described her as pretty. (TV: Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Her attractive appearance drew the attention of Drake Ayelbourne, who remarked that she was beautiful and became infatuated with her (COMIC: Mystery Date [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) and of William Shakespeare, who compared her to a summer's day. (COMIC: A Groatsworth of Wit [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2005).) Upon first seeing her reflection in a mirror when possessing her, the Lady Cassandra characterised Rose as a \"chav\", but also noted her attractive posterior, (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) as did Jack Harkness (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and Toby Zed. (TV: The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nBefitting her working-class background as an average shopgirl, Rose usually wore casual clothes and muted tones during her early travels with the Doctor, such as hoodies, faded T-shirts, tank-tops, baggy jeans and trainers. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) As time went on, however, she became more confident and sophisticated in her clothing choices, changing from jeans to tight black trousers and favouring zip-up jackets and form-fitting tops in brighter, bolder colours. (TV: The Long Game [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Impossible Planet [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nOccasionally, Rose made use of the TARDIS wardrobe when visiting historical periods for more appropriate feminine attire. (PROSE: The Clockwise Man [+]Justin Richards, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) For her first voyage into the past, to 1869 Cardiff, she wore a ruffled ruby-red Victorian dress with a black low-cut sequined bodice, complete with stockings and petticoats and a dark shawl worn over her shoulders. The Ninth Doctor remarked she looked beautiful. (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) She would wear a dress again on what she believed was a trip to see Elvis in the 1950s, donning a bright pink sequined dress and matching hairband, sunglasses and high-heeled shoes, as well as a cropped bomber jacket of steel blue leather and black fishnet tights. (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nHer choice of apparel did not always suit the times she found herself in; on her second visit to the Victorian era, dressed mistakenly for 1979, Rose's short denim dungarees and tights prompted Queen Victoria and her entourage to comment more than once on her \"nakedness\". (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Rose herself questioned the decision to sport a bold Union Flag T-shirt when she ended up hanging from a barrage balloon in the middle of a German air raid during the London Blitz. (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nHer wardrobe took on a more provocative aspect when she was possessed by Cassandra, who sought to flaunt the \"curves\" of her stolen figure. Inside Rose's body, Cassandra discarded her blue zip-up jacket to show off the low-cut patchwork blouse she had on underneath (in coloured patterns of violet, midnight blue, lilac and mauve); which she wore with the collar unbuttoned, baring her cleavage in an effort to seduce the Doctor. (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) After being restored, Rose continued to wear the blouse in such a style throughout more adventures. (AUDIO: Infamy of the Zaross [+]John Dorney, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017)., The Sword of the Chevalier [+]Guy Adams, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).; COMIC: Which Switch? [+]Michael Stevens, DWA comic stories (BBC Magazines, 2006)., Mirror Image [+]Jacqueline Rayner, DWA comic stories (BBC Magazines, 2006).)\n\nIn the rare moments where she and the Doctor would go undercover as service staff, Rose donned the uniforms of a school dinner lady (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and a cocktail waitress, (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)./The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) much to her annoyance. As she crossed dimensions to return to her universe in what would be her final time facing the Daleks, she dressed in a rose top under a bomber jacket of indigo leather with black trousers, reflecting her mature, battle-hardened personality following her separation from the Doctor. (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)./Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhen she met the Eighth and Eleventh Doctors, Rose Tyler wore a Prussian blue hoodie over a crimson t-shirt. She briefly wore a heliotrope dress when posing as her parallel self to keep her fleets busy. (COMIC: Empire of the Wolf [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who (2020) (Titan Publishing Group, 2021-2022).)\n\nRose was able to use firearms to effect. (TV: The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) She was a skilled gymnast; Rose mentioned she had \"got the bronze\" during her school years. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) She showed such physical strength and talents with martial arts, fighting by her parallel self's side. (COMIC: Empire of the Wolf [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who (2020) (Titan Publishing Group, 2021-2022).) As a Girl Guide, she learned to tie knots, using this skill to apprehend a member of the Herazi. (AUDIO: Infamy of the Zaross [+]John Dorney, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nRose proved more intelligent than she seemed. She was very observant, and often noticed things the Doctor failed to see. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Fear Her [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., AUDIO: Cold Vengeance [+]Matt Fitton, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).) She also proved a capable leader; rallying fellow captives to escape. (TV: Tooth and Claw [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Satan Pit [+]Matt Jones, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) She also knew about Union Jacks being the names of Union flags flown on sea, (TV: The Idiot's Lantern [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and also learned long words such as Raxacoricofallapatorius quickly. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor twice states on-screen that Rose is nineteen years old (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and Rose refers to her years before meeting the Doctor as \"the first nineteen years of [her] life\". (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) It is established on her missing poster she left with the Doctor on 6 March 2005 and was 19 years old. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nHowever, PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005)., a short story from Doctor Who Annual 2006, states that Rose was born on 27 April 1987. Although this contradicts the age stated in several television stories (she would have been about two months under eighteen when she met the Doctor), it is consistent with the appearance of the baby Rose in Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., set on 7 November 1987, where the baby is a few months old. Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006). establishes that Rose was six months old at the time of Pete's death, which would place her birth around early May or late April, seemingly agreeing with the Annual dating. Furthermore, The Vault: Treasures from the First 50 Years, states that Rose was eighteen during Rose.\n\nThe original script of the Bad Wolf Bay scene in Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008). contained an excerpt in which the Tenth Doctor gave the Meta-Crisis Doctor and Rose a piece of TARDIS coral, and Donna told them how to increase the rate of growth so that they could travel the stars in the parallel universe. \"The Doctor in the TARDIS with Rose Tyler, just as it should be\". This scene was removed in the final cut for complicating the scene too much. It was, however, mentioned in The Doctor's Data section of Doctor Who Adventures magazine, and in DWM 398. Russell T Davies states that it is fine to assume this part of the scene did actually occur. The scene is included on the Series 4 DVD Box Set.\n\nNews of Rose's return to the series leaked out during early production of the fourth series when photographs of her on set appeared on websites and in the press. After initial denials by the BBC, promotion for the season incorporated images of Rose Tyler. In an interview with Doctor Who Confidential aired in conjunction with Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Billie Piper revealed that the decision to bring Rose back had in fact been made when she left the series in 2006, and she had to mislead journalists and fans for the next year to keep Rose's return a surprise. Rose's first appearance in Series 4 is a surprise cameo at the end of Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., a scene shot during production of Turn Left and veiled in such secrecy that advance review copies of the episode had the scene edited out and, unlike many other aspects of the series (such as Rose's ultimate return), was broadcast without having been the subject of Internet spoilers. In a later interview with Doctor Who Magazine, Davies indicated the original plan was for Rose to not appear again until Turn Left, but on learning how well the cameo went over with viewers, at the last minute he inserted brief, silent images of Rose into The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008). and Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).; the scene was filmed for Midnight and was scripted. Davies added it to The Poison Sky before it was broadcast. As with Partners in Crime, the Poison Sky cameo was not included in review copies. Billie Piper receives screen credit for her appearances in Poison Sky and Midnight.\n\nAfter Rose was written out of Doctor Who at the end of Series 2, Russell T Davies considered giving the character her own 90-minute spin-off production, Rose Tyler: Earth Defence, with the possibility of such a special becoming an annual Bank Holiday event. Although the special was officially commissioned, Davies changed his mind and decided that such a return, wherein the audience would be able to see Rose when the Doctor could not, would spoil her final scenes in Doctor Who. The production was consequently cancelled.",
