  "content": "A genius scientist, Nyssa assisted the Doctor in his fourth incarnation before joining him, Adric and Tegan as a travelling companion after becoming the last of her kind. Following Adric's death, a period of time alone with the Doctor and travelling alongside Brewster, Hannah, Marc and Turlough, Nyssa left the TARDIS to assist in the curing of those with Lazar's disease.\n\nNyssa assisted those harmed by the Time War and rejoined the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough before remaining in E-Space. She was seemingly able to eventually return and entered into a relationship with Tegan on Earth.\n\nNyssa was born on Traken (AUDIO: Primeval [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).) circa 1961 (AUDIO: Cobwebs [+]Jonathan Morris, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2010).; TV: Logopolis [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).) as the daughter of Consul Tremas and Lucina. (TV: The Keeper of Traken [+]Johnny Byrne, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).) Both of her grandfathers had died by the time she was born (AUDIO: The Toy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and her mother died in childbirth (PROSE: Empire of Death [+]David Bishop, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) or when she was young. (AUDIO: The Haunting of Thomas Brewster, Pursuit of the Nightjar)\n\nHaving grown up in the harmony of the Traken Union, Nyssa was shielded from the horrors of the universe. (AUDIO: 1001 Nights) She was brought up to be altruistic and to always put others before herself, a rule that she abided by. (AUDIO: The Entropy Plague) As Trakenite nobility, Nyssa learnt the manners and behaviours expected of her, including dance, which she considered herself quite good at, (TV: Black Orchid [+]Terence Dudley, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) whilst the servants' children were able to share rooms and play in the grounds. (AUDIO: The Toy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Due to her father's position, Nyssa spent most of her time amongst older people and was starved of company of her own age. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Keeper of Traken [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from The Keeper of Traken (Johnny Byrne), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1982).)\n\nTremas entered into a romantic relationship with Kassia (TV: The Keeper of Traken [+]Johnny Byrne, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).) and would play her a piece of Trakenite music when she was feeling low. Nyssa remembered the piece fondly. (AUDIO: The Entropy Composition) She had a number of teddy bears, namely a talking one called Big Bear who \"guarded\" her when she slept. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nNyssa inherited her father's love of science. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Keeper of Traken [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from The Keeper of Traken (Johnny Byrne), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1982).) She was a genius, with bioelectronics (TV: Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) and cybernetics as her strong points. (TV: Four to Doomsday [+]Terence Dudley, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) However, she knew very little about telebiogenesis. (TV: Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) She assisted in a minor role with surgical operations, meaning that blood did not tend to make her nauseous. (PROSE: Goth Opera [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).)\n\nShe enjoyed tending a grove (AUDIO: Masquerade) and was once stung by a Lime Grove Wasp. (AUDIO: The Mutant Phase) She was able to let loose during the Autumn Festival, when her people hung paper lanterns on all the trees in the garden and carried all the fruits in, followed by singing and a food fight which included the consuls. It was undignified, but Nyssa loved it. (AUDIO: Spare Parts)\n\nShe recognised that she was very fortunate in her upbringing and had everything in her life handed to her on a plate. (AUDIO: The Peterloo Massacre)\n\nNyssa attended Tremas and Kassia's wedding, after which she met the Fourth Doctor and Adric. Unbeknownst to her, the Decayed Master planned to exploit the tremendous power of the Keepership, which her father was to inherit, by manipulating Kassia. Nyssa helped the Doctor and Adric prevent the Master from gaining the power of the Source, but was unable to prevent him from killing Kassia.\n\nAfterwards, Nyssa and Tremas bid farewell to the Doctor and Adric. Nyssa told her father that he had to put everything back together again following the Master's actions, but did not witness her father being killed and taken over by the decayed Time Lord, (TV: The Keeper of Traken [+]Johnny Byrne, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).) although she did think she heard a distant echo of mocking laughter. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Keeper of Traken [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from The Keeper of Traken (Johnny Byrne), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1982).) She sent a message to the TARDIS telling the Doctor of the Master's escape and Tremas's disappearance. (PROSE: Logopolis [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, adapted from Logopolis (Christopher H. Bidmead), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1982).)\n\nAfter the Trakens' message had been received by the Doctor, Nyssa met the Watcher who took her to Logopolis to find the Tremas Master, as she wished to know what he had done to her father. She was reunited with the Doctor and Adric and met Tegan Jovanka before the Master enslaved her mind and used her in his complex plan to conquer N-Space. The Doctor was able to break the Master's control over her and she learnt that he had killed and taken over her father's body.\n\nWhilst the Doctor, Tegan and the Master went to Earth in the latter's TARDIS, Nyssa and Adric remained in the Doctor's TARDIS on Logopolis. The Watcher helped Adric pilot the TARDIS and take them to Earth. However, during the journey, Nyssa witnessed the apparent destruction of the entire Traken Union thanks to an entropy wave, leading her to believe that she was the last of her kind. She witnessed the Doctor's regeneration into his fifth incarnation, (TV: Logopolis [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).) after which she helped get him back to the TARDIS. (TV: Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).)\n\nNyssa helped the Doctor get to the Zero Room, which she accidentally jettisoned in order to save the TARDIS from being destroyed in Event One. Arriving at Castrovalva for the Doctor's benefit, Nyssa found it was a secondary trap by the Master to get rid of the Doctor by using Adric to make block transfer computations. However, they managed to escape Castrovalva with Adric and the Doctor stabilised. (TV: Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).)\n\nUpon leaving Castrovalva, the TARDIS materialised in the Psychodrome, which created four competing kingdoms based on each of the travellers' individual perceptions of one another and their own backgrounds. Nyssa's perception proved to be the most dangerous due to her trauma causing her to associate the Doctor with the Master, resulting in the creation of King Magus. They were able to leave after acknowledging their flaws and shortcomings and affirm that they accepted one another despite them. (AUDIO: Psychodrome)\n\nIn 2592, after the four travellers were locked out of the TARDIS, Nyssa and Tegan booked rooms at a hotel and met Chris Cwej, from whom Nyssa learnt that Serenity had survived the entropy wave that wiped out the Traken Union. Nyssa escaped from Adjudicators with Chris and assisted in his investigations into corruption within the force, disarming fusion bombs and eventually meeting up with the Doctor, Tegan and Patience. (PROSE: Cold Fusion [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).)\n\nThe TARDIS landed on Isopterus, where the crew saved the humanoid survivors from giant termites. (PROSE: On the Planet Isopterus) Nyssa lost consciousness in the 1950s due to the presence of an intelligence which she and the Doctor later took to Otho. (PROSE: First Born)\n\nOn Monarch's spacecraft, Nyssa was, unlike Adric, appalled by the Urbankans' plans and was determined to oppose tyrants following her encounters with the Master. Because of this, she was taken away to become an android. She was rescued by the Doctor and Bigon but, after the TARDIS dematerialised, she fainted (TV: Four to Doomsday [+]Terence Dudley, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) due to Kwundaar afflicting her with evil. (AUDIO: Primeval [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).) Whilst the Doctor initially believed that she had suffered a mild mental disorientation, he later believed that it was a sign of post-traumatic stress resulting from the death of her father. (PROSE: Empire of Death [+]David Bishop, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).)\n\nAfter Nyssa collapsed a second time, the Doctor built a delta wave augmenter. Although she claimed that she was alright, she admitted that she was having difficulty concentrating and used the augmenter, sleeping for days and eventually waking up apparently fully recovered. (TV: Kinda [+]Christopher Bailey, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).)\n\nIn 1666 London, Nyssa found evidence of the use of an alien weapon inside Sir John's house and headed to the TARDIS to build a sonic booster to defeat the Terileptils' android, something that she did with some assistance from Adric. She successfully used it to destroy the android, after which the pair tried to use the TARDIS to travel back to the house. (TV: The Visitation [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).)\n\nNyssa and Adric instead arrived in the future, near the Mississippi River. They helped James escape his slave masters and restored power to Doc Ashberry's TARDIS (PROSE: The Dark River) before returning to 1666, where they were reunited with the Doctor and Tegan and attempted to extinguish what would become the Great Fire of London. (TV: The Visitation [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).)\n\nThe Celestial Toymaker gave Nyssa dreams of Traken, her father and the consuls. She was angry with the Doctor when he agreed to help separate the Toymaker from Rallon, not understanding why he could not have done the same for her father and the Master. Whilst she remained unhappy, the two discussed the matter and she remained strong, something that Tegan admired. (PROSE: Divided Loyalties [+]Gary Russell, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).)\n\nBelieving Udilf's people to be threatened by aliens, Nyssa and Tegan assisted them in making weapons and armour. However, they learnt from the Doctor and Adric that the aliens were actually U'thai's people, after which Nyssa preferred a peaceful solution, something that Tegan and Adric disagreed with. (PROSE: The Immortals)\n\nDue to a communication node disguised as a toy, Nyssa had recurring nightmares of her father on Traken. The telepathic call led her to a room where she saw a vision of the First Doctor and the Master on Gallifrey, the Doctor later telling her that the node had been locked away so that it could not be used to track himself and Susan. (AUDIO: The Toy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhilst the Doctor and Tegan left Gallius Ultima to investigate the Larger Magellanic Cloud, Nyssa and Adric stayed behind and watched the autopsy of the crew of the previous expedition to the cloud. She saw Rovus begin his attack and, when the Star Men invaded, she was sent to their universe for a time. (AUDIO: The Star Men)\n\nAt the Contingency in 1864, Nyssa escaped from Edward with Adric and encountered Marjorie Stonegood, who helped them leave via the tube tunnels. They discovered an underground bathhouse, within which grew a number of Edwards. (AUDIO: The Contingency Club)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor traced Adric and Tegan to Zaltys after they disappeared from the console room. Gevaudan detected Nyssa's psychic capabilities and used them to magnify his own, allowing him to defeat the vampires. (AUDIO: Zaltys)\n\nIn the 1920s, Nyssa encountered the Master again and was taunted about the destruction of her planet by him. He hypnotised her, something that Tegan sympathised with after being controlled by the Mara and the Terileptils. (AUDIO: Smoke and Mirrors)\n\nOn Cicero Prime, the Doctor was mistaken for the Scorpion and Nyssa for his assistant, taking on the alias of \"Nyssa the Destroyer\" to avoid being imprisoned and executed. The two eventually reunited with Adric and Tegan and helped protect Miranda from the real Scorpion. (AUDIO: Kingdom of Lies)\n\nNyssa and Adric were attacked by an invisible force in 17th century Yorkshire. Using a displacement generator, the Doctor sent Nyssa to 1738 where she was accused of being a witch before being saved and cared for by Matthew Doyle. However, her rejection of his love caused him to side against her when the villagers demanded that she be drowned, a fate that she was saved from by the Doctor. (AUDIO: Ghost Walk)\n\nNyssa disliked Argentia, finding it excessively decadent. She was tasked with finding out the species of the snake which attacked Galgo whilst he was investigating the murder of Angelo Mazzini. (AUDIO: Serpent in the Silver Mask)\n\nOn a Rutan weapon test field, Nyssa, Adric and Tegan were kidnapped by Adam Mitchell. (COMIC: In Their Nature) They and numerous other companions of the Doctor were saved from death by Frobisher and later rejoined their Doctor. (COMIC: Endgame)\n\nIn 1925, Nyssa met and befriended her doppelgänger, Ann Talbot. Ann supplied her with a costume identical to her own, allowing the two to play a trick on the guests at Cranleigh Hall as nobody was able to tell them apart, confusion which Nyssa was able to prolong thanks to Tegan having taught her how to Charleston. However, their resemblance led to George Cranleigh kidnapping Nyssa by mistake, although he eventually released her upon realising his mistake. (TV: Black Orchid [+]Terence Dudley, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).)\n\nThe travellers celebrated Christmas in the TARDIS, but Nyssa was angered when Adric and Tegan's antics resulted in their Christmas tree falling over. She stuffed the pudding that Adric had created using Block Transfer Computation up Tegan's nose. (PROSE: In the TARDIS: Christmas Day) According to Iris Wildthyme, she once spent Christmas aboard the TARDIS with the four travellers. (AUDIO: Excelis Dawns)\n\nNyssa and her companions watched the Freedom Day celebrations on Lemaria, including a reenactment of the rescue of the planet by the First Doctor and Susan. After the actor playing the First Doctor took out his sonic screwdriver to defeat the Megrati, Nyssa realised that the actor was himself an incarnation of the Doctor. (PROSE: The Constant Doctor)\n\nNyssa was told by the Dar Traders that she should be dead, which was later revised to her having a strange connection with death due to being a Trakenite. She was stabbed and died for three minutes, after which she awoke in Tegan's arms having been brought back by the Dar Trader. (AUDIO: The Darkening Eye)\n\nWorking with Adric, Nyssa attempted to fly the TARDIS, which resulted in the ship materialising on Fleming's Island, the TARDIS falling off a cliff after the four left. Nyssa found herself briefly overwhelmed by the psychic presence of the I Predator, which they later managed to trap. (AUDIO: Iterations of I)\n\nNyssa and Adric played chess outside of the TARDIS, but she got fed up of his grumbling and left him on his own. She was able to coax him out of his bedroom days after the Doctor saved him from becoming a Melkur-like statue on a lifeless world, promising him that he could return to the planet in a matter of months as she knew that he would not wish to do so. (PROSE: Hearts of Stone)\n\nFollowing another argument between the Doctor and Adric, Nyssa spoke to the both of them. She remained in the TARDIS with Professor Kyle after they saved her from Cyberman androids and destroyed a lieutenant when the Cybermen entered the ship. With the Doctor and Tegan, she watched Briggs's freighter crash into Earth with Adric aboard. (TV: Earthshock [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) She asked the Doctor if the TARDIS could go back and save him, but the Doctor refused. (TV: Time-Flight [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) Otherwise, she showed little reaction to Adric's death, something that the Doctor later believed was due to post-traumatic stress. (PROSE: Empire of Death [+]David Bishop, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).)\n\nThe crew returned the freighter's personnel to their own time and, instead of landing at the the Great Exhibition as the Doctor intended, landed at Heathrow. Nyssa, the Doctor and Tegan investigated the disappearance of a Concorde and found themselves transported to 140,000,000 BC where Nyssa's psychic powers came to the fore. Upon defeating the Master once more, Nyssa and the Doctor left Tegan at Heathrow in a hurry to avoid providing an explanation to Douglas Sheard, unaware that Tegan wished to remain with them. (TV: Time-Flight [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).)\n\nAfter Adric's death and leaving Tegan at Heathrow, Nyssa began to keep a journal which she entitled Observations and Analysis, A Journal. The Doctor told her that he would take her to the Great Exhibition as he had originally intended, but they encountered what claimed to be the ghost of Adric and instead went to 1863. She eventually broke down and admitted to the Doctor and to herself that, on some level, she blamed him for the deaths of her father, her world and Adric. (PROSE: Empire of Death [+]David Bishop, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor put Tegan's possessions into storage. (AUDIO: The Elite [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nNyssa remained in the TARDIS, mourning Adric whilst the Doctor had an adventure at a school. (PROSE: Long Term) At some point, the two met P. G. Wodehouse. (AUDIO: Autumn)\n\nIn 1945 Maine, Nyssa and the Doctor investigated the phenomenon of the Truth Tellers and met Jonny Heftklammern and Nettie Washington, who declined the Doctor's offer to join them in the TARDIS. (PROSE: Tip of the Tongue) In Wales in the 1980s, she suggested that she and the Doctor visit Tegan and found herself trapped in Ellen Carter's games. (PROSE: Past Reckoning)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor were rescued from the ocean of Lethe by the crew of the Lung of Heaven. She was later taken captive aboard the Parliament of Rats before being rescued by the Doctor and Constantine. (PROSE: The Parliament of Rats) On Earth, Nyssa and the Doctor ran from one of Nicholas Carnon's creatures to his manor, where she cried for the first time since the death of her father and the extinction of her people. (PROSE: The Eternity Contract)\n\nAfter losing the lottery, Nyssa and the Doctor went to Monitoring Base XL-7 on a planet that the Doctor had once won. They met Sebastian Musgrove, who tried to sacrifice them to Telxzana. Upon learning that Telxzana was dying, the travellers promised to send a survey ship to the base to pick up Sebastian. (PROSE: Lonely Days)\n\nThe TARDIS materialised above Alaska in 1964 before almost colliding with a light aircraft, after which it travelled to the same spot in 1994. Nyssa experienced headaches and encountered the Permians, whom she helped kill by burning down the house built by Monica Lewis. (AUDIO: The Land of the Dead)\n\nNyssa was transported to Switzerland by the Doctor's Spillager detector, where she became embroiled in poltergeist activity at a boarding school. When the Doctor arrived, she reluctantly helped him investigate and they discovered Spillager scouts using the pupils' psychic abilities to open a gateway for an invasion. Nyssa was forced to use her nascent telepathic powers to close the gateway. (AUDIO: Winter for the Adept) Unbeknownst to her, her growing abilities were due to Kwundaar's manipulations. (AUDIO: Primeval [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).)\n\nWhilst Nyssa was repairing the TARDIS, it was thrown into a time corridor to Kansas in 2158 where she met the Daleks for the first time and helped research and avert the Mutant Phase. She questioned the Doctor about why he was able to use time travel to save the Daleks but not to save Adric. (AUDIO: The Mutant Phase)\n\nOn a mission for the Time Lords, Nyssa and the Doctor went to convince Cardinal Zero to rejoin the High Council of Gallifrey. Nyssa interfered in Redklaw's trial and, after being taken before Cardinal Zero, learnt from him of the fact that the Doctor was exiled from their planet. (AUDIO: Spring) An attempt by Nyssa to repair the TARDIS's chameleon circuit resulted in the craft turning into a whale, which the pair then had to recover. (AUDIO: The Deep)\n\nHaving succumbed to Kwundaar's influence, Nyssa collapsed and was taken by the Doctor to Traken in the Primeval Times to be cared for. She befriended Sabian whilst she recuperated and was cured as part of a deal between the Doctor and Kwundaar, who died after he took control of the Source and Nyssa cleansed it of corruption. She elected not to remain on ancient Traken but to continue travelling with the Doctor, her psychic powers once again dormant. (AUDIO: Primeval [+]Lance Parkin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).)\n\nThe TARDIS landed on Mondas where Nyssa met Yvonne Hartley and helped save her father. She had an affection for the Hartleys and was frustrated when the Doctor told her that they could not interfere in events as they were pivotal to the creation of the Cybermen. Nonetheless, they attempted to improve the future of the Mondasians by pouring wine into the nutrient feed of the Central Committee. (AUDIO: Spare Parts)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor continued their repairs to the TARDIS which proceeded to drift into the Veln system and have an accident with a Koteem ship, causing the dyestrial poisoning of Veln. Nyssa waited with the TARDIS as the Doctor went off to warn the people of the dangers of using dyestrial, but she heard a scream and found Veline's body. She was charged with her murder and was to be executed before she was saved by the Doctor, Quain and Forleon. (AUDIO: Creatures of Beauty)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor were locked in the Tower of London after the Doctor gave her incorrect currency to pay their tavern bill. Isaac Newton deduced that they were time travellers and eventually let them go after they told him tales of the future and of his continued legacy, although Nyssa could not understand why the Doctor would admire the man. (AUDIO: Summer)\n\nMaya gave Nyssa and the Doctor an illusionary adventure at the end of which the Doctor told Nyssa that he would not be going with her, telling her that she would have to be the Doctor from then on. In tears, she returned to the TARDIS and entered the code that the Doctor gave her to remove his telepathic link from the TARDIS, which she then learnt actually strengthened his connection to the ship and rescued him from Maya. (PROSE: Confabula)\n\nNyssa took issue with Surrender, Earthlings! and was appalled when the Doctor became addicted to it, later joining with the Provisional Wing of the National Viewers and Listeners Association to attack the BBC and end the transmission. Meeting up with the Doctor, they ensured that the programme received zero ratings, defeating the Xyz. (PROSE: Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life)\n\nOn Cray, Nyssa found Darzil Carlisle for the Doctor and, after learning that he had been taking credit for the Doctor's peacekeeping efforts, chose to leave the TARDIS and stay with him in order to help him use his influence to do good. However, following Carlisle's death and the escape of Morian and Faye Davis, she left with the Doctor, asking him not to meet Carlisle again until she had left his company. (AUDIO: The Game)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor interviewed the team members of the fifty-seventh Fraternity research station after the appearance of a duplicate of Ian Bird, for whom Nyssa felt sympathetic due to his status as the sole member of his kind. The Doctor suggested that he take Nyssa for a holiday after the duplicate killed Stuart Gorey before vanishing, his fate uncertain. (PROSE: The 57th)\n\nThe Doctor took Nyssa to Saturn where they met Hel and Keet in a café. Nyssa went with the couple after the Doctor was deported to Titan and was saddened by the Saturnites' society, being reminded of her own planet and missing her family. She and the Doctor were eventually reunited and left the planet, with Nyssa remaining unaware of why Hel and Keet would accept never meeting their son per the Saturnite customs. (PROSE: Saturn)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor met a tribe of gypsies in 12th century Lebanon and learnt of a superstition stating that the dead appeared in the church to those responsible for their deaths. Nyssa and Ioanna sneaked into the church, where Nyssa saw an apparition of her father. She and the Doctor escaped from the church after the villagers and gypsies set it alight with them inside, believing that they were to blame for the manifestations. (PROSE: The Church of Saint Sebastian)\n\nFor a holiday, the Doctor took Nyssa to Stockbridge where she began writing a novel about Traken. She shared her first kiss with Andrew Wittaker, who took her to Traken Village under the belief that that was where she came from. She contemplated living on Earth after finding that she had fallen in love with Andrew, but she realised that she did not like his lack of regard for consequences and departed, leaving him her completed novel. (AUDIO: Autumn)\n\nFor a short while, Nyssa undertook a solo expedition to 13th century Rhodes whilst the Doctor visited Stockbridge in the 20th century. During that time, she communicated with the Doctor across time and space through a pocket interocitor. Due to the Daleks' manipulation of time and space, she and a knight called Mulberry were transported to the middle of the American Civil War. Following her rescue by the Doctor, (AUDIO: Renaissance of the Daleks) the pair visited Vortis where they helped the Menoptera against the Zarbi. (AUDIO: Return to the Web Planet)\n\nDuring a power cut in the TARDIS caused by temporal phenomena, Nyssa was sent to 1867 London by a Death Wraith but was soon reunited with the Doctor, who had arrived in the TARDIS twelve months earlier. She was kidnapped from 107 Baker Street by Thomas Brewster, who stole the TARDIS key that the Doctor had given her and left in the ship, leaving Nyssa and the Doctor stranded until they were able to find a version of the TARDIS from an alternative timeline created by the Wraith. After averting said timeline and removing Brewster's psychic link, Brewster stole the TARDIS a second time. (AUDIO: The Haunting of Thomas Brewster)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor were stranded on Earth for five months before they tried to use Block Transfer Computation to bring back the TARDIS, an attempt which transported Nyssa to the City of Excellence where she encountered an aged Adric. She rebuffed him, denying having loved him and refusing to become his bride, but Adric ended up joining her and the Doctor and ended his plans for revenge. Returned to 1868, Nyssa mourned Adric when he died once more and returned to the TARDIS after he helped Brewster pilot it back to them. (AUDIO: The Boy That Time Forgot)\n\nAlthough Nyssa initially believed that she and the Doctor had merely got themselves lost in the TARDIS, they learnt that Brewster had sold some of the ship's parts, including the conceptual geometer. The Doctor traced the parts to a time reef where Nyssa and Brewster saved a Rukh and the removed instruments were recovered from Commander Gammades, allowing them to restore the TARDIS. (AUDIO: Time Reef)\n\nPer Brewster's request, the Doctor piloted the TARDIS to 2008. Nyssa believed that Brewster might have changed time to bring about a utopia, a suggestion that the Doctor gave no credit as he could not believe that any alteration to the timeline could bring about such universally benign effects. When they learnt that reality had been altered by Phil and Trev, Nyssa asked them if they could put things right, after which she was surprised by Brewster's decision to remain in 2008 with Connie Winter. (AUDIO: A Perfect World)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor went to Stockbridge to celebrate Christmas, choosing to go to 1899 so as to avoid bumping into Andrew. After watching a play about the Doctor, the pair went to 1199 and encountered the Rutans, who attempted to absorb Nyssa's knowledge and for whom she supplied unlimited energy knowing that it would prove to be their undoing. They returned to 1899 and boarded a Rutan ship to end its influence over Osbert's descendants, initially unaware that the ship was in poor condition and about to explode. (AUDIO: Castle of Fear)\n\nAwakening in a time bubble created by the ship's explosion, Nyssa met a possible future version of herself known as the Lady of the Manor. She and the Doctor stopped the bubble from expanding to include the whole of Earth, preventing them from becoming the Lord and Lady, but they were unable to escape from the bubble in time as it exploded. (AUDIO: The Eternal Summer)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor found themselves in 45th century Stockbridge where she, Lysette Barclay and Rinxo Jabbery were taken captive by the Daleks. The two travellers attempted to save Lysette as Stockbridge was destroyed, but to no avail. Following Stockbridge's destruction, Nyssa attempted to comfort the Doctor and suggested that they go off to happier times and places. (AUDIO: Plague of the Daleks)\n\nUpon receiving a distress call, Nyssa and the Doctor arrived on the SS Hermes and met Ailsa and the ship's crew, learning of their ancestors' arrival in the Ardelban system a hundred years previously. (PROSE: Curiosity)\n\nNyssa and the Doctor attended a Christmas party in 1539 at which they were taken prisoner by Norfolk due to Henry VIII's attraction to Nyssa rather than Katherine Howard. The two women became friends and ladies-in-waiting until the Doctor got Nyssa back to the TARDIS, after which they travelled forward in time to ensure that Henry fell in love with Katherine and that he would marry her after Anne of Cleves. (PROSE: God Send Me Well to Keep)\n\nHelping the Doctor locate all copies of Ronnie D. Clinton's Listen To The Beat on Royal Hospital Street but unaware of why, Nyssa met Alan Collins. The two managed to get him to swap his copy for the Doctor's copy of Ain't Got No Home To Go To, one that Nyssa knew that the Doctor would miss, and she finally learnt that they had been hunting the vinyl down due to them containing a hypnotic track by the Master. (PROSE: Tweaker)\n\nIn 1665, Nyssa and the Doctor arrived in Red Lodge and were attacked by the Speera who took their forms and attempted to absorb them. Nyssa was able to trick the Speera into adopting the Doctor's form, resulting in fatal anomalies which killed them due to their belief that the Doctor was a human and had only one heart. The two travellers then remained in Red Lodge, as the Speera attempt to replicate her had brought the subject of Traken to the forefront of her mind for the first time in a long while and she wished to watch the sunrise.

(AUDIO: The Entropy Composition)\n\nWhen the Doctor was arrested and imprisoned on Folly, Nyssa attempted to get herself arrested as well in order to join him but was unsuccessful.

(AUDIO: Smuggling Tales)\n\nA sultan forced Nyssa to tell him stories of her adventures, leading her to tell him about her visits to the Miaxa's prison, Norwood and Fabula. She and the Doctor eventually learnt that he was trying to steal the Doctor's identity and steal the TARDIS, but the Doctor's memories made him break down. (AUDIO: 1001 Nights)\n\nNyssa was taken by the Doctor to 1963 to see the Beatles and the two became aware of Lenny Kruger's changes to the timeline, using the Common Men to gain power. By means of a blood test on Korky Goldsmith, she learnt that the Common Men were non-humans from Byulna and helped to defeat Lenny, restoring the timeline. (AUDIO: 1963: Fanfare for the Common Men)\n\nOn 23 November of the same year, Nyssa and the Doctor visited Bob Dovie's house, 59A Barnsfield Crescent, the Doctor having suddenly felt the need to visit.

(AUDIO: The Second Oldest Question)\n\nVisiting the hunting grounds of Nathaniel Whitlock in 1911 Suffolk, Nyssa and the Doctor met Hannah Bartholemew and became aware of the presence of Vatuus on the planet. Nyssa stood guard whilst the Doctor and Silver Crow entered the Ghost Dance to trap Vaatus once again and later departed with him in the TARDIS, (AUDIO: Moonflesh) unaware that Hannah had stowed away on board.\n\nThe TARDIS landed on an Arrit tomb ship where Nyssa, the Doctor and Hannah defeated the Arrit-Ko. Although the Doctor set the coordinates to return Hannah home following the adventure, he said that that would most likely be the last place that the TARDIS would land. Thus, Hannah was accepted as a companion. (AUDIO: Tomb Ship)\n\nOn SORDIDE Delta, Nyssa was trapped in a virtual reality where the Doctor was her guardian and Hannah was her 18th century tutor. Hannah was able to save both Nyssa and the Doctor but lost all of her emotions in the process, prompting her to leave the TARDIS and remain on the space station to help the survivors. (AUDIO: Masquerade)\n\nIn the Arc of Infinity, after listing off all the things that the Doctor had to repair in the TARDIS, Nyssa witnessed Omega link himself to the Doctor's biology and later stood up to the High Council on Gallifrey in an attempt to save her companion's life, holding Borusa at gunpoint. She and the Doctor escaped Gallifrey and travelled to 1983 Amsterdam where they were reunited with Tegan, who helped them stop Omega from returning and rejoined them aboard the TARDIS. Nyssa told her that she had missed her and that it was wonderful to have her back. (TV: Arc of Infinity [+]Johnny Byrne, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).)\n\nNyssa, the Doctor and Tegan remained in Amsterdam and went to the Rijksmuseum where they discovered that Rembrandt had drawn functional spacecraft. This led to the team learning of and defeating the Nix, in the course of which Nyssa met Rembrandt and spoke to him of his wife's death, understanding how it felt to lose a loved one. (AUDIO: The Waters of Amsterdam) After Nyssa and Tegan spent some time together holidaying in Amsterdam, the Doctor returned for them. (AUDIO: The Elite [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAccording to one account, the reunited crew first went to Akoshemon's moon after the Dark used its influence on Nyssa and left her concussed. She had a heart attack caused by the Dark but was revived by the Doctor, who hypnotised her in order to make use of the connection between the two of them. She later vomited out the Dark as it became corporeal and helped to defeat it before leaving the moon, mourning Captain Lawrence, Jyl Stoker and everybody else that died. (PROSE: Fear of the Dark)\n\nAccording to another account, the three travellers first went to Florana as the Doctor knew that Nyssa was taken with the tulips of Amsterdam and would like the scenery. They instead landed in its early history as a barren planet, where Nyssa was brainwashed by Educator Stemp into serving the High Priest as a recruit for the Elite. The Doctor eventually reversed the conditioning and she was returned to normal, leaving Florana after Thane killed the High Priest. (AUDIO: The Elite [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nNyssa thought about leaving the Doctor after Florana, but realised that the fate of the universe outweighed what had happened on that one planet. (AUDIO: The Children of Seth)\n\nTo recover after their experiences on Florana, the trio spent several days relaxing near Brisbane before Nyssa insisted that the Doctor help Tegan investigate the disappearance of Mike Bretherton. Their search took them to Luparis, where Nyssa agreed to help Lord Jezzavar with his coup in order to gain access to the Hexagoran palace after initially refusing his suggestion that she should be installed as queen. (AUDIO: Hexagora)\n\nWhilst Nyssa was conducting an experiment in the TARDIS, the ship was directed to the Archipelago of Sirius by a message picked up on the scanner. There, Nyssa was arrested and sent to Level 14 with her mind wiped, briefly believing that she was the Doctor. She was eventually able to remember enough about herself to plan a successful escape from Level 14 and a reunion with the Doctor and Tegan. (AUDIO: The Children of Seth)\n\nNyssa remained in the TARDIS whilst the Doctor and Tegan explored Aronassus 49, but did meet Threll when her companions brought him to the ship.

(PROSE: Amazing Fossil Fish)\n\nDuring another argument between the Doctor and Tegan over the impossibility of saving Adric, Nyssa interrupted to ask where they were. They went on to find that they were on the Hardy Station and saved the universe from being destroyed by a cyclotron. (PROSE: Lackaday Express)\n\nSadan Rassul and his men kidnapped Nyssa at the British Museum in 1896 and sent her back in time 4000 years using a lodestone. Rassul placed her in a coma to become the host for Nephthys, but the Doctor saved her and defeated Nephthys by employing the help of Ann Cranleigh to confuse the goddess. (PROSE: The Sands of Time)\n\nWhen the Doctor suffered from visions and worried that his mind was destroying itself, Nyssa and Tegan looked for help on Morestra and found themselves frustrated by the sexism they experienced from the Morestran Orthodox. Nyssa infiltrated the Sorenson Academy in search of information on the Zeta Project but was found out by the dean, whose advances she spurned, and sent to Zeta Major as a lab specimen. She was experimented on with anti-matter crystals and succumbed to the contamination before being saved by the inhabitants of the anti-matter universe. (PROSE: Zeta Major)\n\nNyssa, the Doctor and Tegan visited the Necropolitan to remember Adric, placing a small metal star in an alcove, and heard of the murder of a funeral director.

(PROSE: Wake)\n\nIn 493 Ravenna, Nyssa met Flavius Theodoric and introduced Tegan to him as \"High Queen of Brisbane\". She, the Doctor and Tegan were accused by Princess Ariadne of stealing the Crown of Byzantium, but it was eventually revealed that Prince Leo had stolen it. (PROSE: Goths and Robbers)\n\nAs they were not human, neither Nyssa nor the Doctor were as affected by the psychic phenomena that caused Anna to appear to them as Tegan. They went looking for Tegan and found her just after she had escaped from the apparition of Anna. (PROSE: Soul Mate)\n\nOn F-four, Nyssa and the Doctor carried out biological tests, causing Tegan to feel left out. Nyssa's work was invaluable to the colonists and she promised them that she would tell their story to anybody who would listen. (PROSE: No Exit)\n\nBoth Nyssa and Tegan were chased by Endovorms disguised as stone lions in Trafalgar Square in 1843. (AUDIO: The Lions of Trafalgar)\n\nNyssa found herself a part of The King of the Dead in 1982 and spoke with Patrick about how she had managed to forgive the Master for killing her father and how he should follow suit. (AUDIO: The King of the Dead)\n\nIn Mistpuddle, Nyssa and Tegan solved a series of murders committed by Pricklethorp and learnt that the talking animals that inhabited the village were engineered by Lindsay Wood. (AUDIO: The Mistpuddle Murders)\n\nThe Doctor, wanting to meet Cicero, took Nyssa and Tegan to 63 BC Cumae where they dressed in togas and pretended to be the Doctor's sisters; Claudia and Claudia. Whilst there, Nyssa came to believe that the Doctor was still struggling to come to terms with Adric's death, having originally interpreted his silence on the matter as him being cold-hearted. She and her companions were put through a series of tests by Tartarus, in the course of which she lured a bull into a pit, and she later invited Marc to join them in the TARDIS, an offer that he accepted. (AUDIO: Tartarus)\n\nNyssa visited Marc in his bedroom and was concerned by how difficult he found it to adjust to being a freedman. After the TARDIS landed on Proxima in the 30th century, she and Tegan found themselves in a separate time zone to the Doctor and Marc due to interstitial time, but were able to help their companions and Christopher Jennings defeat Kalu. (AUDIO: Interstitial)\n\nIn 19th century Ireland, the Spae Wife took control of Nyssa's mind in an attempt to gain control of the TARDIS. To free her from the Spae Wife's control, the Doctor attempted to remind her of Traken and Marc reminded her of their previous adventures together, but it was Tegan telling her how she would be affected by the loss of her best friend that restored her. She apologised to Tegan for her actions, but she told her that she understood due to her own experience with the Mara. (AUDIO: Feast of Fear)\n\nNyssa, the Doctor, Tegan and Marc found themselves drafted into the race on Samotis, during which Nyssa ran alongside Morris, whom she assisted and befriended. When Marc became partially cyber-converted, Nyssa and Morris put an end to the race by tying up the Commentator and disabling the course's fail-safes, forcing the system to shut everything down. (AUDIO: Warzone)\n\nNyssa cared for Marc in the TARDIS and was, with the Doctor, able to hack the mainframe and reverse all mental programming, restoring each Cyberman's memories and restoring Marc's. Afterwards, the upset Doctor left his companions on Callanna with a great deal of money, an action that Nyssa could not understand as she could not see how it helped anybody. (AUDIO: Conversion)\n\nUnlike Tegan, Nyssa enjoyed the tranquillity of Callanna and was not concerned about the planet's relaxing effects. She, Tegan and Marc worked with Steppa Westma Cotter-Thatch Slitheen to stop Bella and Grumma, after which the Doctor returned for them, telling them that they needed to talk. Nyssa was somewhat upset, believing that the three of them could have been happy living on Callanna. (AUDIO: Madquake)\n\nThe Doctor attempted to take Nyssa, Tegan and Marc to Gallifrey to have a talk mediated by a Time Lord, but they instead arrived at Welkin Sanatorium on Soresia where they saw an apparition of Adric. Once the ghostly phenomena was ended, Nyssa reminded the Doctor that they still needed to talk but, instead of going to Gallifrey, he apologised to the three of them for avoiding them and his emotions concerning Adric's death and Marc's conversion. (AUDIO: The Lost Resort)\n\nThe TARDIS arrived on RMS Oceanic, aboard which Nyssa found that she suffered from seasickness and explained that there were no seas on Traken. She was, however, cured when the Doctor gave her tablets of his own making, and she was able to assist in ensuring that Nellie Bly completed her journey. (AUDIO: The Perils of Nellie Bly)\n\nThe Doctor wanted to take his friends on holiday, but Marc collapsed after changing the coordinates. She placed Marc in a sleep pod hoping to stabilise his vitals. She went into the sleep machine with the Doctor to help discover what the Daleks were doing. She learnt that the Daleks were just ghosts who wanted to become real using the humans in the base. (AUDIO: Nightmare of the Daleks)\n\nNyssa, the Doctor and Tegan intended to visit Prague but arrived several hundred kilometres below the city. They were given a tour of the Svarozhich Project by Dr Jane Flora and found the corpses of project workers, finding that Szlth'TOK had killed them to avenge his people inadvertently killed by the project. After returning to the TARDIS, the Doctor tried to teach Nyssa and Tegan to read the star charts and asked that one of them read out coordinates for their next destination. (PROSE: Men of the Earth)\n\nTegan and Nyssa found that the TARDIS was shrinking and that the Doctor was the cause. Nyssa went with the Doctor to the Komoko mining planet to visit his old friend Velar. Having found his place abandoned, she thought he had left but later found out that he had been killed. She helped the Doctor to rig an explosion at a mine to help convince the miners of what Reno had done. (AUDIO: Friendly Fire)\n\nInside a time loop, Nyssa cycled around France, confused about when and where she was, until she encountered Jean-Baptiste who told her that she was an artist. She investigated what was causing the disruptions. (AUDIO: The Edge of the War)\n\nUsing a reference book, Nyssa found that Tegan had given them the coordinates for Manussa and later asked the Doctor if it was really necessary to hypnotise her. They learnt that Tegan was being influenced by the Mara and went in search of the scenes of her dream, in the course of which Nyssa lost Tegan in a marketplace and was unable to find her. Nyssa stole Ambril's key to free the Doctor after he was imprisoned and fell victim to the Mara's power before the Doctor defeated it. (TV: Snakedance [+]Christopher Bailey, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).)\n\nAfter they were summoned to Gallifrey by Cardinal Hemal to help solve a murder, Nyssa and the Doctor were taken by Hemal to examine the body of the murdered Time Lord, with Nyssa being interested to find out more about Gallifreyan physiology, while an unwell Tegan stayed in the TARDIS. When they returned to the TARDIS after discovering that the Time Lord had been killed by a vampire from the Cult of Rassilon the Vampire, Nyssa and the Doctor found that the vampire had taken refuge in the ship and infected Tegan. When the vampire set the coordinates for London at night to start his reign of terror on Earth, Nyssa covertly adjusted the TARDIS's parameters to bring the time forward ten hours, resulting in the vampire blithely stepping out into direct morning sunlight and instantly reducing to ash. While Tegan was freed from the vampiric taint, Nyssa remained concerned that other traces of vampire DNA might exist elsewhere in the universe. (COMIC: Blood Invocation [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who Yearbook comic stories (Marvel Comics UK, 1994).)\n\nIndeed, in their next adventure, Nyssa was bitten by the Child in 1993 Tasmania - beginning her transformation into a vampire - and found herself unable to tell the Doctor and Tegan what had happened to her, even after finding that sunlight hurt her and realising that she was craving blood, for which she attempted to synthesise a substitute. She attacked Tegan but was able to stop herself at the last moment from feeding on her and fled, eventually being returned to normal with the Child's death. (PROSE: Goth Opera [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).)\n\nNyssa was infected by a plant that she was inspecting on HMS Aquitaine and was subsequently taken to the medical bay by Hargreaves. Shortly afterwards, she met Dr Sergei Akunin who sedated and restrained her before she was able to escape using her newfound strength gained thanks to her transformation. She asked Hargreaves to amputate her arm but was ultimately saved when the Doctor, Tegan and Hargreaves aborted the timeline. (AUDIO: Aquitaine)\n\nThe TARDIS landed in 1819 Manchester where Nyssa joined Cathy Roberts in attending the protest which ended with the Peterloo Massacre, during which she witnessed the death of Cathy's son, Peter. Nyssa, upset and angry, blamed Mr Hurley for Peter's death. (AUDIO: The Peterloo Massacre)\n\nAfter the TARDIS encountered interference from a transmat capsule aboard a spacecraft, Nyssa and Tegan found Mawdryn's burnt body and assumed that it was the Doctor going through another regeneration. They soon realised that this was not the case and were infected by Mawdryn's disease, making it impossible for them to travel through the Time Vortex without rapidly ageing or de-ageing and forcing the Doctor to help Mawdryn. Whilst the Doctor was prepared to give up his remaining lives to save Nyssa and Tegan, they were restored by the Blinovitch Limitation Effect caused by Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart.\n\nVislor Turlough joined the TARDIS crew on their travels, something that Nyssa and Tegan were both unsure about. (TV: Mawdryn Undead [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).) In the Gardens of the Dead, Nyssa told Turlough, whom she decided to give a chance, how her father had been taken over and killed by the Tremas Master. She learnt that Turlough was working for the Black Guardian but, after hitting her head, she forgot about this. (AUDIO: Gardens of the Dead)\n\nNyssa, the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough met Ophiuchus in the Cloisters of the Capitol. She and Tegan convinced the Doctor to save Opiuchus rather than letting him die, saying that he was not a monster like the Master was. After Ophiuchus regenerated into a woman, the Doctor explained Time Lord gender to Nyssa. (COMIC: Ophiuchus)\n\nNyssa was trapped in her room when the destabilised TARDIS attached itself to Terminus and she was forced to pass through onto the space station to survive. The Doctor found her and the two explored the station, with Nyssa contracting Lazar's disease and eventually being left by the Vanir for the Garm, who successfully cured her.\n\nAppalled by the treatment of those who suffered from Lazar's disease and being aware that she could synthesise, and even improve upon, hydromel, Nyssa chose to stay aboard Terminus in order to help the Garm and the Vanir cure the disease and make the station a proper hospital independent of Terminus Inc. She gave the Doctor a kiss on the cheek as she said farewell, telling him that she was adamant that she would stay, and told Tegan that she would not die easily as, like Tegan, she was indestructible. (TV: Terminus [+]Steve Gallagher, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).)\n\nNyssa worked tirelessly to cure Lazar's disease and to create a vaccine against it, one which she helped to distribute. In the course of doing so, she travelled from laboratories to makeshift clinics to election meetings and had a number of lovers, after which she proceeded to leave Terminus in search of other challenges. Venturing out into the galaxy, she embarked on microbiological research to defeat a deadly fungus, diplomacy to avert a war and fundraising for medical supplies following a flood. (PROSE: Asylum [+]Peter Darvill-Evans, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nSome time after leaving the Doctor, Nyssa was transported to the Death Zone where she met Ian Chesterton, Steven Taylor, Sara Kingdom and Polly Jackson and was reunited with the Fifth Doctor, who had already travelled with her older self in his personal timeline. (AUDIO: The Five Companions)\n\nFollowing the destruction of Exanos, Nyssa decided to find a place free from war and became a technography lecturer at a university. There, she was reunited with the Fourth Doctor, who had not yet met her, and joined him in an adventure in the 12th century, in the course of which she fought back against a killer and realised that she needed to once again choose to enjoy her life. The Doctor returned her in the TARDIS, promising that he would pretend not to recognise her. (PROSE: Asylum [+]Peter Darvill-Evans, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nDuring the Time War, Nyssa operated a hospital ship known as the Traken and assisted planets that became caught up in the war. She met a man who called himself Dr Foster and became her assistant, although she came to suspect him of being a Time Lord saboteur. In truth, the saboteur was Dr Isherwood. Dr Foster departed after giving Nyssa a kiss on the cheek, reminding her of how she had said goodbye to the Doctor on Terminus. (AUDIO: A Heart on Both Sides)\n\nShe was taken by Gommen into the Gommen Machine believing she was a stuntman. She had discovered what Gommen was doing on a medical station as she was curious about what happening. She realised it was stolen Time Lord technology adapted from the Matrix. K9 Mark II helped her keep her mind active. She worked out the truth and that's why her mind was taken. She had been tracking Gommen due to his torturing in the name of medical advancement. After Gommen was arrested, she took his medical ship to add to her fleet. (AUDIO: The Stuntman)\n\nOn board the Varnomium, a quarantined ship, Nyssa worked to find a cure for the plague threatening the Stagnant Protocol. She was recruited for her unparalleled skill in this area. By the time the War Master arrived, she was working alone, both treating patients and running experiments to isolate the virus and reverse its impacts. The Master pretended to have been sent by the Stagnant Protocol, as an overseer, and joined her in her pursuit, sabotaging her experiments and manipulating her into killing one of her patients accidentally. In time, he managed to convince her to develop an even deadlier strain, in the interest of her research, and Nyssa finally realised who he was. The Master abandoned Nyssa aboard the Varnomium when he departed. (AUDIO: The Orphan)\n\nNyssa married Lasarti and had two children: Neeka (AUDIO: Winter) and Adric, whom she told stories of her travels in the TARDIS. (AUDIO: Prisoners of Fate) She was reunited with the Fifth Doctor once more when she assisted with his regeneration into his next incarnation. (AUDIO: Winter)\n\nNyssa set about attempting to find a cure for Richter's Syndrome. She had an android called Loki whose hard drive she once had to erase after it was corrupted by his fear of his own shadow. (AUDIO: Cobwebs [+]Jonathan Morris, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2010).)\n\nIn 3530, after losing contact with the Helheim facility attempting to cure Richter's Syndrome, Nyssa travelled to the planet with her android Loki. She was reunited with the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough, whom she had not seen in fifty years, and joined them on the condition that they take her home so that she could dispense the cure. She accepted, however, that that might take some time and went to find her old bedroom. (AUDIO: Cobwebs [+]Jonathan Morris, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) She had to keep from the Doctor her knowledge of his regeneration into his sixth body. (AUDIO: Heroes of Sontar)\n\nFollowing the trail of Richter's Syndrome, the TARDIS landed on Chodor in the 28th century. Nyssa and Turlough were split up from the Doctor and Tegan and fled from Mertil, getting lost in the forest and having to fight against the current of the river. (AUDIO: The Whispering Forest)\n\nThe TARDIS returned to Manussa, this time during the reign of the Manussan Empire, after Tegan confided in Nyssa that she had the mark of the Mara on her arm. (AUDIO: The Cradle of the Snake)\n\nNyssa encountered the Sontarans again on Samur, but did not remember previously meeting them in the Death Zone. (AUDIO: Heroes of Sontar)\n\nNyssa helped defeat the Trion Rennol, his mercenaries and the Morass on Vektris. (AUDIO: Kiss of Death)\n\nNyssa helped defeat a Rat King on 1982 Earth which attempted to exploit Nyssa's anger for the Tremas Master. She was tempted to help the rats create a non-lethal plague in return for help with curing Richter's Syndrome. (AUDIO: Rat Trap)\n\nFurther adventures took Nyssa to the comet Eight slash Q Panenka, (AUDIO: The Jupiter Conjunction) a monkey house in a zoo (AUDIO: The Monkey House) and 51st century Earth where she and Turlough spent a year training in Reykjavik and helped defeat Magnus Greel. (AUDIO: The Butcher of Brisbane)\n\nShe also helped defeat Eldrad (AUDIO: Eldrad Must Die) and had an adventure in Mercia. (AUDIO: The Lady of Mercia)\n\nDuring an adventure in India on 31 December 1926, Nyssa was rejuvenated and had her youth restored, making her look physically similar to how she had during her original adventures in the TARDIS. (AUDIO: The Emerald Tiger)\n\nThis meant that Adric, whom they came across on Valderon, believed that she was a past version of his mother. Nyssa learnt that twenty-five years had passed since her mission to Helheim and that she was presumed dead, whilst Lasarti was dead and Neeka was in suspended animation after being infected with Richter's Syndrome. She and Adric managed to develop a cure and planned to meet in one month's time to cure Neeka, but Adric never saw her again. (AUDIO: Prisoners of Fate)\n\nShortly after leaving Valderon, the TARDIS was diverted into E-Space when it passed too close to a Charged Vacuum Emboitment. Whilst searching for a way out, the TARDIS landed on Alzarius where Nyssa and Turlough were almost killed by Alzarian spiders. (AUDIO: Mistfall)\n\nThey then visited the ice world of Isenfel where she was interested in why the society wanted to be in equilibrium. (AUDIO: Equilibrium)\n\nThe TARDIS crashed on Apollyon where Nyssa began dying due to entropy. She also had the rejuvenation that she experienced in India removed due to making contact with the Sandmen, returning her to her older appearance. She chose to remain in E-Space in order to power a portal back to N-Space for her friends to use to return home. (AUDIO: The Entropy Plague)\n\nNyssa lived for at least another decade, spending a number of years treating the sick and teaching others how to do the same before retiring to tend a garden, much as she had on Traken in her youth. Despite the Doctor's concerns about entropy, Nyssa saw a new star emerge in the sky, hinting that there was still new life in E-Space. (AUDIO: The Entropy Plague)\n\nEventually, Nyssa would \"settle\" on Earth, (PROSE: The Doctor's Companions [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who Atlas (Puffin Books and BBC Children's Books, 2021). Page 15.) coming to live in 21st century Australia with Tegan, (WC: Farewell, Sarah Jane [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (YouTube, 2020).) becoming a couple. (WC: Farewell, Sarah Jane [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (YouTube, 2020)., PROSE: The Doctor's Companions [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who Atlas (Puffin Books and BBC Children's Books, 2021). Page 15.)\n\nThe pair attended Sarah Jane Smith's memorial one spring day where they mingled with other companions and friends of the Doctor's, as well as assisting them in fighting the Jackals of the Backwards Clock to foil the Trickster. Clyde Langer described them as being a couple. (WC: Farewell, Sarah Jane [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (YouTube, 2020).)\n\nAt some point, an image of Nyssa was obtained by UNIT and kept in the Black Archive as a record of her having been a companion of the Doctor. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAt some point, while she was travelling alone with the Fifth Doctor, they visited Bob Dovie at 59A Barnsfield Crescent in Totton, Hampshire on 23 November 1963. The pair pretended to be police officers. There, she and the Fifth Doctor discovered Bob's odd behaviour, including him talking on a phone that was disconnected from the wall. After finding Bob's family killed by the Master using a Tissue Compression Eliminator, Nyssa and the Doctor took Bob into the TARDIS causing the Master's conceptual bomb to explode. This timeline was eventually erased when the Doctors' other selves were able to render the conceptual bomb useless. (AUDIO: The Light at the End)\n\nNyssa was pleasant, friendly (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Keeper of Traken [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from The Keeper of Traken (Johnny Byrne), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1982).) and selfless. Tegan once remarked that she was \"too good for this world\", (AUDIO: Aquitaine), the Fifth Doctor described her as \"terribly nice\", (AUDIO: Alien Heart) and the Eighth Doctor considered her to have more good than anyone else he had known. (AUDIO: A Heart on Both Sides) She always found the good in people; even during the Time War, she provided medical care to both sides of the conflict. (AUDIO: A Heart on Both Sides) Her gentle and trusting nature meant that she was not adept at detecting deception, (TV: Mawdryn Undead [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).) but she was skilled at negotiating an effective balance between strong personalities. (TV: Earthshock [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982)., AUDIO: The Game) Tegan noted that Nyssa preferred to \"care and share.\" (PROSE: Goth Opera [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).)\n\nDespite her gentleness, Nyssa was willing to use and threaten violence where necessary, destroying on separate occasions a Terileptil android (TV: The Visitation [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) and a CyberNeomorph (TV: Earthshock [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).) in addition to threatening to shoot Time Lord guards. (TV: Arc of Infinity [+]Johnny Byrne, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).) She was driven to rage after the death of Cathy Roberts's son in the Peterloo Massacre (AUDIO: The Peterloo Massacre) and initially wanted to kill the Tremas Master for the murder of her father, although she managed to forgive him. (AUDIO: The King of the Dead) She also argued on occasion with the Doctor, such as when he broke her trust on Valderon. (AUDIO: Prisoners of Fate)\n\nShe considered Tegan to be her best friend (AUDIO: The Emerald Tiger) and Tegan held her in the same esteem. (AUDIO: The Waters of Amsterdam) However, she also \"never quite understood\" why so many of the Doctor's friends were human. (AUDIO: The Boy That Time Forgot)\n\nNyssa generally did not use a surname, referring to herself only as Nyssa. (TV: Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982)., Four to Doomsday [+]Terence Dudley, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982)., etc.) The Doctor introduced her to the Time Lords as \"Nyssa of Traken\", (TV: Arc of Infinity [+]Johnny Byrne, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).) a name that she often used herself. (AUDIO: Spare Parts, etc.) Whilst posing as a human actress, she used the name \"Nyssa Traken\". (AUDIO: Special Features)\n\nNyssa was a slender (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Keeper of Traken [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from The Keeper of Traken (Johnny Byrne), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1982).) and beautiful (AUDIO: Creatures of Beauty) girl with brown curls, a pale face, serious, round eyes (PROSE: Logopolis [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, adapted from Logopolis (Christopher H. Bidmead), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1982).) and fine features. (PROSE: Kinda [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from Kinda (Christopher Bailey), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1984).) She had an unearthly quality of remoteness and aristocracy (PROSE: Castrovalva [+]Christopher H. Bidmead, adapted from Castrovalva (Christopher H. Bidmead), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1983).) but she had a hardness in her face that bespoke experience. (PROSE: The Parliament of Rats)\n\nDuring her earliest travels in the TARDIS, she wore a flowing, gauzy dress (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Keeper of Traken [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from The Keeper of Traken (Johnny Byrne), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1982).) but later started to wear a plum purple velvet trouser-suit with elaborately puffed sleeves. (TV: Four to Doomsday [+]Terence Dudley, Doctor Who season 19 (BBC1, 1982).-Arc of Infinity [+]Johnny Byrne, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).) She eventually stopped wearing Traken clothes, wearing a white blouse with turquoise blue stripes on the front and sleeves, a rainbow skirt, burgundy shorts, and ruby shoes on Manussa (TV: Snakedance [+]Christopher Bailey, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).) and a steel blue mini-dress over an ivory underdress until her departure on Terminus. (TV: Terminus [+]Steve Gallagher, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983).) Following Adric's death, she took to wearing a bracelet of Trakenite gold. (PROSE: Goth Opera [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).)\n\nTegan believed that Nyssa looked very good for her age when she was about seventy, something that Nyssa credited her Traken heritage for. (AUDIO: Cobwebs [+]Jonathan Morris, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) In India, she was rejuvenated and looked as she did during her first stint in the TARDIS. (AUDIO: The Emerald Tiger)",
