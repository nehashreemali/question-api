  "content": "She was an American college student who accidentally joined the Fifth Doctor during his visit to Lanzarote in 1984. She then elected to remain with him for the rest of her vacation time. She remained with the Doctor after his regeneration into his sixth incarnation. She found it harder to get along with him because of his recklessness, seeing him as arrogant and mad. However, as time went on, the Sixth Doctor's personality mellowed and Peri's friendship with him improved, especially after he returned to comfort her after the death of her mother.\n\nPeri was separated from the Doctor by the Time Lords so that they could cover up the Ravolox conspiracy, with a Matrix record indicating that she had been brainwashed into becoming the Mentor leader Lord Kiv, before being killed. According to the Tremas Master, this record had been faked, and Peri had survived and had fallen in love with King Yrcanos, whom she married, subsequently making her Queen of Krontep. But that was just part of the truth. As it turned out, there were several future versions of Peri's life due to interventions of various Time Lord factions. At least two versions of Peri eventually rejoined the Sixth Doctor on his travels after Yrcanos died, one of whom choose to return to Krontep once a year to pay tribute to her late husband and check on the progress of the people she had once ruled.\n\nPeri had limited contact with other companions, although she did encounter a few. She spent a significant amount of time alongside the uncrowned Egyptian Pharaoh Erimem, developing a deep sister-like bond. As well as this she had a series of adventures with Frobisher. She was also acquainted with Jamie McCrimmon, meeting him and the Second Doctor during an encounter with two Androgums and two leading members of the Ninth Sontaran Battle Group. She also briefly met Vislor Turlough who left the Doctor's company just prior to her joining, as well as Kamelion before his destruction. She also met Ace, accompanied by the Seventh Doctor, at the Factory, and became friends with Melanie Bush at LudoSphere Incorporated.\n\nPerpugilliam Brown was born in 1966 as the only child of archaeologists (PROSE: Blue Box [+]Kate Orman, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003).) Paul and Janine Brown, who had married on 21 November 1962. She had an aunt named Mona who lived on a trailer park. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) \"Perpugilliam\" was an old family name (PROSE: Players [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) which Peri claimed meant \"she who lives in the hills\" (AUDIO: The Bride of Peladon [+]Barnaby Edwards, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2008).) or \"by a handful\" (PROSE: A Handful of Stardust [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and which she often found people had difficulty pronouncing. (PROSE: Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, adapted from Revelation of the Daleks (Eric Saward), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2019).)\n\nAccording to most accounts, Peri was raised in Baltimore, (PROSE: House [+]Jeremy Daw, Short Trips: Steel Skies (Short Trips, 2003)., The Ruins of Heaven [+]Marc Platt, Short Trips: Steel Skies (Short Trips, Big Finish Productions, 2003).; AUDIO: Nekromanteia [+]Austen Atkinson, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003)., The Macros [+]Ingrid Pitt and Tony Rudlin, adapted from The Macro Men, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) specifically Fell's Point (AUDIO: The Reaping [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).; PROSE: When It Was Fun [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013).; TV: Vengeance on Varos [+]Phil Ford, Tales of the TARDIS (BBC iPlayer, 2023).) where she lived at 256 East Lombard Street. (PROSE: When It Was Fun [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013).) According to other accounts, she came from New York City, (PROSE: The Twin Dilemma [+]Eric Saward, adapted from The Twin Dilemma (Anthony Steven), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1986)., Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, adapted from Revelation of the Daleks (Eric Saward), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2019).; AUDIO: The Authentic Experience [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Pasadena (PROSE: Synthespians™ [+]Craig Hinton, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004)., Something Borrowed [+]Richelle Mead, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).) or New England, (PROSE: The Mark of the Rani [+]Pip and Jane Baker, adapted from The Mark of the Rani (Pip & Jane Baker), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1986).; AUDIO: ...ish [+]Phil Pascoe, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) specifically Boston. (PROSE: The More Things Change [+]Andy Lane, Doctor Who Yearbooks (1993).)\n\nPeri was raised as a Baptist (AUDIO: The Council of Nicaea [+]Caroline Symcox, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) and made to attend church every week, (PROSE: The Ruins of Heaven [+]Marc Platt, Short Trips: Steel Skies (Short Trips, Big Finish Productions, 2003).) but she would later consider herself not to be religious. (AUDIO: The Council of Nicaea [+]Caroline Symcox, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) She travelled the world with her parents due to their careers (PROSE: Blue Box [+]Kate Orman, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003).) and went to Manhattan every Thanksgiving. (AUDIO: Paradise 5 [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She enjoyed a comfortable life thanks to her parents' wealth, but she was only truly happy amongst nature and was fascinated with botany. (PROSE: Synthespians™ [+]Craig Hinton, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) She was best friends with Kathy Chambers, whose brother Nate she fancied. (AUDIO: The Reaping [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nJanine once took Peri to the Boston Botanical Centre when she was eleven (PROSE: Superior Beings [+]Nick Walters, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) and she once visited Kew Gardens and Wembley Stadium where she saw AC/DC and the Who, (PROSE: The Church of Football [+]Benjamin Adams, Short Trips: The Centenarian (Short Trips short stories, 2006).) although she would later tell the Sixth Doctor that she had never visited London. (TV: Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) She also visited Bath Abbey, (PROSE: Superior Beings [+]Nick Walters, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).) Las Vegas (PROSE: Something Borrowed [+]Richelle Mead, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).), San Francisco (AUDIO: Prime Winner) and France, where she walked in the gardens of a chateau. (AUDIO: Breaking Bubbles [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAs a girl, Peri read the comic book Swamp Thing (PROSE: Players [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and read about the Philadelphia Experiment. (AUDIO: The Macros [+]Ingrid Pitt and Tony Rudlin, adapted from The Macro Men, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) Her father took her out hunting and they had a dog called Whiskey. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She had the opportunity to take horse-riding lessons, but chose not to (AUDIO: The Church and the Crown [+]Cavan Scott and Mark Wright, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).) and later remarked that she never had time. (AUDIO: Leviathan [+]Paul Finch, The Lost Stories (Big Finish Productions, 2010).) Whilst living in Baltimore, she would sometimes go to the graveyard and read inscriptions upon the tombstones. (AUDIO: Emissary of the Daleks [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nPaul taught Peri how to use a gun, although she did not like handling them (PROSE: Attack of the Cybermen [+]Eric Saward, adapted from Attack of the Cybermen (Paula Moore), Publication Order (Target Books, 1989).) and was not confident in her ability to use them. (TV: Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) When she was thirteen, her father died in a boating accident. (PROSE: Synthespians™ [+]Craig Hinton, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) Janine married Professor Howard Foster, another archaeologist, who already had two children. (PROSE: Shell Shock [+]Simon A. Forward, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).) Peri believed that Janine married Howard too soon after Paul's death. (AUDIO: The Reaping [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) According to some accounts, Howard sexually abused Peri and made her keep it a secret from Janine. (PROSE: Synthespians™ [+]Craig Hinton, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004)., Shell Shock [+]Simon A. Forward, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).)\n\nIn high school, Peri was a straight A student (AUDIO: Trouble in Paradise [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and popular amongst her peers whilst Kathy was her \"geeky friend\". (AUDIO: The Reaping [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) She studied Christopher Columbus, whose actions she was disgusted by, in great detail (AUDIO: Trouble in Paradise [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and learnt British history, covering Henry VIII. (AUDIO: Recorded Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She was top of her class in botany and dreamed about discovering a new plant species or having a flower named after her. (AUDIO: Paradise 5 [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn addition to Kathy, Peri was friends with Eunice, Paula, (AUDIO: The Reaping [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) and Candy Tyler, whom she once pushed into the path of a boy to prevent him from asking her to prom. (AUDIO: The Veiled Leopard [+]Iain McLaughlin and Claire Bartlett, Big Finish DWM originals (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) Candy never forgave her. (AUDIO: The Reaping [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) Peri and some of her friends once drove across the plains of Arizona. She would later remember how clearly she was able to see the stars that night, a view which was not surpassed until her travels with the Sixth Doctor. (AUDIO: The Shadows of Serenity [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nPeri's first boyfriend was George Stewart, whom she nicknamed \"Curious George\" and who crashed the car on their way to their first date because he was distracted by her legs. When she was sixteen, she was dumped by \"a real creep\" and was upset until her grandmother called her and told her to pull herself together. She started dating Davey Silverman, who never left her alone for the first three months of their relationship and was nervous when she once used the subway, something that she interpreted as him being overprotective. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nPeri and Nate both disliked their names, which they thought were stupid, and agreed that they would one day get them changed. Peri knew that Nate was attracted to her, something that Kathy was also aware of and found weird on account of her and Peri being best friends. (AUDIO: The Reaping [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) In her gap year, she read À la recherche du temps perdu and believed that Marcel Proust could have benefitted from a better editor. She also read Black Orchid (AUDIO: Year of the Pig [+]Matthew Sweet, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) and did a fair amount of serving drinks in cafés. (AUDIO: Paradise 5 [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nPeri began studying Botany (TV: The Mysterious Planet [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) at college (TV: Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) in 1983 (AUDIO: The Mind's Eye [+]Colin Brake, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2007)., Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) whilst maintaining an interest in archaeology thanks to her parents and Howard. (PROSE: Blue Box [+]Kate Orman, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003).) Accounts differed on whether she attended Boston University, (PROSE: Burning Heart [+]Dave Stone, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) Berkeley (PROSE: Synthespians™ [+]Craig Hinton, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2004).) or California State.\n\nPeri considered breaking up with Davey rather than have a long-distance relationship whilst she was at college and he punched a door when he realised this was the case. She ultimately decided to stay with him, (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) although she did date Chuck for a time and found that he was unable to give simple answers to any question, always speaking in \"jargonese\". (PROSE: Attack of the Cybermen [+]Eric Saward, adapted from Attack of the Cybermen (Paula Moore), Publication Order (Target Books, 1989).) She would later remark that she had to deal with a number of \"dumb jocks\" in college. (PROSE: Superior Beings [+]Nick Walters, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nOn campus, Peri was a sports star, enjoying playing tennis, hockey and lacrosse. (PROSE: The Two Doctors [+]Robert Holmes, adapted from The Two Doctors (Robert Holmes), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1985).) Whenever she passed the Zoology laboratory on campus, she was glad that she chose to study Botany instead as she did not know what was going on with the animals inside. (AUDIO: Year of the Pig [+]Matthew Sweet, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) She shared a residence with other girls, (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) was friends with Sara (PROSE: Burning Heart [+]Dave Stone, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) and knew a girl with an eating disorder who was referred to a counsellor. (AUDIO: Year of the Pig [+]Matthew Sweet, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nPeri had a young cousin named Pete who had just started learning how to walk (AUDIO: The Song of Megaptera [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) by the time she went on holiday to Lanzarote in 1984. (TV: Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) She carried a photograph of Pete around with her and fondly remembered how he laughed when he burped and burped when he laughed. (AUDIO: The Song of Megaptera [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn Lanzarote on 9 May 1984, Peri met two Englishmen (AUDIO: The Reaping [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) and decided to go with them to Morocco before returning to college in the autumn, cashing in her return ticket to New York. However, Howard stopped her from making it to the airport on time by stranding her on a boat. Peri later escaped the boat by stripping down to her Bikini and attempting to swim for shore.\n\nPeri was saved by Vislor Turlough from drowning and was taken by him into the TARDIS where she met the Fifth Doctor and Kamelion, who assumed Howard's form and, later, the Tremas Masters. Kamelion seized control of the TARDIS and took Peri to Sarn where she met the real Master. Following his defeat and Turlough's return to Trion with his brother, Peri joined the Doctor on his travels with the intention of returning to finish her degree. (TV: Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).)\n\nWhen the Doctor received a summons and materialised the TARDIS in 12th century England, he decided that it was not the right place for Peri's adventures in time and space begin and told her to wait inside whilst he answered the call. (PROSE: Five Card Draw [+]Todd Green, Short Trips: Zodiac (Short Trips, 2002).)\n\nOn N'Tia, Peri began to regret joining the Doctor but decided that she had made the right choice upon seeing the planet's beauty. (PROSE: Light at the End of the Tunnel [+]Mark Wright, Short Trips: Steel Skies (Short Trips, Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nTo recover from her experiences with the N'Tians, the Doctor took her shopping in London where they watched Les Misérables. (PROSE: Black and White [+]John Binns, Short Trips: Farewells (Short Trips short stories, 2006).)\n\nThe Doctor took Peri to Astroville Seven in the 31st century to help her acclimatise to being amongst various species of aliens and, wanting to choose clothes for herself rather than be limited to what was in the TARDIS wardrobe, she went shopping. They became caught up in a quest for the legendary treasure of Rovan Cartovall. (PROSE: The Ultimate Treasure [+]Christopher Bulis, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).)\n\nOn Earth, she watched Len Skeggs die after stealing the Eye of Gaar. (PROSE: Hot Ice [+]Christopher Bulis, More Short Trips (Short Trips short stories, 1999).)\n\nOn Mars in the 2000s, Peri and the Doctor encountered the Ice Warriors and met the crew of the Argosy. When the Argosy crash-landed, Peri went with Paul and Tanya Webster to Izdaal's tomb. (AUDIO: Red Dawn [+]Justin Richards, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2000).)\n\nA week into her adventures, she once again met the Master, this time in 1880s California. (PROSE: A Town Called Eternity [+]Lance Parkin and Mark Clapham, Short Trips and Side Steps (Short Trips short stories, BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nA week later, the Doctor took her to watch a football game and she encountered Edward Grainger (PROSE: The Church of Football [+]Benjamin Adams, Short Trips: The Centenarian (Short Trips short stories, 2006).) before going to 2099 Prague. (PROSE: Leap Second [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nShe later met the Valethske and narrowly avoided becoming a meal. Despite understanding how she felt, the Doctor disapproved of the visceral hatred she developed for Veek's people. (PROSE: Superior Beings [+]Nick Walters, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2001).)\n\nAfter travelling alone with the Doctor, they met Erimem, a princess of ancient Egypt, who joined them in the TARDIS. (AUDIO: The Eye of the Scorpion [+]Iain McLaughlin, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2001).)\n\nThe Doctor intended to drop Erimem off on the Braxiatel Collection so that she could have an education. Instead, they arrived in 17th century Paris. There, Peri was kidnapped by the Duke of Buckingham, who believed that she was Queen Anne (a look-alike of Peri). After this adventure, the Doctor invited Erimem to join them travelling in the TARDIS. (AUDIO: The Church and the Crown [+]Cavan Scott and Mark Wright, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).)\n\nBy this time, Peri had found one of Leela's skins in the TARDIS wardrobe and considered wearing it on one occasion. (AUDIO: No Place Like Home [+]Iain McLaughlin, Big Finish DWM originals (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nPeri grew exceptionally close to Erimem and hoped her feelings for Erimem were like those she had for a sister. (PROSE: Blood and Hope [+]Iain McLaughlin, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2004).) She helped teach Erimem to read English.\n\nThe three battled Jarra To in the Axis, (AUDIO: The Axis of Insanity [+]Simon Furman, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) defeated the Great Old Ones in the Himalayas (AUDIO: The Roof of the World [+]Adrian Rigelsford, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) and prevented the Khellians from preying on a vulnerable Earth colony. (AUDIO: Three's a Crowd [+]Colin Brake, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).)\n\nThe trio next visited Nicaea in 325 AD, where they found themselves in the middle of a religious conflict. (AUDIO: The Council of Nicaea [+]Caroline Symcox, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2005).)\n\nPeri and Erimem were stranded in 15th century Earth when the TARDIS separated them from the Doctor, having to work as serving wenches. They were eventually reunited with the Doctor after coming into conflict with William Shakespeare. (AUDIO: The Kingmaker [+]Nev Fountain, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nAs part of a scheme with his seventh incarnation, the Doctor left Peri and Erimem in Monte Carlo in 1966 to stop the theft of the Veiled Leopard at a party. They discovered the thief was Lillian Hawthorne and stopped her getting away, returning the jewel to its safe. (AUDIO: The Veiled Leopard [+]Iain McLaughlin and Claire Bartlett, Big Finish DWM originals (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nLater, Peri and Erimen corrected a change to the timeline caused by the Doctor's former companion Tegan Jovanka. The three women proceeded to go out and get drunk afterwards. (PROSE: Graham Dilley Saves the World [+]Iain McLaughlin and Claire Bartlett, Short Trips: Past Tense (Short Trips, 2004).)\n\nIn a hallucination induced by the plants of YT45, Kyropite, she believed that she had a boyfriend with a stepson, Kyle. She had to deal with Kyle's unruly behaviour. She was eventually found being ingested by the plants. Inside the dream her stepson caught Meningitis, this corresponded to her health deteriorating in the real world. As it got worse she imagined her partner cheating on her and then she was run over by a car. Takol wanted her to die for his experiment. She didn't recognise the Doctor when he went into her dream. As her dream became a bad drama, the Doctor asked her to choose. As she awoke the plant removed itself from her. Both Erimem and the Doctor took her back to the TARDIS to escape. (AUDIO: The Mind's Eye [+]Colin Brake, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor, Peri and Erimem visited Peladon after answering a distress call from the Ice Warrior prince and ambassador Zixlyr in the 41st century. King Pelleas proposed to Erimem, and she accepted, parting with Peri and the Doctor to stay to rule Peladon. The Doctor and Peri departed for the TARDIS, still in orbit around Peladon with the help of Alpha Centauri's ship. (AUDIO: The Bride of Peladon [+]Barnaby Edwards, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2008).)\n\nSoon after Erimem's departure, Peri and the Doctor went to the planet Grallista Social for a spot of relaxation but found themselves in the midst of a viral decontamination effort by the Viyrans. She was infected with a virus which turned anyone she came into contact with. The Viyrans were getting her to remember each time this happened, first with the Doctor, then with Chris and finally Lawrence as a way to remove her memories as part of the cure. Her memory wouldn't be erased as easily so the Viyran wanted to kill her. She realised that her memory was returning as her memory was trying to work out what had happened and why it was happening. (AUDIO: Mission of the Viyrans [+]Nicholas Briggs, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2007).)\n\nPeri and the Doctor went to the village of Sair during the Middle Ages, where a young man named Tablibik used a form of magic to make her fall in love with him. The Doctor swiftly broke his spell. (PROSE: Fascination [+]David J. Howe, Decalog (Virgin Decalogs, 1994).)\n\nAfter Peri was badly injured, the Doctor took her to Karn where she was kidnapped by Morbius. However, she was able to trick him into putting her into an escape pod and escaped to Sylvana where she became a guerrilla leader against his regime. She eventually rejoined the Doctor after he became the general of an army of Draconians, Sontarans, Cybermen and Ice Warriors against Morbius. (PROSE: Warmonger [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2002).)\n\nPeri was intentionally separated from the Doctor on an unnamed world. During this separation, the Doctor travelled briefly with a tracer named Amy whom he helped find the Key to Time. Peri was reunited with the Doctor after his second attempt at finding the Key to Time concluded. (AUDIO: The Judgement of Isskar [+]Simon Guerrier, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2009)., The Chaos Pool [+]Peter Anghelides, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2009).)\n\nThe two met an Essex priest who was hiding alien bodies in his church crypt in 1953. (PROSE: The Canvey Angels [+]David Bailey, Short Trips: Companions (Short Trips, Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nPeri was, for a time, separated from the Doctor on a World War I battlefield in 1914. (PROSE: Never Seen Cairo [+]Darren Sellars, Short Trips: A Christmas Treasury (Short Trips short stories, 2004).)\n\nThe two met Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart before encountering the Arix. (PROSE: A Life in the Day [+]Xanna Eve Chown, Short Trips: A Day in the Life (Short Trips short stories, 2005).)\n\nPeri helped the Doctor save a group of human colonists beset by the carnivorous Farakosh. (AUDIO: Exotron [+]Paul Sutton, Main Range (Big Finish, 2007).)\n\nPeri pretended to be a waitress in an alien restaurant to figure out why three different gourmets wanted to kill the Doctor. (AUDIO: Urban Myths [+]Paul Sutton, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2007).)\n\nPeri helped the Doctor stop the Valtor from invading Beadledom 3. (AUDIO: Rulebook [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nArriving in Los Angeles in 2009 to stop Zarl from selling Earth's water to his fellow Piscons, Peri met a future version of herself who, unbeknownst to her, only remembered her first adventure with the Doctor. She was disgusted by her future self when she apparently killed Zarl and Carburetor and greatly upset upon learning that her future self had lied about having children, which she wanted more than anything. She decided that she would stay with Davey Silverman when her travels came to an end and wondered about how her relationship with the Doctor, who decided to take her to Androzani Minor, would change given what he had seen her future self do. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhilst exploring Androzani Minor, Peri and the Doctor contracted spectrox toxaemia and became caught in the conflict over spectrox between Androzani Major government forces and Sharaz Jek's insurgency. They were arrested by government forces and sentenced to execution, but they were abducted by Jek, who was attracted to Peri. They escaped with the aid of fellow prisoner Salateen, however the Doctor became separated from them. Salateen took her back to the soldiers, however she was abducted by Jek again. She began to die from the disease and the Doctor gave her the single dose of bat's milk he was able to acquire before regenerating into a new incarnation, to her astonishment. (TV: The Caves of Androzani [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).)\n\nPeri was disturbed by the Sixth Doctor's behaviour following his regeneration and terrified after he attempted to strangle her, leading him to decide to repent for his actions as a hermit on Titan III before they found the wounded Hugo Lang and learnt of the kidnapping of Romulus and Remus Sylvest. Joined by Hugo, they followed Azmael and the Sylvests to Jaconda where they were captured by Mestor, whom the Doctor and Azmael killed. Peri tried to get the Doctor to stay to help the Jacondans and admonished him for being rude to Hugo when they parted, but he asked her to get to wait before condemning his new persona. (TV: The Twin Dilemma [+]Anthony Steven, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).)\n\nPeri wanted to return home, but decided to acquiesce to the Doctor's request and get to know him. (PROSE: The Twin Dilemma [+]Eric Saward, adapted from The Twin Dilemma (Anthony Steven), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1986).) He called Peri by the names of various former companions of his, as well as Zodin, in the days following Jaconda (TV: Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) and, according to one account, they spent a week frozen inside of a glacier on Vespod Eight. Otherwise, Peri spent her time studying in case she returned to college and demanded that she and the Doctor discuss terms for her remaining on the TARDIS. (PROSE: Attack of the Cybermen [+]Eric Saward, adapted from Attack of the Cybermen (Paula Moore), Publication Order (Target Books, 1989).)\n\nAfter picking up Gustave Lytton's distress call in 1985, Peri and the Doctor descended into London's sewers and encountered Cybermen who infiltrated the TARDIS and forced the Doctor to take them, Lytton and Charles Griffiths to Telos. There, Peri was saved from a deranged Cyberman by Rost and Varne, from whom she learnt of the Cybermen's plan to destroy Earth and who wanted her to destroy the TARDIS to prevent this, and was eventually reunited with the Doctor. She told the Doctor that Lytton was working with the Cryons, but they were too late to save him and they left Telos before Cyber-Control was destroyed. (TV: Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).)\n\nThe Doctor kept making attempts to repair the TARDIS's chameleon circuit, causing it to switch between various shapes before returning to the form of a police box. It was then that Peri demanded that he stop. (COMIC: Quick Change [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He had a number of accidents in the TARDIS, including burning dinner despite promising a cold supper, (TV: Vengeance on Varos [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) and Peri thought more and more about returning to college.

Forward, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).)\n\nRunning in the new Zeiton-7 landed the Doctor and Peri in Dorsill where Peri saw Edward Baddesley dig up Bill Neville's corpse, which he demonstrated when confronted by the Doctor was to inspect it as there had not been a post-mortem. The corpse came to life before they could return it to its grave and the Doctor and Edward went after it whilst Peri waited in the pub because of a cold, learning from Janet Spillsbury that Christopher Sheldon had been working on a DNA computer.

He ignored Peri's reading of the coordinates, so they instead arrived in 1929 and caused a potential temporal disaster by putting money in the timeshare meter when Godfrey and Camilla Richardson had already done so. After a Time Lord explained the Doctor's note to him, he went back to remove the body and he and Peri used up two weeks' time in the course of a week to resolve the temporal issues.

Peri saved the Doctor after he was captured by the Master and the Rani and collected herbs with Luke Ward to make a sleeping draught to sedate the Luddites, a task which led them to Redfern Dell where Luke was turned into a tree by one of the Rani's land mines. The sleeping draught was ultimately unnecessary thanks to the Doctor picking the Rani's phial from her pocket before she and the Master fled Earth.

Following the defeat of Swan and the Savant, Peri and the Doctor said goodbye to Charles Peters, who wrote the story of what happened as Blue Box with Peri's surname changed to Smith.

Peri and the Doctor met a Warlord with a sexual interest in Peri who had been supplied with CD phasers from Thoros-Beta. He told Peri and the Doctor where the weapons came from with his dying breath and they went to investigate, the Doctor being concerned with the interference with the Thordonians' civilisation. Peri, however, was less concerned given that the Thordonians would be killing each other with less-advanced weapons anyway. (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).)\n\nUpon arriving on Thoros-Beta in 2379,[source needed] Peri and the Doctor were attacked by the Raak and captured by Kiv's men, but they managed to escape with Yrcanos after Crozier attempted to interrogate him to learn what provoked the Raak. According to a Matrix record (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) tampered with by the Valeyard, (TV: The Ultimate Foe [+]Robert Holmes and Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) the Doctor began behaving oddly and seemingly betrayed his friends to Sil, again giving Peri away when she joined Matrona Kani's retinue to speak with him discreetly.\n\nPeri, Yrcanos and Dorf went on to stir up rebellion amongst the Thoros-Alphans until they were stunned by Frax and imprisoned. Peri confessed to Yrcanos, who decided that she would be his queen, that she had been feeling a longing to belong somewhere with people that she loved ever since arriving on the planet. As Peri explained the concept of love to Yrcanos, she seemed to develop feelings for him. (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).)\n\nPeri was at first relieved when she was taken to the laboratory, as she believed that she had avoided execution, but then became more nervous due to the detailed medical tests conducted on her person. (PROSE: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, adapted from Mindwarp (Philip Martin), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1989).) She mistakenly believed the purpose of her examination by Crozier and Matrona Kani, which included antigen tests, meant she had been selected for an arranged marriage. Peri was initially pleased when the medical examination found her to be a fit and healthy subject, but she was alarmed when she was then strapped to an operating table and gagged, as she had been chosen by Crozier to become the new host body for Kiv. In preparation for this, Crozier ordered Matrona to shave Peri's head, as he had decided to attempt direct transference of Kiv's brainwaves into Peri's brain. (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) After having all her hair cut off and her skull shaved, the terrified Peri was glad that she at least could not see herself with her completely bald head.

The Doctor was taken out of time by the Time Lords, preventing him from saving Peri (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) who would otherwise be able to corroborate his claims about Ravolox. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nCrozier was able to transfer the contents of Kiv's memories and personality directly into Peri's brain, erasing her original mind in the process. This meant that although Peri was still physically alive, the person she once was mentally no longer existed and she had effectively been brainwashed into becoming Kiv. Ostensibly to prevent Crozier's discovery from making Kiv immortal and affecting evolution across the universe, the High Council trapped Yrcanos in a time bubble and used him as an unwitting assassin to kill Kiv by destroying Peri's body with a CD phaser soon after the successful transfer. (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).)\n\nDespite her death, a number of varied fates for Peri existed thanks to the temporal manipulations of various competing factions of Time Lords who each devised different ways to save her life and let her live out her life. According to a Time Lord who visited the Sixth Doctor and a version of Peri living in Los Angeles in 2009, at least five versions of Peri were removed from the timeline prior to the death of the original. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nA faction within the High Council deemed Peri's death excessive and unnecessary and pulled her out of the timestream before her death, allowing Yrcanos to rescue her. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) According to one account, she made Yrcanos wait with her on Thoros-Beta for a month as she believed that the Doctor would be coming back to collect her, something she continued to believe when she agreed to leave for Krontep. (PROSE: Bad Therapy [+]Matthew Jones, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) She and Yrcanos were married (TV: The Ultimate Foe [+]Robert Holmes and Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) in the Hall of Blood and Skulls on the Day of Six Deaths (PROSE: The Dark Scrolls of the Valeyard [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and it was on the day of their wedding that she accepted that the Doctor would not be coming for her. (PROSE: Bad Therapy [+]Matthew Jones, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) Accounts differed on whether Peri was in love with Yrcanos (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.; WC: The Eternal Mystery [+]Pete McTighe, The Eternal Mystery - The Collection Season 22 Announcement Trailer (Doctor Who: The Collection mini-episodes, YouTube, 2022).) or if the relationship was entirely one-sided. (PROSE: Bad Therapy [+]Matthew Jones, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).)\n\nAccording to one account, Peri was reunited with a small and old Doctor, possibly the Seventh, twenty years after they parted ways on Thoros-Beta. She was bitterly unhappy with him for having abandoned her and refused to reconcile with him, claiming that she had had better things to think about than him whilst on Krontep. He left, accepting her decision. (PROSE: Reunion [+]David Carroll, Brief Encounter (1992).)\n\nAccording to another account, Peri chose not to have any children with Yrcanos, who waited patiently for her to change her mind. As well as being the nominal queen, becoming known as Queen Gilliam, she was governor in her own right of seven planets and director of several health and education enterprises on Krontep and almost never had time off from her official duties as a result. She was suffocated by the regimented life of a queen and her twenty-five unhappy years of marriage and ran away to the Palace of the First Queen of Kr'on Tep where she continued her research into Petruska. Although she promised Yrcanos that she would return when he came after her, she used Petruska's time tunnel and was reunited with the Doctor in his seventh incarnation, whom she greeted with a slap, in London in 1958. She helped him defeat Moriah, after which she forgave the Doctor for leaving her and had him take her to the late 20th century where she went to travel Europe. (PROSE: Bad Therapy [+]Matthew Jones, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).)\n\nA further account stated that since marrying Yrcanos and becoming Queen of Krontep, Peri brought peace and prosperity to her new homeworld, and was considered mightier than her husband, ruling with both steel and compassion. After ruling for many years as the Warrior Queen, Peri left Krontep following her husband's death as she did not believe that her subjects needed a figurehead anymore, with her disappearance being dubbed the Eternal Mystery. (WC: The Eternal Mystery [+]Pete McTighe, The Eternal Mystery - The Collection Season 22 Announcement Trailer (Doctor Who: The Collection mini-episodes, YouTube, 2022).)\n\nPeri began travelling the universe, and eventually returned to Earth. In that time, her name as the Warrior Queen had become legendary across the universe, and songs were made in her honour. She later found herself on the remembered TARDIS, where she was reunited with an older version of the Sixth Doctor. Peri thought back to her experience on Varos, and agreed to rejoin the Doctor in his travels, on the condition that he take her back to Krontep once a year to pay her respects to Yrcanos and check on her former people. (TV: Vengeance on Varos [+]Phil Ford, Tales of the TARDIS (BBC iPlayer, 2023).) On one such occasion, Peri was discovered by Rex, whose history with his father was similar to her own with her stepfather, and she invited him aboard the TARDIS. (WC: The Eternal Mystery [+]Pete McTighe, The Eternal Mystery - The Collection Season 22 Announcement Trailer (Doctor Who: The Collection mini-episodes, YouTube, 2022).)\n\nAccording to another account, a Time Lord claimed that Peri and Yrcanos had three children: two boys and a girl. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) According to one account, their daughter Yrcanthia gave them three grandchildren: Actis, Artios and Euthys. Peri and her family were regularly visited by the Sixth Doctor and Frobisher. Following Yrcanos's death, Yrcanthia assumed the throne, but civil war raged between Actios and Euthys, and Peri left the capital in disgust at her grandsons' actions. The war led to Yrcanthia's death and her sons being exiled to the desert. Peri's other grandchild, Actis, became unofficially queen under a regency until she married.  Peri then assumed the alias of 'Ranith' and subtly assisted the Doctor, Frobisher and Actis in exposing Farlig's warmongering whilst under the control of a Nahrung. Although she never disclosed her identity, the Doctor correctly deduced that 'Ranith' was Peri, and he called out to her from afar as he prepared to leave the planet. (COMIC: The Age of Chaos [+]Colin Baker, Doctor Who - Graphic Novels (Marvel Comics, 1994).)\n\nAccording to a further account, Peri trained herself as a warrior after marrying Yrcanos, increasing her physical strength and fighting skills, and she even took to carrying a Krontep sword known as a kintar around with her. Becoming known as 'Queen Perpugilliam of Krontep', she came to regard Krontep as her new homeworld and even proudly referred to herself as 'Queen Yrcanos'. She led many armies in battle, such as fending off invading Daleks, but preferred to lead soldiers who follow her out of choice. She also became mother to three children.\n\nAt some point, she was time-scooped by the Tremas Master and forced to participate in deadly reality TV shows run by LudoSphere Incorporated. After some months of fighting for her survival in a show called Monster Dungeon, she was reunited with the Sixth Doctor and Melanie Bush, who had been similarly abducted. Upon meeting and rescuing the Doctor, Peri demonstrated her developed combat skills by single-handedly defeating a squad of Cybermen. Her more violent methods and enthusiasm to do battle took the Doctor by surprise, and he initially found it hard to believe that Peri had become a \"bloodthirsty hooligan\". He later apologised to her for the abrupt way they had parted company on Thoros-Beta, and she in turn assured him that she knew he had tried to save her.\n\nAfter a series of battles with various old foes, such as Davros, the Imperial Daleks, the CyberNeomorph Cyber-Leader and Androgums, Peri helped the Doctor and Mel to defeat the Master and destroy the Ludosphere, after which they then departed in the TARDIS. (AUDIO: The Trials of a Time Lord)\n\nFeeling that forcing Peri to live out her days with Yrcanos was a fate worse than death, an incoming President arranged for another version of Peri to be removed from the timestream and given the same treatment as Jamie McCrimmon and Zoe Heriot: being returned home and having her memories of all but her first adventure with the Doctor wiped. Peri completed her studied at college, going on to earn a doctorate, and resumed her relationship with Davey Silverman, whom she married. Davey frequently beat her, kicking her on their honeymoon and pushing her down the stairs.\n\nDavey's beatings were so severe that Peri had to undergo reconstructive surgery because of damage to her nose and found that she was unable to bear children. She ran away to Los Angeles and became a relationship counsellor because she wanted to help people, but she eventually did it solely to make money and came to host Dr. Peri Brown: Worrier Queen, a popular television series which she produced with Carburetor, her best friend. After divorcing Davey, she had two further failed marriages.\n\nIn 2009, Peri was reunited with the Doctor on an adventure that saw her interact with her younger self — she pretended to be an alien expert working for the government in order to protect the Web of Time, not revealing her future to her past self. She unintentionally appalled her earlier self by seeming to kill Zarl, despite the fact that he was actually the Sixth Doctor in a monster costume, and was teleported away rather than killed. Ultimately, she learnt about her other selves, and the Doctor apologised profoundly for how his people had tampered with her life. Offered a chance to travel with the Doctor again, she declined and returned to her life in Los Angeles in 2009. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nExercising mercy, the High Council distorted the Matrix's timeflow and removed Peri and Yrcanos prior to the mind transfer operation, sending them back in time to live out their lives on Earth in the early 1990s. Peri was happy to be back in the United States, where she and Yrcanos settled in California, and believed that Yrcanos coped better with the perplexities of the 20th century than some natives.\n\nPeri became Yrcanos's manager when he decided to take up a career as an all-win wrestler and watched him from the crowd during his matches. Whilst doing so, she wondered what had happened to the Sixth Doctor as her memories of Thoros-Beta had become vague, but she was ultimately happy being in her original time and place. (PROSE: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, adapted from Mindwarp (Philip Martin), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1989).)\n\nAnother version of Queen Peri, visited by the Sixth Doctor on Krontep, was revealed to have become a pawn of Mandrake, the Doctor's childhood imaginary enemy that became a mind parasite, transferred to Crozier's computer when the Doctor was connected to the machine, and then to Peri's body instead of Kiv. Oblivious of the fact, Yrcanos died seven days after the wedding, having been poisoned by Mandrake.\n\nWhen the Doctor came to attend Peri's wedding, Mandrake had him thrown into the cells, where he remained for five years as Mandrake used Peri's body to prepare for a coup of the various kingdoms. However, since Peri was sterile due to her spectrox poisoning, none of the other rulers would marry \"Peri\" as she would be unable to continue the royal line. After five years, Mandrake poisoned Peri's own body, wanting to force the Doctor to transfer his mind to the body of princess Dirani of Hurn in exchange for a cure.\n\nEventually, after swapping bodies with Peri in order to force the mind parasite into submission with his greater strength of will, the Doctor managed to restore her real consciousness and save her life with an antidote he had prepared during his imprisonment. Following this, Peri rejoined the Doctor on his travels. (AUDIO: The Widow's Assassin [+]Nev Fountain, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2014).)\n\nOne of their first trips together in the TARDIS again was to Scotland during the 22nd century Dalek invasion. She wanted to stop the stoning of Ross Nicolson. The Doctor told her not to get involved in what was happening and accidentally got chosen to work in the Daleks' refinery. On board, Peri met Moira Brody who told her more of the situation. Whilst escaping the complex she met up with the Doctor as he broke in.\n\nPeri and the Doctor joined Moira on her way north to the Orkneys. Walking by foot, she was infected by a Varga plant. She started to be influenced by the Varga and wanted to kill her friends. After being captured by the Daleks, Moira started testing her blood and Peri was cured in a Dalek facility. She then helped Moira and Curbishly to stop the Roboman Elite as Moira used the same technique she used on Peri to remember her past. (AUDIO: Masters of Earth [+]Mark Wright and Cavan Scott, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor and Peri visited the College of Advanced Galactic Education so that the Doctor could get an honorary degree. She helped Lizzo when they encountered her after she was experimented on. After attending one of Professor Baxton's lectures, she followed her to the medical facility and she realised that Baxton was in fact the Rani in her new incarnation. Peri was subjected to another body-switching experience when an elderly Countess was transferred into her body, but listening to an audio diary Peri had made earlier forced the Countess to realise that what she and others were doing was wrong. Peri later gained an honorary degree in Botany. (AUDIO: The Rani Elite [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen a signal was interfering with the TARDIS, Peri noticed that the TARDIS rotor was cracking. She used her botanical knowledge using the local plant life to deduce that they had landed in an African Jungle. They found the camp that Amanda Latimer's expedition was using, and Peri used her status of the Queen of Krontep to negotiate for their release. She was taken by the B'lemyae with Siyanda. Peri realised that the B'lemyae's creation story meant that they had come from the space. She tried to rescue Kaylin but she was almost dragged over a cliff. (AUDIO: The Headless Ones)\n\nShe went with the Doctor to Rusina to help in negotiate on behalf of Sandis-Fernis. She was arrested for not having a computer chip implanted into him. She didn't like the concept of social media. The Doctor and Peri both had a chip forcibly implanted in them and were released into the custody of Christie. She initially declined to be part of an advertising campaign, but when their sub count did permitted her or the Doctor to see the governor she accepted it to get the subs. She was distressed at how Crompton manipulated the Doctor's message. She used her contact at Christie's to help Sandis-Fernis by creating a mini-advertising campaign. (AUDIO: Like)\n\nAiming for Metebelis IV, the Doctor and Peri landed on Earth encountering Myrna Kendal who said she knew them both, which delighted her as her mother watched all her films. She stopped the Doctor from wearing his own attire. She consoled Carolyn Sue May after she was chastised by Myrna. She was flung into the future be the time distortion. She realised that Myrna and Carolyn were forked versions of each other. (AUDIO: The Vanity Trap)\n\nThe Doctor and Peri went to Freudian Institute to undertake some therapy and were both assigned a Sigmund Freud to care for them. She told them about their exploration and dismissed that they were attracted to danger, after detailing their defeat of the Complex. She also retold how the Doctor wouldn't let her leave the TARDIS, then requested to be returned to Baltimore during the 1990s. When he suggested keeping her in a deep freeze to stop her from dying, she thought something was mentally wrong with the Doctor, and that's why they came to the institute. She was attacked by the Rorschach. She was sent to The Complex, Her story to her analyst was a fiction based on multiple previous adventures. (AUDIO: Conflict Theory)\n\nAnother account suggested that after having her mind rewritten into becoming a copy of Kiv's, (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) Peri survived being assassinated, although Crozier himself died. Peri continued to be possessed by the personality of Kiv until a new host body was selected, due to her brain somehow growing bigger as Kiv's old one had. It was implied that Peri's brain, which still housed Kiv's mind, was surgically transplanted into a succession of new bodies by Crozier's daughter, Cordelia, (PROSE: Sil and the Devil Seeds of Arodor [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) eventually ending up in the body of a human lawyer called Adam Carter. (HOMEVID: Sil and the Devil Seeds of Arodor [+]Philip Martin, Reeltime Pictures releases (Reeltime Pictures, 2019).)\n\nThe other permutations of Peri and the reasons for their creation were not specified by the Time Lord. (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile travelling with the Sixth Doctor, Peri encountered the Fielding brothers in an adventure involving an exiled Draconian prince. (AUDIO: The Avenues of Possibility [+]Jonathan Morris, The Legacy of Time (Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nAt some point, Peri was taken to the Black Archive by UNIT to have her record as a companion of the Doctor taken, her memories of the visit were subsequently erased and she was sent on her way. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nIn March 2005, Peri wrote on the website Doctor Who? asking if anybody had information on the Doctor as she was interested in getting back in touch. (PROSE: Have You Seen This Man? [+]various authors, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nIn a parallel universe, the Valeyard accidentally killed the Fourth Doctor by time-ramming him, the Fifth Doctor was erased from existence, and thus Peri's first meeting with the Doctor was altered or dissolved. (AUDIO: He Jests at Scars... [+]Gary Russell, Doctor Who Unbound (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nIn an alternate timeline created when Rassilon joined forces with the Cybermen, the Fifth Doctor and Peri landed on Skaro, the home planet of the Daleks, only to find it conquered by the Cybermen. (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).) Realising that the Cybermen had grown powerful to wipe out the Daleks, the Doctor led Peri away, (COMIC: Prologue: The Fifth Doctor [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Supremacy of the Cybermen prologues (Titan Comics, 2016).) only for this timeline to be undone when a remorseful Rassilon joined forces with the Twelfth Doctor. (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nThe Doctor and Peri were almost forced to land at the Big Bang due to mysterious coordinates being sent to the TARDIS which the Doctor tried to investigate. Escaping the explosion, the Doctor and Peri arrived at a Vess warehouse, and learnt the full magnitude of the situation with the Seventh Doctor and Ace. The Seventh Doctor was melancholy when he saw her again, telling his younger self that he had never gotten used to time travel leading to his being reunited with old friends. However, Peri got along well with Ace. She was surprised that Ace referred to the Seventh Doctor as \"Professor\" but was amused when she referred to the Sixth Doctor as \"Joseph,\" a reference to the musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. The Sixth Doctor and Peri went to investigate the higher levels where they found a delegation of Time Lords, however Peri vanished due to the Doctor’s travels being undone by the Master’s conceptual bomb. These events were erased when the detonation of the conceptual bomb was prevented by the Doctors and the First Doctor disabled the emergency system that had drawn some the Doctors to the Vess pocket dimension. (AUDIO: The Light at the End [+]Nicholas Briggs, Big Finish Doctor Who Special Releases (Big Finish Productions, 2013).)\n\nPeri enjoyed playing tennis, hockey and lacrosse. (PROSE: The Two Doctors [+]Robert Holmes, adapted from The Two Doctors (Robert Holmes), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1985).) Peri was often exasperated with the Doctor's sixth incarnation (TV: Vengeance on Varos [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).), but still cared for him and relied on his judgement. (TV: Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985)., The Two Doctors [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985)., Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985)., etc.) Over time, the two of them became more amicable with each other, (TV: The Mysterious Planet [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) especially after the death of Peri's mother. (AUDIO: The Reaping [+]Joseph Lidster, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nAlthough she typically relied on the Doctor, she showed that she was intelligent, such as when she figured the poison must own a cure, (TV: The Caves of Androzani [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) and when tricked a Paradise 5 computer into giving her food and drink. (AUDIO: Paradise 5 [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She showed such courage when standing up to enemies. (TV: Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984)., Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985)., Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) She also showed compassion for many, even on opponents such as Lytton. (TV: Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) She mourned the death of Kamelion even though he was an android, (TV: Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) proved a capable one as a big sister figure to Erimem. (AUDIO: The Veiled Leopard [+]Iain McLaughlin and Claire Bartlett, Big Finish DWM originals (Big Finish Productions, 2006).), and also felt remorse after killing a mutant victim of Davros. (TV: Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).)\n\nPeri began to develop fond and romantic feelings for the warrior king Yrcanos, whom she subsequently fell in love with. (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) Following her rescue on Thoros Beta, Peri married Yrcanos in a least one timeline, (TV: The Ultimate Foe [+]Robert Holmes and Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) and later bore his children. (COMIC: The Age of Chaos [+]Colin Baker, Doctor Who - Graphic Novels (Marvel Comics, 1994)., AUDIO: The Trials of a Time Lord) Since becoming Queen of Krontep, Peri proved to be a capable leader and was remembered by her people as leading with iron and compassion, and was regarded as being mightier than her husband. (WC: The Eternal Mystery [+]Pete McTighe, The Eternal Mystery - The Collection Season 22 Announcement Trailer (Doctor Who: The Collection mini-episodes, YouTube, 2022).) She also trained herself to be a warrior like Yrcanos, increasing her physical strength and fighting abilities, and she developed more violent personality traits, much like her husband's, such as an enthusiasm for battle. When commanding her armies, Peri preferred to command those who follow her out of choice, and objected to having enslaved soldiers, even nanobots. This objection to slavery was described by the Doctor to be one of Peri's strengths as a leader, as it shows she retains her sense of right and wrong. (AUDIO: The Trials of a Time Lord) After Yrcanos' death, Peri would regularly visit a temple dedicated to Yrcanos, once a year, to pay fond tribute to her late husband, as well as check on the progress of her former subjects. (WC: The Eternal Mystery [+]Pete McTighe, The Eternal Mystery - The Collection Season 22 Announcement Trailer (Doctor Who: The Collection mini-episodes, YouTube, 2022).)\n\nIn one timeline, (AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Peri's entire mind was altered into becoming a copy of Lord Kiv's. This made her personality more ruthless, lustful and dictatorial, although Crozier made sure she retained some of her original personality's spirit and strength, and she also seemed to retain her disgust for the physical form of the Mentors. (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).)\n\nPeri had dark, shiny hair which she usually wore short and straight (PROSE: The Mark of the Rani [+]Pip and Jane Baker, adapted from The Mark of the Rani (Pip & Jane Baker), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1986).) but later wore long and curled. (TV: The Mysterious Planet [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986)., Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) During her time on Krontep, she wore her hair short again, (AUDIO: The Widow's Assassin [+]Nev Fountain, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2014).) presumably due to having to regrow it after being shaved bald by Matrona Kani, (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) but she later grew her hair back into its long and curled style. (AUDIO: Bad Terms) In her later years, she styled her hair long and straight. (TV: Vengeance on Varos [+]Phil Ford, Tales of the TARDIS (BBC iPlayer, 2023)., WC: The Eternal Mystery [+]Pete McTighe, The Eternal Mystery - The Collection Season 22 Announcement Trailer (Doctor Who: The Collection mini-episodes, YouTube, 2022).) She had a trim young figure (PROSE: The Mark of the Rani [+]Pip and Jane Baker, adapted from The Mark of the Rani (Pip & Jane Baker), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1986).) and was considered beautiful. (TV: The Caves of Androzani [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984)., Timelash [+]Glen McCoy, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).)\n\nShe often wore shorts with a low-cut top whilst travelling with the Doctor, (TV: Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984)., Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985)., The Two Doctors [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985)., etc.) but donned a royal yellow gown in 19th century Killingworth. (TV: The Mark of the Rani [+]Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) In her later adventures, she wore more conservative clothes. On Karfel and Necros, she wore a brown trouser suit; (TV: Timelash [+]Glen McCoy, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985)., Revelation of the Daleks [+]Eric Saward, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985).) on Ravolox, she wore a flaxen and black blazer, a gold-coloured silk blouse and silver-grey slacks; (TV: The Mysterious Planet [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986)., PROSE: The Mysterious Planet [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from The Mysterious Planet (Robert Holmes), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1988).) and on Thoros Beta, she was attired in pale blue culottes, a sleeveless pink wrap blouse and a short loose-fitting kimono with a pink, white and blue pattern. (TV: Mindwarp [+]Philip Martin, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).)\n\nAfter becoming Yrcanos' wife and Warrior Queen of Krontep, Peri started wearing armour and carried a Krontep sword known as a kintar around with her. (AUDIO: The Trials of a Time Lord) Following her husband's death, an older Peri took to wearing a black ensemble, (TV: Vengeance on Varos [+]Phil Ford, Tales of the TARDIS (BBC iPlayer, 2023).) which later included a cloak with a hood. (WC: The Eternal Mystery [+]Pete McTighe, The Eternal Mystery - The Collection Season 22 Announcement Trailer (Doctor Who: The Collection mini-episodes, YouTube, 2022).)\n\nWhen asked about the name \"Perpugilliam\" in a 1986 interview, Nicola Bryant said:\n\nThe 1995 Cornerstone trading card misspelt her name as \"Perpugillium\". The same typo was made in Dalek Combat Training Manual [+]Richard Atkinson and Mike Tucker, BBC Books (2021). in 2021.\n\nPerpugilliam is an old family name (PROSE: Players [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) and a family tradition. (PROSE: A Town Called Eternity [+]Lance Parkin and Mark Clapham, Short Trips and Side Steps (Short Trips short stories, BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nIn the audio story The Bride of Peladon [+]Barnaby Edwards, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2008)., Peri claims her name means \"she who lives in the hills\".\n\nIn the short story A Handful of Stardust [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., Thomas Digges says that Perpugilliam is Latin for \"by a handful\". Digges ends A Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes with the inscription \"Per Pugilliam Pulvis Sidereus\", which Peri translates as \"by a handful of stardust\".\n\nUsing her actual English accent, Nicola Bryant played \"Miss Brown\" (who was never actually referred to by name on-screen), an obvious analogue to Peri, in three BBV Productions videos in the Stranger series: Summoned by Shadows, More Than a Messiah and In Memory Alone. Later videos in the series would make clear that the Stranger series did not take place in the Doctor Who universe and that Peri and Miss Brown had no connection with each other. Bryant also played Elenya \"Ellie\" Brown, the girlfriend of Colin Baker's character, TV weather forecaster Arnold \"Arnie\" Davis, in another BBV production, the non-Doctor Who The Airzone Solution.\n\nCounting audio and televised adventures together, Peri effectively shares the longest-serving companion title — both in terms of number of stories and recorded time — with Ace. As they are tied, the title essentially alternates as new stories are released. Her nearest rivals are Jamie McCrimmon, Charley Pollard and Nyssa. Nyssa's appearances are considerably more frequent than Jamie's so she represents the only potential threat to Peri and Ace's record-breaking number of appearances.\n\nWhile she clearly eclipses the amount of time Sarah Jane Smith has been seen or heard as a companion, Peri is easily outpaced by the character of Sarah, due to Sarah's latter-day appearances as a solo character.\n\nPeri was also incredibly prolific within the Sixth Doctor's era on television. Terror of the Vervoids [+]Pip & Jane Baker, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986). is the only television story of that era in which she does not appear, though within that story, she is still mentioned.\n\nWhile Peri is supposed to be an American, her English accent often slips and her American accent wanders between different regional accents. She sometimes uses phrases and pronunciations that Americans would not use, such as \"lift\" instead of the American \"elevator\".\n\nIndeed, the Attack of the Cybermen [+]Paula Moore, Doctor Who season 22 (BBC1, 1985). DVD commentary maintained that it was mandated that Peri only use British slang to avoid confusing the audience. This may have worked for the British audience but, as Peter Davison pointed on on the DVD commentary for Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984)., it had the opposite effect on American viewers. They could spot Bryant's fake American accent — or, really, any British actor's attempt at American — with ease. This was one of the principal reasons that Davison fought hard against adding an American companion to the show. This idiosyncrasy of language did not end with the TV series, as it can be heard in several audio dramas also.\n\nAccording to Nicola Bryant on the DVD commentary for Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984)., there was an active effort to cover up the fact that she was not, in fact, American. She recounted there how John Nathan-Turner insisted she use her American accent when making public appearances or appearances that could have been monitored by the press. At least during the recording of her earliest serials, like Planet of Fire, she was even required to use the American accent when she broke character between takes.\n\nIt's unclear how long this obfuscation lasted, but evidence for the subterfuge can be heard on a clip from Breakfast Time broadcast the day the first episode of The Twin Dilemma aired. During the interview, the interviewer asserted that as a \"little girl in America\" Bryant used to watch Doctor Who and dream of being a companion. Bryant, who used only a very mild English accent during the interview, failed to correct the interviewer or to even look as though the interviewer had made an error. Near the end of the 1984 production block — which is to say after the recording of Season 22, but probably slightly before its airing — Bryant gave a radio interview in which she used her natural British accent. (AUDIO: Doctor Who at the BBC Volume 3)\n\nThe idea of Howard Foster sexually abusing Peri is one never considered by the production team on Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984). and does not have resonance in audio and print literature beyond the novel Shell Shock [+]Simon A. Forward, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).. Nicola Bryant says that the idea, as envisioned by Fiona Cumming, Dallas Adams and her was to suggest that she and her stepfather had an appropriate but friendly relationship. Indeed, according to Bryant, Peri much preferred the company of Howard to that of her mother. (DCOM: Planet of Fire [+]Peter Grimwade, Doctor Who season 21 (BBC1, 1984).) However, the character of Peri (or at least one aspect of Peri) was still destined for an abusive relationship as revealed in AUDIO: Peri and the Piscon Paradox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW..",
