  "content": "Abandoned as a baby by her mother, Ruby was soon fostered, and then adopted, by Carla Sunday and raised alongside other children that she fostered, developing a protective personality and changing the lives of Carla and her adopted grandmother, Cherry, for the better. Upon her nineteenth birthday, she and the Doctor defeated the Goblin King and his Goblins, preventing them from continuing to abduct the babies of the world. She then joined the Doctor in his travels. Following the defeat of Sutekh and finally finding her birth mother, Ruby returned to a normal life on Earth with her family.\n\nRuby was believed to be born around 2PM on 24 December 2004. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Her parents were Louise Miller and William Benjamin Garnet who were both fifteen when Louise got pregnant. Within the next few hours, her mother travelled to the church on Ruby Road, abandoning her outside in the snow, presumably to protect Ruby due to Louise's abusive stepfather. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) The Fifteenth Doctor then arrived in his TARDIS, having travelled back from 2023 to negate a cracked timeline where the Goblins stole Ruby before she could be found and ate her. The Doctor was successful in saving her, and left Ruby to be found by the vicar, restoring the original timeline. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) She was named \"Ruby\" after the road the church was located on, a name that was chosen by Louise before she left, although Ruby believed that it was either the social workers or the paramedics who had named her. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nRuby was raised in Manchester and fostered by Carla Sunday, who often took in other children to simultaneously foster, but Ruby would be the only one she adopted. Ruby did her A levels, but her results were negatively affected by moving from Manchester to London, into the flat belonging to Cherry Sunday because of her declining health and refusal to move to Manchester. Ruby considered the move to have been \"tricky\" and \"expensive\". (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Ruby and her family lived through the pandemic, the recession and the Giggle together. (PROSE: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, adapted from The Church on Ruby Road (Russell T Davies), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2024).)\n\nOn 1 December 2023, Ruby, having wanted to find the truth about her parentage, ended up on a television series presented by Davina McCall which attempted to reunite \"foundlings\" like Ruby with their families. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Before going on the show, Carla told Ruby to not let anyone tell her story for her. (PROSE: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, adapted from The Church on Ruby Road (Russell T Davies), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2024).) While an interview for the show was being filmed, Davina told Ruby about how there was no guarantee her family could be found and Ruby told her about her adoptive family, (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) but found it was too personal to speak about how much she appreciated Carla. (PROSE: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, adapted from The Church on Ruby Road (Russell T Davies), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2024).) However, filming was cut short when a heavy studio light nearly fell on Ruby and an electrical plug ricocheted against the back of Davina's head, as the Goblins began to weave bad luck into Ruby's life, having sensed a \"chance of coincidence\".\n\nFollowing the interview, Ruby was befell by a long series of bad luck, such as Bobby McGeever asking her out, causing Ruby to believe she was the centre of \"a whirlwind of bad luck\". On 22 December, while playing in her band, her musical keyboard stopped working, halting their performance. The next day, she nearly dropped her drink at a nightclub, only for the Fifteenth Doctor to arrive and catch it for her. She later left the club in a taxi, where her friends playfully called her a jinx.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, which was also her nineteenth birthday, Ruby learned Carla was fostering a new baby, Lulubelle. While Carla went out to buy items for her, Ruby received a phone call from Davina giving her the news that they had not been able to trace her birth family. The Goblins then arrived to steal Lulubelle from Ruby. Ruby chased them to the roof, grabbing the ladder that was suspended from their ship to follow them. As it drifted away from the house, the Doctor bounded over and leapt onto the ladder with her. He gave her one of his intelligent gloves to help her hold on to the ladder. However, the goblins captured and tied them up once aboard. While tied up, the Doctor informed her the goblins were time riders, \"bimbling\" on Ruby's timeline to create seemingly coincidences to then capture Lulubelle and feed her to the Goblin King. Working together, the pair escaped and freed Lulubelle, returning her to the house before Carla returned.\n\nHowever, the goblins then \"bimbled\" back to 2004 to steal Ruby as a baby instead, but the Doctor managed to save her and kill the Goblin King, causing the Goblins to fade away. The Doctor then returned to 2023 to ensure Ruby had returned, and then went back to his TARDIS. Realising he was a time traveller, Ruby left Carla and entered the Doctor's TARDIS. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nRuby's first trip in the TARDIS saw the Doctor take her 150 million years into Earth's past to see dinosaurs in Wyoming. Initially concerned about the Butterfly effect, she was relieved when the Doctor undid the impact and activated the butterfly compensation switch. When the Doctor asked for a set of numbers, they traveled to 21506, discovering a space station run by babies. While the Doctor investigated, she learned from Jocelyn Sancerre that the babies had been abandoned due to a funding cut but couldn't be shut off due to legalities. This disturbed her as it mirrored her own time. When she tried to learn more about the Bogeyman, she was horrified to find that her story inspired a baby named Eric to confront the monster. She stopped Jocelyn from evacuating the Bogeyman by removing the Doctor's sonic screwdriver from the controls. (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nArriving atop the Jason Orange Plaza in Mancopolis 2424, the Doctor and Ruby dodged being run over by a tram, only to be arrested by the Care Force for being \"tram raiders\". A weather orb, noticing they weren't smiling, began raining on them. After stopping the orb, the mayor of the city, Mary Mulberry, communicated to them via the windows of a tower which also functioned as screens, believing them to be auditors sent by the Galactic Central Exchange; she ordered Zhi, one of the Care Force, to bring them to her, and, on the journey to the Mancopolis City Hall, she explained to them how Mayor Mulberry saved the city and its population after the 2399 Event.\n\nEntering the Mayor's office, the Mayor vocalised her belief that they had been a deliberate distraction to enable the Exchange to sneak an assault ship into the city, which she promptly had destroyed. She offered a negotiation, but, after realising they weren't non-humans since they weren't going shift into another form, she threatened to dismember one of them. As they tried to escape through a lift, she had the duo teleported to a dark space filled with \"massive people-eating silkworms\". (COMIC: Mancopolis [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Magazines, 2024).)\n\nAround July 2024, Ruby asked the Doctor to take her to see The Beatles record their first album, as she was a fan due to her mother's influence. Disheartened by the bad music, she discovered that all music was poor. She helped the Doctor investigate by interviewing John Lennon while he spoke with Paul McCartney. The Doctor asked her to play one of her songs to inspire the world, one she had wrote for Trudy, but this attracted the attention of Maestro. Skeptical of their power, Ruby was convinced when shown a ruined 2024. Maestro kidnapped her to consume her music. Sensing the power of the Oldest One in her, Naestro let her go. Ruby then helped the Doctor in a musical battle, ending up trapped inside a cello. After Maestro was banished with the help of Lennon and McCartney, Ruby joined the Doctor in celebrating with the locals in a rendition of \"Twist at the End\". (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nOn her next adventure, the Doctor took her to Kastarion 3, her first time on an alien planet. However, the Doctor ran off from the TARDIS. Ruby chased after him, hearing him singing The Skye Boat Song while balanced on a landmine. She was tasked with finding something heavy to help him. On the new planet, she found an urn containing the remains of John Francis Vater. Listening to his AI hologram, they met his daughter, Splice Alison Vater. Ruby physically restrained her from approaching the Doctor. Mundy Flynn then arrived but this brought an Villengard Ambulance to them. Ruby sensed danger and grabbed Mundy's gun, firing indiscriminately. Mundy later asked her to shoot her on a low setting but was fatally shot by Canterbury James Olliphant. The ambulance stopped treating Ruby as she wasn't ordained, but Olliphant tried to override the system. The AI of Vater eventually forced the ambulance to treat her by stopping the war.  (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nBack in 2024, the Doctor took Ruby to see the South Wales coast and was thrilled to be in Wales. Ruby remarked she had been to Wales three times before. The Doctor began to warn Ruby about Roger ap Gwilliam but stopped, realizing Ruby was not yet living through 2046. Ruby then saw a woman in the distance and heard her whisper \"don't step\". Looking down, Ruby warned the Doctor to not step in the fairy circle. The Doctor remarked that he would have broke it. Ruby went to read the messages attached, but the Doctor warned her not to. They carried on, the Doctor asking Ruby about the third time she went to Wales. She told the Doctor the third time was now, although it seemed as though she had a hint of recollection about her ordeal in an alternate lifetime where the Doctor had broken the fairy circle which released \"Mad Jack\" and caused him to disappear, leaving Ruby on her own. (TV: 73 Yards [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nRuby and the Doctor traveled to Finetime in the distant future, where they realised the residents were being eaten alive by Mantraps designed by the system's AI to kill them all in alphabetical order. Ruby managed to make contact with a few of the residents by posing as a system's administrator and convinced them to listen to the Doctor. Doing so, the pair helped many of the residents escape like notably Lindy Pepper-Bean and Ricky September. However, upon Lindy and some of the others escaping, they refused the Doctor's offer to take them to a safer planet in his TARDIS because of his skin colour. Despite Ruby and the Doctor's pleas, the group sailed off into the wilderness without them; and the two time travellers solemnly departed, aware that it was likely that the stubborn colonists would not survive. (TV: Dot and Bubble [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nAdventuring to 1813 amidst the Regency era, the Doctor and Ruby joined a ball at a manor in Bath, England and took part in the dance. Ruby was overjoyed as it resembled one of her favourite television shows, Bridgerton. Ruby befriended Emily Beckett while at the party, comforting her about the shame she felt in an affair with Lord Barton. However, the pair soon realised that Chuldur were present at the party killing the guests. Ruby met back up with the Doctor and his new friend Rogue, learning they had also learned of the alien's presence. She then watched the Doctor and Rogue lure the Chuldur away and comforted Emily. However, Emily revealed she was actually a Chuldur in disguise and tried to kill Ruby, but she fought her off using her psychic earrings. Ruby then posed as her during the Chuldur's mock wedding, which led the Doctor to trap her in a triform. Rogue then took her place, banishing himself and the Chuldur to a random dimension, devastating the Doctor. Ruby comforted the Doctor about his loss before leaving in the TARDIS. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nRunning into more forms of the same woman across their adventures, the Doctor and Ruby went to UNIT headquarters in 2024 to seek help from Kate Lethbridge Stewart and her team. They learned they were all connected to Susan Triad, whom Ruby guessed may be connected to the Doctor's actual granddaughter. Later, UNIT's scientific advisor Morris Gibbons revealed their technology could be used on the VHS cassette that Ruby had containing blurred footage of her mother the night she left her on Ruby Road. She returned home to get it, bringing Carla with her. The Doctor took her to UNIT's time window to recreate the memory so they could see. However, her mother \"shadowed\" away before they could make out her face and a new threat appeared in the time window that caused the window's projection to explode. Ruby was later back in the command room when an entity began to manifest from the TARDIS. On the Doctor's instruction, she ran back to the time window, which triggered itself automatically and sent her back to the night of her abandonment, putting her face to face with her mother once more. (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nAs Sutekh brought death to all of time and space, the Doctor and Melanie Bush, one of the Doctor's previous companions, joined Ruby in the time window where the Doctor had Ruby use her connection to it and her memories of the TARDIS to bring the Memory TARDIS to life. Sutekh joined them via the real TARDIS, also seeking answers about Ruby's mother, but the Doctor and his companions managed to escape in the remembered TARDIS. As death spread across all of time and space, the Doctor and Ruby worked to solve the mystery of her mother's identity and how it tied into Sutekh. The time window directed the two to 2046 where Prime Minister Roger ap Gwilliam had mandated DNA testing and created a DNA database of all UK citizens. The Doctor and Ruby ran her DNA through the database, but Sutekh possessed Mel and demanded Ruby's mother's name. Having already realised that the god had possessed their friend, the Doctor and Ruby lured Sutekh into a trap, attaching him to the TARDIS console by intelligent rope and dragging the god throughout time and space through using the time vortex, restoring all of the life that Sutekh had destroyed. The Doctor then cut the god lose, causing Sutekh to burn up against the wall of the time vortex. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nAfter returning to UNIT, Ruby's search in the DNA database finally identified her parents as Louise Miller and William Benjamin Garnet who were both fifteen when she was born. Kate Stewart surmised that Louise had most likely given Ruby up to protect her due to Louise's abusive stepfather. The records revealed that Louise had become a nurse. The cleaned up VHS tape also revealed that Louise had been pointing at the signpost for Ruby Road, meaning that Louise had named her daughter, something that Ruby had never known before.\n\nThe Doctor took Ruby to a cafe where, despite the Doctor's concerns and ignoring his advice, Ruby introduced herself to her mother and thanked Louise for leaving her somewhere safe. Mother and daughter were tearfully reunited, and Louise explained that she had always thought about finding Ruby, but was too afraid that Ruby would hate her for having abandoned her. Ruby introduced her birth mother to her adoptive family and Louise helped Ruby to find her father William, who had never known that Ruby existed. Excited about the possibilities before her, Ruby and the Doctor went their separate ways with the Doctor telling his friend that her adventures were only just beginning, and he promised to see Ruby again some day. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nLouise would remain a part of her daughter's life after they were finally reunited. Ruby's father would also be a part of her life, although that was a longer story than the one about her reuniting with Louise. At some point following her departure from the Doctor, Ruby officially joined UNIT (TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) and was biochipped as one of their employees. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nIn 2025, Ruby witnessed the shining of Joy Almondo as the Christmas star, something which happened as part of the Fifteenth Doctor's adventures, before taking a call from Louise. (TV: Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nStruggling to readjust to life without the Doctor, Ruby went on Conrad Clark's podcast after discovering that Conrad was looking for her, having witnessed Ruby and the Doctor fighting the Shreek. The two began dating, but Ruby displayed signs of PTSD and paranoia, worrying Kate Stewart. Conrad turned out to be using Ruby to discredit UNIT, breaking her heart. After Conrad broke into UNIT Tower, Kate released the Shreek on him and live streamed it until Conrad admitted that he was lying at which point Ruby subdued the creature with a high tech Taser. Heart-broken and devastated by recent events, Ruby decided to take time to herself to figure things out. After learning that Conrad had hurt his friend, the Doctor visited him in prison to berate Conrad for his treatment of Ruby. (TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nUsing the power of Desidirium, the God of Wishes, two incarnations of the Rani - one of whom was Ruby's old neighbor Mrs Flood - and Conrad Clark changed Earth into Conrad's World. Uniquely, Ruby retained memories of the correct world, allowing her to determine that something was wrong. In one iteration of 23 May 2025, Ruby teamed up with Shirley Bingham who had a similar sense of the world to try to stop the Rani, but they failed. (TV: Wish World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nAfter the Doctor restored UNIT to normal by exposing it to real time from the Time Hotel with the help of Anita Benn, all UNIT employees within a ten-mile radius were called to UNIT Tower, including Ruby, who was finally reunited with the Doctor. The Doctor had UNIT provide Ruby with the Indigo Device, a transmat, to teleport into the Bone Palace, confront Conrad and bring an end to the twisted version of reality. Attempting to talk her ex-boyfriend down, Ruby recognised that the reality constructed by Conrad was kind rather than violent which he admitted was because Conrad had taken the Doctor's words to heart. Ruby was able to get Desidirium and used the baby's powers to wish that Conrad had a happy life before wishing an end to Conrad's World as the Doctor forced Omega back to the Underverse.\n\nAs reality was restored to normal, the Doctor and Belinda's daughter Poppy vanished and only Ruby remembered her due to her unique ability to remember altered series of events, an ability that not even the Doctor could explain. Discovering that the world had been restored with some \"glitches,\" Ruby convinced the Doctor to alter reality to restore Poppy, although it came at the cost of the Doctor regenerating into the Sixteenth Doctor. Melanie Bush discovered that thanks to Ruby's wish, Conrad was living a happy life as a chief chef and bottle washer with no one, including Conrad himself, remembering the man that he had been before. Unable to return Desidirium to his own time, the Doctor gave the baby to Carla to adopt who renamed him Joe Sunday. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nAfter their first adventure together, the Fifteenth Doctor mentioned Ruby in his diary, as he recounted his early exploits. (PROSE: First Day of the Doctor [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (Penguin Group, 2023). Page 31.)\n\nIn a branch timeline from the main universe, Ruby Sunday became stranded after the vanishing of the Doctor, living out an entire lifetime before the timeline reset. (TV: 73 Yards [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nRuby existed in the Daft Dimension, appearing on the cover of an issue of Doctor Who Magazine with the Doctor. (COMIC: The Daft Dimension 600 [+]Lew Stringer, The Daft Dimension (Panini Comics, 2024).)\n\nRuby was a short, fair-skinned blonde with deep hazel eyes, profuse amounts of jewellery, and a noticeable slit on her right eyebrow. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., et al.) From a leather flight jacket (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) to a denim pinafore (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Joy to the World [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2024 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) to period-appropriate dresses in 1963 (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and 1812, (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) her outfits were as diverse as those of her corresponding Doctor.\n\nRuby had an uplifting, bubbly and energetic personality and held a desire for adventure. (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) She was also comfortable with her abandonment, embracing the term \"foundling\" upon Davina McCall's usage of it. However, she did seek out her biological mother and father, if only to understand the truth behind why they left her. However, when Davina's search for Ruby's family was in vain, Ruby expressed disappointment in having no other relatives. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, adapted from The Church on Ruby Road (Russell T Davies), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2024).) During the interview with McCall, Ruby thought to herself about how, without Carla, she would have been lost, and that she loved her adopted mother \"more than anything\", but found it was too personal to speak about to Davina on-camera. (PROSE: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, adapted from The Church on Ruby Road (Russell T Davies), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2024).) Upon moving to London, Ruby felt stranded and that she was waiting for her life to begin. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) This contributed to her wanting to learn her birth mother's identity, with her thoughts on her abandonment as a baby weighing deeply on her. She was disheartened when the Doctor informed her he wouldn't take her back to the night her mother abandoned her. (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) Above all, she wanted to let her mother know that she was enjoying living life. (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) After finally learning her birth mother Louise Miller's identity and why she was abandoned, Ruby expressed understanding and forgiveness upon their first meeting. In turn, Louise admitted that her fear of Ruby being angry at her had kept Louise from seeking out her daughter. (TV: Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nRuby was pleasantly surprised to discover that 2424 Manchester still used trams, but was less pleased when a living cloud began raining on her and the Doctor, as that too was familiar to her. (COMIC: Mancopolis [+]Alan Barnes, DWM Comics (Panini Magazines, 2024).)\n\nRuby became so close with the Doctor, she even took up a weapon and risked her own life to ensure he was freed. (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) She was visibly disgusted that the citizens of Finetime refused the Doctor's help because he did not fit in with their society, and she was appalled by their bigoted and arrogant attitude. (TV: Dot and Bubble [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) She would even express this to men who belittled her, such as dismissing Lord Barton as a mere \"stiltson\" for his flowery comments about her appearance. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) She also had a compassionate side, feeling empathy and a desire to care for the lonely babies on Baby Station Beta (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and also sought to comfort Emily Beckett when she was upset. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) Ruby was protective of the children Carla Sunday fostered, acting as a supportive sibling figure. She instinctively sought to protect Lulubelle after the Goblins kidnapped her, even when faced with precarious and life-threatening obstacles. She also sassily confronted the Goblin who hissed at her. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nMusic was a core part of Ruby's personality. She enjoyed playing her keyboard and was in a band, expressing herself by writing and playing music for people. This ranged from public performances (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) to more thoughtful instrumentals, reflecting her deep thinking and expressive emotions she conveyed through her songs. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) She also loved Regency era music, expressing utter joy at being able to dance to it, especially in the Bridgerton esque setting. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) She used music to support people, whether with her friends overcoming heartbreak or to provide them a sense of joy. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) She also saw dancing as a way to help her get over romantic failures, (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) and partook in group numbers for the sheer joy of it. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nAfter retiring from her travels, Ruby displayed signs of PTSD and paranoia as she struggled to adjust to a normal life again which Kate Stewart expressed concern about. After Conrad Clark's betrayal, Ruby had to take time to herself to sort things out. (TV: Lucky Day [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).) Despite Conrad's betrayal, Ruby later displayed understanding and compassion towards her ex-boyfriend when confronting him and used Desidirium's power to wish a happy life for him. Melanie Bush believed that Ruby did a very kind thing with what she did for Conrad. (TV: The Reality War [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 15 (BBC One and Disney+, 2025).)\n\nRuby could play a GO:PIANO88 musical keyboard, and was the keyboardist in her band. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Her musical talent stretched to songwriting, Ruby able to compose a composition to help her friend Trudy get over her break up. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Despite some initial difficulty, she also proved able to improvise a song on the spot. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Ruby also had a good sense of rhythm, (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) able to sing and dance alongside Cilla Black (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and with various people at a ball in 1813. (TV: Rogue [+]Kate Herron and Briony Redman, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).)\n\nRuby also had a connection to snow, which the Doctor surmised came from her birth. (TV: The Church on Ruby Road [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) When Ruby was in danger, snow would appear in the area, even in environments where snow was typically unable to form. (TV: Boom [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) Aware that she had this ability, (TV: 73 Yards [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) Ruby could also instinctively summon the snow when frightened (TV: Space Babies [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) or when talking about the night she was left on Ruby Road. (TV: The Legend of Ruby Sunday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) According to Maestro, her ability to summon the snow came from a hidden song within her heart, and prevented the entity from absorbing her musical spirit. (TV: The Devil's Chord [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nDue to her alternate self's experiences in Ruby's World, Ruby possessed an instinctual sense of alterations to time as well as vague memories from Ruby's World that she couldn't explain. (TV: 73 Yards [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024)., Empire of Death [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 14 (BBC One and Disney+, 2024).) This allowed her to sense the truth about Conrad's World and remember Poppy as the Doctor's daughter when reality was restored when even the Doctor forgot. The Doctor himself was unable to explain this unique ability and Ruby chalked it up to a special skill.
