  "content": "Yasmin Khan, also known as Yaz, was a companion of the Thirteenth Doctor and a junior police officer with Hallamshire Police. She lived in Flat 34 of the Park Hill estate in Sheffield with her parents Hakim and Najia, and her sister Sonya. She was of Pakistani descent.\n\nAs part of Team TARDIS, Yaz often made use of her investigation skills to help the Doctor solve problems. She often questioned people for information and made note of items of interest, to help work out what was really going on.\n\nShe also had training which came in handy for reassuring and calming victims and survivors of traumatic events, in the aftermath. During adventures, she was best equipped to develop a relationship of trust with people who could help out, by gaining their confidence.\n\nFiercely loyal to the Doctor, with budding romantic feelings for her developing later in their travels, Yaz saw her outlook on life changed by her travels and found it difficult to adjust to life on Earth after the Doctor's imprisonment. As a result, she continued to travel in the TARDIS even after her friends Ryan Sinclair and Graham O'Brien chose to leave.\n\nTravelling alone with the Doctor, Yaz became fully immersed in the Doctor's world. No longer working for the Hallamshire Police, she found a new role by the Doctor's side, as co-pilot and co-conspirator.\n\nDan Lewis later joined the crew as the Flux threatened to destroy everything they knew. As the more experienced companion, Yaz helped Dan adjust to this new reality, offering explanations without condescension, and challenged the Doctor on keeping secrets from her friends.\n\nWhilst trapped in a storage unit building on New Years Eve, she revealed to Dan that she liked the Doctor. She also admitted that she hadn't told anyone about it, or even admitted to herself that she had those feelings. Dan said that her feelings for the Doctor were obvious from how she acted.\n\nFollowing the foiling of The Master's Dalek Plan to keep the Master from stealing the Doctor's identify, Yaz parted ways with the Doctor before her regeneration; joining the Companion support group founded by Graham.\n\nYasmin was born to Hakim and Najia Khan (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) in late 1998 or early 1999. (COMIC: A New Beginning [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2018-2019).; PROSE: The Secret in Vault 13 [+]David Solomons, BBC Children's Books (BBC Children's Books, 2018)., Dr. Thirteenth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She had an older sister[1] named Sonya, with whom she did not get along. (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nWhen she was little, Yaz begged her parents to get a pet rabbit but was not allowed one because Hakim was allergic to animal fur. Instead, she was given a cuddly toy named Mister Hoppy. (PROSE: The Secret in Vault 13 [+]David Solomons, BBC Children's Books (BBC Children's Books, 2018).)\n\nYasmin saw The Wizard of Oz as a child. She remembered being scared by a scene involving a tree which attacked Dorothy. She had really wanted a pair of ruby shoes, but her mother Najia made her get black lace-up ones for school instead. (PROSE: The Wonderful Doctor of Oz [+]Jacqueline Rayner, Puffin Classics crossovers (BBC Children's Books, 2021).)\n\nYaz once recalled how she loved panto when she was a child. (COMIC: It's Behind You! [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAs a child, Yasmin attended Redlands Primary school alongside Ryan Sinclair. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) She was known to be attending primary school by at least 2004. (PROSE: Time Lapse [+]Naomi Alderman, Thirteen Doctors, 13 Stories (Puffin eshort, Puffin Books, 2019).) Yasmin was placed in a class named after Rosa Parks. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Her best friend at primary school was Poppy Hillman. When they both started attending secondary school almost ten years before Yaz met the Doctor, their friendship ended after Taylor Grant called Yaz an \"Islamist terrorist\". (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).) When Yaz was twelve years old, she was best friends with another girl named Aisha and went on a school camping trip with her. (PROSE: The Secret in Vault 13 [+]David Solomons, BBC Children's Books (BBC Children's Books, 2018).)\n\nIn Year 7, fellow classmate Izzy Flint began badmouthing Yaz after she had knocked her off of the maths leaderboard. Around the same time, Yaz and Ryan were briefly reunited on a school trip to the Natural History Museum, where they met the Second Doctor and helped him in defeating the insect-like Myriapods, an encounter that was erased from their memories. (PROSE: The Myriapod Mutiny [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn Year 10, she sneaked into Danny Biswas' house through the window. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Yasmin studied criminology, and one of her lecturers on the subject once said that \"unique was where answers lived\". (PROSE: The Shadow Passes [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIzzy Flint would continue to bully Yaz, which left her feeling afraid for a whole year. (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) When things got particularly difficult, to the extent that it affected her grades at school, Yaz ran away from home feeling that her parents did not understand her problems. Convinced that she was \"going to do something stupid\", Sonya reported her missing. Yaz was found on the moors by PC Anita Patel, who convinced her to face her problems by offering her a compromise: \"Moments change. Look me up in three years. If I'm wrong, I'll give you 50 quid. But if I'm right, you owe me 50p\". (TV: Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nAround 2017, inspired by Anita Patel, Yasmin joined Hallamshire Police as a junior officer. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) Her police officer training included learning about measures to help children feel safe in stressful circumstances. (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She also learned \"basic forensic science\" in her \"first police courses\", (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).) and had weapons training that included how to use a gun. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nYasmin encountered the effects of racism in the 21st century. She often had racial slurs like \"paki\" directed at her during her work as a police officer, and she was labelled a terrorist due to her Muslim faith. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She was sometimes stationed at the city centre on a Friday night, (WC: Case File Two [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and dealt with many domestic violence cases. (PROSE: Gatecrashers [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) As part of her job as a police officer, Yaz had given evidence to court for minor cases such as a few traffic offences and urinating in public, which she described as \"open and shut cases\". (PROSE: The Witchfinders [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThough she hoped for more high-stakes assignments, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) Yaz was dedicated to her responsibilities as a police officer, which she took seriously. As she did not pursue a social life outside of work, Yaz's family considered her to be \"married to her job\". (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nAs a trainee on second-year probation, Yaz was often sent by her superior, Ramesh Sunder, to deal with small-time petty disputes. After vocalising her need for something more, she was sent to investigate an unidentified object in the Peaks outside Sheffield. There, Yaz found the caller was Ryan Sinclair, whom she recognised from school. Ryan insisted the call was not a prank and, though Yasmin didn't initially believe him, touching the cold object led to her doing so.\n\nAfter Ryan received a call from his grandmother, Grace, Yaz accompanied him to check on her, finding her train under attack from a mysterious creature. There, she encountered the Thirteenth Doctor. Yasmin, along with Ryan, Grace and the latter's husband Graham O'Brien, helped the Doctor investigate and stop the pod's occupant, a Stenza named Tzim-Sha, from abducting Karl Wright. After Grace died while disabling the coil, Yasmin attended her funeral.\n\nYasmin later helped the Doctor construct a teleporter to get her to her TARDIS. Though meant to stay whilst she left, Yasmin, Ryan and Graham were also teleported into deep space with her. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).)\n\nBelieving the pair to be bonuses in the Rally of the Twelve Galaxies, Epzo scooped Yasmin and the Doctor out of deep space and transported them aboard his ship - the Cerebos. Yaz awoke in a MediPod, stepping out to find the Doctor preparing to jettison the back of the ship, initiating a speed boost which caused them to crash onto the surface of Desolation.\n\nOn Desolation, she found Ryan and Graham, who had been similarly saved by Angstrom, Epzo's rival in what would become the final stage of the rally. The rivals, with the Doctor and her friends in tow, were tasked by Ilin, master of the rally, to race across the planet; the first to reach the finish line at the Ghost Monument would win 3.2 million krin and salvation from planet's hostile surface. The Doctor discovered that the Ghost Monument was, in fact, her TARDIS, phasing in and out of reality. After the Doctor stabilised the TARDIS, Yasmin entered it for the first time and the Doctor attempted to take them home. (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nAttempting to land the TARDIS back in 21st century Sheffield, the Doctor failed several times to bring Yasmin home. When the TARDIS latched onto nearby artron energy and they landed 1955 Montgomery, Alabama, Yaz was excited to begin her first adventure in the past and was astonished to meet Rosa Parks. In Slim's Bar and the Sahara Springs Motel, she recounted the famous historical event of Parks refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger, starting the Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nShe also endured many of the effects of racial segregation in the 1950s. She was misidentified as Mexican instead of a British woman of Pakistani descent and this caused her to be denied service at the bar and she had to discreetly enter the motel room through the back window. However, she was permitted to enter the buses in Montgomery through the front door and sit in the \"white-only\" section, unlike the black people who had to sit at the back of the bus. She remarked that she was unsure in her place in Montgomery due to the lack of citizens with Pakistani heritage.\n\nAttempting to stop Krasko's plans to alter history, Yasmin and the Doctor made sure Rosa Parks left work as a seamstress on time by giving her their clothes to mend. Yasmin chatted with Parks about her life, and the latter was surprised to hear that Yaz was permitted to be a police officer.\n\nBy making sure that the bus was crowded enough that Parks's moment of defiance could happen, the Doctor, Graham, and Yaz reluctantly became the three extra \"white\" passengers that required Parks to move back. The three, as well as Ryan, then witnessed Parks's historic arrest. Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor explained how Parks would be commemorated in the future, and Yasmin saw Asteroid 284996, also named Rosaparks, in space. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nYaz returned home to Sheffield in 2018 just half an hour after she had been transported into deep space. Noticing the Doctor's sadness at the prospect of travelling alone, she invited her to tea at her family's flat, along with Ryan and Graham. There, Hakim and Sonya teased Yaz who rarely brought friends home. However, her mother rang Yaz shortly after, asking her to pick her up and to not tell her father about it.\n\nClaiming she was taking a parcel to Najia, she left her father, sister, Ryan and the Doctor and drove to Jack Robertson's luxury hotel. She seemed impressed, but her mother confided that she had just lost her job as general manager. Robertson then appeared and had Kevin hold Yaz and Najia at gunpoint for trespassing, to which Yaz protested, asserting that they had no right and demanding to know why her mother had been sacked.\n\nYaz and Najia were shown a hotel room full of cobwebs, which no-one could explain. Left in the room, she was phoned by the Doctor, and the TARDIS team regrouped in the lobby, joined by Najia and Jade McIntyre. Her mother embarrassed Yaz when asking if she and the Doctor were in a relationship though was more irritated when asked the same of Ryan.\n\nAfter the giant spiders were contained, she offered to get her family their bread, promising her mother she would tell her the truth about the Doctor when she returned. She decided to stay travelling in the TARDIS with the Doctor, a decision also followed by Ryan and Graham. (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nTeam TARDIS found themselves on Seffilun 27 in the 67th century. When they unearthed a sonic mine that the Doctor could not disable, all four were rendered unconscious. They were recovered by the medical ship Tsuranga and Yaz woke up after several days. Bound to Resus One, the ship was attacked by a Pting that Yaz helped the Doctor defeat. (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nYaz and Team TARDIS travelled to the planet Gatan, arriving in the City of Radiant Stone in the midst of war. A lost young girl called Tondi took a shine to Yaz as she promised to help her find her mother while the Doctor, Graham, and Ryan investigated the area to see why it was destroyed. When two super-soldiers called Tumat and Kraytos appeared, Yaz ran with Tondi despite wanting to help the Doctor. Safely out of the fighting, Yaz and Tondi hid from a group of drunken revelers, celebrating the collapse of society, as they attempted to find Tondi's Aunt Vela instead. Yaz eventually had to use her powers of command presence to intimidate a crook into leaving an innocent old man alone and quickly found Vela, who revealed that Tondi's mother had died. With the Doctor eventually returning to Gatan, she reunited with Yaz as she helped lure Tumat and Kraytos into a teleport pad, forcing them to re-emerge in the same place as one combined being. With the new Chimera stopping the war, Yaz and Tondi visited The Freedom Thoughtcasting Network where the battle was being broadcast from and used Tondi's painful memories to shut down the operation before Yaz had to go on her way. (COMIC: The Warmonger [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn Proxima Ceti, Yasmin witnessed the Doctor outwitting carnivorous chessmen. (PROSE: The Secret in Vault 13 [+]David Solomons, BBC Children's Books (BBC Children's Books, 2018).)\n\nFor Yasmin's birthday, the Doctor brought her a Sontaran Frosted Boom Cake from Sontar, two zeppelins from the London Blitz and a candelabra from Paris. (PROSE: Dr. Thirteenth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and her team were tasked with preventing the Genesis Seed stored in the secret Vault 13 within the Galactic Seed Vault from falling into the hands of Nightshade. (PROSE: The Secret in Vault 13 [+]David Solomons, BBC Children's Books (BBC Children's Books, 2018).)\n\nYaz returned home to celebrate her grandmother Umbreen's birthday. Umbreen told Yaz she was her favourite granddaughter and gave her a watch with a shattered face that was precious to her. However, Umbreen did not elaborate on the sentimental value of the watch, nor the lifelong accomplishments she spoke of. This caused Yaz to grow curious and she asked the Doctor to take her to see Umbreen when she was younger.\n\nWith the watch being put into the telepathic circuits, the TARDIS took the Doctor, Yaz, Ryan and Graham to a rural area in the Punjab on 17 August 1947, though Yaz had been expecting to be taken to Lahore in the 1950s from what her grandmother had told her of her youth. There they met Prem, who offered to take Yaz and the rest of Team TARDIS to Umbreen's house.\n\nUpon arriving at Umbreen's house, Yaz claimed to be the sister of a third cousin of Umbreen's uncle Malik from fifteen valleys away. However, her confusion intensified when she learned that Umbreen was engaged to Prem, who looked nothing like her grandfather in the photos she had seen. Prem was also Hindu, whereas all of Yaz's family were Muslim. Realising she might not know her nani as well as she thought, Graham comforted her.\nYaz received henna art from her great-grandmother Hasna and spent the night before Umbreen's wedding with them and the Doctor. The following morning, she witnessed her grandmother marry Prem at the Pakistani border with India, tying their hands together as part of a Hindu wedding rite. Later, she witnessed how Prem gave Umbreen his watch, the face shattering when he dropped it as he passed it over.\n\nWhen the Doctor realised that Manish was a murderer, Umbreen fled to Lahore. While she was taking her possessions, Yaz found a map with Sheffield marked on it, with Umbreen explaining how she wished to travel to the \"exotic\" city.\n\nBack at the TARDIS, she and the Doctor spoke of Umbreen's life yet to come. She returned home to Umbreen in 2018 again. With henna still on her hands, Umbreen once again expressed distaste for her mother's designs. Yaz asked her if she was happy with her life and Yaz's grandfather; Umbreen said she was and expressed her love for Sheffield. Offering to tell Yaz the story of the watch, Yaz declined as she knew how much pain it had caused Umbreen. The two affirmed their love for each other once more. (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nTeam TARDIS arrived on Kandoka's moon in +135 following the Doctor receiving a disturbing message in her Kerb!am delivery. Assuming positions as employees in the warehouse, Yaz was assigned to work in storage, where she quickly struck up a good working relationship with her new colleague Daniel Cooper. Yaz found Dan's Arcadium necklace after his death, and when she asked a TeamMate for help, she was surrounded by delivery bots and ran away.\n\nWhen Yaz met with the rest of Team TARDIS at the Home Zone, she mentioned Dan's disappearance as one of the strange goings-on in Kerb!am. Subsequently, the Doctor, Ryan and Yaz left to confront Jarva Slade and Judy Maddox, and then discreetly investigated Slade's office and found his paper records, circumspect in the heavily-automated systems at Kerb!am.\n\nOnce the suspicious activity was attributed to the system, Ryan took Yaz and Charlie Duffy to save Kira Arlo from the TeamMates, riding the conveyor belts to reach the Foundation Levels of the warehouse. Yaz watched in horror as Kira was killed by exploding bubble wrap. She witnessed the resulting confrontation as Charlie was revealed as the saboteur that planted the deadly bubble wrap in packaging in protest of the low quotas on human labour in Kandokan law. In the TARDIS, Yaz requested taking Dan's necklace to his daughter and telling her how much her father loved her. (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nAlthough the Doctor attempted to take Team TARDIS to see the coronation of Elizabeth I, Yaz and Graham noticed the location did not seem correct. In fact, they had landed in Bilehurst Cragg in the early 17th century, during the reign of James I. Yaz was shocked when shortly after she arrived, she witnessed a witch trial where Old Mother Twiston was drowned. Yaz was introduced to Becka Savage as a witchfinder alongside the rest of Team TARDIS. While travelling to Becka Savage's manor, she cast doubt on the superstitious traditions of the era.\n\nShortly after their arrival at the manor, the Doctor told Yaz to go to Willa Twiston and find out what she knew about the area. Coming across Willa's ritual in memory of her grandmother, Yaz saw a mud tendril coming from the ground and violently smashed it with a shovel before Willa ran away. Yaz informed the Doctor about her encounter with the tendril. Analysing the sample, the Doctor expressed confusion that the mud read as no different than usual on her sonic screwdriver. Yaz and the Doctor visited Willa's home, where they were served tea by Willa and comforted her due to the mistrust and suspicion of witchcraft that Willa experienced. Yaz, the Doctor, and Willa visited Mother Twiston's burial site once more and encountered the living mud tendrils yet again, as well as the corpse of Mother Twiston which was possessed by the Morax.\n\nWhen the encounter ended, Yaz witnessed the Morax take Becka Savage's axe from the manor, before returning to Bilehurst Cragg in time for the Doctor's trial for witchcraft. After yelling at the townsfolk to let the Doctor go free, she witnessed the Doctor's escape from her chains, and Becka Savage being revealed as the cause of the Morax's presence in the village. When Yaz tried to defend King James from being kidnapped, she was knocked out by Morax energy. After defeating the Morax for good, Yaz departed Bilehurst Cragg with the rest of Team TARDIS. (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nTeam TARDIS next arrived at a pizza parlour in New Port City, where they discovered the body of Iz. Yaz was crestfallen to see the Gornt's dead body, and used her police skills to investigate the pizza parlour and Iz's home. Yaz and Ryan discovered that Iz was a brilliant artist, and found teleportation coordinates to a party Iz had attended outside the Grey Zone. They teleported to the party's location, but were instead kidnapped by Ronan Sumners, who planned to harvest their sperantium to power the city's teleportation system. However, Yaz and Ryan were saved by Graham and the Doctor, and Sumners was accidentally ported into a Pizza-Porter oven. (PROSE: Gatecrashers [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter helping the Doctor halt a war on the planet Lobos between the dog-like loba and the human colonists, Team TARDIS had to return to retrieve Ryan's mobile phone. Accidentally, the TARDIS slipped almost six hundred years into the future, where the planet was now ruled by human zealots, served by slave loba. The zealots derived human superiority over loba from one joke by Graham, now worshipped as \"the Good Doctor\" while the real Doctor was forgotten. With women treated barely better than loba, Ryan and Yasmin were conflated into \"St Rasmin\". Almost immediately Yasmin was arrested for walking without a male relative. In prison, she met and befriended Pry, the leader of the resistance. This helped the Doctor learn both sides of the story. In the end, the Doctor succeeded in uncovering the lie of the zealots, setting the record straight and brokering a lasting peace between humans and loba. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).)\n\nVisiting 2018 Norway, the Doctor and friends discovered a strangely boarded-up and quiet cottage in the middle of nowhere. Exploring, they found a girl called Hanne hiding, terrified, as her father Erik had left her and she believed there was a monster in the nearby woods that took him. Yaz helped calm Hanne's nerves and explored outside with Ryan. Meanwhile, when an upstairs mirror began to distort, the Doctor determined that it was some form of dimensional portal. Promising to find Erik, Yaz entered the mirror alongside the Doctor and Graham.\n\nThey ended up in an anti-zone, an area made to protect space-time, and after being led through by Ribbons and avoiding the flesh moths inside, they discovered the other side: a mirrored world where Erik was safe alongside Hanne's mother, Trine, and Grace - both of whom had memories of dying and could not explain their presence. The Doctor explained to Yaz that they were in the Solitract plane, a conscious alternate universe that was exiled at the beginning of time as it was incompatible with the main universe and was now seeking friends, creating the figures of Grace and Trine as a result. With the reality falling apart, Yaz rejected the reality and was sent back into the anti-zone, managing to escape with the rest of the group. (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nIn the TARDIS, the Doctor discovered nine separate distress signals all coming from the planet Ranskoor Av Kolos, which they followed to meet a man called Greston Paltraki, a commander who had visited the planet to stop a threat there. They eventually discovered that he was being threatened by Tzim-Sha, the Stenza they met on their first adventure, over the safety of some strange mineral-shaped objects. Yaz was tasked with accompanying Paltraki to find out his original mission purpose while the Doctor met with Tzim-Sha and after they were nearly attacked by SniperBots, they found more of the strange objects.\n\nYaz eventually discovered Andinio and Delph of the Ux, being forced by Tzim-Sha to use their powers with his technology to stasis freeze entire planets, starting with Earth, with the objects being previously attacked planets. Eventually saving the Ux, Yaz worked with the Doctor to connect the TARDIS to Delph, using his memory of the planets' original locations to teleport them back before they overwhelmed Ranskoor Av Kolos. It eventually worked, and with Graham and Ryan sealing Tzim-Sha in one of his own stasis pods, the Ux decided to see the universe with Paltraki and the Doctor's group headed on their way. (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nYaz and the rest of Team TARDIS accidentally landed in 1601 Bohemia where they met famous astronomers Tycho Brahe and a young Johannes Kepler and joined them on a gathering of scientists in a nearby castle laid out by Baroness Dagmar Ruskovitch. Yaz struck up a friendship with Johannes and stayed with him. However, when the Baroness took an interest in him, he was forced to leave and Yaz accompanied Graham and a furious Tycho through the castle. They eventually encountered Ruskovitch attempting to show him knowledge from the future, and when they were spotted, she transformed into a centaur to try and kill them. When Johannes stopped her, she ordered Yaz, Graham and Tycho to the dungeon, where Yaz scared the gatekeeper into letting them out by recording a video of him on her phone. Escaping, the three discovered how the assembled astronomers had been paralysed by the Baroness' orbs, so Yaz and Graham shattered them to stop the connection. With the Doctor and Ryan finally returning, she explained the situation before going to meet Ruskovitch again, where it was revealed that she and Dominik were actually trying to save the castle from the Catastrophia's Herald being summoned in the cellar. With the Doctor and Ruskovitch hunting the Herald and sealing it away, Yaz stayed behind, helping Ryan convince the assembled astronomers never to make the events known again. (COMIC: Herald of Madness [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nArriving on Acantha, Team TARDIS were caught in mag-storm and separated from Ryan. After being rescued by two Mobox, M'Kurr and R'Takk, and being taken to a nearby Icarus Incorpoated colony, the Doctor managed to convince the governor to let Yaz and Graham search for Ryan. With M'Kurr and R'Takk piloting again their ship encountered another mag-storm. To lighten the ship's weight, R'Takk converted Yaz and Graham into energy and took them inside himself. Upon landing, he released them and they set off for Ryan, only to be briefly caught in another storm. Yaz received a video from Ryan, showing that humans were creating the storms in an underground chamber, and they found him. Exploring the facility further, they found the Doctor and helped her reach the chamber where she released captive Mobox and lowered local gravity to ensure the peaceful arrest of those responsible. (COMIC: The Power of the Mobox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor told her companions to stay in the TARDIS when she confronted Berakka Dogbolter about the coverage of her actions on Venus. They disobeyed, intervening when three Children of Chaos intrrrupted the meeting. After the Doctor, Graham and Berakka were teleported away, Yaz and Ryan encountered Mother G, who Yaz recognised from being a servant from Bohemia. Mother G congratulated her on remembering her and worked with them to rescue their friends by flying the TARDIS into the Catastrophia. (COMIC: Mistress of Chaos [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nSometime later, Yaz and her friends were treated by the Doctor to witnessing nineteen New Year's Eve celebrations in a row from across history. Before reaching the twentieth, however, the Doctor was alerted to some non-terrestrial things attempting to come together in Sheffield. Landing at an archaeological dig site on New Year's Day 2019, Yaz met Lin and Mitch who had uncovered an ancient burial site when a massive squid-like creature briefly appeared. Yaz led the two out of the area then, while trying to analyse the creature, Team TARDIS travelled to Graham's house, meeting Aaron, Ryan's father. As Ryan left to talk with him, Yaz returned to the TARDIS when the Doctor finally realised that the creature was, in fact, a Dalek.\n\nAttempting to track the Dalek mutant, Yaz picked up Mitch and returned to Graham's house where Mitch taught them about the legend of the Three Custodians defeating a similar creature in the ninth century. Discovering that the Dalek was a reconnaissance scout that had taken control of Lin, Yaz joined the Doctor in tracking it down to a farm.\n\nThe Dalek eventually let go of Lin and Yaz helped take her back to the TARDIS. After the Dalek rebuilt a casing for itself before meeting the Doctor and taking off to summon a fleet to Earth, the group picked up Graham and Aaron and went to corner the Dalek. After they used a microwave owned by Aaron to melt its casing, the Dalek escaped and took control of Aaron, although the Doctor eventually managed to jettison it into a supernova and save Aaron's life, with Ryan finally forgiving him. Returning Aaron, Lin and Mitch to their lives, Yaz continued her adventures with the Doctor. (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).)\n\nWhilst watching the Sentient Nebulae on Blecplam Two and a Half in 3912, the Doctor and her friends encountered a rip in time that the Doctor recognised as one she had encountered before. The rip vanished as before, but the Doctor was able to track it down again to an unnamed planet, where Yaz, Ryan and Graham successfully pulled the trapped man, Dr. Leon Perkins, out of the rip before being captured by the Grand Army of the Just. While they were imprisoned together, Perkins explained that he had become stuck in a time-loop when he and his superior, Dr. Irene Schulz, activated their prototype vortex manipulators, only for his to malfunction. After the Doctor opened their containment cell, Team TARDIS escaped with Perkins back to the TARDIS. Perkins attempted to hijack the ship by threatening Team TARDIS at gunpoint, but his attempt was rendered pointless as the TARDIS had neutralised his weapon. Over a pot of tea, Perkins explained to the group that he and Schulz had come into contact with an alien, \"the Hoarder\", who forced them to steal treasures and take hostages using their time travel technology, with Schulz being injected with a toxic substance as punishment for disobedience. Resolving to help him, the Doctor and her friends helped Perkins find Schulz on the Hoarder's resident planet. After the Doctor cured her, Perkins and Schulz stood up to the Hoarder whilst Team TARDIS freed the hostages. After the Doctor summoned the Time Agency, forcing the Hoarder to try to escape using Perkins' faulty vortex manipulator which froze him in a time loop, Team TARDIS parted ways with Perkins and Schulz. (COMIC: A New Beginning [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2018-2019).)\n\nArriving in Guelder in the early 16th century, Yaz, Graham and Ryan revealed their knowledge of the time period, which they had gained of the Guelders Wars from a historical podcast hosted by Bethany Brunwine called Hidden Human History, to the Doctor's surprise. Exploring, Team TARDIS encountered a horde of Stilean flesh eaters, an alien species that were able to gradually take on the traits of different lifeforms after consuming their blood, one of which took a bite out of the Doctor. After the Stilean flesh eaters fled Team TARDIS tracked them down again to North Carolina in 1711 during Cary's rebellion, and to Canada in the 1860s during the Battle of Ridgeway, both subjects of Hidden Human History, where they encountered Leon Perkins and Irene Schulz again, both having joined the Time Agency. To learn how the podcast was connected to their recent travels, Team TARDIS paid a visit to Bethany Brunwine at her home in 2019 London, where they discovered that she was the Stilean flesh eater that had bitten the Doctor upon their first encounter, having become almost human. After having tea with her, Team TARDIS left her in peace. Yaz asked the Doctor if she would now listen to the podcast, with her replying that it'd be rude not since she caused it to exist. (COMIC: Hidden Human History [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter the Doctor was arrested on Devivian, the trio asked for her release, with Yaz pointing out how accused were treated on Earth prompting the aliens to reluctantly give details on the accusation, and helped her escape. The Doctor traced the true culprit of the crime, the Corsair and introduced her to her friends. The Corsair asked the team to help her with a heist on Raddplina, however when guards arrived the Corsair abandoned them and took off with the Doctor in the TARDIS. Yaz, Graham and Ryan were held in a cage beneath the flying city until the Doctor rescued them by materialising the TARDIS around the cage. (COMIC: Old Friends [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen Yaz's \"time of the month\" came, the Doctor helped her feel better by relaxing in the TARDIS's Hungarian bathroom, giving her a hot water bottle and a bar of creamy, delicious chocolate, and telling her the story about how her eleventh incarnation met Amelia Earhart. (PROSE: Chasing the Dawn [+]Jenny T Colgan, Star Tales (2019).)\n\nThe Doctor dropped her companions off home whilst she repaired the TARDIS. (PROSE: Press Play [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).) After asking her superior officer for more time off to continue her travels, Yaz was picked up by agents of MI6 and reunited with the TARDIS team. Working with Agent \"O\", the group infiltrated the operations of Daniel Barton, Yaz and Ryan posing as a reporting duo. During their investigation, Yaz was attacked by one of the Kasaavin, winding up trapped in their dimension, before she wound up in Australia with the Doctor, a trapped Kassavin having swapped places with her. After the group had confronted Barton at his birthday party and stolen his private jet, O revealed himself to be the Spy Master, another Time Lord and an old enemy of the Doctor's. After summoning two Kasaavin to take the Doctor away, the Master teleported away and left the humans to die. Before the plane crashed however, a recording of the Doctor appeared and told them how to get to safety. Back on the ground, the trio found that they were marked as persons of interests by Barton's influence and were forced to go on the run. The trio eventually tracked Barton down to a warehouse where they learnt his scheme was to turn humanity into hard drives. As the Master arrived to gloat, the Doctor revealed that, through the Master's TARDIS, she had sabotaged the plan, leaving the Master to be taken prisoner by the Kasaavin. Back aboard the TARDIS, the companions requested that the Doctor say who she really was with her giving them the barest of details on her past. (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nAfter an incident with a squid, Team TARDIS was unexpectedly teleported to Tranquility Spa. Though intending to relax, a hole in the resort's ionic membrane let in the native lifeforms, beasts known as the Dregs. After the creatures had abducted Benni, an ultimately futile rescue mission was mounted where it was found that the planet, Orphan 55, was actually a future version of Earth, destroyed by a nuclear war. Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor assured her companions that Orphan 55 was but a possible future for Earth and could be altered if the right choices were made in 2020. (TV: Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nWhilst visiting Hong Kong in 1972, Yaz and Graham bumped into Tung-Mei in a market and were taken captive by men pursuing her, who mistook a pendant Yaz had bought for one in Tung-Mei's possession which she had dropped. They learned the men worked for Chen Luo, one of the most powerful men in Hong Kong, and discovered during an escape attempt that he was allied with the alien Kalatra. Chen kept them hostage and let them watch the duel for the Earth between his champion and his rival found by the Kalatra's pendant - Bruce Lee, who arrived with the Doctor and Ryan. The team gave Bruce advice which enabled him to win, causing the Kalatra to abandon Chen, and then spent a few days in his company before departing. (COMIC: The White Dragon [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nTracking alien technology in the 20th century, the group ran across Nikola Tesla who had found a Thassorian orb. Left with Tesla at his lab, Yaz was abducted by the Skithra who used her to force Tesla into repairing their damaged craft before the Doctor rescued them. The Skithra later made another attempt to invade Tesla's Wardenclyffe laboratory only to be forced away when the tower conducted a lighting strike and sent their ship warping away. As the group left the 20th century, Yaz expressed dismay that Tesla would never be regarded as a genius in his own time but the Doctor assured her that the man's legacy would live on forever. (TV: Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nAfter roughly twenty minutes of watching the Doctor fiddle with the TARDIS, looking for traces as to the Master's location, the group travelled to contemporary Earth to deal with a Judoon invasion of Gloucester. After speaking with the barista Allan, the group was led to believe that the Judoon were hunting Lee Clayton. Making their way to his flat, though losing Graham in the process, the Doctor bluffed that she was an Imperial Regulator and that Yaz was a local law liaison. Invoking the fictitious Article 12 to grant themselves an audience with Lee, the trio were invited inside the flat where the man agreed to meet the Judoon if his wife Ruth was taken to safety. As the Doctor took the woman away, Yaz and Ryan went outside to speak to the Judoon only to be teleported away by Captain Jack Harkness. Having been previously been told by Graham that the Doctor was now a woman, Jack had assumed Yaz to be the Doctor only for Graham to inform him that there were now three companions aboard the TARDIS. After being told that the Judoon were the reason for his malfunctioning scoop, Jack was forced to take his leave when the stolen ship's security nanogenes began attacking him. Teleporting the trio back to Gloucester, he warned them of the \"Lone Cyberman\" and to make sure that it didn't get what it wanted to rebuild the Cyber-Empire. When the trio reunited with the Doctor, they passed on Jack's message before she revealed that the fugitive was an incarnation of herself, one she could not remember being, and feared that time was rewriting around her. (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nDuring the Praxeus infection on Earth, Yaz and Graham were sent by the Doctor to investigate strange energy readings in Hong Kong. There they met DI Jake Willis, the husband of the missing astronaut Adam Lang. While investigating the warehouse, they came across advanced control panels, as well as Adam, and were attacked by figures in hazmat suits. Realising the figures did not want destroy the panels, Yaz threatened to destroy one of them to convince the figures to stand down. Rescued by the Doctor, Yaz elected to stay and find out what was going on with the advanced technology. Given one hour, Yaz was joined by vlogger Gabriela. Yaz realised the control panel was triangulating signals from two other places. After hiding from one of the hazmat aliens, and observing it teleporting away, Yaz and the reluctant Gabriela followed it. They found themselves in a submarine that had been reported missing. After finding a dead hazmat alien, Yaz discovered it was fully infected with Praxeus. When the Doctor joined them, they managed to stop the spread of the virus. (TV: Praxeus [+]Pete McTighe and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nAfter arriving on Calapia, the group were forced to shelter with the locals for three weeks due to the passing of the Death Moon. (PROSE: The Shadow Passes [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor gave Yaz an in-depth tour of her TARDIS, during which she briefly told her about \"Ruth's TARDIS\". (PROSE: TARDIS Tour [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor promised to take her friends to Woodstock, but they wound up in London in 1969 instead. Unsure as to why they'd been brought there, as her own past self and Martha were stranded in this time period, the Doctor sent her companions to watch her past self, the Tenth Doctor. Following him around all day, the companions found nothing suspicious. Though the Doctor intended to leave soon afterwards, Yaz convinced her to stay a while longer, noting the similarity to police investigations. As they followed the Tenth Doctor again, Yaz realised that he was tracking the temporal emissions of their TARDIS. To prevent this, Yaz approached him and claimed to work for the Time Agency only for her bluff to quickly be called. When Ryan and Graham approached, the Doctor advised all three to turn around and not blink as a Weeping Angel had just approached. Through all three companions keeping an eye on the Angel, the Tenth Doctor was able to reach the TARDIS and carry them to safety, meeting up with the Thirteenth Doctor and Martha Jones who had discovered a nest of Autons. When the TARDIS next landed, the Angels attacked to try and feed off it only for the Doctors to dematerialise in such a way that forced the Angels to observe each other. Travelling to the lair of the Nestene Consciousness, the Doctors lured the Angels in, who sent the plastic back in time, before trapping the Angels using a stellar net and depositing them in a sun. After saying goodbye to Martha and the Tenth Doctor, the companions requested to be returned home for some time off. (COMIC: A Little Help from My Friends [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2020).)\n\nThe group arrived in 2020 only to discover the two Doctors meeting had triggered a paradox which had rewritten history, so Earth was now conquered by the Sea Devils. Arrested by the Sea Devils, the four met Jackie and Peter Tyler, with the Doctor telling Team TARDIS about her history with Rose, before they were rescued by a Skithra Queen. Deducing that the history had changed in 1903, with the Skithra now succeeding in kidnapping Tesla. Team TARDIS travelled back there, encountering another version of the Tenth Doctor and Rose Tyler who were also seeking to correct history. In 1903, the group discovered that Thomas Edison had also been kidnapped by the Skithra. After Rose and the Queen stopped the awakening of the Sea Devils, they all travelled to the Skithra ship where they rescued the two scientists. After returning them to Earth, the Doctor took her companions to the restored 2020, thoug briefly abandoned them to resolve another timeline discrepancy. By the time she returned, Team TARDIS had been reunited with the Corsair. (COMIC: Alternating Current [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who Comic (2020) (Titan Comics, 2020-2021).)\n\nWhile she was on a break from travelling, she had strange dreams relating to her encounter with Anita Patel three years beforehand. After helping the Doctor find and defeat Zellin, who was the cause of the nightmares, she met with Anita once again and gave her the 50p she owed her. The Doctor subsequently decided to take her friends to Villa Diodati. (TV: Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nWhile dealing with strange events in Villa Diodati, concerning Mary Shelley, the TARDIS team finally encountered the Lone Cyberman. Despite Yaz's and the other members of the team's warnings, the Doctor gave up the Cyberium to save Percy Shelley. (TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nTravelling to the far future to stop the Lone Cyberman, Team TARDIS helped the last humans escape the last of the Cybermen. However, Yaz, along with Graham, got separated from Ryan and the Doctor and ended up on a Cybercarrier carrying an army of Cyber-Warriors. As the humans took control of the ship, the Cybermen boarded and reactivated the Warriors, storming the bridge. (TV: Ascension of the Cybermen [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nAt Graham's suggestion, the group donned the cyber-suits of inactive Cybermen to hide idside. They later reunited with Ryan, Ethan, and Ko Sharmus. Together with Ravio and Yedlarmi, the group entered the Boundary and found themselves on Gallifrey. There, they met up with the Doctor, who sent them away via another TARDIS to sacrifice herself to stop the Master with the death particle. Materialising back on 21st century Earth, Yaz mournfully questioned what had happened to the Doctor, presuming her dead, unaware that Ko Sharmus had taken the Doctor's place. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nFor the next ten months, Yaz desperately tried to find any trace of the Doctor, even sleeping in the control room of the second TARDIS to continue working. When Graham and Ryan approached her with footage of a Black Dalek linked to Jack Robertson, the three went to confront him. Unsuccessful, they returned to Graham's house where the Doctor, along with Jack Harkness, returned. After Yaz angrily told the Doctor how long she'd been gone, the group began investigating the Daleks.\n\nSent to Osaka with Jack, the two discovered a clone farm for Dalek mutants. When the Doctor arrived, a clone of the Reconnaissance Scout revealed itself and teleported its army into Robertson's drones, turning them on the humans of Earth. With no other option, the Doctor summoned Death Squad Daleks to exterminate the impure Daleks. As Jack, Graham and Ryan sabotaged the Dalek ship, the Doctor and Yaz disguised the second TARDIS as a police box and destroyed it, ending the Dalek invasion.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ryan and Graham chose to stay on Earth but Yaz opted to stay with the Doctor, noting that there was so much more of the universe to see. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nThe Doctor sought to give Yaz the experience of a lifetime, taking Yaz to \"amazing places\" where the two had much fun. (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) After an argument with a Silurian, a Judoon, and a Hath, the Doctor and Yaz were trapped in a joke book, and had to work out what the oldest joke in the universe was to escape. (PROSE: Knock! Knock! Who's There? [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor took Yaz to 1605 only to discover history had been altered so the Gunpowder Plot was successful. Travelling to the night of the explosion, they witnessed Guy Fawkes being arrested and Berthold Schwarz take his place to cause the explosion. They failed to stop Schwarz lighting the gunpowder so fled and travelled back in time to meet his younger self. They discovered he inadvertently summoned an alien knight in an alchemy ritual and stole its gun, killing it. Yaz tried to interfere but was shot in the shoulder by Schwarz, so the Doctor got her back to the TARDIS and dealt with the wound. Once Yaz had recovered, the Doctor explained to her that the alien knight had used its dying breath to curse Schwarz to be immortal until being shot by the last gun on Earth. They travelled forward in time to find Schwarz in the ruins of Earth and he agreed to help them put history right so they took him back to the Gunpowder Plot where the he convinced his younger self not to detonate the gunpowder, breaking the curse. She recounted these events to herself in her mind on Bombfire Night figuring out a way for her to draw away a young individual without him shooting her and saving him from committing crime. This was all witnessed by the Doctor who was checking the timeline had fixed itself. She joined Yaz for the fireworks that night. (PROSE: Black Powder [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who Magazine prose stories (2021).)\n\nWhilst visiting the hanging gardens, Yaz became separated from the Doctor and gave her a phone call as she waited by a waterfall. (WC: A message from Yaz [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor eventually responded to her explaining that she'd gotten distracted. (WC: A Message from the Doctor [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nArriving in a forest, Yaz went to explore whilst the Doctor fixed the TARDIS' biscuit dispenser. She interrupted the locals' forest bride ceremony which enabled the intended bride to escape, and was forced to take her place. Yaz was trapped within one of the trees but was set free by the Doctor who turned the locals against the ceremony and deduced the forest was actually leftover colony technology. (COMIC: The Forest Bride [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor told Yaz she needed to \"see a man about a dog\" and refused to elaborate. The man turned out to be Karvanista who trapped them both hanging over an acid sea. They escaped and made it back to the TARDIS, heading to Earth to discover what Karvanista had meant by mentioning Earth's \"final hours\". Tracing him to Liverpool on the 31st of October 2021 Yaz and the Doctor discovered he'd kidnapped Dan Lewis and briefly encountered Claire Brown. Reaching Karvanista's ship, they split up with the Doctor telling her to find Dan. Yaz set him free and went to find the Doctor, however Dan being free enraged Karvanista who forced them all to flee in the TARDIS. The Doctor took them to investigate the Flux, landing the TARDIS on the edge of Earth's solar system as it approached, only for the Flux to turn target the ship.\n\nAfter the Doctor unleashed vortex energy on the Flux moments before it could engulf the TARDIS, (TV: The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) the collision of energies sent the ship and its crew through time to the Crimea in 1855. After briefly meeting Mary Seacole, Yaz and Dan suddenly continued falling through time with the Doctor promising to find them. Yaz found herself in the Temple of Atropos and encountered a Priest Triangle demanding to know if she could repair. Playing along, she followed it to the Mouri and met Inston-Vee Vinder who was similary confused by where they were. Swarm, Azure, and a Passenger form arrived and forced Yaz and Vinder to cooperate. Swarm killed two Mouri in addition to the two already broken and put Yaz and Vinder in their places. He revealed what he'd done to the Doctor when she arrived looking for Yaz and prepared to expose her and Vinder to the full force of time, wondering how long they'd last. (TV: War of the Sontarans [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nThe Doctor saved them by taking the place of a broken Mouri herself and taking the force of time upon herself, hiding Yaz in her own time stream. Yaz was disturbed by inconsistencies in her time stream and was attacked by a Weeping Angel. When the Mouri retook their positions with the Doctor's help, Yaz was returned to the Temple. After Swarm and Azure departed, they returned to the TARDIS with Vinder and dropped him off on his ruined home planet. (TV: Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021).) Now with just herself, Dan, and the Doctor in the TARDIS, the Thirteenth Doctor sent a distress call about the arrival of the Flux. (TV: The Flux is Coming... [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) A little later, Yaz checked her phone in the control room and was shocked when the Weeping Angel emerged from it, seizing control of the TARDIS. (TV: Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nAfter the Doctor rebooted the TARDIS to get rid of the Weeping Angel, she, Yaz and Dan arrived in Medderton on 21 November 1967. Whilst helping to look for a missing girl named Peggy, Yaz and Dan were touched by another Weeping Angel which sent them back in time to Medderton in 1901. They found Peggy who led them to an energy barrier showing what was happening in 1967. They were joined in 1901 by Professor Eustacius Jericho after he was caught by an Angel and witnessed the Doctor being surrounded by Weeping Angels in 1967. As the Doctor was turned into an Angel after being recalled to the Division, Dan had to stop Yaz from attempting to go to her aid through the energy barrier, as doing so would have resulted in her death. (TV: Village of the Angels [+]Chris Chibnall and Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nYaz, Dan and Jericho spent three years in the 1900s following instructions from the Doctor, who had left a holographic message in Yaz's pocket in case they were separated, to find clues to a potential coming battle for Earth. In 1904 they learnt the date of the future event was 5 December and consulted a seer for further details, who advised them to \"fetch their dog\". Taking that as a clue to contact Karvanista they travelled to the Great Wall of China where they painted a message large enough for the Lupar to see from space in 2021, asking him to come rescue Dan. (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) By this time, they had been in the past for four years. (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nAboard a ship leaving China, they were attacked by a man, who committed suicide rather than be interrogated by them, and encountered Joseph Williamson briefly, who Yaz had previously met at the Temple of Atropos. Realising Williamson's tunnels might be a way of moving through time, they travelled to Liverpool and entered them, finding Williamson again who explained his tunnels went throughout history. To their shock, a group of Sontarans suddenly invaded the Tunnels. (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) Yaz dealt with the Sontarans by opening a door Williamson claimed led to \"death\" and they followed a door to 5 December 2021. There they met Kate Stewart and were reunited with the Doctor, who was currently split into three aspects. Yaz helped the Doctor carry out a plan to infiltrate Sontaran command and assisted as she turned their plan against them to stop a second Flux event. Afterwards, she and the Doctor invited Dan to join them full-time and the Doctor promised to be more open with Yaz. (TV: The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nNow travelling for pleasure as a trio, Yaz, the Thirteenth Doctor and Dan went to see a pantomime of Cinderella, which took a turn for the adventurous after the Doctor tried something during the interval to make the show more exciting, only to accidentally summon real versions of various pantomime characters to the theatre. Though Yaz had to fight off the Crocodile from Peter Pan while Dan dueled Captain Hook, the Doctor was able to put things to right using one of the three wishes from a magic lamp, and things returned to normal, allowing the time travellers to witness the second half of the real show. (COMIC: It's Behind You! [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nA week after the end of the Flux crisis, the Doctor began the TARDIS's reset process to repair damage caused by the Flux, intending to land on a beach where she and Yaz could finally talk properly about what was troubling the Doctor. However the trio instead found themselves in ELF Storage on New Year's Eve 2021 and encountered a Dalek Executioner who exterminated them. They were resurrected when the TARDIS created a time loop and worked with bystanders Sarah and Nick to destroy the Daleks using explosives being stored there, dying and being resurrected numerous times in the process, during which Yaz confirmed to Dan that she had romantic feelings for the Doctor. Afterwards the Doctor abruptly decided that the three of them should go look for the lost treasure of the Flor de la Mar, postponing her and Yaz's conversation. (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nThis quest led the trio to 1807 China where they teamed up with legendary pirate queen Madam Ching to thwart a centuries-old plot by a piratical Sea Devil fanatic to flood the Earth using an artefact known as the Keystone. When the Doctor was about to sacrifice herself to defeat the Sea Devils, she admitted to Yaz that she returned her romantic feelings, but confessed that she \"couldn't\" pursue them because \"time [was] running out\"; even after she made it out alive thanks to Sin Ji-Hun sacrificing himself instead, she declined Yaz's offer to try and pursue a relationship despite the future risk, admitting that she couldn't bring herself to entangle herself in such a way again at the risk of future heartache, but also earnestly stating that she wished her time travelling with Yaz \"could go on forever\". (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nWhilst the trio was investigating disappearances centring on Hydra Hall in 2022, Yaz was captured by alien traders and taken through a portal to their market. By the time the Doctor tracked her down, Yaz was already leading her fellow captives in an escape attempt. The Doctor helped her reach a portal back to 2022 but to Yaz's horror didn't make it through herself. The Doctor subsequently reopened it and reunited with her companions. (COMIC: Hydra's Gate [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor took her friends to visit the edge of reality, however, there she became infected with a psychic virus which erased them. After restoring the people erased by the virus with the help of Cleo Proctor, the Doctor planned to find her friends. (AUDIO: Salvation [+]Juno Dawson, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).)\n\nYaz was chased into the sea by some wasps when she visited a beach for a picnic with Dan and the Doctor. Dan saw this before it happened through a pair of Preventacles and mistakenly believed Yaz was drowning. He ran into the water to rescue her, only to find she was still sitting on the sand with the Doctor. (COMIC: Fear of the Future [+]Jacqueline Rayner, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2022).)\n\nAfterwards, the group investigated the Gardens of Everlasting Summer on a hunch of the Doctor, where Yaz was the first to discover that the custodian, Jinpar, was artificially rewinding time to keep the long-lived residents living in a perpetual state of summer. However, in doing so, she was artificially aged into an old woman, and was only reverted when the Doctor convinced Jinpar to stop. (COMIC: The Everlasting Summer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen a temporal crisis made itself known, the TARDIS made an emergency landing in the Third Doctor's UNIT HQ laboratory, with UNIT HQ having turned into a Waypoint teeming with vortex energy by its experience passing through a singularity into the anti-matter universe. The temporal disturbances were also having an effect on the Doctor herself, who didn't recognise the lab as anywhere she'd been before, even after Yaz found \"John Smith\"'s badge and frilly shirts. With K9 Mark IV's help, the two were able to charge up the TARDIS with vortex energy and make a quick hop to another location, where they met Sil, who sold them technology to help the TARDIS recharge faster using the unrefined vortex energy. After the Doctor briefly visited Atlantis, they returned to the UNIT lab where the Doctor finally remembered the place and realised she was losing some of her symbiotic nuclei, causing her memory troubles. (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).)\n\nAfter Dan departed following an encounter with the CyberMasters, Yaz accompanied the Doctor as she fell into a trap set by the Spy Master. After she was captured by Daleks, Yaz fled back to the TARDIS and received a broadcast from the Master showing the captive Doctor. Using her post-it notes to fly the TARDIS she honed in on the broadcast in time to witness the Master force regenerate the Doctor into himself. After abandoning him on an asteroid, she was guided by an AI hologram of her Doctor and rescued Vinder. Together they forced the Master to reverse the process, restoring the Doctor.\n\nAfter the Doctor saw to the failure of the Master's plans, she was mortally wounded by the Qurunx and Yaz ran out of the TARDIS to retrieve her, carrying her to safety. As the Doctor began to regenerate, she asked to go on alone and took Yaz for a final trip to get ice cream, which they ate together sitting on top of the TARDIS. Afterwards the Doctor dropped Yaz back on Earth, where she met Dan and Graham on their way to a meeting of former companions. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nYasmin was ambitious. Although outwardly confident, she wasn't overly so, and was aware that she still had much to learn; she viewed \"every day [as] a learning day\". (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) She held high aspirations, telling Rosa Parks that she wanted to be at the top of the police force. Despite enduring racism in American 1955, she spoke positively, thanking Rosa Parks for making it possible for her to be a police officer, and that (despite the hard times) America would eventually have a black President. She had a sense of humour and joked about her supposed Mexican blood when she was misidentified in Montgomery. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She rarely brought friends home and her family considered her to be \"married to her job\". (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nYasmin was naturally curious, never failing to leap through into the unknown. (TV: Praxeus [+]Pete McTighe and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) She considered travelling with the Doctor everything she had ever wanted. (PROSE: Can You Hear Me? [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She came to develop romantic feelings for the Doctor, but she did not admit her non-heterosexual feelings to herself for sometime. (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) Her mother, however, had already suspected her daughter was attracted to women, (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) and Yasmin was ultimately encouraged by Dan to accept her true feelings towards The Doctor. (TV: Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nYasmin was known for her strong will. Despite numerous racial slurs hurled at her during the course of her life, Yaz refused to let it get her down. Instead she worked hard to be the better person. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018)., TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Though she was bitter at the memory of such things costing her friends. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).) According to fellow companion Graham O'Brien, nothing deterred Yasmin; she was always fighting, never afraid and never beaten. (TV: The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nYaz had a dislike of \"being on duty at the city centre on a Friday night\". (WC: Case File Two [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Her phone background was a selfie taken by the Doctor featuring herself, the Doctor, and Dan. (COMIC: Hydra's Gate [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She was not arachnophobic, (WC: Case File Four [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and liked Carly Rae Jepsen's music. (PROSE: At Childhood's End [+]Sophie Aldred, Mike Tucker and Steve Cole, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2020).) She also didn't like playing video games. (TV: Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nMuch like Clara Oswald, (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Yaz began thinking and acting like the Doctor, becoming accustomed to taking charge and putting up with the cowardly nature of other companions. (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)., Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).)\n\nHer police experience meant that she was a good negotiator, capable of forming a truce between two opposing civilians. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) Her family liaison training helped her to provide support to those recently bereaved. (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) She was also skilled in helping calm people by reassuring them of something they believed in already. (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nShe had a good knowledge of history, recounting the significance of Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. She knew what time of day Parks was arrested and had some idea about her profession. This knowledge would help the Doctor keep history in order when Krasko's actions put the past in jeopardy. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Yaz was quite good at keeping herself from making verbal slip-ups when visiting the past, especially if it would affect her future. (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nYasmin had a lovely singing voice. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).)\n\nWhile travelling alone with the Doctor, Yasmin became an experienced co-pilot in The Doctor's TARDIS, a very rare skill for a non-Time Lord companion which only Clara Oswald had managed to do previously.\n\nYasmin proved capable of martial arts (TV: Survivors of the Flux [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).) including swordsmanship. (TV: Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)",
