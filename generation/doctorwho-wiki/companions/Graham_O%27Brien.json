  "content": "Following the death of his wife, Graham chose to travel with the Doctor as a way of coping with his grief, rather than allowing it to consume him in a house filled with the memories she left behind. As part of Team TARDIS, Graham often served as a voice of common sense from the older era, while doubling as a proxy for the Doctor in times where women were not respected.\n\nAfter Ryan decided to retire to life on Earth, Graham chose to join him. Provided with psychic paper of their own by the Doctor, Graham and Ryan dedicated themselves to continuing to protect their planet from threats.\n\nGraham was born in Essex (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).) in the late 1950s, being a toddler in 1962 (COMIC: The Piggybackers [+]Scott Gray, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2020).) and a twelve-year-old later that same decade. (AUDIO: The Romanov Project [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) As a child, he attended Sunday School in Chingford, spent some summer holidays in Margate and Whitstable (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).) and once visited a lighthouse. He was obsessed with Silvia Sandstrom, whom he read about and saw on the television and who inspired him. (AUDIO: The Romanov Project [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter Graham's mother died, his father quickly got rid of all her possessions and told him that \"she's gone now and that's the end of it\". (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).) Graham got into trouble with the police on at least one occasion (COMIC: Alternating Current [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who Comic (2020) (Titan Comics, 2020-2021).) and worked as a bus driver, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) once having a supervisor whom he would later remark behaved in a similar way to Thomas Edison. (TV: Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nGraham kept in contact with his fellow bus drivers following his retirement. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) Fond of houseplants, his favourite was a begonia which he named Vera. Once, having left for a trip to Blackpool, Graham forgot to water his plants and Vera withered away, much to his disappointment. (PROSE: The Secret in Vault 13 [+]David Solomons, BBC Children's Books (BBC Children's Books, 2018).) He once dated a goth. (PROSE: Combat Magicks [+]Steve Cole, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).)\n\nGraham developed cancer and met his wife Grace, a chemo nurse, while undergoing treatment. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) When he told Grace he was a bus driver, she remarked that he ought not to be like James Blake, who she called \"Blake the snake.\" He learned of her appreciation of Rosa Parks and that she owned a t-shirt that said \"The Spirit of Rosa\". (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Once the cancer was found to be in remission, Graham married her and had become her second husband by 2015. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).)\n\nWhilst returning home after an unsuccessful session of teaching Ryan how to ride a bike, Grace and Graham were trapped when a swarm of gathering coils attacked their train in search of Karl Wright, a fellow passenger. He, along with Grace, Ryan and Yasmin Khan, helped the Thirteenth Doctor battle both the coil and its controller, Tzim-Sha.\n\nWhilst the Doctor recovered at his and Grace's home, he went around Sheffield to ask if anyone had seen anything unusual. Later, Grace and Graham followed the Doctor's orders to pose as construction managers and evacuate the construction site Karl worked at, so the Doctor, Ryan and Yasmin could rescue him.\n\nHowever, the gathering coils were still active, with Tzim-Sha using them to damage the crane that Ryan and the others were on. Despite Graham's protests, Grace climbed up and destroyed the creature by electrocuting it with live cables. However, Grace was also electrocuted in the process and fell to the ground. Mortally wounded, she died in Graham's arms, after telling him to not be afraid without her. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) After she died, Graham organised her things into boxes, finding the childhood possessions of her son, Aaron, as he did. (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).)\n\nAt Grace's funeral, Graham spoke of how Grace inspired him during their three-year marriage and felt guilty that he hadn't died instead. Sometime after the funeral, Graham helped the Doctor construct a teleporter to take her to her TARDIS. Though he meant to stay behind, he, along with Yasmin and Ryan, were accidentally brought along with her. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).)\n\nBelieving the pair to be bonuses in the Rally of the Twelve Galaxies, Angstrom scooped Ryan and Graham out of deep space and transported them aboard her ship.\n\nOn Desolation, he found Yasmin and the Doctor, who had been similarly saved by Epzo, Angstrom's rival in what would become the final stage of the rally. The rivals, with the Doctor and her friends in tow, were tasked by Ilin, master of the rally, to race across the planet; the first to reach the finish line at the Ghost Monument would win 3.2 million krin and salvation from planet's hostile surface. The Doctor discovered that the Ghost Monument was, in fact, her TARDIS, phasing in and out of reality. After the Doctor stabilised the TARDIS, Graham entered it for the first time and the Doctor attempted to take him, Ryan and Yaz home. (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nThe TARDIS deposited the Doctor and her companions in 1955 Montgomery, Alabama instead of returning them to Sheffield due to large traces of Artron energy. Graham was initially excited about his first journey back in history and expressed a desire to see Elvis Presley playing.\n\nAs the only other white member of the group aside from the Doctor, Graham was treated far better than Ryan or Yaz. He defended them from the racism inflicted on them, even coming to Ryan's aid when Mr Steele slapped him for returning a glove to his wife Lizzie.\n\nGraham worked to help ensure Rosa Parks began the Montgomery Bus Boycott, using his knowledge of bus drivers to help. He and Ryan encouraged James Blake to leave his fishing spot on his day off after spreading a rumour of a black boycott.\n\nDue to Krasko's interference, a distressed Graham was forced to take part in Parks's famous moment of defiance by ensuring the bus was crowded enough for Parks to be asked to give up her seat. Graham ultimately became the passenger that Rosa Parks refused to give her seat up to, sparking the boycott. The Doctor later showed her companions a history of Rosa's life and how she would go on to have a lasting impact on the history of the universe by taking them to Asteroid 284996, Rosaparks. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nUpon returning home, Graham declined to have tea at Yaz's with Ryan and the Doctor. Instead he returned home, where he imagined Grace was still alive telling him to fix things around the house like she asked. Grieving, he began smelling her clothes despite his vision of Grace telling him it didn't help. Hearing a noise upstairs, he went to investigate, finding an abnormally large spider. Fleeing back to Yaz's, he informed Ryan and the Doctor of what he saw. He joined them to investigate further, giving Ryan a letter from his father he found at home; though Ryan took it, he dismissed reading it right away. After the giant spiders had been dealt with, Graham decided to join the Doctor in the TARDIS as he didn't want to just stay in his house and dwell on his grief. (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nGraham and Team TARDIS travelled to the planet Gatan, arriving in the City of Radiant Stone in the midst of war. Graham accompanied Ryan on the roofs to see why the city was under attack when they noticed \"a flying robot lady\" called Sandola Dell flying past. They later witnessed the battle between the destroyers of the city - Tumat and Kraytos - as Sandola reported on it, and upon being spotted, Sandola teleported them to her headquarters at The Freedom Thoughtcasting Network. Graham attempted to phone the Doctor, and briefly reunited with her when she was teleported on board as well. With Sandola locking him and Ryan in a disused dressing room, the two learnt of her struggles at work and convinced her to take some time off, leaving the two alone. Learning they were in the room belonging to two actors who played Tumat and Kraytos for promotions, they used the powerful suits to break out and rescue the Doctor from being attacked by Berakka Dogbolter. They eventually used the suits to trick the real warriors onto a teleport pad where the Doctor fused them into one being, thereby ending the war. (COMIC: The Warmonger [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen Team TARDIS travelled to the junk planet Seffilun 27 in search of spare parts in the 67th century, Graham accidentally set off a sonic mine that knocked them out for four days. Fortunately, the Tsuranga medical ship had been nearby when the mine detonated, and they were brought on board for treatment shortly after the blast, but without the TARDIS. As the Doctor found a way to get back, the ship was boarded by a Pting, which began to eat through the ship itself. With a plan forming, Graham and Ryan were forced to act as 'doulas' for Yoss, a man who was about to give birth and successfully delivered his baby. Safely arriving on the space station with the Pting jettisoned in the meantime, Graham and his friends were able to return to the TARDIS. (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nGraham and Ryan came up with the suggestion of giving Yasmin a cake, balloons and candles for her birthday. (PROSE: Dr. Thirteenth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and her team were tasked with preventing the Genesis Seed stored in the secret Vault 13 within the Galactic Seed Vault from falling into the hands of Nightshade. (PROSE: The Secret in Vault 13 [+]David Solomons, BBC Children's Books (BBC Children's Books, 2018).)\n\nGraham and Team TARDIS later travelled to Punjab in 1947 on Yaz's request to see her grandmother Umbreen when she was younger. They eventually met Umbreen and her husband-to-be Prem on the day before both their wedding and the Partition of India, where Prem's younger brother, Manish, wanted to separate Hindus and Muslims on the nearby border. However, they encountered two Thijarians who they believed were killing local people. Graham and Yaz stayed behind as the Doctor, Ryan and Prem investigated and later helped collect some ox spit to help create the Doctor's \"demon repellent\". However, the Doctor later realised that the Thijarians were simply bearing witness to the unacknowledged dead, with Prem next. Graham watched as Umbreen and Prem got married, but when Manish's Hindu nationalists attempted to drive the Muslims out, Prem was shot by Manish. Graham and his friends eventually returned to 2018 with history unchanged by their visit. (TV: Demons of the Punjab [+]Vinay Patel, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nThe Doctor's group next visited the Kerb!am warehouse on Kandoka's moon after the Doctor received a message for help on a packing slip she received. After taking the roles of employees in the workforce, the Doctor swapped her position with Graham, leaving him as a maintenance worker alongside Charlie Duffy. While the Doctor and Ryan worked in packing and Yaz helped in product selection with a man called Dan who went mysteriously missing, Graham was tasked with finding out the history and map of the company. After receiving it, the group learnt of the Kerb!am system going rogue, with Graham and Charlie retrieving Twirly, the first form of a delivery bot, who revealed that the system was the one who sent the call for help.\n\nTeleporting down to the Dispatch area where Yaz, Ryan and Charlie had gone, Graham discovered the liquidised remains of the killed workers who had gone missing. It was later revealed that Charlie had intercepted all the company's parcels and turned their bubble wrap into bombs to kill their receivers and pin the blame on the automated system to let humans get more jobs. With the Doctor preventing the deliveries from going out but Charlie refusing to leave, the group teleported out before the warehouse could explode. Back in the TARDIS, Graham nearly played with the bubble wrap in the Doctor's order before deciding against it. (TV: Kerblam! [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nAfter attempting to arrive at Queen Elizabeth I's coronation, the Doctor accidentally brought Team TARDIS to Bilehurst Cragg in the early 17th century in the middle of a series of witch trials. After Mother Twiston was tried as a witch by the landlady, Becka Savage, the Doctor intervened, proclaiming her group to be witchfinders. However, upon meeting King James I, Graham was appointed Witchfinder General instead as James could not imagine a woman doing the job. After Becka's younger cousin Willa was attacked by a tendril of mud while attempting to bury her grandmother, Graham and Ryan were forced to stick with King James and Becka to prevent them from killing anyone else while the Doctor and Yaz investigated. However, the plan did not work, leading the group to encounter the others as the mud possessed the body of Mother Twiston.\n\nMoving off to find a group of the mud figures, Graham, Yaz and Ryan eventually stumbled upon the Doctor getting ducked under suspicion as a witch. Although she survived, Becka revealed herself to be infected with the mud and transformed, now identifying as the Morax, whose prison disguised as a tree on Pendle Hill was broken by Becka, leading them to plan on releasing their king and filling up the planet with their form. After being briefly knocked out, everyone followed the Doctor to Pendle Hill, where they used burning torches constructed from the prison to seal the Morax again. Eventually, the group made King James promise that the events would never be recounted in the future and they left in the TARDIS. (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nTeam TARDIS next arrived at a pizza parlour in New Port City, where they discovered the body of Iz. Graham and the Doctor investigated Iz's local Grey Zone Mall, but found that the posh dress she was wearing wasn't sold there. The Doctor attempted to find the teleportation coordinates to the Black Zone Mall above, but instead, Graham and the Doctor found themselves outside the city next to the teleportation system's core. Needing to bypass the core's teleportation block, they returned to the pizza parlour and used spray cheese to provide a forcefield while Graham drove a moped to the core. Graham and the Doctor rescued Ryan and Yaz from having their sperantium harvested, as the city's dictatorial mayor Ronan Sumners was accidentally ported into a Pizza-Porter oven. (PROSE: Gatecrashers [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter helping the Doctor halt a war on the planet Lobos between the dog-like loba and human colonists, shortly before leaving in the TARDIS, Graham finally told the joke he had been itching to use about loba being human's best friend. When they attempted to return - to retrieve Ryan's mobile phone - the TARDIS slipped almost six hundred years into the future, where the planet was now ruled by human zealots, served by slave loba, who derived human superiority over loba from this one joke. Graham was now worshipped as \"the Good Doctor\" while the real Doctor was forgotten. While agreeing this had to be fixed, Graham felt uneasy as the man in charge whose word was everyone's command but did surprisingly well. Eventually, his intolerance of racism and misogyny caused High Priest Mykados of the Temple of Tordos to denounce him and his friends as charlatans. In the end, the Doctor succeeded in uncovering the lie of the zealots, setting the record straight and brokering a lasting peace between humans and loba. The locals commemorated Graham by naming a bay after him. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).)\n\nVisiting 2018 Norway, the Doctor and friends discovered a strangely boarded-up and quiet cottage in the middle of nowhere. Exploring, they found a girl called Hanne hiding, terrified, as her father Erik had left her and she believed there was a monster in the nearby woods that took him. As Graham kept watch from upstairs, he noticed a strange noise coming out of a nearby mirror that was not reflecting him, and the Doctor determined that it was some form of dimensional portal. Promising to find Erik, Graham entered the mirror alongside the Doctor and Yaz.\n\nThey ended up in an anti-zone, an area made to protect space-time, and after being led through by Ribbons and avoiding the flesh moths inside, they discovered the other side: a mirrored world where Erik was safe alongside Hanne's mother, Trine, and Grace - both of whom had memories of dying and could not explain their presence. After Graham had a heartfelt conversation with Grace, the Doctor discovered they were in the Solitract plane, a conscious alternate universe that was exiled at the beginning of time as it was incompatible with the main universe and was now seeking friends, creating the figures of Grace and Trine as a result. With the reality falling apart, Graham realised Grace was not real when she displayed a lack of empathy over Ryan's safety and, rejecting it, he was sent back into the anti-zone and just about managed to escape with the rest of the group. Reflecting on their experience, Graham and Ryan talked about how they both missed Grace, with Ryan finally calling Graham 'Granddad' in doing so, before returning to the TARDIS. (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nIn the TARDIS, the Doctor discovered nine separate distress signals all coming from the planet Ranskoor Av Kolos, which they followed to meet a man called Greston Paltraki, a commander who had visited the planet to stop a threat there. They eventually discovered that he was being threatened by Tzim-Sha, the Stenza they met on their first adventure, over the safety of some strange mineral-shaped objects. Attempting to find Paltraki's crew with Ryan, Graham spoke to the Doctor, explaining that if he had the chance, he would kill Tzim-Sha without question, despite the Doctor promising to throw him out if he did. Evading fire from SniperBots, Graham and Ryan discovered the rest of Paltraki's crew held in Stenza stasis pods and attempted to get them out before they were attacked again.\n\nAs Tzim-Sha began his plan of using the local Ux's powers with his technology to stasis freeze entire planets, starting with Earth, Paltraki gave Graham the weapons needed to stop the ongoing SniperBots while Ryan led the hostages to safety. Eventually being faced down by Tzim-Sha, Graham refused to kill him, wanting to be the better man instead, and after finally fist-bumping Ryan locked him in one of his own stasis pods. With the threat averted, the Ux decided to see the universe with Paltraki and the Doctor's group headed on their way. (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nGraham and the rest of Team TARDIS accidentally landed in 1601 Bohemia where they met famous astronomers Tycho Brahe and a young Johannes Kepler and joined them on a gathering of scientists in a nearby castle laid out by Baroness Dagmar Ruskovitch. Graham quickly struck up a friendship with Tycho, with Tycho explaining an urban legend over the castle being cursed. However, when the Baroness took a greater interest in Johannes, Graham and Yaz accompanied a furious Tycho through the castle. They encountered her attempting to show him knowledge from the future, and when they were spotted, she transformed into a centaur to try and kill them. When Johannes stopped her, she ordered Graham, Yaz and Tycho to the dungeons. After some quick thinking from Yaz, they escaped and discovered how the assembled astronomers had been paralysed by the Baroness' orbs, where Graham and Yaz smashed the orbs and freed them. With the Doctor returning, Graham explained the situation and joined the rest of the group in encountering Ruskovitch again, where she revealed that she and Dominik were actually trying to save the castle from the Catastrophia's Herald being summoned in the cellar. With the Doctor and Ruskovitch hunting the Herald, Kepler revealed that he would seal it away at the cost of his life, and Brahe forcibly took his place, knowing Kepler's impact on the future. Graham was mortified but powerless to stop him, being helped to know that Brahe would receive a state funeral. (COMIC: Herald of Madness [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nArriving on Acantha, Team TARDIS were caught in mag-storm and separated from Ryan. After being rescued by two Mobox, M'Kurr and R'Takk, and being taken to a nearby Icarus Incorporated colony, the Doctor managed to convince the governor to let Graham and Yaz search for Ryan. With M'Kurr and R'Takk piloting again, their ship encountered another mag-storm. To lighten the ship's weight, R'Takk converted Graham and Yaz into energy and took them inside himself, which Graham found very disconcerting. Upon landing, he released them and they set off for Ryan, only to be briefly caught in another storm. They used a video Yaz had been sent from Ryan's phone, showing that humans were creating the storms in an underground chamber, to find him. Exploring the facility further, they found the Doctor and helped her reach the chamber where she released captive Mobox and lowered local gravity to ensure the peaceful arrest of those responsible. (COMIC: The Power of the Mobox [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen she went to Venus to confront Berakka Dogbolter about her news organisations branding her a terrorist, the Doctor told her companions to stay in the TARDIS. They disobeyed and intervened when three Children of Chaos interrupted the meeting. In the ensuing scuffle Graham was teleported away along with the Doctor and Berakka by the leader of the three, Krizanthia Kalos. Arriving on another part of Venus, Graham was pulled into the Catastrophia when Krizanthia activated the Eye of M'Dulia. The Doctor guided him and Berakka to the safety of a logic cube within the chaos, where they discovered two possible future versions of the Doctor; the Herald, who had succumbed to the madness of the Catastrophia, and the Sanity, who had made the logic cube and planned to destroy the Catastrophia. After the Doctor and Berakka managed to defeat the two, they were rescued by Mother G, who was piloting the TARDIS along with Yaz and Ryan. (COMIC: Mistress of Chaos [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nSometime later, Graham and his friends were treated by the Doctor to witnessing nineteen New Year's Eve celebrations in a row from across history. Before reaching the twentieth, however, the Doctor was alerted to some non-terrestrial things attempting to come together in Sheffield. Landing at an archaeological dig site on New Year's Day 2019, Graham met Lin and Mitch who had uncovered an ancient burial site when a massive squid-like creature briefly appeared. Trying to analyse the creature, Team TARDIS travelled to Graham's house, where Graham begrudgingly answered the door to Aaron, Ryan's father. As Ryan left to talk with him, Graham returned to the TARDIS when the Doctor finally realised that the creature was, in fact, a Dalek.\n\nAttempting to track the Dalek mutant, the group picked up Mitch and returned to Graham's house where Mitch taught them about the legend of the Three Custodians defeating a similar creature in the ninth century. Discovering that the Dalek was a reconnaissance scout that had taken control of Lin, Graham was sent to buy some peanut butter for the TARDIS' systems, and by the time he returned, the TARDIS had left again to follow the creature. In the meantime, Graham showed Aaron how Grace had kept his childhood belongings all her life and told him how there was still time to improve things.\n\nAfter the Dalek let go of Lin and rebuilt a casing for itself before meeting the Doctor and taking off to summon a fleet to Earth, the Doctor returned to pick up Graham and Aaron, where the group went to corner the Dalek. After they used a microwave owned by Aaron to melt its casing, the Dalek escaped and took control of Aaron, although the Doctor eventually managed to jettison it into a supernova and save Aaron's life, with Ryan finally forgiving him. Returning Aaron, Lin and Mitch to their lives, Graham continued his adventures with the Doctor. (TV: Resolution [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2019 (BBC One, 2019).)\n\nWhilst watching the Sentient Nebulae on Blecplam Two and a Half in 3912, the Doctor and her friends encountered a rip in time that the Doctor recognised as one she had encountered before. The rip vanished as before, but the Doctor was able to track it down again to an unnamed planet, where Graham, Ryan and Yaz successfully pulled the trapped man, Dr. Leon Perkins, out of the rip before being imprisoned by the Grand Army of the Just. While they were imprisoned together, Perkins explained that he had become stuck in a time-loop when he and his superior, Dr. Irene Schulz, activated their prototype vortex manipulators, only for his to malfunction. After the Doctor opened their containment cell, Team TARDIS escaped with Perkins back to the TARDIS. Perkins attempted to hijack the ship by threatening Team TARDIS at gunpoint, but his attempt was rendered pointless as the TARDIS had neutralised his weapon. Over a pot of tea, Perkins explained to the group that he and Schulz had come into contact with an alien, \"the Hoarder\", who forced them to steal treasures and take hostages using their time travel technology, with Schulz being injected with a toxic substance as punishment for disobedience. Resolving to help him, the Doctor and her friends helped Perkins find Schulz on the Hoarder's resident planet. After the Doctor cured her, Perkins and Schulz stood up to the Hoarder whilst Team TARDIS freed the hostages. After the Doctor summoned the Time Agency, forcing the Hoarder to try to escape using Perkins' faulty vortex manipulator which froze him in a time loop, Team TARDIS parted ways with Perkins and Schulz. (COMIC: A New Beginning [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2018-2019).)\n\nArriving in Guelder in the early 16th century, Graham, Ryan and Yaz revealed their knowledge of the time period, which they had gained of the Guelders Wars from a historical podcast hosted by Bethany Brunwine called Hidden Human History, to the Doctor's surprise. Exploring, Team TARDIS encountered a horde of Stilean flesh eaters, an alien species that were able to gradually take on the traits of different lifeforms after consuming their blood, one of which took a bite out of the Doctor. After the Stilean flesh eaters fled, Team TARDIS tracked them down again to North Carolina in 1711 during Cary's rebellion, and to Canada in the 1860s during the Battle of Ridgeway, both subjects of Hidden Human History, where they encountered Leon Perkins and Irene Schulz again, who had joined the Time Agency. To learn how the podcast was connected to their recent travels, Team TARDIS paid a visit to Bethany Brunwine at her home in 2019 London, where they discovered that she was the Stilean flesh eater that had bitten the Doctor upon their first encounter, having become almost human. After having tea with her, with Ryan and Graham doing the washing up, Team TARDIS left her in peace. (COMIC: Hidden Human History [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter the Doctor was arrested on Devivian, the trio asked for her release and helped her escape. The Doctor traced the true culprit of the crime, the Corsair and introduced her to her friends. The Corsair asked the team to help her with a heist on Raddplina, however when guards arrived the Corsair abandoned them and took off with the Doctor in the TARDIS. Graham, Ryan and Yaz were held in a cage beneath the flying city until the Doctor rescued them by materialising the TARDIS around the cage. (COMIC: Old Friends [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor dropped her companions off home to do repairs to the TARDIS. (PROSE: Press Play [+]Pete McTighe, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).) After a check up on his cancer, Graham was forcefully picked up by agents of MI6 and reunited with his fellow companions and the Doctor. On the way to MI6, the GPS device in the car vaporised the driver, and the car tried to kill the group, however they made it out alive thanks to the Doctor.\n\nFollowing \"C\"'s death at MI6, the Doctor and Graham headed to Australia to visit \"O\". When Ryan and Yaz regrouped with them, the five headed to investigate the schemes of Daniel Barton, whom they suspected was behind the murdering of several spies with the aid of the Kasaavin, malevolent beings of light. They infiltrated a party hosted by Barton, gambling to blend in before Barton fled upon suspicion from the Doctor. The group made chase and ended up following Barton onto his private jet, which took off. While on the plane, \"O\" revealed that he was actually the Spy Master and activated a bomb in the cockpit. As the plane began to crash, the Kasaavin teleported the Doctor, away.\n\nGraham and the others panicked as the plane fell, but Ryan found plaques in the plane that revealed a series of clues that led to a video from the Doctor, explaining to them how to get out of the situation. After they escaped, the Master pulled some strings with Barton, making it seem that Graham and the others are wanted criminals, and disabling their means of communication. Hiding in a dilapidated building, Graham and the others discussed what the Doctor would do in this situation, which led them to realse they didn't know as much about her as they'd like to. They were then ambushed by Kasaavin, and later tricked Barton's pawns into a trap using Graham's laser shoes that he had gotten from MI6. They then stole a car from the cronies and regrouped with the Doctor, who had been tracking and thwarting the Master with the help of Ada Lovelace and Noor Inayat Khan. They then witnessed the powering up of the Silver Lady, which began to summon hundreds of Kasaavin, as Barton planned to change humanity into a technological mindspace of sorts. However, the Doctor, Graham, Ryan, and Yaz thwarted the Master, disabling the Silver Lady and turning the Kasaavin against him. Afterwards the team confronted the Doctor about her origins and she finally gave them some basic details, but refused to elaborate any further. (TV: Spyfall [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nAfter picking up enough coupons from Bandohzi Herald for a free holiday, Graham accidentally made a cube out of them and transported the TARDIS team to the Tranquility Spa on Orphan 55, an orphan planet seemingly destroyed by nuclear warfare. After being told by their hostess, Hyph3n, that they could leave at any time but were allowed to stay for their full 2-week booked stay, Graham decided to enjoy his holiday and do \"as little as possible.\" However, he was soon informed over intercom of a breach of the hotel perimeter, which forced him into his closest muster zone, with the green-haired Nevi and his son Sylas. Graham later regrouped with Yaz and the Doctor, and later Ryan. Graham was then part of the search party for the missing hotel guest Benni, who was later killed by the native Dregs of Orphan 55. Later, after the search party was deserted, they began to find their way back through tunnels, which revealed that Orphan 55 was a future Earth. The Doctor then found out (through telepathy with a Dreg) that Earth was orphaned by global warming and nuclear warfare. After the Doctor, with the help of her companions and the hotel guests, stopped the Dregs, she consoled her distraught friends and explained that Orphan 55 was only one possible future of Earth, and that actions in the present (2020) could change the outcome. (TV: Orphan 55 [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nAlong with the Doctor, Ryan, and Yaz, Graham visited early 20th century New York City when the Doctor detected a strange energy reading. The group then met Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison, who were promoting different methods of light and energy. However, Edison was renowned while Tesla's equally powerful methods were a failure in the eyes of the public, not aided by Edison's spies and fake rumours. The group discovered the presence of the Skithra, spider-like aliens with a hobby for collecting scraps of technology from other species and conquering worlds. Graham, along with the Doctor, Ryan, Yaz, Tesla, Edison, and Tesla's assistant Dorothy then headed to Tesla's Wardenclyffe lab in order to enact a plan to stop the Skithra. Graham engaged in several conversations with Edison and Tesla (even going so far as to defuse their arguments) before the gang tricked the Skithra queen, who beamed down into the lab, into electrocuting herself (using a current aided by Tesla's tower), forcing her and the armies of the Skithra to retreat. The next day, before the Doctor and her companions left, the Doctor explained to Graham, Yaz, and Ryan that Tesla never became famous during his time alive, and Edison got all of the recognition. (TV: Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror [+]Nina Métivier, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nWhen the TARDIS arrived in 1969, the Doctor suspected it had something to do with her past self being stranded there and sent her companions to observe him. As they followed the Tenth Doctor around London, Graham, Ryan and Yaz were attacked by Weeping Angels and worked with him to escape. Reuniting with their Doctor, they helped the two Doctors pit the Angels against the Nestene Consciousness which was also attacking London. With both monsters dealt with, Team TARDIS asked to go back to 2020 for a break only for them to discover a paradox had been created by the two Doctors' encounter and had rewritten history, leaving their time in ruins. (COMIC: A Little Help from My Friends [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2020).) As they explored, Team TARDIS were captured by Sea Devils who now ruled the Earth and were taken to a prison camp, where they encountered Peter and Jackie Tyler. They escaped when a Skithra Queen attacked the camp and returned to the TARDIS with her, learning the timeline had been altered in 1903 with the Skithra now successfully kidnapping Tesla and then awakening Sea Devils to conquer Earth for them. Team TARDIS resolved to save Tesla a second time, reasoning that they'd done it before, and along the way encountered another version of the Tenth Doctor with Rose Tyler who was also investigating the timeline change. In 1903, Team TARDIS learnt that Edison had been kidnapped too. After the Queen and Rose stopped the awakening of the Sea Devils, they all travelled to the Skithra ship where they rescued the two scientists, correcting history. The Doctor took her companions to restored 2020 however suddenly left them to resolve another timeline discrepancy. When she returned, she found her companions had met the Corsair again. (COMIC: Alternating Current [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who Comic (2020) (Titan Comics, 2020-2021).)\n\nWhile investigating the reason why the Judoon had invaded Gloucester in 2020 with the mysterious Ruth, Graham was transported to a spaceship, where he met Jack Harkness, who subsequently kissed him, believing him to be the Doctor. After being reunited with Ryan and Yaz, who Jack also accidentally picked up, the three were told to, \"beware the Lone Cyberman\" and to not \"give it what it wants\" before being returned to Gloucester. Graham, along with Ryan and Yaz, explained this warning from Jack to the Doctor, who also explained to them that Ruth was actually a version of herself. (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nGraham was present during the Praxeus virus' infection on Earth. During the event, he helped Jake Willis with advice about how to reconnect with Willis' husband, Adam Lang. (TV: Praxeus [+]Pete McTighe and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nArriving on Calapia, Team TARDIS were forced to shelter with the locals for three weeks due to the passage of the Death Moon. (PROSE: The Shadow Passes [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor attempted to take Graham to have a kickabout with Bobby Moore during the West Ham F.C's glory days in 1964, however they instead arrived in West Ham in 1896 to his excitement as he realised they could meet the original team. There the Doctor and Team TARDIS discovered a Draconian using Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company to build a dreadnought. To her companions' surprise, the Doctor was only able to convince the Draconian and company boss to allow the workers' football team, the precursors to West Ham F.C, to train so they would be prepared for the 1896 Charity Cub Final, avoiding history being changed. (PROSE: The Simple Things [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhilst visiting Hong Kong in 1972, Graham and Yaz bumped into Tung-Mei in a market and were taken captive by men pursuing her, who mistook a pendant Yaz had bought for one in Tung-Mei's possession which she had dropped. They learned the men worked for Chen Luo, one of the most powerful men in Hong Kong, and discovered during an escape attempt that he was allied with the alien Kalatra. Chen kept them hostage and let them watch the duel for the Earth between his champion and his rival found by the Kalatra's pendant - Bruce Lee, who arrived with the Doctor and Ryan. The team gave Bruce advice which enabled him to win, causing the Kalatra to abandon Chen, and then spent a few days in his company before departing. (COMIC: The White Dragon [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile on a rest from travelling, Graham experienced visions of Rakaya on a space platform, which ended up being a trap set by Zellin. During the experience, he had a dream where his cancer came back. He later had a conversation with the Doctor on the subject, but the Doctor awkwardly diverted his question. (TV: Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nWhile visiting 19th century Switzerland, Graham, the Doctor, Ryan, and Yaz found shelter in Villa Diodati on the supposed night of Mary Shelley's idea to write the book that would become Frankenstein. On the way to use the restroom, Graham finds a skeletal hand and notices that he keeps ending up in the same place within the house. He later met back with Ryan in the drawing room, before watching over Ryan as the crazed Polidori challenged Ryan to a duel. Graham then witnessed what appeared to be the ghosts of a woman and a girl. Graham is then present when the Lone Cyberman breaks into the Villa, revealing himself to be called Ashad. The Doctor and company were then caught in a sticky situation with Ashad, forcing the Doctor to make a tough decision. Graham, Ryan, and Yaz tried to convince the Doctor to not give Ashad the Cyberium (the entity of all Cyber knowledge), but the Doctor ranted to them about how she is at the top of their \"mountainous\" team structure, despite her previous claims that the group's team structure was flat. The Doctor faces an ultimatum and chooses to save Percy Shelley and preserve history, but give Ashad the Cyberium. Ashad teleports away, and the next day, the group departed. Graham was still confused about his \"ghost\" encounter, but the Doctor refused to deny the existence of ghosts, to Graham's slight worry. The group then headed off to the future to stop the repercussions of giving Ashad the Cyberium. (TV: The Haunting of Villa Diodati [+]Maxine Alderton, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nTen months after returning to Earth, Ryan and Graham found a video of Jack Robertson demonstrating new Defence Drones to the Prime Minister, which they realised were actually Daleks. They recruited Yaz to help them investigate, however got nowhere when Jack simply ignored their threats. They were reunited with the Doctor, who returned to Earth with Jack Harkness, and worked with them to defeat the Daleks once more. Afterwards, Ryan declined the Doctor's offer of further adventures, feeling that he knew who he was and wanted to remain on Earth to help his friends and continue reconnecting with his father, prompting Graham to decide to stay to be with his grandson. The Doctor gave them two sheets of psychic paper, which they planned to use to keep investigating unusual incidents. Graham once again tried to teach Ryan to ride a bicycle and they both saw a vision of Grace smiling at them. (TV: Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021).)\n\nIn 2022, both he and Ryan were reported as missing, (AUDIO: SOS [+]Juno Dawson, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).) due to a psychic virus infecting the Thirteenth Doctor and erasing people who had had contact with her. The Doctor and Cleo Proctor eventually restored the disappeared. (AUDIO: Salvation [+]Juno Dawson, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).)\n\nLater that year, Ryan was in Patagonia whilst Graham investigated Dalek-induced volcanic activity in Bolivia, and became embroiled in the Master's Dalek Plan. Graham teamed up with former Seventh Doctor companion Ace to defeat the Daleks, escaping when the Doctor arrived in the TARDIS to help. Graham helped pilot the TARDIS alongside Yaz, Tegan Jovanka, Ace and Kate Stewart before being returned to Croydon by Yaz.\n\nFollowing this, he met with another former companion, Dan Lewis, where they joined a support group for other people who had travelled with the Doctor, including Yaz, Ian Chesterton, Jo Jones, Tegan Jovanka, Melanie Bush, Ace and Kate Stewart. (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).)\n\nGraham believed if you wanted to know something, you just had to ask a bus driver. He was also wary about rushing into danger. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).)\n\nHe seemed upset and hurt that Ryan refused to call him \"granddad\". (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018)., The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) However, he was elated when Ryan finally referred to him as such. (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nCompassionate and against racism, Graham was greatly distressed by his inability to help Rosa Parks from her destined arrest in 1955, not wanting to be party to such an act. Previously, he fiercely defended Ryan when he was threatened by a white man, openly calling Ryan his grandson. (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) He was equally against sexism, often having to work at the Doctor's proxy in intolerant societies. (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018)., TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nAfter Grace's death, Graham grieved by talking about her, viewing it better to talk than stay silent as Ryan preferred. (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Despite his peaceful demeanour, Graham occasionally grew angry at Ryan for his apathy to Grace's killer and even advocated firearms when consumed by rage, (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) even though he usually displayed contempt for them. (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nStruggling to move on from losing her, Graham believed he could find solace by travelling with the Doctor rather than waiting for his grief to consume him while surrounded by memories of Grace in their home. (TV: Arachnids in the UK [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) By the time he met the Solitract's version of her, Graham had come to terms with her passing, knowing Ryan still needed him. (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Graham was so distraught with losing Grace that he resolved to kill Tzim-Sha, nearly allowing his emotions to overcome him when facing the Stenza. However, when finally given the chance to kill him, Graham chose not to, desiring to be \"the better man\" as he believed Grace would have wanted. (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nGraham often said wisecracks whenever faced with the Doctor's eccentricities or dangerous situations. Notably, he quoted Quentin Tarantino to King James I as if it were an actual line of scripture. (TV: The Witchfinders [+]Joy Wilkinson, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nWhile first sceptical of the Thirteenth Doctor's title, (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, BBCA, Space and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2018).) Graham grew to use the name, though commonly chose to refer to her informally as \"Doc\", rather than 'Doctor' like Yaz and Ryan; regardless, the Doctor never vocally corrected him. (TV: The Ghost Monument [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., et al.)\n\nGraham became grumpy when his blood sugar was low. (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Because the Doctor often did not permit snack breaks during adventures, (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Graham always made sure to have a sandwich with him when he left the TARDIS. (TV: It Takes You Away [+]Ed Hime, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nWhen he and Ryan did something successful together, Graham raised his hand for a fist bump only for Ryan to reject as it was \"uncool\". (TV: Rosa [+]Malorie Blackman and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018)., The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).) Although, to Graham's surprise, Ryan eventually returned the gesture. (TV: The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nGraham also once mentioned that he enjoyed solving crosswords. (PROSE: Time Lapse [+]Naomi Alderman, Thirteen Doctors, 13 Stories (Puffin eshort, Puffin Books, 2019).)\n\nHe was clumsy with the psychic paper, (TV: The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).) just as Rose and Jack had been with it, (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) however he once joked that he was the fastest card dealer in South Yorkshire. (TV: Can You Hear Me? [+]Charlene James and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)\n\nUpon seeing a stained glass window which depicted Graham, the Thirteenth Doctor said that it was \"either [Graham] or him from the gameshow\". (PROSE: The Good Doctor [+]Juno Dawson, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2018).) Whilst mistaking Graham for the Doctor, Jack Harkness made note of his grey hair at the temple which he loved, adding that he was \"kind of distinguished yet still sexy.\" (TV: Fugitive of the Judoon [+]Vinay Patel and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).)",
