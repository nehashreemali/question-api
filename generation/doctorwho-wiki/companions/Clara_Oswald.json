  "content": "Clara Oswald was a companion of the Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors. On several occasions, while the \"real\" Doctor was absent or incapacitated, she assumed the mantle, promise and name of \"the Doctor\", with the Twelfth Doctor acknowledging on one of these occasions that she \"made a mighty fine Doctor\".\n\nAccording to the Doctor, she was \"impossible\" due to their meetings previously in his personal timeline, with two such encounters where he saw her die. Though assured by the empathic psychic Emma Grayling and the TARDIS scanner that Clara was just an \"ordinary girl\", the Doctor couldn't believe that to be true and thought her to be \"the only mystery worth solving\".\n\nWhile a physically ordinary human woman from the 21st century, Clara chose to enter the Doctor's timeline in his tomb on Trenzalore in order to try to reverse the damage done to his timeline by the Great Intelligence. This caused the time winds to shatter her into millions of what River Song referred to as \"echoes\" or \"splinters\" that were dispersed throughout his personal timeline. These echoes corrected the damage caused by the Great Intelligence but were not the original Clara. She was trapped in the Doctor's time stream but rescued shortly thereafter.\n\nAfter Trenzalore, Clara became a school teacher, though she still travelled with the Doctor, meeting the Doctor's War and Tenth incarnations. She was with him when he regenerated into his twelfth incarnation, having encouraged the Time Lords to grant him a new regenerative cycle and continued to travel with him thereafter.\n\nClara later met and fell in love with fellow schoolteacher Danny Pink. However, she lied to him about giving up her travels with the Doctor; only to lose him to a car accident, and again to Missy despite her best efforts to bring him back.\n\nAfter the loss of Danny, Clara became less attached to Earth and began to copy the heroic aspects of the Doctor's persona; this caused her to become increasingly reckless, as she believed he would always have a plan.\n\nClara's heroics eventually cost her greatly. While trying to prove Rigsy's innocence of a false murder accusation she took a Chronolock, which killed the one branded, from him. The Raven, who was originally set to kill Rigsy, killed her instead. She was later extracted from her own fixed point of death in her timeline by the Doctor using an extraction chamber on Gallifrey. In her resurrected form, Clara had none of the usual aspects of the living, such as breathing, having a pulse or even ageing, instead being stuck \"between one heartbeat and the next\".\n\nThe Doctor then stole a TARDIS and escaped Gallifrey, travelling to the end of the universe in an attempt to fully bring Clara back, proving to be ineffective, however. The Doctor planned to wipe Clara's memory of ever travelling with him, yet instead, in a turn of events, the Doctor lost his memories of Clara. She then left in the other TARDIS, planning to use it to travel \"the long way round\" back to Gallifrey, with Ashildr and Willa Twiston for company.\n\nClara was born in Blackpool (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) on 23 November (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) 1986 (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) to Dave and Ellie Oswald. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She liked to receive travel books and science kits for Christmas rather than hair products (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) and loved attending Sunday school, which was taught by a \"nice lady teacher\" in a small church room that smelt of oak polish and had felt-tip colouring on the walls. (PROSE: Into the Nowhere [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Ellie told her not to speak to strange men, advice which she ignored. (WC: The Bells of Saint John: A Prequel [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who episode prequels series 7 (BBC, 2013).)\n\nAs a child, Clara visited many National Trust houses (AUDIO: The House of Winter [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and went to the Blackpool Tower circus with her grandmother. (PROSE: All the Empty Towers [+]Jenny T. Colgan, The Scientific Secrets of Doctor Who (2015).) Her role model was Amy Johnson, whom she learnt about at school, (COMIC: A Wing and a Prayer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and she always wanted to meet Robin Hood. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She was once stung by a wasp. (PROSE: The Crawling Terror [+]Mike Tucker, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) She met the Eleventh Doctor when she accidentally kicked a football at his head in a park whilst she was with her parents, after which Dave remarked that she wanted to be Bryan Robson. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara often lost things, including her \"best pencil\", her school bag, her grandmother and her mojo, which she managed to get back. Whenever she lost something, she would go to a quiet place, close her eyes and remember where she left it. (WC: The Bells of Saint John: A Prequel [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who episode prequels series 7 (BBC, 2013).) Her worst fear was getting lost herself and she had a number of nightmares about it. On a bank holiday Monday when she was about six, she got lost on Blackpool Beach and was eventually found by her mother. They then went for fish and chips and returned home where Ellie told Clara that she would always find her. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara met the Eleventh Doctor a second time, earlier in his timeline, in a park and advised him to go somewhere quiet to think about how to find his lost friend instead of waiting for destiny, both of them being unaware that it was her that he was looking for. (WC: The Bells of Saint John: A Prequel [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who episode prequels series 7 (BBC, 2013).) He followed her advice. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nDave took Clara to a restaurant with a glass floor at the top of a tower block near Southport when she was nine. Although he assured her that the floor was \"safe as houses\", she was scared when two boys started jumping up and down on the glass, swearing and shouting that they were going to break it, and she remained nervous about heights and glass floors afterwards. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She also stopped believing in Santa Claus at the same age, later explaining that she was growing out of fairy tales. (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nEllie read to Clara from her copy of 101 Places to See. When Clara was nine, she wrote her own name inside the book and updated it with her age over the years. Inside of it was kept the leaf that blew into Dave's face on the day that he and Ellie met, (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) which she would later refer to as \"page 1\". (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara attended St Mary's School and played on the rugby team. (COMIC: Unearthly Things [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) In 2001, at the age of fourteen, she let the leaf blow away in the wind in frustration after her mother told her she could not stay over a friend's following a Halloween party. She met the Doctor again at the party and they briefly ventured to an alien forest where a wolf guided her to the leaf before they returned to Earth. Having been aiming for Clara during her time as his companion, the Doctor wiped her memory of the adventure to preserve the timeline. (PROSE: Clara Oswald and the Enchanted Forest [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nClara passed her driving test on her first try. (COMIC: The Fractures [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) She was able to ride a motorcycle. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) Although she was not always successful, she enjoyed making soufflés and followed the recipe used by her mother, who told her that the soufflé was the recipe rather than the soufflé itself. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nOn 5 March 2005, Ellie died. Taking 101 Places to See with her, Clara visited Ellie's grave with her father, unaware that the Eleventh Doctor was watching her from a distance. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She was angry following her mother's death. (AUDIO: The Gods of Winter [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She wore her mother's ring, which was precious to her, (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and remembered her as a great woman. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She went on to graduate from university. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara was among the billions of people across the world who briefly became part of the Master Race circa the 2000s.[nb 1] (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) She once found a second-hand book in a shop with a dedication reading, \"There's no larger responsibility than great potential\", a phrase which stuck with her and made her want to look after children. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 2012, Clara planned to go travelling and went to stay with family friends George Maitland and his wife for a week before she departed. George's wife died during her stay and she decided to halt her plans to travel in favour of helping George by becoming Angie and Artie's nanny, (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) inspired by the phrase she read in the second-hand book. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She told George that she would help for as long as she was needed and intended on going travelling once that was no longer the case. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara had a poor knowledge of the internet. While attempting to log on to the Wi-Fi in the Maitland home, she used a mnemonic device, \"Run you clever boy and remember\", to help her recall the Wi-Fi password, rycbar123. She phoned a number for technical support, given to her by a woman in a shop, that reached the Eleventh Doctor in the year 1207. Perplexed, she believed that he was on a helpline, and so she requested that he go to her to help her figure out how to use the Internet.\n\nHe attempted to assist her, but Clara clicked on the Wi-Fi connection being used by the Great Intelligence to harvest human minds. A Spoonhead, adopting the guise of a character from Summer Falls, a novel she read, uploaded her to the data cloud. The process was incomplete when the Doctor found her, allowing him to restore her. Clara found that her technical knowledge was greatly enhanced as a result of this.\n\nShe used this new skill to hack the Great Intelligence's operatives, choosing \"Oswin\" as a username. She discovered their location in the Shard, before she was downloaded again by a Spoonhead, this time successfully. The Doctor had the entire cloud downloaded back where possible, restoring Clara once more. He invited her to come with him and she told him to return the next day and ask again. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhen the Doctor returned for her, Clara was waiting eagerly. She rushed to meet the TARDIS outside the moment the Doctor knocked on her door. When the Doctor asked her where she wanted to go, she was stuck at first. She quickly recovered, replying \"somewhere awesome\". He took her to the Festival of Offerings near Akhaten.\n\nThere, they explored the markets and watched the festival. When Merry Gejelh, whom Clara had comforted and encouraged to sing the Long Song at the Festival, was taken by the Mummy, Clara and the Doctor saved her. In doing so, Clara had to give up her mother's ring, which had extreme sentimental value to her. To destroy Akhaten, she was forced to sacrifice something even more precious: the leaf that brought her parents together, \"the most important leaf in human history\". After saving everyone on the planet, they thanked her by returning her ring. After the trip, the Doctor dropped her back off at her house in London, which she remarked looked different. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor later took her on another trip, but instead of landing in Las Vegas as planned, they landed on the Firebird, a Soviet submarine at the North Pole in 1983. While the Doctor brought the sinking submarine to safety, the TARDIS activated its Hostile Action Displacement System and it dematerialised, leaving the Doctor and Clara on the submarine.\n\nThey quickly found that the Ice Warrior Grand Marshall, Skaldak, had been brought on board. The Doctor attempted to convince the submarine's crew to be peaceful to him, but Lieutenant Stepashin stunned Skaldak with a cattle prod. The Doctor ordered the crew to imprison Skaldak; Clara was sent to try and talk some sense into him, under the Doctor's guidance, but discovered Skaldak had managed to escape his capture and threatened to launch the submarine's nuclear missiles. The Doctor and Clara managed to make him hesitate his decision, and Skaldak and the submarine were rescued by an Ice Warrior ship. Skaldak left and remotely disarmed the submarine. The Doctor then confessed to setting the HADS, and found that it had sent the TARDIS to the South Pole; he had to ask the submarine captain for a lift, much to Clara's amusement. (TV: Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAt some point, Clara went to Baghdad in 1930 with the Doctor, where she met and befriended Amy Johnson. After an adventure, Clara bade a sad farewell to Amy, knowing that she wouldn't see Amy again until Amy's death. She soon found a loophole in that her body was never found and, thus, as Amy was drowning a few years later, the TARDIS materialised around her. The Doctor and Clara took Amy to Cornucopia. (COMIC: A Wing and a Prayer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nLater, the Doctor took Clara to Caliburn House, the home of Major Alec Palmer, which was thought to have been haunted by the \"Witch of the Well\" for many years. Unknown to Clara, he took her there to speak to the psychic Emma Grayling and find out what Clara was. The Doctor took lots of photographs of the ghost throughout Earth's timeline. The Doctor used his photographs to explain that the \"ghost\" was, in fact, a time traveller from the future called Hila Tacorien, who was trapped in a pocket universe and being chased by the Crooked Man. The Doctor used a crystal from Metebelis III to make Emma open up the portal to the pocket universe. Whilst there he saved Hila but got trapped himself; Clara argued with the TARDIS voice interface when the TARDIS would not let her in, Clara wanting to use the TARDIS to save the Doctor while the TARDIS was concerned for its own safety.\n\nLater, after revealing that Hila was a distant relative of Alec and Emma, the Doctor realised that the \"Crooked Man\" in the pocket universe was trying to get to another creature in the house, so he and Clara went back to pick it up. (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhile the Doctor was out, the TARDIS demonstrated her antagonism toward Clara by deleting her bedroom and creating a holographic leopard while she was in the bathroom. It also created multiple versions of Clara simply to annoy her. (HOMEVID: Clara and the TARDIS [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) After this, he and Clara made an arrangement: he would pick her up every Wednesday and they would have adventures, but unlike his previous companions, she wouldn't travel aboard the TARDIS on a permanent basis as she had responsibilities on Earth of being a nanny. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhile trying to teach Clara how to operate the TARDIS, the time machine was caught in a magnetic hobble-field from a space salvage ship, operated by the Van Baalen Bros. A future version of the Doctor arrived through a time rift, throwing his present self a magno-grab remote with \"BIG FRIENDLY BUTTON\" branded into it to stop the ship's magno-grab. After the Doctor pressed the button, the TARDIS disappeared, escaping the Van Baalens and preventing its engine failure. The Doctor said aloud to Clara that two days had been compressed into the space of one. The Doctor asked Clara if she felt safe travelling with him, and after a long conversation, she admitted that she did.\n\nIn an alternate timeline, however, the TARDIS was successfully captured by the Van Baalen Bros., causing the TARDIS to leak the past and future. In the confusion, the Doctor made it out of the TARDIS, while Clara ended up lost inside, her hand burnt by the scorching metal of a magno-grab remote that had mysteriously appeared in the TARDIS and rolled towards her shortly before she was separated from the Doctor. Inside, she travelled through the TARDIS' rooms, running away from a time zombie threatening to harm her. She eventually arrived in the TARDIS library and hid there. She read a book called The History of the Time War, and found out the Doctor's true name.\n\nShe kept travelling inside the TARDIS, eventually arriving in an echo of the control room. She was pulled through to another echo room and reunited with the Doctor, meeting Bram and Tricky Van Baalen. The Doctor switched off the countdown to the TARDIS's non-existent self-destruct sequence but realised that the magno-grab had caused the engine to start malfunctioning. On the way to the \"centre of the TARDIS\", the four kept running from the time zombies and reached the Cloister Room, where they found out what the time zombies really were: them. The Doctor managed to trick the time zombies and make them fall to their deaths inside the Eye of Harmony. The Doctor and Clara ran to the heart of the TARDIS. There, the Doctor told Clara about her uniqueness, and about her multiple lives and deaths.\n\nThe Doctor found that the burn marks on Clara's hand had formed words: \"BIG FRIENDLY BUTTON\". The Doctor then realised they needed to go back to the point of the disaster and activate the magno-grab remote, which had caused the burn marks on Clara's hand before, to stop the field and prevent the disaster. The Doctor passed through a time rift to give the device to his past self, who successfully activated it, undoing the damage to the engine and making Clara forget about the Doctor's name. The Doctor did not want Clara to go searching for his name, because an important secret was connected to it. (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) This adventure, although negated, was later recalled by Clara when the TARDIS leaked time energy. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara travelled to 1893 Yorkshire and reached a new little town, Sweetville, run by Winifred Gillyflower and her mysterious partner. While investigating the town, the two were taken by Gillyflower's guards into a creepy dungeon, where they were lowered down into a strange red liquid — known locally as \"the Crimson Horror\". Clara was successfully preserved by the matter and was placed with another survivor into a glass dome in one of the Sweetville houses, awaiting the next part of Mrs Gillyflower's insane plan. After Jenny Flint rescued the Doctor from being held by Ada Gillyflower in an almost catatonic condition, they eventually found Clara. The Doctor broke the glass, took Clara out and pulled her out of her \"puppet\" condition. Clara, the Doctor and Jenny set off to finally defeat Mrs Gillyflower in a tower in the town; Gillyflower, along with her mysterious partner — the repulsive red leech, Mr Sweet — planned to fire a rocket that would spread the \"Crimson Horror\" all around the world, wiping humanity out except for those preserved by being lowered into the liquid. Clara broke a chair on Mrs Gillyflower's control console preventing her from triggering the rocket. After the Crimson Horror was safely removed from the rocket, Mrs Gillyflower threatened to kill the Doctor and Clara anyway. She was shot by Strax and fell to the ground, suffering fatal injuries. Mrs Gillyflower died and Mr Sweet was also killed by Mrs Gillyflower's daughter, Ada.\n\nThe Doctor brought Clara back to the 21st century to the Maitland family house. Angie and Artie, the children she looked after, found photos from her adventures with the Doctor on her laptop and found out that she was a time traveller. When going through the photos, Clara saw one of her past lives, Clara Oswald, in Victorian London. Realising that both her physical appearance and where the picture took place in was different, Clara began to suspect something wasn't right. Before she could process the thought entirely, the kids begged her to take them to an adventure, or else they would tell their father that their nanny was a time traveller. Clara, lacking any other choice, agreed. (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor took Clara, Artie and Angie to the abandoned theme park, Hedgewick's World of Wonders, where Angie and Artie were taken by weapons-grade Cybermen, who had been reawakened from their tombs after being presumed long-extinct. The Doctor put Clara in charge of the punishment platoon to fight the Cybermen and began a game of chess to end the stalemate over his mind with the Cyber-Planner, Mr Clever.\n\nThe Doctor released the children in exchange for one of his chess pieces and pulled in the \"local resources\" to stop the Cybermen. The missing Emperor, Ludens Nimrod Kendrick Cord Longstaff XLI, revealed himself as having been their short-statured friend Porridge and activated the planet-destroying bomb. This summoned his spaceship, transmatting the humans on Hedgewick's World to safety while the Cybermen were left behind on Hedgewick's World. Porridge proposed to Clara, but she declined. The Doctor returned Clara, Angie and Artie home. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara visited Tickle Town with the Doctor and was trapped in a roller coaster. She eventually escaped in the TARDIS. (COMIC: Welcome to Tickle Town [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nTogether, they met the King of Bones, (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and visited the avocado seas of Venofax, where they visited an archaeological dig. While the Doctor enjoyed himself, Clara quickly got bored and pressed some buttons on the archaeologists' equipment, accidentally turning off the barrier keeping the site from being flooded by the avocado seas. Nobody got hurt, but the entire expedition was ruined and everyone got wet.\n\nAfter leaving Venofax, Clara changed into dry clothes in the TARDIS. When she came out, the Doctor had landed in Dallas in 1963. Clara and the Doctor discovered a parasite called the Shroud which was feeding off of the grief of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. After allying with some clowns from the planet Semtis, the Doctor took the Shroud to Venofax and trapped it there. (PROSE: Shroud of Sorrow [+]Tommy Donbavand, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2013).)\n\nSometime later, whilst at home with Angie and Artie, Clara received a letter from Vastra laced with a soporific that took her into a \"conference call\". There, she learnt that the murderer Clarence DeMarco had said \"The Doctor has a secret, you know. He has one he will take to the grave. And it is discovered,\" and showed Vastra the co-ordinates to where the Doctor's tomb was. The call was interrupted by the Whisper Men attempting to murder Jenny. River woke up Vastra and Strax, and the Great Intelligence appeared, using the face of Walter Simeon, to tell Clara that to save his friends, the Doctor had to come to Trenzalore - the place of his grave. When she woke up from the conference, River stayed connected. Using the telepathic circuits to get the co-ordinates, the Doctor and Clara went to Trenzalore, crossing the Doctor's timeline. The Great Intelligence was waiting there and wished to enter the tomb of the Doctor, a future, decaying version of the TARDIS.\n\nEntering the decaying TARDIS through a hidden passageway, Clara began to remember the events of a deleted timeline, in which the Doctor told her about her multiple lives, causing her to panic slightly. They eventually made their way to the Doctor's tomb, where the Great Intelligence demanded the Doctor tell him his true name. When he refused, River uttered it, and the door opened. Inside the tomb, the Intelligence entered the Doctor's timeline, rewriting his history, changing all his victories into losses. The universe began decaying, all the people and civilisations saved by the Doctor now destroyed. With no other choice, Clara did what she was meant to do; saying, \"Run. Run you clever boy, and remember me\", she walked into the timeline as well, scattering herself across time and space. This action projected her across time, creating many other versions of her that saved the Doctor time and time again, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) ultimately weakening the Great Intelligence so much that it was forced to jump to the Brigadier's time stream instead where Clara couldn't follow it. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).) Meanwhile, the Eleventh Doctor decided to jump into the timeline as well in order to save her. Hearing the Doctor's comforting voice, she approached him. As they were just about to leave, Clara noticed an incarnation of the Doctor that she'd never met. This version was the only one to break the promise of the name \"the Doctor\". However, the stress of the experience caused Clara to faint, so she didn't find out anything more about this incarnation. Clara and the Eleventh Doctor then departed, with the mysterious Doctor watching them leave. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAfter she escaped the Doctor's timeline, Clara could only remember bits and pieces of her echoes' lives. Some memories were more vivid, others she only recalled as dreams. (PROSE: Into the Nowhere [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHanging out into space from the TARDIS, Clara and the Doctor found a Tonnchenform, similar to Earth tardigrades. The Doctor told Clara that because the space between galaxies was so big, they were rarely seen, but each of the billions of macroscopic creatures out there were beautiful and unique, just like the trillions of microscopic ones on Earth. Soon after, they went on an adventure involving a dinner with alien robots, a small jewel-encrusted seashell stolen by Bozzi the Mysterio, and a chase across the snowscapes of Halas Four. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter the two had ended the Frogman civil war, they were assaulted by Adam Mitchell who abducted Clara and placed her, along with all of the Doctor's other companions, in a suspended animation chamber. (COMIC: The Choice [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) The companions were soon freed by Frobisher to fight off the Tremas Master's Auton army, with the Doctor delighting in introducing Clara to Amy Pond and Rory Williams before Adam sacrificed himself to thwart the Master's plan. Along with the other companions, Clara attended Adam's funeral before she and the Doctor resumed their travels. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nAs a result of an accident caused by his fiddling with the TARDIS' telepathic circuits, the Doctor was left with the majority of his vast memory wiped as he and Clara were preparing to go on holiday. Using the Twelve Hundred Year Diary, Clara helped him remember his life. The Doctor lamented that it was easier not remembering the people he had lost over the years, but Clara reassured him that he was a man who never ran from danger and had helped save billions of lives. Cheered up, the Doctor put the TARDIS into flight as they proceeded to their holiday. (TV: The History of the Doctor [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who (BBC Three, 2013).)\n\nOne day, Clara awoke in a darkened and abandoned TARDIS, discovering herself to be in a spatial loop. Finding a button with a note that read \"Do Not Touch\", Clara decided that it was reverse psychology and pressed it, plummeting into a white void where she was rescued by the Sky Jack and taken to Tipperary Station, a meeting point of several alien scavengers, where she reunited with the Doctor, who had been there for three years from his perspective. As the two conversed, the Doctor came to the realisation that they were still in the TARDIS, within an old console room whose preparations had been comically exaggerated. Arriving at the console, the Doctor explained that this was the machinations of \"the Hypothetical Gentelman\", a disembodied entity that resided within the TARDIS' Matrix that the Doctor presumed to be a digital copy of a Time Lord tyrant, only for the being to reveal that it was the Matrix. After the Matrix explained how it became sentient, Clara, knowing that the Doctor was telepathically linked to the Matrix, took the initiative and stowed away on its craft, sabotaging it before the Matrix could cross the wormhole into the wider universe. The delay was enough for the Doctor to reset the TARDIS and trap the Matrix in a never ending wormhole. After the aliens had all been returned home, Clara and the Doctor joined the crew of the Sky Jack at VJ Day in the Hawaii. (COMIC: Sky Jacks [+]Andy Diggle and Eddie Robson, Doctor Who (2012) (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor later took Clara to Deadwood in 1882 where they crossed paths with Oscar Wilde and ran afoul of the Doctor's old foe Es'Cartrss who had put Earth on trial. As Clara worked with Calamity Jane, they discovered that Wild Bill Hickok and many others were being resurrected. After thwarting this scheme, the two went off to Shoreditch. (COMIC: Dead Man's Hand [+]Tony Lee, Doctor Who (2012) (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nAfter a particularly stressful day of nannying, the Doctor took Clara to Cui Palta to relax only for both to fall victim to the psychic pollen of the local flowers, hallucinating an elaborate maze before Clara deduced the truth. Despite the danger, Clara was left exhilarated by the experience. (PROSE: Clara and the Maze of Cui Palta [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nClara studied to become a teacher whilst living with the Maitlands (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and met and befriended Christel Dean, another aspiring teacher. (COMIC: Clara Oswald and the School of Death [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) Her travels with the Doctor got in the way of her studies, but she managed to qualify (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and remained in contact with Christel afterwards. (COMIC: Clara Oswald and the School of Death [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nClara was offered a job at Coal Hill School as an English teacher and accepted it as George Maitland was dealing with Angie and Artie well enough on his own. As she was newly-qualified, she accepted that there could be some truth in Angie and Artie's teasing remarks about the Doctor having been behind her getting the job, but she chose to believe that it was at least partly on her own merit. When she started at the school, she asked the Doctor to leave her to live a normal life for a while. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn Clara's first day, she lost control of the class and threatened to have them all expelled, but Courtney Woods called her bluff by telling her to go through with it. This made her realise that she should never start with her final sanction. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Although Courtney challenged her more often than any of the other students, Clara found it hard to stay made at her because of her apparent lack of any real malice. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She befriended colleague Adrian Davies, (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) whom she once had a confusing conversation with about South American authors (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and whom she did not consider to be her type despite his resemblance to the Doctor. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nIn one particular lesson, Clara decided to switch things up, declaring that \"normal is overrated\", and brought her English class outside to teach them about tardigrades in an attempt to give them a glimpse into the wonders of the universe. Once they got settled on the grass, she instructed them to look up at the sky for ten seconds, then to shut their eyes, count to five, open them again and tell her what they saw. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) At some point, she took tae kwon do lessons with the Year Sevens after school. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nAfter more than six weeks, (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor contacted Coal Hill with the address of where he had landed the TARDIS and she rendezvoused with him. The TARDIS was airlifted by UNIT to the National Gallery where Clara met Kate Stewart and consoled the Doctor when he was reminded of the Last Great Time War. She travelled with a Zygon impersonating Kate Stewart to the Black Archive unaware that the scientific leader of UNIT was being impersonated. Using the code scraped into the wall of the Tower of London, Clara activated Captain Jack Harkness' vortex manipulator and escaped the menacing Zygons by travelling to 1562. There, she met the War Doctor, Tenth Doctor and Queen Elizabeth I and attended the wedding of the latter two.\n\nShe was inserted into the Gallifreyan stasis cube Gallifrey Falls No More with the Doctors to surreptitiously re-enter the Black Archive in the 21st century. When the War Doctor left for his own time to activate the Moment, Clara told the two remaining Doctors that she could see in his eyes that the ending of the Time War was still in the earlier incarnation's future. She travelled through the Time Lock with the Doctors and begged them to reconsider when they decided to cause the genocide together. They took this advice to heart. She was therefore present when the Doctor changed history as he remembered it, and saved Gallifrey instead of destroying it. Back on Earth, she briefly met the mysterious Curator, unaware that anything was extraordinary about him. She bade farewell to the past Doctors, and kissed her Doctor on the cheek; when the Doctor asked how she knew he needed time alone with the painting, she told him, \"I always know.\" Clara visited the Black Archive twice, but only had a memory of visiting once. As a result of the visit that she did not remember, she already had security access during the visit she did remember. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nOn her travels with the Doctor, Clara was attacked by a mind parasite that was dubbed Waites. Waites caused Clara to live a horrible life where she lost her job and all her money but she retained enough awareness to seek out the Doctor, who called himself \"John Smith\" within the shared dream, only for him to turn her away. Eventually Clara managed to shatter the illusion, seconds after the Doctor, whereupon she physically attacked the parasite for the hell it had subjected her to before she and the Doctor ripped its avatars off its other victims, killing it. As the two walked away, the Doctor theorised that Clara's self awareness was the result of her having lived multiple lives. Clara smiled that the lack of Doctor was probably what had tipped her off that something was amiss. (COMIC: John Smith and the Common Men [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nClara visited the Obsidian Mainframe and attended the auction for various creatures. She was with the Doctor when the TARDIS was sold, and the Doctor gained a lot of money. They were then forced to travel \"the normal way\" to the Cornucopia's airport, where Amy Johnson lived. (COMIC: Pay the Piper [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., The Blood of Azrael [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nNeeding a fake boyfriend as she cooked Christmas dinner for her family, Clara called the Doctor twice while he was orbiting a planet surrounded by the universe's most dangerous enemies. She convinced him to come but was shocked to find him naked, which he fixed for her by putting a holographic filter on her. Clara introduced him to her family, who saw him naked because he hadn't put the filter on them. Learning from Handles that the planet was apparently Gallifrey, Clara and the Doctor travelled there. When the Papal Mainframe arrived, the Doctor made Clara swallow a holographic projector to generate holographic clothes around her. Once on board, they met Tasha Lem who agreed to teleport the two to the planet's surface. There, Clara and the Doctor were surrounded by Weeping Angels.\n\nThe Doctor pulled a secret key out of the wig he was wearing and summoned the TARDIS, saving them both. Dressed in proper clothes again, he then flew the TARDIS to the nearby town of Christmas, where they learnt that the town was surrounded in a truth field. Searching for the source of the transmission, the two found a crack in time, and the Doctor realised that it was the Time Lords trying to return to the universe. The Doctor then explained that if he said his real name the Time Lords would return but all hell would then break loose. After learning from Tasha Lem that the planet was Trenzalore, the Doctor had Clara return to the TARDIS. In the TARDIS, Clara inserted a device the Doctor gave her and was returned home, but grabbed onto the TARDIS as it dematerialised again.\n\nClara returned to Trenzalore three hundred years after she left and found the Doctor middle-aged. The Doctor had been defending Trenzalore from the various threats besieging the planet and revealed to Clara that he had used up all of his regenerations and this would be the end of him. Clara begged him to let someone else take up the job of protecting the planet, but the Doctor refused. Clara watched the planet's brief sunrise with him, during which Handles ceased functioning and the two were invited by Tasha to return to the Papal Mainframe.\n\nThere, Clara and the Doctor were led into a trap, as the Daleks had already taken over the Mainframe and converted everyone, including Tasha, into Dalek puppets. When the Doctor threatened to release the Time Lords if the Daleks tried to kill him, Tasha took Clara hostage, and the Doctor claimed not to care if she died. Bravely, Clara declared she would die anyway. Using Clara as an example of bravery, the Doctor helped Tasha regain control of herself and she teleported them back to the planet after disposing of the Daleks.\n\nThe Doctor and Clara returned to the TARDIS where they found Clara's turkey cooked, and after promising never to send her away again, he tricked her into returning home once more. As a grief-stricken Clara celebrated Christmas dinner with her family, she had her grandmother repeat the story of how she fell for her grandfather and was relieved to hear the TARDIS returning for her again, grabbing a Christmas cracker to take to the Doctor. To her surprise, Clara discovered Tasha piloting the TARDIS, and Tasha returned her to Trenzalore sometime further into the future after she left, telling her to go find the Doctor.\n\nUpon reuniting with the Doctor, Clara found him very old and weak. While they sat together, Clara opened the cracker and read the poem inside. When the Daleks demanded his surrender, he agreed but asked Clara to remain behind for her own safety. Desperate to change the future, Clara pleaded to the Time Lords for help through the crack. To her surprise, the crack snapped shut disappeared.\n\nClara watched tearfully as the Doctor stood on top of Christmas' Clock Tower and surrendered to the Daleks, prepared to die at last. As the Daleks hesitated and the Doctor goaded them on, the Time Lords granted the Doctor a new regenerative cycle. To Clara's relief, the Doctor began to regenerate, using the explosive force of his regeneration energy to destroy the Daleks. When the dust cleared, there was no sign of the Doctor, so Clara checked the TARDIS where she found him restored to his youthful self. However, the Doctor told her that he would still regenerate.\n\nShe implored him not to change but despite her pleas, the Doctor suddenly regenerated into a new, older incarnation who left Clara confused by staring at her face to face, and then making comments about his new kidneys. The TARDIS suddenly began crashing, and to Clara's horror, the new Doctor asked her if she knew how to pilot the TARDIS, having apparently forgotten how to do so himself. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAfter crashing in prehistoric times, the new Doctor and Clara were chased by a Tyrannosaurus rex. They managed to escape into the TARDIS, which the dinosaur then swallowed. The TARDIS then relocated to Victorian London, bringing the dinosaur with them, which spat out the time machine onto the banks of the Thames after choking on it. The Doctor, suffering from severe post-regenerative confusion, stepped out and met Madame Vastra, Jenny, and Strax, joined by an equally befuddled Clara, before collapsing. Back at Paternoster Row, the Doctor was put to bed to recover. Vastra confronted Clara over her prejudiced attitude to the Doctor's new face, and Clara admitted that it was a big change for her. Upstairs, the Doctor escaped his room and attempted to communicate with the dinosaur in the Thames, when it suddenly burst into flames. Clara and the Gang left separately and ended up right next to him. The Doctor, still rather confused, disappeared into the Thames.\n\nThe next morning, Clara found a newspaper advertisement that called her the \"Impossible Girl\" and invited her to \"dinner on the other side\"... of the page, which turned out to be an advert for Mancini's Family Restaurant. Believing it was a message planted by the Doctor, Clara travelled to the restaurant and indeed found the Doctor there, though he denied leaving the message. Clara and the Doctor were taken down to the restaurant \"larder\" so that the droids could harvest their organs. After being separated from the Doctor, the Half-Face Man interrogated her with threats of death, but remembering what happened when she had unsuccessfully threatened her rebellious students, dared him to, calling him on his bluff and saying that if the new Doctor was really the Doctor, he'd save her. The Doctor suddenly revealed himself. She and the Doctor called the Paternoster Gang into action, and they began fighting off the droids. The Half-Face Man escaped, but the Doctor followed. Clara and the Gang seemed to be overpowered by the droids, but before they could be killed they all suddenly deactivated.\n\nClara and the Gang returned to Paternoster Row, finding that the Doctor and the TARDIS had vanished. Clara prepared to ask for a vacancy, believing the Doctor wouldn't come back. However, he did, and Clara happily ran to the TARDIS. Inside, she was surprised to find the Doctor, like his predecessors, had renovated the control room. He affirmed to Clara he was not her boyfriend. Still having great trouble dealing with the sudden changes to the Doctor's regenerated self, Clara showed trepidation to continue travelling with him when the TARDIS landed on Earth. Clara's phone started ringing. Stepping outside, Clara answered the phone and was shocked to hear the voice of the Eleventh Doctor. He told her he was calling from Trenzalore before he had finished regenerating. He told her the new Doctor would be just as scared after the change as she would be and urged her to help him, with the two of them finally exchanging a belated goodbye. This call finally convinced Clara to accept the new Doctor, and she gave him a big hug, despite him protesting he was no longer a \"hugging person\". The two then realised that instead of Clara's home, they had landed in Glasgow, and they set off to get coffee. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nWhen the Doctor failed to return with the coffee, Clara returned to her teaching duties. Mr Armitage introduced her to a new maths teacher, Danny Pink, and following an awkward conversation, asked each other out. Clara returned to her office and found the Doctor with the coffee. The Doctor told her he needed her help and brought her aboard the TARDIS. He asked her if he was \"a good man\", but she told him she didn't know.\n\nAboard a ship called the Aristotle (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) in the Ryzak solar system, (PROSE: The Secret Lives of Monsters [+]Justin Richards, BBC Books (2014).) Clara and the Doctor joined a team to be shrunk and deposited into a malfunctioning Dalek called \"Rusty\". The shrunken Doctor and Clara entered Rusty through its eyestalk in order to determine how it became good and attempt to repair the Dalek so that it could help the efforts of the resistance. When the Doctor's repairing of Rusty caused it to kill several of the Aristotle's soldiers, Clara entered the Dalek's memory banks and allowed the Doctor to link minds with it, causing it to turn against its kind and order a nearby Dalek ship to retreat. After this Clara and the Doctor returned to their normal size. The Doctor then returned Clara to Coal Hill School, again asking if he was a good man. Again she admitted she didn't know but pointed out that he tried to be, which was what really counted. Back at Coal Hill, she met up with Danny again, agreeing to go on a date with him and insisting she had nothing against soldiers. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara later gave the Doctor some chips who proceeded to ramble about how great they tasted. (COMIC: Untitled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) In return, the Doctor attempted to get a reservation at a restaurant on Calbaron III in 5083, only to learn that there was a three year wait. They booked and went three years to the future, only to learn the restaurant was closed to celebrate the third anniversary of the overthrowing of the tyrannical emperor Vimlox. After briefly returning to 5083, and seeing their future selves enjoying a meal, the two made for 5080 to make a reservation. Before they left, the Doctor found that the tyrannical emperor had scratched his TARDIS and promptly overthrew him, resulting in the anniversary. (COMIC: Planet of the Diners [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor repaired the scratch on the TARDIS, but found that the damage had caused time within the TARDIS to temporarily run backwards, much to Clara's annoyance when she tried to converse with him. (COMIC: The Inversion of Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor later used his uncertainty about what sort of person he was to have Clara do various chores around the TARDIS, though she stopped indulging him after he forced her to take out the trash. (COMIC: The Bin Dilemma [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor offered Clara the choice of their next visit. She requested to meet Robin Hood, having grown up reading the stories about him, despite the Doctor's insistence that he was a fictional character. They arrived in Sherwood Forest, to indeed find Robin Hood, but the Doctor refused to believe he was real. Following an archery contest, the Doctor, Clara and Robin were captured by the Sheriff of Nottingham and his robot knights, and taken to his castle, which was actually a spaceship. The Doctor and Robin argued in the cell, leading the guard to believe Clara was the most responsible and mature one of the three - and therefore their leader - so he took her out to the Sheriff. Clara tricked the Sheriff into revealing to her his plans to take over the kingdom. The Sheriff also revealed that he planned to make Clara his consort, and attempted to kiss her, which she avoided. She then warned the Sheriff that he'd \"regret that\" if he tried again. She managed to escape with Robin, who brought her to his campsite and demanded he tell her what the Doctor knew about the Robin Hood legends, though she ended up telling them about the Doctor's life as well, having been unable to stop once she started. They returned to the castle in the middle of a revolt led by the Doctor, where Robin defeated the Sheriff in a battle. Clara, the Doctor and Robin then teamed up to launch a golden arrow to allow the ship to fly into space. Clara and the Doctor farewelled Robin and set off on more adventures. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara went on a date with Danny, but some miscommunication caused her to storm off. Returning home, Clara met the Doctor, who convinced her to help him learn if there was a creature that can perfectly hide; he believed this to be why people talk out loud when alone. Using the telepathic circuits, Clara accidentally landed the TARDIS at the West Country Children's Home in the 1990s when a call from Danny distracted her. Clara and a young boy called Rupert Pink, who was a younger version of Danny, and they encountered a mysterious figure hidden by a bed sheet sitting on Rupert's bed. The Doctor, Clara and Rupert turned away from the figure as it left Rupert's bedroom, and they were unable to find out if it was a creature or a child playing a prank. Clara asked the Doctor to take her back to the moment she left Danny, so she could attempt patching things up. However, not only did she mess things up, but the Doctor called her back to the TARDIS, where she met Orson Pink, who came from 100 years later in Clara's timeline.\n\nOrson was a time traveller who had been trapped at the end of time, where the Doctor's theory seemed possible, as something wanted in. However, the Doctor was knocked out when the door opened and the oxygen field collapsed. Clara piloted the TARDIS via the telepathic circuits, accidentally landing in the Doctor's own childhood. Hiding under his bed, Clara convinced the young First Doctor it was a dream. Fear, she told him, can make one kind instead of cruel and cowardly, and a day would come when he was the most afraid. Inside the TARDIS, Orson asked the Doctor what was outside Orson's ship, but Clara entered and asked the Doctor what if there was nothing behind the door, or under everyone's beds, and \"What if the big bad Time Lord doesn't want to admit he's just afraid of the dark?\" Clara made the Doctor promise to leave and never find out where they had landed. She returned to the 21st century where she decided to make her relationship with Danny a romantic one. She leaned in and kissed Danny, allowing both of them to overcome their separate fears of becoming a couple. (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nWhile Clara was preparing for a date with Danny, she refused to go sightseeing with the Doctor. However, when the Doctor received a call from an elderly Madame Karabraxos, who asked him to rescue the Teller and its imprisoned mate from the Bank of Karabraxos before the solar storm would destroy it, Clara joined the Doctor on the mission. The Doctor recruited Saibra and Psi and, disguising himself as \"the Architect\", orchestrated a bank heist for himself and his new team to commit. The Doctor, Clara and Saibra used memory worms to erase their recent memories, while Psi deleted his recent memories manually. This allowed them to break into the Bank of Karabraxos without revealing their plan to the Teller, who was forced to work as the bank's telepathic guard by Ms Delphox, the Head of Bank Security. Following the instructions left by the Architect, the team discovered six devices which they believed were atomic shredders. Preferring a quick and painless death, Saibra was soon forced to use one of them, as later was Psi.\n\nLeft alone, the Doctor and Clara entered the bank's vault, where they found the payment which the Architect had promised to Psi and Saibra. The pair were soon captured by the Teller and Ms Delphox, who ordered their execution. However, they were rescued by Saibra and Psi, who had survived and disguised themselves as guards. They revealed that the \"atomic shredders\" were actually teleporters. Reunited, the team ventured into the bank's private vault, where they discovered the bank's director, a younger Madame Karabraxos. Realising the true identity of the Architect, the Doctor wrote down his phone number and gave it to Karabraxos, who fled the bank. No longer subjected to Karabraxos, the Teller used its psychic powers to restore the Doctor's lost memories, allowing him to learn the true objective of their mission. After freeing the Teller and its mate, the Doctor and his team escaped the planet using the teleporters. Reunited with his TARDIS, the Doctor dropped the two creatures off on an isolated planet. After giving Psi and Saibra their payment and having a meal with them and Clara in the TARDIS, the Doctor returned his companions to their respective times and places, allowing Clara to be back home on time for her date. (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nAt some point, the TARDIS had been lost in 22nd century London and kept a boy called Simon safe when the city had been taken over by wolves. At a time when Simon, the Doctor and Clara all needed help, Simon triggered the TARDIS' telepathic circuits and the TARDIS materialised around the Doctor and Clara just as they were \"about to be turned into toast by an Aaraanandal slime beast\". They took Simon out of the danger zone to bring him to his parents in Bedfordshire, before leaving in the TARDIS. (PROSE: When the Wolves Came [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAlthough the Doctor always returned her home soon after they left, leading a double life didn't prove to be easy for Clara. During one of their adventures, the Doctor and Clara were held prisoner on a desert planet. As a result, Clara acquired a tan, which surprised Danny. After meeting fish people with the Doctor, Clara turned up on a date with Danny in a wet dress and with seaweed in her hair. One day Danny came round to Clara's flat to go running with her, not knowing that she was already exhausted after running for her life on another outing with the Doctor. On another occasion, Danny saw Clara wearing a space helmet. By that time, the rumours of Clara's and Danny's romantic relationship were travelling among the students of Coal Hill School. Clara's two lives finally collided when one morning the Doctor informed her that they were not going to have an adventure that day, explaining that he had a \"thing\" to do. To her horror, when Clara arrived at Coal Hill School, Mr Armitage introduced her, Danny and other teachers to the school's new caretaker, who was actually the Doctor going undercover. He had discovered a Skovox Blitzer killer robot in the surrounding area and was planning to lure it into the school, where he was going to trap it using chronodyne generators and send it into the Time Vortex. However, his plans were spoiled when Danny, whom the Doctor didn't like and whom he claimed he didn't recognise, discovered and switched off some of the chronodyne generators.\n\nThe Doctor was still able to temporarily send the Blitzer into the Time Vortex. Noticing that Clara was familiar with the Doctor, Danny demanded explanations. Clara had to tell him the truth about her life with the Doctor. The Doctor's dislike for Danny increased when he learned that Danny was Clara's boyfriend. Declining his proposal to erase Danny's memories of these events, Clara took the shocked Danny home. Danny was uncomfortable with the fact that Clara \"eloped\" with the Doctor when he wasn't seeing her. This prompted her to give him an invisibility watch and take him with her into the TARDIS the next day so that he could observe her interactions with the Doctor. However, the Doctor sensed Danny's presence, and a heated confrontation arose between the two men. As Danny stormed out of the TARDIS, Clara reminded him that it was parents' evening at Coal Hill School that day, and the pair had to return to their duties.\n\nDuring the parents' evening, the Skovox Blitzer suddenly emerged from the Time Vortex earlier than expected, which the Doctor detected. He summoned Clara and gave her his sonic screwdriver, instructing her to use it to attract the Blitzer's attention and lure it towards the TARDIS. The Doctor used the device that he had built to make the Blitzer think of him as of its superior. This accidentally triggered the Blitzer's self-destruct protocol. However, Danny appeared at the last moment and distracted it, giving the Doctor enough time to deactivate the Blitzer. The Doctor had to acknowledge that Danny had saved the world, while Danny claimed that he didn't need the Doctor to like him, but needed to prove himself a worthy boyfriend for Clara in the Doctor's eyes. Clara shared an evening with Danny. He told her that when he was a soldier, he knew officers like the Doctor, and made Clara promise to tell him if the Doctor ever pushed her too hard. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara volunteered to supervise a school ski trip with Danny, so the Doctor brought her to the planet Isen VI, which they discovered being terraformed by Kano Dollar and his company Dollar Intergalactic. The terraforming woke up a Hyperion named Rann-Korr. Clara had to use a ski-pole to fence with Eric the drone, reprogrammed by Rann-Korr, and helped the Doctor to revert an area of Isen VI around Rann-Korr to its original icy state, freezing Rann-Korr inside. This was Clara's first encounter with Hyperions. (COMIC: Terrorformer [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).)\n\nClara and the Doctor later answered a distress call from an old friend of his, Tiger Maratha, leading them to meet his daughter Priyanka Maratha instead as Tiger had been dead for some time. It turned out that a family cult that worshipped Kali were working to resurrect her by murdering people and using their souls to power Kali's rebirth; they had tricked Tiger into collecting three of the four swords, but threatened to kill him when he claimed that the fourth was nowhere to be found. Clara was captured and used as bait to ensure the Doctor brought the fourth sword of Kali to them, in exchange for Clara's safety.\n\nHowever, they double-crossed the Doctor and used Clara as the vessel of Kali's spirit, mutating her into Kali's form; Clara retained awareness of what was happening. When the Doctor returned, he managed to help free Clara briefly from Kali's control, saving him from being sliced to death. However, the Doctor had a backup plan; he had placed his sonic screwdriver in the fourth sword and tricked Kali into destroying her power source. The vengeful spirits forced Kali out of Clara, returning her to normal. Borrowing a shirt from Priyanka, Clara and the Doctor attended the Festival of Light with Priyanka and her new girlfriend Rani Jhulka, a time-displaced Amazon from 18th century Africa. (COMIC: The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nEarth was later invaded by the Fractures, creatures of the Void who sought Paul Foster, a scientist from another universe who had crossed into N-Space to join a version of his family that had lost his counterpart. The Doctor managed to banish the Fractures with Clara convincing him to allow Paul to remain. (COMIC: The Fractures [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) Clara had been given one of the Doctor's sonic screwdrivers during the course of the adventure but as he had forgotten to reclaim it, Clara kept it for herself. (COMIC: Clara Oswald and the School of Death [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nOn a jungle planet, Clara found a museum that held a record of the Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors meeting. Seeking to prevent the dangerous paradoxes of a Multi-Doctor Event, Clara steered the TARDIS to Paris in 1923 to enlist the aid of Gabby Gonzalez and Alice Obiefune only for a future Gabby to arrive and warn that they were all falling into the trap of an alternate Twelfth Doctor who now ruled the Voord. Navigating around the traps, the group made their way to Marinus to confront their foe where Clara convinced the alternate Twelfth Doctor to revert the Voord lest they be destroyed. Only asking that Clara not forget him, the alternate Doctor complied. Having previously entered the Doctor's timestream, Clara's memories of this were erased soon after. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nWhen the Doctor told Courtney that she wasn't special, she became upset and inconsolable. Noticing this, Clara asked the Doctor to tell Courtney that she was special, which prompted him to take both Clara and Courtney to the Moon in the year 2049 so that Courtney could become the first girl to step on the lunar surface. The TARDIS landed on board a space shuttle that Captain Lundvik and her crew were piloting to the Moon, which recently had been gaining weight and creating chaos on Earth due to its increasing gravity. Investigating an abandoned moonbase, the Doctor, Clara, Courtney and the astronauts were attacked by spider-like creatures, who soon killed Lundvik's crew.\n\nAfter scanning the Moon's core, the Doctor discovered that the Moon was actually an egg that was about to hatch and release a giant creature. Believing that it was a threat to humanity, Lundvik desired to kill it using the nuclear bombs which her crew brought to the Moon in their shuttle. Unwilling to kill a yet-to-be-born and potentially innocent organism, Clara asked for the Doctor's advice - but to her horror, he proclaimed that it was not his place to decide the fate of Earth's Moon and departed in the TARDIS, leaving Clara, Courtney and Lundvik to make a decision on behalf of humankind.\n\nClara sent a video message to Earth, asking humanity to vote whether they should destroy the creature or not. Although the human race unanimously voted for killing it, Clara could not bear such a decision and cancelled the countdown. At the same moment, the TARDIS arrived back, and the Doctor took the three women to a beach on Earth. The creature harmlessly emerged from its egg, its eggshell dissolving without doing any damage to Earth, and laid another egg. He explained that the sight of such a creature being born would fascinate humanity and inspire it to pioneer into space and spread across the universe.\n\nAfter the Doctor took Courtney back to Coal Hill School, Clara confronted the Doctor, demanding to know what he really knew and threatening to hit him \"so hard he would regenerate\". The Doctor replied that he knew that the creature wouldn't harm Earth and that Clara \"would always make the right choice\". Angered by the fact that the Doctor, whom she considered her friend, had put her in a terrible situation in which she nearly caused the death of an innocent creature, and tired of his patronising attitude, Clara told him to leave and never return for her, exiting the TARDIS in tears. When Danny came to see Clara in her class, she recounted the story to him. She claimed that she had finished with the Doctor, but Danny pointed out that she was still angry and stated that \"you can never finish with anyone while they can still make you angry\". He told Clara to calm down first, and only then tell the Doctor that their relationship was over. (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara remained angry at the Doctor for several weeks, but eventually, she realised that although she couldn't carry on travelling with him, she didn't want to part with him on bad terms, and agreed to make one final trip with him as \"a goodbye to the good times\". The Doctor took Clara to the space-bound recreation of the Orient Express, where they soon learned that one of the passengers, Mrs Pitt, had recently died. Theorising that she was killed by the mythical Foretold, the Doctor set off to investigate, while Clara followed Maisie, Mrs Pitt's granddaughter, to the luggage car, where the two got themselves trapped.\n\nAfter several more people were killed by the Foretold, the Doctor discovered that the Orient Express was actually a trap orchestrated by Gus, the computer who controlled the train, to study the Foretold. Learning that Maisie would be the next victim and planning to make use of her death in order to study the Foretold, the Doctor phoned Clara and told her to bring Maisie to the lab, making Clara lie to her that the Doctor would be able to save her. Gus unlocked the luggage car door, allowing Clara and Maisie to the lab, where the Doctor admitted knowing all along, or at least suspecting, that this wouldn't be just a relaxing voyage. Clara realised that the Doctor had once again placed her in a dangerous situation. The Doctor was able to make the Foretold attack him instead of Maisie and, identifying it as an \"ancient soldier being driven by malfunctioning tech\", surrendered to it, allowing it to die. Having no more need for the scientists, Gus proceeded to remove all the air from the train, making Clara and the rest of the passengers pass out. The Doctor retained oxygen long enough to use the Foretold's teleport to rescue everyone on board.\n\nUpon waking up, Clara found herself with the Doctor on a beach on a nearby planet. He explained that he was unable to save the other passengers from the Foretold and that there was a big chance that he wouldn't be able to save Maisie as well, but he still had to risk her life to stop the Foretold, because \"sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones, but you still have to choose\". Back in the TARDIS, Clara asked the Doctor if he loved the fact that his life was full of dangerous situations and hard decisions, and whether it was like an addiction for him, to which he replied that you couldn't tell if something was an addiction until you tried to give it up. Upon receiving a call from Danny, Clara indicated to him that she had finally parted ways with the Doctor. However, unable to really give up her life in the TARDIS, she lied to the Doctor that Danny wouldn't mind if she continued travelling with the Doctor as long as he brought her home safe and on time, and much to his joy and delight, asked him to take her on a new adventure. (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor landed on the Pollyanna, the first of the Ninth Era sunships, which had been on an expedition to circumnavigate the Sun. Because the temperature was kept cold in spite of the Doctor telling Clara he was taking her \"somewhere warm\", Clara went back inside the TARDIS to change in warmer clothing, while the Doctor ran off without her. Clara met the boss of the expedition, the egotistical \"handsome quadrillionaire\" Rudy Zoom, and was shown the Pollyanna's flight deck. When the Umbra, a group of \"psychic predators\" who fed off self-loathing, began attacking the Pollyanna, Clara used the TARDIS to translate a looped signal Sandy Tanaka had been trying to decode. The signal was a message recorded by an alien scientist whom had created the Umbra. He said that originally, the Umbra had been a psychic fabric fashioned into a cloak which drained guilt. However, the Umbra gained intelligence and devoured his people's \"spirits\".\n\nThe scientist as a last ditch effort tried burning them in the Sun, but they survived, trapped inside the Sun's chromosphere. The Umbra began swarming the Pollyanna, anchoring the ship to the Sun to try and hijack it and use it as a way of reaching Earth. As the rest of the crew on the flight deck headed to auxiliary control, Clara destroyed the navigation system, stopping the Umbra from finding Earth. After the crew was surrounded, Clara realised that Rudy was too much of a narcissist to have any self-loathing in his mind for the Umbra to feed on, and sent him to speak to the Umbra. As a result, the inside of Rudy's mind was \"like poison\" to the Umbra and the Umbra on board were destroyed while trying to feed on his mind. Meanwhile, the Doctor had used the graviton inverter on the Pollyanna to destroy the Umbra which had swarmed on the ship's hull by freezing them to death. (COMIC: The Eye of Torment [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile attempting to return Clara home, the Doctor accidentally took the TARDIS to Bristol, and the pair discovered that the TARDIS exterior had reduced in size. Staying behind in the TARDIS to investigate the effect, the Doctor sent Clara to look around and find the cause. Clara met Rigsy and his community service crew and learned that people had been disappearing in the area, with murals of them appearing on the walls of a pedestrian tunnel. On returning Clara discovered that the TARDIS had shrunk further, preventing the Doctor from getting out. However, the doorway was still large enough for him to pass Clara his sonic screwdriver, his psychic paper and a nanotechnological device that allowed him to communicate with Clara and see through her eyes. Putting the small TARDIS in her handbag, Clara set off to find the source of the dimensional leeching.\n\nClara once again met Rigsy, and they investigated the disappearances. The Doctor realised that they were dealing with beings from a two-dimensional universe, who were sucking people into flat surfaces. As the two-dimensional entities were advancing on Clara and Rigsy, Clara received a call from Danny and, telling him that she was busy helping a community worker find his missing aunt, quickly hung up. Clara and Rigsy escaped the danger and, when the Doctor realised that the murals were actually the creatures taking forms of their victims, Clara and the rest of the community service crew at the tunnel hid in a nearby engine repair warehouse. While the group was confused and disorientated, Clara became the leader and attempted to bring them to safety. As the creatures had gradually picked off the community service workers, Clara, Fenton and Rigsy became the only survivors. The Doctor claimed that he had discovered a way to send the creatures back to their dimension but didn't have enough power to do so. In the chaos, the TARDIS was dropped down a shaft onto a railway. Fleeing from the creatures, Clara found the TARDIS in siege mode on the tracks and devised a plan to restore its power. She asked Rigsy to paint a fake door with a flattened handle and placed the TARDIS behind it. Attempting to de-flatten the fake handle so that they could open the \"door\", the creatures unknowingly pumped dimensional energy into the TARDIS, restoring it to its proper size and full power. The Doctor emerged from the TARDIS and, taking his sonic screwdriver back from Clara, sent them back to their dimension. When the threat was over, the Doctor took the survivors to the surface. (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor tried taking Clara to the frost fair in 1641, but instead, was drawn off course and landed in the Sahara Desert in 1941, where they were captured by Nazis. After the Doctor spoke to their field marshal, Erwin Rommel, and learnt of Germany's Tuareg allies making friends with \"men from the stars\", Clara stayed behind at the base because of the Tuareg's hostility towards women. Eventually, though, after the Rutan spy Heinz Bruckner framed the Doctor and Clara as spies, Clara was taken prisoner and joined Bruckner, ostensibly in a mission to find the Doctor and Field Marshall Rommel. Instead, Bruckner drove to the site of the Sontaran world engine weapon, the Warsong, using the chronal energy inside Clara to pinpoint the location of the Warsong so he could claim it for the Rutans. The Doctor and Rommel broke through the defences of the Warsong, but Bruckner held Clara hostage. The Doctor stopped Bruckner from conducting the millennia-old preset programming of the Warsong by using a Sontaran osmic projector to send Bruckner's trigger mechanism through time, and Clara broke free. Rommel threw Bruckner into the Warsong, killing him, while the Doctor destroyed the \"orchestra\" of the Warsong by using his sonic screwdriver to blow it up. Afterwards, he brought Clara to the frost fair. (COMIC: The Instruments of War [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nClara and Danny chaperoned a school trip to a museum, and upon leaving, discovered a forest had grown all over the world. One of the students, Maebh Arden was missing. Clara, Danny and the students met up with the Doctor at Trafalgar Square, and she and the Doctor set off to find Maebh. Following a trail that Maebh left, they caught up to her but were trapped by a tiger. Danny saved them. Maebh claimed to have been behind the forest, and the solar flare headed for Earth that had come to her in the thoughts Maebh found after her sister Annabel went missing. Believing there was no hope for humanity, Clara convinced the Doctor to leave her and Earth behind. The Doctor began to leave but realised the trees were protecting Earth, rather than destroying it with the solar flare. With the Doctor's help, Maebh sent out a message to humanity urging them to leave the trees alone. The Doctor and Clara then watched as Earth was shielded from the solar flare by the trees. Back at her flat, the Doctor stated to Clara that humanity would forget the incident. (TV: In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nWhen the Doctor took Clara to Las Vegas in 1963, he quickly won her a fortune only to be escorted away by enforcers of the casino's owner. Left to her own devices, Clara quickly won the affections of the Wolf Pack who promised to help her find the Doctor before the Cybock Imperium invaded. Imprisoned with the artists at the Cosmos Casino, Clara managed to extort information from the conquerors, distracting them long enough for the Doctor to arrive. The Doctor eventually managed to convince the Cybock to play a game of Rassilon's roulette with the Time-Gun of Rassilon, resulting in the Cybock wiping themselves from history, the Doctor revealing that the gun couldn't fire on Gallifreyan DNA. Afterwards, Clara attended a show by the Wolf Pack, being mortified to discover that they considered the Doctor her \"sugar daddy\".

As the residents all left, Clara was delighted to learn that they'd given Charlotte Brontë the inspiration for Jane Eyre. (COMIC: Unearthly Things [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nDuring the \"invasion of the trees\" Danny learned about Clara's secret adventures with the Doctor. After marking her student's schoolwork and writing some sticky notes, Clara was prepared to tell Danny the truth. (TV: In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) While he was out walking, she phoned him. She began to tell him about her recent travels with the Doctor and that she loved him, however, the line fell silent during the call. A panicked woman took the call and informed her that Danny had been hit by a car. Clara rushed to the scene in time to see Danny's lifeless body being taken away by paramedics. Several days later, Clara attempted and failed to blackmail the Doctor to save Danny's life. The Doctor still agreed to use the telepathic circuits to find a way to save Danny. The TARDIS took them to 3W. They were greeted by Missy, who said that she was a greeting droid and passed them on to Dr Chang. Dr Chang established a communication with the Nethersphere, and the voice of Danny came through. The Doctor left with Chang to investigate the centre while Clara spoke with Danny. Clara asked Danny to say something which only he could say so that she knew that it was definitely him. She vowed to find a way to be with him, even if it meant taking her own life. In fear that she would die for him, Danny repeatedly told Clara he loved her, prompting her to end the call. Turning around, she found that the dark water had drained from the tank containing Dr Skarosa, revealing him to be a 3W Cyberman. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nTo save herself, Clara used her knowledge of the Doctor to try to convince the Cybermen that she was him but ultimately failed. However, another Cyberman stunned her, killed the others and took her to a graveyard. In the graveyard, Clara avoided the Cybermen rising from their graves and her saviour revealed itself to be Danny. However, Danny couldn't stand the pain of being a Cyberman and asked Clara to activate his inhibitor for him. Clara activated his inhibitor to allow Danny to clearly see the Cybermen's plan and afterwards hugged Danny who retained control even with the inhibitor due to his love for her. As Clara hugged Danny, Missy, who was in fact a female incarnation of the Doctor's boyhood friend the Master, arrived to reveal her plan was to convert all of humanity and have them march across the universe, conquering and converting, an unstoppable army, with the only question being whether that army spread on its own or the Doctor took control of it himself. During the confrontation, Clara got ahold of Missy's weapon, while the Doctor handed control of the army to Danny. Danny then sacrificed himself to stop Missy's plans. However, the devastated Clara decided to kill her out of revenge. The Doctor decided to do it to spare Clara from being tainted, but they were both spared when a rogue Cyberman appeared to disintegrate Missy with his wrist blaster.\n\nTwo weeks later, Clara awoke to Danny's voice and followed it to a portal. Clara was excited as the Doctor had told her that Missy's bracelet, which Danny had on him, would thus allow him to come back. However, Danny chose to send back the boy he killed, asking Clara to get him home as there was only enough power left for one trip for one person. Meeting with the Doctor, Clara nearly told him about what happened with Danny when the Doctor assumed he returned and she would be ending her adventures with him for a life with Danny. However, she stopped herself when he told her that he had found Gallifrey. Clara said goodbye to the Doctor and watched him depart once more as she didn't want to spoil his happiness. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nWhen Clara was attacked by a dream crab who slowly fed on her brain, she had a dream where she became an old woman filled with regrets. She turned down many marriage proposals, taught in every school in Europe and learnt how to fly an aeroplane. She was then attacked by a dream crab, and in the dream within the dream was a young woman who saw Santa Claus' sleigh crash on her roof. The Doctor arrived and invited Clara into the TARDIS, and they arrived at a base on the North Pole on Christmas Eve. The Doctor, Clara and the scientists at the polar base were again attacked by dream crabs and had a dream within this dream where Santa saved everybody's life. Clara told the Doctor that Danny was, in fact, dead, while the Doctor explained that he lied about finding Gallifrey. While trying to fetch a dream crab specimen for the Doctor to examine, Clara realised the specimen had come to life, and attacked her face, causing her to have a dream within this dream. In the dream, Clara had woken up on Christmas morning to an alive Danny, and the Doctor had used a dream crab to enter this dream. Clara assured the Danny in the dream that she would miss him for five minutes every day while for the rest of the time she would \"get the hell on with it\".\n\nAfter leaving Danny, the Doctor realised that the dream crab had left no wound on either of them and everyone at the polar base still had the pain in a spot on the head, which meant that they were still dreaming. The Doctor, Clara and the scientists woke up, but before they left, Clara asked the Doctor how Santa could have been on her roof if he was a part of the dream. Ashley Carter signalled Santa with a flare to get them away from the dream constructs that were psychic representations of the dream crabs' attack, and as they rode on Santa's sleigh, the base's scientists, who weren't actually scientists, woke up in the real world. Inside Clara's dream as an old woman, the Doctor pulled the dream crab off her face while she failed to wake up, and he realised that he had arrived sixty-two years after he had last met her. As Clara told the Doctor about her life and the Doctor wished he could have come back for her earlier, Santa arrived, asking the Doctor, \"How much do you wish that?\" The Doctor woke up again, and pulled the dream crab off of Clara's face again at her home, revealing a young Clara. The Doctor offered Clara to travel through time and space in the TARDIS again, and she agreed. (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nTo celebrate Clara's birthday, the Doctor threw her an \"Infinite Clarabration\" attended by herself as a child and an old woman along with Oswin and Clara Oswin Oswald. When Clara was shocked at the violation of the First Law of Time, the Doctor revealed that the guests were, respectively, a ganger, an Ood in a wig, a Zygon and the Teselecta, sending them all out and explaining that he'd already paid for the \"Infinite Clarabration\" banner. (COMIC: The Partying of the Ways [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen the Doctor took Clara to Cinema Paradoxo for a silent film, he had her smuggle all his snacks under her coat, only for the two to discover that it was a movie acted out by Silents, leaving Clara unable to recall the film. (COMIC: Silver Screenesis [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor later took Clara to an auction where they purchased the living portrait of Lady Josephine, who was destined to become the Eighth Doctor's companion Josie Day. (COMIC: Briarwood [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Depositing her in the Doctor's cottage, the two later returned to check up on the two, Clara teasing the Twelfth Doctor about his sentimentality.

(COMIC: Selfie [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, SDCC exclusive (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara travelled to a galactic auction in Earth's orbit where unclaimed storage was being bid on. One of the storage pods belonged to the reclusive collector Hyphen T Hyphen. When the pod was opened, a mother Rigellan Hyper-Kraken emerged and began killing everyone. Her eggs were jolted after being transported with the station's dimensional shunt and began to hatch. Clara helped distract the Hyper-Kraken along with the station's auctioneer as the Doctor safely transported the Hyper-Kraken, her eggs and the storage pods to a backwater world. (COMIC: Space Invaders! [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara went on a tour of Snowcap University in Antarctica in 2048. While taking a helicopter ride, they learnt that one of the students, Polly Evans, had stayed behind at the end of term to join the classified Project Sub-Zero. When another student, Quinn Norton, who also a part of Project Sub-Zero, was killed in a helicopter crash the Doctor and Clara narrowly avoided being on along with Polly's father George, they returned to Snowcap U to investigate. Clara met a research graduate called Winnie Clarence, short for \"Oswin Clarence\". Winnie looked exactly like Clara and recalled dreams of living a thousand lives in a thousand places. Winnie overheard a discussion between the Doctor and Clara over whether or not this meant she was one of her splinters who was born to die based on a decision Clara made and ran off on a snowmobile. Clara tried following after Winnie but the two fell down a crevasse into an ice cavern where the missing students had been experimented on, engineered by Dr Patricia Audley to survive in extreme cold. Along with the spy Paul South, Winnie released most of the imprisoned humans from captivity.\n\nThe Doctor transmitted a signal with his sonic causing Dr Audley's animals to go wild. After feigning betrayal of the two, Winnie threw the Doctor the key to free the hybrid subjects from their cells and saved the Doctor's life by pulling Dr Audley into a vat of liquid ice after Audley pulled a gun on him. Dr Audley was killed, and Winnie appeared to have sacrificed herself, once again, for the Doctor. When Winnie's mother arrived on the scene, Clara, struck with guilt over the death of Winnie, made the decision to live out her life as Winnie to spare Winnie's mother the pain of losing her daughter. Fortunately, Clara did not have to do this as Winnie survived when she unwittingly had a syringe of Dr Audley's experimental blue blood serum injected into her, allowing her to live inside the ice. Clara realised that this meant that not all of the splinters died saving the Doctor, and many of them had lives of their own. The Doctor said that Clara was able to release some of her inner demons as a result of this knowledge. (COMIC: Blood and Ice [+]Jacqueline Rayner, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara visited Paris in 1944 just after it was liberated from the Germans. After foiling a plot by the Darapok Empire, the Doctor and Clara joined in on the liberation celebrations. (COMIC: Trust [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nClara joined the Doctor in a mission to help Mr Hitch recover the sentient superweapon the Hadax Ura. The Hadax Ura shot down the landing craft the team were inside, revealing the weapon's location on the planet Unnamed BX-4, but the team were able to escape using jetpacks. While piloting a jetpack, Clara got separated from the team when she was attacked by pterosaurs, causing her to fall into the Jungle.\n\nClara met the Jungle's organic avatar, who took the form of Danny in an attempt to get Clara to trust him. Although this didn't work, the Doctor found Clara and the organic avatar, and the avatar told them that the Hadax Ura had been \"devouring\" the Jungle, and turning its indigenous life into an army, and asked them either to destroy the weapon or to take it elsewhere. The Doctor realised that this meant it intended to end the war between the Hub Alliance and the Axis Worlds, and the Hadax Ura began augmenting the crew to become its foot soldiers. Believing it had augmented Clara as well, the Hadax Ura had actually linked the Jungle's computer systems to its own after augmenting the avatar. The avatar appeared to shut down the Hadax Ura and its augmented soldiers, but in fact, the Hadax Ura had tricked Hitch's team to bring it on board the lander as a means of escape for the Hadax Ura. With Clara surrounded by the converted Gela and Wiremu and about to be killed by them, the avatar saved her life by destroying them with the entire Jungle's wildlife. When the Doctor returned, Clara kissed goodbye to the Danny avatar, who told her he would always be in her memories. (COMIC: Spirits of the Jungle [+]Jonathan Morris, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara encountered a vampire-like race called the Corvids in Highgate Cemetery in 1972, who had petrified the TARDIS. They tried consuming Clara's psychic essence but found her toxic due to her unique connection to the time-space vortex where she splintered into a million Claras. The Doctor discovered that the Corvids exposing themselves to Clara left a psychic corridor open, and using the psychic signature of the dead amplified by the ley line the cemetery was built on, the Doctor banished the Corvids back to the time vortex. (COMIC: The Highgate Horror [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara arrived in a forest on a planet, where the TARDIS was stolen by dragons. Navigating to a nearby village, they learned from the Lord Mortigan that they were on a planet designed to resemble medieval times, with the dragons being the planet's natural inhabitants, which had been genetically modified. The dragons had been freed from being inhibited by inhibitor chips by a person known as the Dragon Lord, who aimed to wipe out the townspeople, having already killed the royalty. Although the Doctor declared his intent to leave and let the townspeople get what they \"deserved\" for enslaving the dragons, Clara reminded him that he shouldn't decide which lives were worth saving. The Doctor, Clara and the town's remaining lords set off to reason with the Dragon Lord. Along the way, they ran into a baby hatchling, but Lord Mortigan killed it, causing its parents to attack the party. The Doctor was separated from Clara in the chaos, and reuniting with Clara at the Red Castle, they found that the Dragon Lord had been killed, believing they would have been grateful to him for liberating them. The Doctor and Clara retrieved the TARDIS from the dragons' treasure hoard and left, calling rescue ships to evacuate the planet of humans to allow the dragons to live in peace. (COMIC: The Dragon Lord [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara were summoned by Harry Houdini and found themselves in a computer program inside a crystal ball which fed on their despair. The program set up theatrical death traps with no way out so their minds could be ripened for it, but the Doctor, Clara and Houdini escaped. The Doctor revealed the virtual environment with his sonic screwdriver. The Doctor, Clara and Houdini then fought back by imagining what made them feel the most free, which shattered the prison and returned them to the real world. They found the owner of the crystal ball prison, Diamanda, had been completely consumed by the crystal ball's power and killed. When Houdini regretted his inability to commune with the dead, the Doctor and Clara reassured him that his legacy would be remembered forever. (COMIC: Theatre of the Mind [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWanting to raise funds for an IT suite at Coal Hill School in memory of Danny, Clara came up with the idea of a Halloween Fayre. However, few people had actually turned up. As part of the Fayre's witch hunt, the time traveller Miss Chief, intending to create mischief, brought the Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins to find Clara. When he did so, Miss Chief sent them back in time to the 17th century, where Hopkins captured Clara, in costume as the witch, throwing her into the water to see if she floated. Miss Chief saved Clara from drowning, and Clara later found a mob was accusing a woman called Agnes Leech of being a witch. Trying to save Agnes' life and prove her innocence, Clara was captured by Hopkins again. Clara and Agnes were framed as witches; imprisoned and left to starve and be deprived of sleep in solitary confinement until they confessed.\n\nA hallucination of Danny convinced Clara to confess to being a witch and escape, rather than remain in the dungeon. Clara accidentally identified the Doctor, who had come to rescue Clara, as a witch, and both were to be executed. Miss Chief brought them back to the 21st century before they could be hanged. The Doctor and Clara convinced Miss Chief to bring them back to retrieve the TARDIS and save Agnes from the dungeons, and unwittingly brought the missing cat Smudge with them. Clara convinced the mob that Hopkins was a witch and Smudge was his familiar, but the Doctor prevented them from murdering Hopkins by sneakily putting Miss Chief's time travelling Marotte in his belt, forcing Miss Chief to save his life. The Doctor and Clara escaped and returned to Coal Hill. Because of the Doctor and Miss Chief bringing extinct animals and rare artefacts to the 21st century as part of Miss Chief's scavenger hunt game and her making superstitions coming true, the publicity from paranormal, wildlife and antique experts made Clara's fundraiser at the Halloween Fayre a success, and a few months later, Clara opened the Danny Pink IT Suite, which the Doctor was also present at.

When Clara had befriended a fireman named Sam, he led them to the remainder of London's population where they found Kate Stewart waiting for them. Joined by Sam, the Doctor and Clara tried to destroy the Sussex Firewall only to wind up letting the transformed Colonel Weir into the TARDIS. Armed with Weir's knowledge, the trio flew to the sun only to be confronted by a Hyperion who revealed how their race had survived. After escaping back to Earth, the Doctor and Clara led a resistance movement before shifting the fusion web around the sun to the year 5000000000, collapsing it as the star went nova. (COMIC: The Hyperion Empire [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nAt some point, Clara and the Doctor met novelist Jane Austen. Clara befriended Austen and the two would play pranks on each other (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She once confided in her class that Austen was \"a phenomenal kisser\", (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and later told Rigsy, \"I love her,\" before teasing him with the statement, \"Take that how you like.\" (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhen all the planes of Earth were frozen, UNIT requested Clara's help due to being unable to contact the Doctor. With Clara acting on his behalf, they eventually discovered that Missy was behind the freezing of the planes. Missy proposed a meeting with Clara. However, she would not reveal how she was still alive. Clara and Missy managed to track the Doctor down to Essex in 1138, and Missy used vortex manipulators to get them there.\n\nAfter finding out that the Doctor had been having a 3-week party there, they were captured by Colony Sarff who imprisoned the three in a hospital building on Skaro, and later took the Doctor to Davros. After escaping, Clara and Missy were captured by a Dalek and taken to the Supreme Dalek who ordered for their \"extermination\". (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nDespite the appearance that she had been killed, Clara ended up far away from the Dalek City with Missy. The latter led them into a Dalek burial ground, where she attacked and killed a Dalek. She told Clara to get in it, and so she obliged, leading Missy through the city as her \"prisoner\". When she was found by the Doctor, Missy attempted to convince him that the Dalek that, in fact, was Clara had murdered Clara. In trying to convince the Doctor not to kill her, Clara caused the casing to say \"mercy,\" rousing the Doctor's suspicions. Telling Clara how to open the casing, the Doctor found her inside it and told Missy to run. Retreating to the Dalek control room, the Doctor revealed his new sonic sunglasses and rematrialised the TARDIS around them, carrying them to safety beyond the city. Standing on a mountain, the two watched the Dalek city descend into chaos with the Doctor asking Clara how she'd caused the casing to say \"mercy\". When Clara confessed that she didn't know, the Doctor realised what he had to do and led her back to the TARDIS. (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nShortly after leaving Skaro, the two fell into a trap set by the Toymaker, who sought the TARDIS. Much to Clara's horror, the Doctor casually handed over his ship only to reveal to Clara that he'd merely surrendered the Zero Room, allowing the Toymaker to have his peace. (COMIC: Relative Dimensions [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nWith Clara still wearing the same outfit she wore when facing Davros and the Toymaker, (TV: The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., COMIC: Relative Dimensions [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) the TARDIS lost all its power due to a universe-wide temporal crisis, making an emergency landing in a Nevada desert. There, she met an older version of the Twelfth Doctor, as well as an even further version of herself wearing an American waitress outfit who was technically no longer alive. The older Twelfth Doctor's TARDIS was being chased by Daleks, one of which materialised. Drawing on her knowledge of Dalek psychology from when she was Oswin Oswald, the younger Clara exploited the Dalek's confusion at seeing two Claras, one of whom gave off no life-signs, to make it believe that it had become impure and mad as a result of its excessive time-travel, and talk it into self-destructing. The older Twelfth Doctor found the display disturbing. The older Twelfth Doctor then left with the older Clara to another space-time Waypoint: Stonehenge. (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).)\n\nSeeking a break from adventuring, Clara invited the Doctor to play board games. After she won the round, an insulted Doctor travelled back in time to redo the initial meeting until he won, repeating the loop seventy-five times. (COMIC: The Board Games [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen the TARDIS' friction contrafibulator needed repairs, the Doctor set down on Planet Karaoke. Not hearing the Doctor's warning that the translation circuits would be offline, (COMIC: Day of the Tune [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Clara tried her hand at singing but wound up insulting the Karaokean monarch, which got her and the Doctor arrested. (COMIC: The Meddling of Clara's Song [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Performing for their lives in Battle of the Bands Beyond the Stars, the Doctor and Clara were shocked to discover that five incarnations of the Master had co-opted the show. (COMIC: The Abominable Showmen [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) After the Master's ego had led to their incarnations arguing over which one should rule the galaxy and they were disqualified, (COMIC: The Five Masters [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Clara and the Doctor made their way onto the stage, where Clara simply cut the operation's power, killing the show's ratings, before the two ran back to the TARDIS, flying off to get some chips. (COMIC: One! Two! Three! Four! To Doomsday [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) They ate their chips while parked in the Blue Lagoon Nebula, Clara wondering if their adventures would ever stop, the Doctor assuring her that adventure was just part of life, and both of them unaware that they were about to be eaten by a giant space turtle... (COMIC: Epilogopolis [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nClara travelled with the Doctor to the Drum, an underwater mining base in Scotland, in the year 2119, where they were met with a group of murderous ghosts, who had been repeating coordinates to the location of a stasis pod inside a nearby church. After the ghosts were captured inside a Faraday cage, the pod was brought inside. Meanwhile, the ghosts' meddling with the Drum's day-night cycle caused the base to be flooded and cutting Clara off from the Doctor. As the Doctor travelled back to before the nearby town was flooded, Clara saw a ghostly Doctor outside in the water, (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) who was actually a hologram created by the Doctor's sonic sunglasses, and gave the Doctor the idea to hide in the stasis pod in 1980 to be released that night, which the Doctor told his ghostly doppelganger to do so because he was told via Clara's phone that the ghost was saying, \"The chamber will open,\" a bootstrap paradox. The Doctor saved Clara and the Drum's crewmembers using Security Protocol 712. (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nOn another adventure with the Doctor, she spent too long in the Spider Mines and ended up with a Love Sprite crawling up her spacesuit. She was rescued by the Doctor, and they landed on Earth where they were captured by Vikings and brought to their village. Clara met Ashildr, a Viking girl, and they were transported to the spaceship of the Mire, where Ashildr foolishly declared war on the Mire and their leader, who was disguised as Odin. The Doctor trained the Vikings to fight against the Mire and used Clara's phone to record their humiliation and retreat. After returning to the TARDIS, the Doctor revealed that the Viking girl he saved, Ashildr, may have become immortal. (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nClara later asked the Doctor to help one of her students, Evie Hubbard, with her homework. As the assignment was an imaginary interview with Winston Churchill, the Doctor decided to just take Evie to meet Winston and ask him his thoughts.\n\nWhen the Doctor returned for her, Clara showed him a selfie she took with Evie as a gift for helping her homework. Clara cited the Doctor basically cheated, while he defended that Evie should have stressed \"imaginary\". Clara was oblivious to the fact that Ashildr was in the background of her selfie. (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nIn her apartment building, she checked her iPhone and saw that she had missed 127 calls from the Doctor. At the top of the building's stairs, she met Sandeep, a child who lived in the building. Sandeep was sad because he couldn't find his mummy and daddy. Entering his apartment, Clara found his \"mum\", who was actually a Zygon. She was then attacked by the aliens and replaced with Bonnie. (TV: The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nMaintaining a live link with Bonnie inside a Zygon pod, Clara caused Bonnie to stall for long enough to allow the Doctor and Osgood to escape Boat One before it was destroyed by a rocket launcher Bonnie fired from. She then used Bonnie's fingers to secretly send a text message to the Doctor's phone to say she was still alive, and in a video call between the Doctor and Bonnie, manipulated Bonnie's eyelids to inform the Doctor that she was being kept in a tunnel under London. Bonnie successfully got the location of the Osgood Boxes in the Black Archive from Clara, and Clara revealed that her body-print, and therefore Bonnie's as well, was the key to enter the Black Archive with. When the Doctor convinced both Bonnie and Kate Stewart not to use either Osgood Box, which were, in fact, both empty, he explained that Bonnie let Clara get inside her head. (TV: The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nAt some point while the Doctor was off on a solo adventure, Clara took a leave of absence from Coal Hill in order to take on an English teaching job at the Scottish private school Ravenscaur, in order to investigate the disappearance of one of its teachers, Christel Dean, who had attended teaching school with Clara. She was joined by the Doctor and encouraged by him to continue her undercover work as he helped investigate, leading to the uncovering of a conspiracy involving the Sea Devils that led to the unmasking of the then-current UK prime minister as one. During this time, Clara was bemused, if not outright annoyed, by the Doctor's decision to take on what he claimed to be a new companion - a stuffed swordfish he named Sonny. During the adventure, Clara briefly gained superhuman-like powers - including the power of flight - due to the Doctor providing her with technology to augment her mental abilities in order to combat the Sea Devils, one of whom she appeared to kill by dropping a chandelier on him, a rare documented case of Clara using deadly force on anyone. Afterwards, Clara told the Doctor outright that she now considered the TARDIS her home. (COMIC: Clara Oswald and the School of Death [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara landed on the space station Le Verrier in the 38th century, where the Morpheus pods which created Sandmen on board were used by Gagan Rassmussen, the creator of Morpheus, to put on a show for dramatic effect where he sent a video of the adventure containing an encoded message that could create further Sandmen out of the sleep dust in humans' eyes throughout the solar system by altering the humans' brain chemistry.\n\nThe Doctor and Clara joined a rescue mission on Le Verrier looking for Rassmussen, but eventually got split off, until only the Doctor, Clara and Chief Nagata were left. Nagata apparently killed Rassmussen when he apparently tried to get the Sandmen to spread from Le Verrier to other planets and moons, and the Doctor blew up the station's gravity shields so that the Doctor, Clara and Nagata got past the Sandmen blocking the way to the TARDIS to get to Triton to destroy every last Morpheus pod there. (TV: Sleep No More [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhen the Doctor detected strange energy emissions in London, the chase led them to a comic book store where the Doctor was outraged to discover Time Surgeon, a comic based on him and Clara, even if Clara herself was greatly amused. When she turned her head however, she found that the Doctor had disappeared with the staff showing her that everyone was being absorbed into the comics. When Clara saw Luke being absorbed, she realised that the Boneless had returned and she led Molly back to the TARDIS, following the Doctor's instructions to use the telepathic circuits to create a spatial/temporal flux that disrupted the fourth wall and returned the Boneless to their dimension. After the Doctor had gotten his new friend Natalie a job, he turned to an invisible audience and told them to leave, to Clara's visible confusion. (COMIC: The Fourth Wall [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) The Boneless briefly returned, replacing the Doctor and Clara for a time. (COMIC: The Faceless Two [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter a series of adventures in extremely cold locales, the Doctor came down with the common cold, Clara withering his melodramatic attitude. (COMIC: The Day at the Doctors [+]Colin Bell, DW12 backup comic stories (Titan Comics, 2016).) They later went to Beachelguese, the oldest beach in the universe, with the Doctor travelling to the dawn of time to truly be the first ones on the beach. (COMIC: Surfshock [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) When they landed on the planet Dyssiopeia, Clara, despite the natives communicating exclusively through insults, managed to utter something so insulting and foul that they were chased out. To her dismay, Clara then introduced the Doctor to the world of online forums where he could insult others without consequences. (COMIC: Planet of the Rude [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nShortly before she visited the Trap Street, Clara recognised that her travels with the Doctor might end abruptly. She made a guidebook for the companion(s) that would succeed her, with information on the Doctor, the TARDIS, and most alien creatures she encountered. Influenced by her profession, her guidebook included tests and a certificate of completion. She hid the book \"in the one place in the TARDIS that [she] knew the Doctor would never look\". (PROSE: The Companion's Companion [+]Craig Donaghy, Official Guides (Penguin Group, 2017).)\n\nAfter Clara saved the Doctor from a marriage to a sentient plant on the \"second most beautiful garden in all of time and space\", they received a call from Rigsy, who had lost a day of memory and had a strange tattoo on the back of his neck. The Doctor and Clara found that the tattoo which was counting down was a chronolock counting down to Rigsy's death, because of Rigsy being accused of murder in the trap street. Clara willingly took Rigsy's chronolock to buy time, but this changed the terms of Ashildr's agreement with the Quantum Shade, and Ashildr was not able to remove it, because she had been cut out of the deal. Upon knowing the Doctor could not do anything to stop the inevitable, Clara told the Doctor not to let her demise change him, to be a doctor, and not to get revenge for her, and declared she would die and no one on Trap Street or anywhere else would suffer. The Doctor asked how he would cope with her death, and Clara replied they would both have to be brave. She chose to face her end on her own and wished the Doctor goodbye, trying to be as brave as she knew how to be. The Quantum Shade then flew to kill her. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nThe moment before her death, a later version of the Doctor had the Time Lords use an extraction chamber to freeze Clara in the moments between one heartbeat and another before her death and take her to Gallifrey. The Eleventh General, believing Clara was there to help locate the Hybrid, tried to tell her that she was not really alive and would have to be returned to her own time to die after they were done with her help, but the Doctor overpowered the General and grabbed his gun. After the General refused to let them go, the Doctor made sure he could regenerate and then shot him, taking a neural block calibrated for humans with him as he fled with Clara.\n\nThe two fled into the Cloisters and the Doctor informed Clara of his time in his confession dial and his history with the Cloisters. Clara was horrified to realise it had been a very long time for the Doctor since she died and he had changed. Clara confronted the Twelfth General and Ohila and demanded to know how long the Doctor had been in the confession dial, learning it was four and a half billion years. She was struck speechless when she realised the depth of his caring for her. At that moment, Clara realised that she and the Doctor should say certain things to each other. After whispering a message to him, Clara turned to the General and Ohila. She refused to reveal what she had told the Doctor, except to indicate that she was a distraction so the Doctor could escape and steal another TARDIS. The Doctor materialised a new TARDIS around Clara and the Doctor and Clara fled Gallifrey.\n\nBelieving that Clara's heart would restart once they were away from Gallifrey, the Doctor was stunned to realise it hadn't. Desperate, he took her to the last five minutes of the universe, believing her heart would restart. It did not, and Clara became concerned when the Doctor shouted at her in frustration. When the Doctor left the TARDIS to talk to Ashildr, Clara used the Doctor's sonic sunglasses to activate the TARDIS scanner and watched as the Doctor and Ashildr discussed the Hybrid and Ashildr's theory that it was the Doctor and Clara together since they would do anything, including fracture time to save each other. Hearing that the Doctor planned to wipe her memory of him, Clara reversed the polarity of the neural block using the glasses. When the Doctor returned, she challenged the Doctor over his plans, demanding to be allowed to keep her memories and informing him of her sabotage. The Doctor relented, but indicated that their relationship had become too dangerous; the Doctor decided it was for the best that they were separated. Uncertain as to whether she had actually been able to reverse the polarity of the device, Clara and the Doctor agreed to push the button together and let fate decide. The Doctor and Clara activated the neural block and the Doctor's memory of Clara was erased. Before passing out, the Doctor gave Clara several pieces of advice as to how to be her own Doctor. Clara flew the TARDIS to Nevada where she dropped the Doctor off and told a man to look out for him. She then subsequently travelled to London and used the TARDIS to retrieve the Doctor's TARDIS.\n\nSoon, Clara and Ashildr piloted their TARDIS to Nevada and used its chameleon circuit to have it take on the form of an American roadside diner. Somehow, the Doctor found himself at the diner. Clara, dressed as a waitress, listened to the Doctor's story of what happened to her and how he couldn't remember much beyond her name and bits of their adventures together. Though the Doctor believed he would recognise her if he met her, he didn't and Clara was devastated. During his visit, the Doctor played a romantic melody. Hearing him play this tune, and realising she had lost the Doctor, Clara suggested that perhaps memories become songs when they are forgotten. With the Doctor turned away and distracted by his playing, Clara opened a door at the rear of the diner, and dematerialised around the Doctor, leaving him with his own TARDIS next to him and a message on his chalk board inside stating \"run you clever boy and be a doctor.\"\n\nFlying off, Ashildr informed Clara that their chameleon circuit was stuck and their TARDIS was stuck in the form of an American diner. Clara's heart hadn't restarted and she realised that her death was a fixed point in time and she had to die. However, Clara noted that she was now effectively immortal so she had some \"wiggle room\". Clara decided to return to Gallifrey to have the Time Lords return her to her death, but to go there \"the long way around\", going on more adventures with Ashildr. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nMe and Clara were travelling in their TARDIS when Clara was compelled to return to Nevada in temporally-abnormal circumstances and met the Twelfth Doctor during his travels with Bill Potts. After seeing a younger version of herself, also brought here by the temporal anomalies, destroy a Dalek in a way which the Doctor found \"disturbing\", the immortal Clara wryly stated that she had done \"much worse\" since, but the Doctor urged her not to elaborate. After joining the Doctor on an expedition to the Underhenge, Clara parted ways with him again and returned to the diner TARDIS. Standing in the \"diner\" room, the two women agreed to try and disentangle themselves from the Doctor's timeline, and, to do so, set a course for the most boring place Me knew, and thus the least likely to be visited by the Doctor: the Minyan ship. (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).)\n\nAfter Willa Twiston was saved from death by the Thirteenth Doctor, Willa joined Clara and Me on their travels. (PROSE: The Witchfinders [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn his book concerning the saving of Gallifrey at the end of the Last Great Time War, the Curator (an aged incarnation of the Doctor from the distant future) related that Clara Oswald, who therefore \"knew him of old\", often popped round for tea. Out of courtesy for Clara, the Curator pretended not to know who Clara really was and how he knew her. While reflecting on whether the Tenth Doctor had really married Elizabeth I (the competing hypothesis being that Elizabeth had instead tricked him into a false ceremony to tether him to her), the Curator asked Clara if she thought the Doctor could have been so easily bamboozled. Clara answered that she agreed it sounded far-fetched, but knew from personal experience that Elizabeth was \"a fantastic kisser\". (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nDespite the Doctor's attempt to change history, the death of Clara Oswald on the trap street in London became an established historical fact and a fixed point in time, a fact she had recognised upon setting out on her travels with Ashildr; she intended to someday return to Gallifrey and be put back into her time-stream by the Time Lords so that her death could proceed (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) as witnessed by the Twelfth Doctor in the Trap Street, her body falling lifeless onto the cobblestones. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nLike all of humankind, Clara was extracted from the point of her final death by the Testimony Foundation and her memories uploaded to the Testimony, giving her a new lease of life in New Earth's manmade \"heaven\". (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nA short time prior to the Twelfth Doctor's regeneration, Bill Potts, by then a part of the Testimony herself, decided to \"prove to him how important memories were\". She gave him a kiss on the cheek that restored his memories of Clara, following which the Doctor was able to exchange a few words with an apparition of Clara standing in front of him. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) Bill had allowed Clara to take her place inside the glass avatar she was occupying, (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) noting that the glass avatars \"could be everyone… were everyone\". Before disappearing, Clara ordered the Doctor not to forget her again, joking that his having done so the first time around was \"frankly offensive\". (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) Upon regaining his memories of Clara, the Doctor believed that she had faced her raven in the end, but doubtless in a surprising way and with style. He also thought that Clara might have defeated that raven and eventually found an entirely different one that ultimately claimed her. The Doctor noted that Clara was \"smirking as if she had, anyway\". (PROSE: Twice Upon a Time [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Twice Upon a Time (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nDuring the period when he was searching for the original Clara, the Eleventh Doctor painted a detailed portrait of the Clara Oswin Oswald echo. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Shortly after meeting Clara, the Doctor wrote about how \"nothing [made] sense about [her]\" in his diary; he considered asking her for answers and if he was being led into a trap. (PROSE: The Doctor's Diary [+]Moray Laing, The Official 50th Anniversary Annual (Penguin Group, 2013). Page 9.)\n\nRigsy later painted a memorial for her on the TARDIS doors, which included a portrait of Clara. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) It was still there when Clara and Ashildr dropped off the TARDIS in Nevada for the Doctor, but the Doctor had now forgotten her. As the TARDIS dematerialised, the mural he painted disintegrated, (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) though some flakes of paint remained from the portrait. (TV: The Husbands of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2015 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nAfter Clara's death, the Twelfth Doctor continued to speak to her and ask her what she would do while he was inside his confession dial. He had hallucinations of writings on the TARDIS blackboard writing by itself and briefly, an apparition of Clara herself. She told the Doctor to \"Get up off your arse, and win.\" A \"very old\" painting of Clara also appeared inside the tower in the Doctor's confession dial. (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhile visiting the diner in Nevada, the Doctor began playing a melody that he apparently composed. The song, he said, was titled \"Clara\". Later, Clara suggested that some memories become songs when they are forgotten, in reference to this piece of music. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhen a Time Lord author reflected on the events surrounding the coup against Rassilon and the Doctor's latest absconding of Gallifrey, he theorised that the Doctor's love for Clara caused the two of them together to be the Hybrid of Gallifreyan legend. (PROSE: A Brief History of Time Lords [+]Steve Tribe, BBC Books (2017).) By the era of the Last Great Time War, the Time Lords already knew of Clara, recording her as a temporal anomaly in the records of the Matrix, albeit one that had been keeping the Doctor alive. (PROSE: Dalek Combat Training Manual [+]Richard Atkinson and Mike Tucker, BBC Books (2021).)\n\nWhile the Doctor recalled saving Jess Collins' life in Highgate Cemetery and having prevented the Corvids from being unleashed on Earth, he failed to remember that Clara was with him at the time. Jess mentioned that if it wasn't for the Doctor and Clara, Jess would be dead. The Doctor was also unclear as to who Jess was referring to when she asked him where Clara was. (COMIC: The Pestilent Heart [+]Mark Wright, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2016).)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor specifically noticed the name \"Oswald. C.\" on a Roll of Honours board at the renovated Coal Hill Academy. (TV: For Tonight We Might Die [+]Patrick Ness, Class television stories series 1 (BBC Three, 2016).)\n\nClara's association with the Doctor was such that when Sonny Robinson created Time Surgeon, based on urban legends about the Doctor, the eponymous character's assistant, Nurse Kara, was based on Clara. When the Mindmorphs telepathically attacked the Twelfth Doctor, his repressed memories of Clara were roused but he remained unable to fully recall her. (COMIC: Invasion of the Mindmorphs [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nSomewhat contradictorily, a character called Clara appeared in the BBC science fiction/drama series, Doctor Who. (TV: In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., WC: The Zygon Isolation [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (BBC, YouTube, 2020).)\n\nWhilst communicating with his previous and immediate future selves via the TARDIS' telepathic circuits, the Twelfth Doctor responded with bewilderment upon hearing the Eleventh Doctor mention Clara. (WC: Doctors Assemble! [+]James Goss, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (2020).)\n\nWhen the Doctor was about to wipe the memories of Bill Potts, Bill asked how he would feel if someone did it to him. The Doctor then told Bill to leave before he changed his mind before later inviting her to join him on his travels. (TV: The Pilot [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) Shortly before regenerating, the Doctor briefly recalled Clara's face, without knowing whose face it was. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nClara, along with Willa Twiston and Ashildr, became one of the Three Norns or Fates of mythology. (PROSE: The Witchfinders [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Encyclopedia Gallifreya contained files on Clara and all of her splinters directly encountered by the Doctor. (PROSE: Citation Needed [+]Jacqueline Rayner, The Target Storybook (2019).)\n\nClara's copy of 101 Places to See and her leaf eventually were entered into the Black Archive by Dr Shaw (WC: INCOMING TRANSMISSION [+]Time Lord Victorious (Immersive Everywhere, 2021).) in the 2020s. (WC: 14681 UNIT Field Log [+]UNIT Field Log (YouTube, 2020)., etc.)\n\nWhen the Toymaker performed a puppet show about the fates of the Doctor's companions, he featured a puppet of Clara and abridged her death as her having been \"killed by a bird\". The Fourteenth Doctor countered that she was still alive in the last second of her life. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nBecause of her interaction with the Doctor's timeline, Clara Oswald met the Doctor in many forms. She met and saved the lives of the Doctor's first twelve incarnations (excluding his war incarnation). She noted, however, that he rarely ever noticed her. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Though Clara and the Doctor initially believed that all of the splinters had died after saving the Doctor, they later learned that this was not the case and that many had lived their own lives. (COMIC: Blood and Ice [+]Jacqueline Rayner, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2015).) Ultimately, the Great Intelligence found Clara's splinters stopping it at every turn, weakening it more and more each time. After Clara stopped it from interfering in the London Event, (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).) the Intelligence's first defeat by the Doctor, (TV: The Web of Fear [+]Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1968).) the Great Intelligence realised that wherever it went Clara would be there to stop it and so it jumped into the Brigadier's time stream instead where she could not follow it. Greatly weakened by Clara's efforts, the Great Intelligence was eventually destroyed once and for all by the Brigadier. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).)\n\nClara was a very feisty, jolly, clever and altruistic young lady with a sharp wit and a thirst for adventure. During her first encounter with the Doctor from her point of view, she was somewhat reserved and didn't reveal her true feelings easily. Although she was noted for being very clever, she had no computer skills at first, only becoming a computer genius after being uploaded into the Wi-Fi by a Spoonhead. She was wary of the Doctor at first, believing him to be some kind of internet freak. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She was also very good at looking after children. She followed Merry Gejelh, a small lost child, to help her find her way. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) However, she thought things through carefully at first, as shown when she didn't instantly agree to join the Doctor on his adventures and told him to come back the next day. Clara was also quite cautious at first and was unsure what to make of the Doctor's bizarre personality. Clara was flirtatious, but during her first adventure with the Doctor, she seemed to react to situations rather than initiate them, unlike her other more proactive incarnations. She seemed touched that the Doctor was guarding her, although she was unsure what the danger was. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) As time went on, however, and she adapted to life with the Doctor, she developed a reckless streak; when the Doctor told her that that anything could happen to her when travelling with him, she merely replied; \"That's what I'm counting on.\" She also became more curious, as shown when she opened a door with an explosion, which she admitted to herself was a bad decision. (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara often displayed tendencies that led her to be labelled by the Doctor as \"bossy\" (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and a \"needy game player\" and a \"control freak\". (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Clara took great exception to this after being told the latter, denying that she was a \"control freak\" several times, but at one point uttering \"Nothing is more important than my egomania.\" While under the influence of Trenzalore's truth field, however, Clara admitted that she was, in fact, a control freak. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara had close relationships with her mother and father, and kept the leaf that had started their relationship for many years after her mother's death. Clara had a great strength of character and was very brave and selfless, even more so than the Doctor at times. She was easily willing to give up things extremely important in order to save people she hardly knew. Although she was frightened of Akhaten, she showed great courage by standing up to it and helping the Doctor defeat it. She gave up both her leaf and her mother's ring in order to defeat the Old God, although she later got the ring back. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Clara's selfless and loyal nature led her to make a huge sacrifice for the Doctor by jumping into his time stream to save him from the wrath of the Great Intelligence, even after River Song told her that her real self would die, leaving only echoes. The Doctor shortly thereafter jumped in to save her. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Her selflessness was reflected by her echoes, especially her Dalek-self who brought down the shields of the Dalek Asylum, allowing the Doctor to complete his mission of shutting the shield and escaping with Amy and Rory; even when she ended up among many who got destroyed by the Dalek Parliament. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nClara was also very caring and compassionate. She felt genuinely sorry for the Ice Warrior Grand Marshal Skaldak when she was told about the death of his daughter and later managed to convince him not to destroy the Earth by reminding him of how many daughters he would kill. (TV: Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She was also disgusted by Winifred Gillyflower's abuse of her daughter, Ada, (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and comforted Porridge when he said he felt like a monster. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She also assured Robin Hood that he would be reunited with his love, an instinct that turned out to be correct. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara was willing to stand up to people to defend her rights and was annoyed on being seen as anything less than a person. When the Doctor later revealed that she reminded him of a \"friend\" who had died (actually the Victorian-era version of Clara herself), Clara told him that she would be happy to travel with him, but not if she were viewed as a ghost of someone else. She said that she was a separate, unique individual, and wanted to be treated as such. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Clara again showed her annoyance of being seen as a \"ghost\" by the Doctor when the two travelled throughout the Earth's history and the Doctor compared life in the TARDIS to being outside of time. She felt rather emotional about seeing the entire life cycle of Earth and wondered if her body was in the ground somewhere. (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Her willingness to defend her rights was also shown when she scolded the Twelfth Doctor for abandoning her and forcing her to make an extremely difficult decision about whether or not to let the creature that emerged from the Moon live, especially since he knew all along that the creature was harmless. She claimed that he wasn't right to throw her to the same bag with other people and that, since he breathed their air, it was his responsibility to help them out when they needed it. (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) However, she realised she'd crossed the line in misjudging the Doctor, (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and in her hypocrisy in lying to Danny. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara initially had a low opinion of the Doctor's TARDIS, calling her a \"grumpy old cow\", in reaction to the TARDIS' apparent suspicion of her. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Clara once confided to the Doctor that she felt the TARDIS was looking at her. However, she did try to be civil to the TARDIS, unless she was frustrated or desperate like when the Doctor was trapped in a pocket universe and apologised when she shook water all over her floor from her umbrella. (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She later kissed the TARDIS console when she thought that the TARDIS had brought her to the control room. (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) After sacrificing herself for the Doctor on Trenzalore, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Clara finally managed to earn the TARDIS' respect and trust, being the only person apart from the Doctor known to be able to open and close her doors with a snap of her fingers. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) The TARDIS also extended its shields to protect her when she hung on to return to the Doctor, despite the fact that doing so slowed the TARDIS's travel severely. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara was quite observant, being the first person to notice that the ghost in Caliburn House was always in the same position and easily recognising a romantic attraction between two people, saying that Alec Palmer's feelings for Emma Grayling stuck out like \"a big chin\". (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Clara's keen sense of observation made her the first person to realise that Sweetville had a chimney that didn't blow smoke. She was also very resourceful and could use anything to her advantage, as shown by her use of a chair to smash Winifred Gillyflower's machine. Her resourcefulness was even enough to impress the Doctor, who remarked that \"chairs are useful\". (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Clara also had a knack for playing politics, as shown when she reminded Skaldak that he listened to her when she begged him to spare Grisenko's life (TV: Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and convinced the Half-Face Man that killing her would not help him in the slightest. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara was happy to try alien food in the Festival of Offerings, though she was disgusted with her first sampling. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She could frequently be found making and drinking tea, (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) but considered whisky to be \"the eleventh most disgusting thing ever invented\". (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She did, however, drink wine on occasion, both socially (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and by herself. (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nWhen alone, Clara would sometimes talk to herself. (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nHer curiosity once led her to learn the Doctor's true name, although she forgot it when the Doctor rewrote time. Clara was terrified when she was cornered by a mysterious zombie creature, and after the Doctor rescued her she punched him on the arm. She was shocked and devastated when she realised the burning zombie that had chased her was herself from an alternate reality. (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhen left in charge of a group of soldiers by the Doctor, Clara showed that she was a natural leader, adapting to the situation very quickly and keeping the soldiers in line. However, she did seem unprepared for the possibility of someone disobeying and betraying her. She was a good strategist and could use anything available to her advantage, using a cable to electrocute Weapons-Grade Cybermen in a moat, although this idea failed due to the Cybermen's ability to upgrade their defences on the spot. Clara was very protective of Angie and Artie Maitland and at one point even referred to them as \"my children\", suggesting that she considered them to be her daughter and son, despite Angie constantly pointing out that she wasn't their mother. Clara was also humble and had no interest in being the queen of the universe, gently refusing Porridge's offer of marriage. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nDespite their rather uneasy start, Clara and the Eleventh Doctor formed a strong bond very quickly. She also showed great trust in the Doctor, even after Emma Grayling warned her that he had \"a sliver of ice in his heart\". (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She viewed him as her best and most trusted friend, even going so far as to sacrifice her own life for his safety. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Throughout their adventures, Clara and the Doctor apparently never discussed the Doctor's attraction to Clara, and she appeared to appreciate the signs of affection he occasionally showed her, (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) although she once said in one of their earlier adventures that she didn't see the Doctor as a love interest. (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) The idea of personal space was constantly forgotten between the two of them. After the events that transpired at his tomb at Trenzalore, Clara and the Eleventh Doctor apparently grew much closer and trusting to each other, with the latter showing an enormous amount of trust in Clara. Although Clara was aware that he had wiped out his own people and the Daleks to end the Time War, she had never been able to picture his eleventh incarnation doing it and persuaded him to reconsider the decision he made that day. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) She often poked fun at the Doctor with a flirtatious undertone, rather enjoying seeing him squirm. (PROSE: Shroud of Sorrow [+]Tommy Donbavand, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2013)., TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Clara later admitted she fancied the Doctor while under the influence of a Truth Field, and refused to accept his impending death. Her pleading to the Time Lords to help caused them to intervene and save the Doctor by granting him more regenerations. However, his regeneration saddened her deeply, as she had formed a strong bond with this particular incarnation of the Doctor and the idea of the Eleventh Doctor dying distressed her greatly. Before he changed, she reached out for him and begged him not to change. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) The Twelfth Doctor later indicated that the Eleventh Doctor thought of himself as Clara's boyfriend as the Twelfth Doctor clarified to Clara that \"I'm not your boyfriend\" and that it wasn't her mistake he was referring to when he said that. At the same time, Clara told him that she never thought the Doctor was. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara viewed the Eleventh Doctor as \"her\" Doctor and shared a strong bond with him. However, this later transpired as a problem when his next incarnation proved to be vastly different than his predecessor. Clara appeared to be in slight denial of his regeneration and struggled for a while with losing \"her\" Doctor. She also appeared to have been ready to stop travelling with the Doctor after his regeneration and her first adventure together with the new Doctor, claiming that she \"[wasn't] sure who the Doctor [was] any more\". However, the Eleventh Doctor phoned Clara, reassured her about his next incarnation and said his goodbyes to her. This led to Clara finally accepting the new Doctor and agreeing to stay on with him. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) However, she still took some time to get used to the new Doctor. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nHowever, over time she grew very close to the new Doctor to the point where she found herself often choosing his company over that of Danny while trying to balance her relationships with both. For a time, she actually travelled with the Doctor without telling Danny, who was under the impression that she had broken up (in Danny's words) with the Time Lord. (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Clara's relationship with the Doctor deepened after Danny's death; she willingly rejoined him in his travels, (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) on one occasion challenged the Doctor to not give up during a situation by saying \"if you love me in any way, you'll come back\"; (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and while early on Clara would occasionally slap or threaten to slap the Twelfth Doctor (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).), by the time of her final adventures she had taken to stroking his face affectionately instead (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and the Doctor remembered this when he recreated Clara in his mind while trapped for billions of years in his confession dial. (TV: Heaven Sent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) The Twelfth Doctor, for his part, often expressed that he felt he had a \"duty of care\" towards the young woman, which initially annoyed her (TV: Under the Lake [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) though it became a statement of devotion when the Doctor gave this as his reason for spending billions of years on a plan to rescue her from death. Upon learning of this, Clara was thunderstruck and she told him something in private that she felt only people like she and him should say to each other; the nature of this conversation, following the Doctor's memory wipe, remained known only to Clara. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nClara was also heard to describe the Doctor as her \"hobby\", which annoyed him somewhat. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nShe wasn't a fan of boy bands in spite of Linda claiming that everyone her age was. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) In fact, she had had a poster of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius on her bedroom wall when she was fifteen. Related to this, Clara once angrily insisted to Madame Vastra that she \"never had the slightest interest in pretty young men\" when Vastra accused Clara of exhibiting ageism following the Doctor's regeneration. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara implied that her feistiness was partly due to her home town being Blackpool. When questioned by Sheriff of Nottingham in 1190, she told him that \"you can take the girl out of Blackpool\". (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara loved Sunday School but hated snakes. (PROSE: Into the Nowhere [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She also enjoyed reading books, as various tabletops in her room were covered with them. One of her favourite books was 101 Places to See, a keepsake book that previously belonged to her mother. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She was also an admirer of the children's novel Summer Falls by Amelia Williams. She had a keen interest to travel, as that was what she intended to do after her brief visit to the Maitlands, although after the children's mother died, she decided to stay and help look after the children in return. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Clara enjoyed baking too, determined to master her mother's soufflé frequently, although the results never turned out how she planned. She insisted that she would be \"soufflé girl\" and that \"the soufflé [wasn't] the soufflé; the soufflé [was] the recipe\", something that she had learnt from her mother, to which Angie Maitland reacted saying that she thought her mother was \"deep on puddings\". (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Likewise, she had trouble cooking a Christmas turkey for her family and had to call the Doctor for help. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) Clara showed an interest in the life of the pilot Amy Johnson, and her knowledge that Johnson's body had never been found allowed the Doctor to rescue her as she drowned. (COMIC: A Wing and a Prayer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She also enjoyed foreign or otherwise unconventional cinema that allowed her to broaden her horizons. (COMIC: Silver Screenesis [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nDespite her compassion and strong morals, her travels with the Doctor changed her, numbing her in a way to the requirements and challenges of a normal human life, such as when she declared Danny's death to be boring, (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) or when she eagerly jumped on the TARDIS to witness the solar storm, forgetting her duties to her students. (TV: In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She told Rigsy to forget George when he was taken by the Boneless. (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) When Clara used Rudy Zoom's mind and its absence of self-loathing as a weapon against the Umbra, she didn't know for certain if the plan would have worked but knew it was at least worth a try. The Twelfth Doctor, claiming that Clara wasn't aware of this, pointed out that she was \"definitely\" starting to think like him. (COMIC: The Eye of Torment [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Her grief over Danny's death drove her to the limits of her loyalty and enabled her to betray the Doctor's trust for personal gain; an action she regretted, believing that she had betrayed the Doctor which he acknowledged although he assured her that it didn't make a difference. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She also tried to kill Missy in revenge, only to be stopped by the Doctor and shown the monster she was becoming. After this incident, she made a vow to never compromise her kindness and honesty to others ever again. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nDespite her kind nature, Clara knew that occasionally it was necessary to not be kind. On several occasions she indicated a willingness to engage in deadly force when necessary, such as commanding a group fighting Cybermen, (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) being prepared to order UNIT snipers to shoot Missy during a later encounter, (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and she also once wielded a sword in battle. (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) In a rare documented example of her using deadly force, Clara, during a brief time when her mental abilities were augmented by the Doctor to the point where she developed a form of telekinesis, used said abilities to drop a chandelier on a Sea Devil, supposedly killing him. (COMIC: Clara Oswald and the School of Death [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nClara was acutely aware that one danger involving time travel was learning the circumstances of one's own demise. On at least two occasions (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) she became adamant that she not be given \"a preview\" of her death. From the time she was extracted from the trap street by the Doctor, however, she was thereafter aware of the exact time, place, and circumstances of her death. This had the effect of, if anything, decreasing her fear of death even further. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nOccasionally, Clara would speak without thinking through the consequences, uttering an offensive joke or remark when in the heat of a good moment. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nClara was an accomplished liar, which she occasionally used to her advantage, most notably when she lied to Danny about giving up travelling with the Doctor. (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and she also lied to the Doctor about being reunited with Danny so that the Doctor would be free to find Gallifrey without being tied down to her. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) She was also able to, for a time, successfully bluff a group of Cybermen into thinking that she was the Doctor by reciting facts about his life. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She eventually got to the point of boasting about her lying skills, though her attempt to use this ability against Bonnie backfired. (TV: The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nClara had strong control over her will, and during the time she was mentally linked to Bonnie, she was able to on several occasions physically manipulate the Zygon without Bonnie even being aware - most notably causing her to miss when firing a rocket at a plane carrying the Doctor, as well as making Bonnie send a text message to the Doctor without realising - and, during a direct confrontation, her will was strong enough to cause Bonnie to momentarily revert to Zygon form. (TV: The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She similarly used her willpower to try and fight off being taken over by the goddess Kali, causing the creature to momentarily lose control over her. (COMIC: The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nWhen emotional, Clara had the ability to make her dark eyes appear even larger. This was noted by the Doctor on numerous occasions (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., etc.) and on one occasion, he immediately sensed something was wrong when he saw her expressive eyes during a video call. (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nClara never adopted a \"catch phrase\", but she did have a tendency to use the word \"Seriously?\" as an inquisitive, often after the Doctor said or did something puzzling or unexpected. (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Witch's Familiar [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., etc.) Several of her incarnations experienced situation in which Clara felt lost, during which she would repeatedly shout \"I don't know where I am!\" (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., etc.)\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor once noted that Clara had a habit of smirking \"as if she [knew] something no one else knows\". (COMIC: The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nBoth Oswin and Clara Oswald were notable for their brilliant hacking skills. Clara gained the ability from being uploaded by a Spoonhead. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Oswin's hacking abilities were so great that she even managed to hack into the pathweb of the Dalek Empire and erase every memory of the Doctor, something that even the Time Lord himself was unable to do. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) Clara, despite apparently losing most of what the Spoonhead had uploaded, still possessed sufficient hacking skills to quickly and successfully use Jack Harkness' vortex manipulator to escape from the Zygons, despite having no prior apparent knowledge of the 51st century device. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) She later was able to instruct Danny Pink on how to activate the Doctor's invisibility watch, despite having only seen the Doctor do so once. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She also later gained the ability to use the TARDIS to retrieve data from a damaged mobile phone (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) though at one point she apparently did not know how to use the 21st century streaming media app iPlayer. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara's various incarnations were very good at looking after children. Her Victorian incarnation could change her accent easily and was able to play the part of both a London barmaid and a governess. Victorian Clara's fake accent would only slip when she was shocked or frightened, such as when the Ice Governess barged into the Latimer children's bedroom. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nClara quickly mastered the ability to pilot an unfamiliar alien vehicle, having previously only watched the Doctor piloting it. She demonstrated the ability to ride a Moped, (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and later obtained a motorbike. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013)., The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nClara was skilled at using some guns and was a good strategist. She could use anything around her to her advantage - such as when she suggested lowering an electric cable into a moat — but when she tried to attack a Weapons-Grade Cyberman with a mace, it just wrenched it out of her hands due to being cybernetically enhanced. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAt some point, Clara gained the ability to operate the TARDIS doors by snapping her fingers, an ability previously demonstrated only by the Doctor. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013)., The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She also learned how to pilot the TARDIS using its telepathic interface, becoming the first known companion to do so, though without the Doctor guiding her she wasn't accurate in her destinations - though she nonetheless was able to pilot the TARDIS to Gallifrey and a point early in the Doctor's lifetime. (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She later used the circuits again to pilot the TARDIS to a specific location in Paris in 1923, and managed pinpoint accuracy, though it would seem the TARDIS assisted her. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).) The Doctor began teaching Clara how to operate basic TARDIS functions early in their relationship (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and got to the point where the Doctor appeared comfortable enough to allow Clara to not only help operate the TARDIS (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., etc.) but fiddle with settings on the control console on her own. (TV: The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) After the Doctor passed out after erasing all memory of her, Clara displayed the ability to fly the stolen TARDIS back to her own time period and deposit the Doctor in Nevada without guidance from the Doctor or using the telepathic circuits, and later used her TARDIS to retrieve the Doctor's TARDIS and transport it to Nevada. While Ashildr consulted a manual for information on the TARDIS's functions such as its chameleon circuit, Clara was completely comfortable flying the unfamiliar TARDIS, planning to have adventures of her own with Ashildr before going to face her death. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nAt some point during her encounters with the Paternoster Gang, Clara learned the art of lockpicking from Jenny Flint. (PROSE: The Crawling Terror [+]Mike Tucker, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) During her time with the Doctor, she learned self-defence skills, as demonstrated when she used her fencing skills to defeat a robot possessed by Rann-Korr with a ski pole, (COMIC: Terrorformer [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).) and when she stated that she had been learning tae kwon do after school, though she had little opportunity to display her skills. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., COMIC: The Hyperion Empire [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) She was later said to be aiding her students in learning the martial art. (TV: The Woman Who Lived [+]Catherine Tregenna, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Clara also once used a sword in battle. (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She was also a skilled swimmer, able to dive to the bottom of a lake to access the submerged TARDIS without breathing equipment. (COMIC: Clara Oswald and the School of Death [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nAt some point, Clara gained a measure of authority with UNIT due to her association with the Doctor. When the organisation was unable to contact the Doctor, they contacted her instead, and not only was her directions in lieu of the Doctor followed, but they even gave her authority to negotiate with Missy and command a team of UNIT snipers to the point of being authorised to order Missy to be shot. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She also similarly was granted authority to command UNIT soldiers. (TV: The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She was only one of four individuals granted access to the Black Archive following the peace agreement between the humans and Zygons and was one of only a handful of people aware of the nature of the Osgood Box and the presence of more than 20 million Zygons now living on Earth. (TV: The Zygon Inversion [+]Peter Harness and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nDue to being pulled from the time stream by means of an extraction chamber on Gallifrey, Clara became effectively immortal as her physical body, despite being able to move around and do anything a normal person does, was frozen in time between one second and the next, right before her death from the Quantum Shade, removing her ability to age and die as she had to go back to the trap street and face her death due to it being a fixed point in time. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nClara was a short, young Caucasian woman with big, brown eyes and long brunette hair that she usually kept down, but occasionally tied up in a ponytail or bun. During her final adventures with the Doctor, she trimmed her hair to a medium length which she would also ponytail on occasion. She also adopted a 1920s-style bob hairstyle briefly at one point, though this may have been a wig. (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Clara's appearance attracted the attention of Latimer, Porridge and the Sheriff of Nottingham. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Rosemary Kizlet and Emma Grayling also referred to her as pretty, (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and the Eleventh Doctor himself noted she was beautiful and showed that he was attracted to her when he said, \"A mystery wrapped in an enigma squeezed into a skirt that's just a little too... tight\" and smiled happily afterwards. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nShe appeared to usually wear very little makeup; the Twelfth Doctor was very confused when she had put some on for a date with Danny Pink, asking why she had coloured her face. (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She also was seen to wear heavier-than-usual makeup on occasion while teaching during her times when not travelling with the Doctor. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., The Zygon Invasion [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She wore a variety of jewellery including rings, bracelets, necklaces and earrings. Dresses were her main item of clothing, along with tights, jackets and skirts; including one done in crimson with a black collar, (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) one of Clan Campbell tartan. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) one in cherry with white symbols, (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) one in indigo with African symbols done in gold, (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and one in jade green. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She also wore a black cardigan, a white blouse, and a skirt of Clan Wallace tartan. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013)., Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Early in her travels with the Doctor, she regularly carried around a red bag that sometimes held her keepsake book that used to belong to her mother. As time went on, however, she no longer carried the bag or the book with her. On one occasion, Clara wore a plum purple trouser suit, a white shirt, and a black necktie for a date with Danny Pink. (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara was five feet and one inch tall, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) which was nearly a foot shorter than the Eleventh Doctor (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) and a \"very similar\" height to the Sontaran Strax, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) according to her Victorian incarnation and the Twelfth Doctor, respectively. The Eleventh Doctor referred to her as being small, (PROSE: Shroud of Sorrow [+]Tommy Donbavand, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2013).) while the Twelfth Doctor said that she was \"sort of small and roundish\" (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and realised her legs were much shorter than her predecessor, Amy Pond. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Wolf made a crack about Clara's height being about the same as one of Santa Claus' elves when he said it was hypocritical that someone of her height would say a \"racist\" remark towards elves, to which Clara reacted self-consciously. (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) According to Clara, she was average height. (PROSE: Shroud of Sorrow [+]Tommy Donbavand, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2013).) Upon seeing an image of Amy Pond for the first time, Clara was heard remarking in a mixture of jealousy and admiration about the length of the previous companion's legs. (HOMEVID: Clara and the TARDIS [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) During a brief period when she was taken over by the spirit of Kali, Clara temporarily grew to super-Amazonian height and grew two additional arms while her skin turned blue and she grew fangs. After returning to her natural state, Clara remarked that being tall was the only part of the affair she liked. (COMIC: The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nClara was not oblivious to her appearance and on several occasions acknowledged that she knew she was physically attractive, at one point accusing Madame Vastra of being attracted to her \"pretty face\" (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and joking with the Doctor, after correctly surmising the origin of the Morpheus machine's name, \"Oh yeah, not just this [indicating her face]\". (TV: Sleep No More [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) On one occasion where she had the rare opportunity to view an earlier version of herself from the rear, she expressed approval. (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Ashildr also told Clara shortly before her death that she was as beautiful as she was in photographs she had seen. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She once caught the attention of Leonardo da Vinci and was the original model for his famous painting, the Mona Lisa, which would go on to intersect with the Doctor's life on numerous occasions. The Twelfth Doctor indicated to Leonardo that the likeness wasn't very good, except for capturing Clara's perpetual smirk. (COMIC: The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nAfter his regeneration, the Twelfth Doctor often insulted her appearance, talking about her face being so wide she needed three mirrors in her bedroom, (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) suggesting she was \"built like a man\", (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and claiming to not notice how she'd made herself more attractive than usual for a date. (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Regardless of whether these statements were honest or meant in jest, eventually the Doctor stopped insulting Clara about her appearance and in fact paid her a public compliment by playing the opening guitar riff from Roy Orbison's \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" by way of signalling to her that he had seen her in a crowd of people. (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) He also acknowledged that her eyes were a feature he feared remembering if he ever lost Clara (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) and the last thing he wanted Clara to do before he passed out after wiping his memory of her was to smile. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nLike most companions, Clara's wardrobe varied, and after her first few adventures with the Doctor, was rarely seen wearing the same outfit twice except on occasions where one adventure led directly into the next. One notable exception was a leather jacket she began sporting in conjunction with her motorcycle riding. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) According to some accounts, however, she was also keen on a red sweater, blue skirts and dark tights outfit which she often wore during some of her more brief adventures with the Doctor (COMIC: Empire's Fall [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., etc.) She rarely wore revealing outfits, and opted for period-appropriate dress whenever possible. (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., COMIC: The Highgate Horror [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., etc.)\n\nUnlike many of her generation, Clara did not have a tattoo during her \"normal\" lifetime, though she indicated to Rigsy that she was interested in someday getting a small and discreet one. This was just before taking on the Quantum Shade timer on the back of her neck, which resembled a tattoo. (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) Aside from following the standard human custom of piercing her earlobes to wear jewellery, she also sported an additional \"helix\" piercing midway up the cartilage of her left ear in which she often wore a stud. The piercing became more visible after Clara cut her hair after the Dream crabs (Kantrofarri) incident. (TV: The Girl Who Died [+]Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., etc.)\n\nClara's footwear mostly consisted of boots and wedge trainers. Most notably, she wore Ash wedge trainers. (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015)., Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nClara was 24 years old at the time she first met the Eleventh Doctor. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Her age at the time of her death is uncertain, especially given her \"extended lifetime\" with Ashildr. Her chronology, however, suggests that she travelled with the Doctor for several years at minimum:",
