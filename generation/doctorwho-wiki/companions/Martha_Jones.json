  "content": "She met the Doctor when she was a medical student at Royal Hope Hospital in London when the hospital was transported to the Moon by Judoon troops, after which she began travelling with the Time Lord.\n\nShe fell in love with him and expressed her feelings to John Smith, hoping the Doctor would not remember her honesty, and again in the TARDIS before ceasing her travels with him. She stopped travelling due to this unrequited love and the toll The Year That Never Was had on her and her family, but did not cut him off, giving him a phone to contact her and promising that he would see her again. She continued to have a number of adventures, both with and without him, thanks to her work with UNIT and Torchwood.\n\nMartha also went on to marry Mickey Smith, and the two broke out on their own to become freelance alien fighters. She encountered the Doctor again before he regenerated, saving her life one more time from a Sontaran.\n\nMartha Jones was born on 14 September 1984 (PROSE: The Torchwood Archives [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) to Francine and Clive Jones. According to another account, she was born in 1986. She had an older sister named Tish, a younger brother, Leo, and a niece, Keisha Jones, who was Leo's daughter. (PROSE: The Frozen Wastes [+]Robert Shearman, The Story of Martha (2008).) Francine chose the name Martha simply because she liked the sound of it. (PROSE: Wooden Heart [+]Martin Day, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).) Martha grew up on the outskirts of London's sprawl. (PROSE: Peacemaker [+]James Swallow, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).) She decided to become a doctor when she grew up after an incident involving her brother when she was a child; once, Leo pushed her on a swing so hard that she flew off the seat and broke her arm. Going to the hospital and looking at X-rays fascinated her and inspired her to go into the medical field. (PROSE: The Frozen Wastes [+]Robert Shearman, The Story of Martha (2008).) Martha grew up with her mother when her parents divorced and was often forced to play peacekeeper in continual family arguments. Tish and Leo also lived with them, with Martha sleeping in their home's smallest room. (PROSE: Wooden Heart [+]Martin Day, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).) Martha devoured Annette Billingsley's The Troubleseekers, a thirty-two book series, around the age of eight; they were the first books that she ever read. She later read Harry Potter and His Dark Instruments. (PROSE: The Mystery of the Haunted Cottage [+]Derek Landy, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).) Martha had three trumpet lessons in Year 6 of primary school. (COMIC: House Pests [+]Jason Loborik, DWBIT comic stories (GE Fabbri Ltd, 2007).)\n\nWhen Francine invited guests to dinner, Martha and her sister were expected to \"perform\" for the guests by handing out nibbles while Francine bragged that Martha was going to be a leading surgeon. Martha hated the attention and it caused friction between her and Tish, who embraced the attention.\n\nPrior to meeting the Doctor, Martha attended a Mika concert in Denmark. (PROSE: The Pirate Loop [+]Simon Guerrier, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2007).)\n\nAt university, Martha was friends with Holly. After Holly's mother died, they lost touch. (AUDIO: The Last Diner [+]James Goss, The Year of Martha Jones (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nIn 2007, she lost her cousin Adeola Oshodi, who worked for Torchwood One, in the Battle of Canary Wharf. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) She would note that they had shared a resemblance. (PROSE: Made of Steel [+]Terrance Dicks, Quick Reads (BBC Books, 2007).)\n\nMartha first met the Tenth Doctor in the 2000s[nb 1] on her way to her job as a student doctor at the Royal Hope Hospital in London, where she was studying under Mr Stoker. Without introducing himself, the Doctor merely took off his tie and said, \"Like so, see?\", before walking off. Unbeknownst to Martha at the time, he was demonstrating the nature of time travel. She met him again at the hospital, where he was posing as a patient named John Smith, not realising that the man she saw earlier was a future version of him; she also listened to his heartbeat, discovering that he had two hearts, but stayed quiet about it.\n\nLater that same day the hospital was transported to the Moon by the Judoon. Calm while those around her panicked, Martha worked with the Doctor to track down the Plasmavore, \"Florence Finnegan\", for whom the Judoon were searching. During this encounter, the Doctor was quickly impressed with Martha's reasoning and intelligence, such as when she deduced that opening the windows wouldn't result in the air being sucked out; it would've happened already anyway if it were going to happen at all as the windows weren't airtight. Despite listening to his heartbeat, however, Martha was sceptical about him being an alien, until the Judoon's scanners confirmed that he wasn't human.\n\nAs the oxygen in the hospital ran out, Martha gave her last breaths to resuscitate the clinically-dead Doctor, who had thwarted Florence's plan. The Judoon returned the hospital to Earth. That evening, after another family argument at her brother Leo's party, a recovered Martha was approached by the Doctor, who revealed that he was a Time Lord and invited her to join him on what he initially described as a \"single trip\" through time and space in the TARDIS. (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor took Martha to 1599 where they met William Shakespeare, who flirted with her and called her his \"Dark Lady\". The three of them used a \"spell\" to defeat a trio of witch-like Carrionites who were using Shakespeare's play Love's Labour's Won as a spell to bring other Carrionites to Earth; Martha's use of the word \"Expelliarmus\" when Shakespeare was unable to think of the right word to end on proved vital in defeating them. The Carrionites, along with the play, were sealed away. (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nMartha's next trip was to New New York, where they landed in the Undercity. Learning the Doctor had also visited New Earth with Rose, Martha worried she was a \"rebound\" companion. Martha was kidnapped by a couple driving through the Motorway who wanted a third passenger to use an express lane; the three of them were later almost killed by the Macra, but escaped when the Doctor opened up the Motorway. After the two were reunited, Martha witnessed the death of the Face of Boe and heard his final words, \"You are not alone\". Before they departed New Earth, The Doctor told Martha about his home planet and the Last Great Time War. (TV: Gridlock [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor extended Martha's trip in the TARDIS yet again, going to 1930 New York City, where the two of them became entangled in a mystery and found the population of Hooverville being transformed into pig slaves (TV: Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) as part of the Cult of Skaro's plans to build a race of human-Daleks. (TV: Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) Martha and a group of Hooverville residents were abducted and nearly converted into human-Daleks, (TV: Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) but the Doctor created a loud noise and allowed the humans to escape. After the Doctor was escorted back to the Daleks to help them, the Doctor handed Martha his psychic paper and Martha went with Tallulah and Frank to the top floor of the Empire State Building, pretending to be engineers and an architect, and realised the Daleks had taken over the Empire State Building while working with Mr Diagoras and placed Dalekanium on the mast to power their experiment. While the Doctor got in the way of the lightning strike hitting the mast, Martha and Frank connected metal rods from the outside of the building to the lift shaft as the lightning struck the building, killing the pig slaves inside the lift which were chasing after the Doctor. (TV: Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nAfter the Cult of Skaro's defeat, the Doctor returned Martha home to twelve hours after she had left. He overheard a TV news story about a man promising to \"change what it means to be human\", and escorted her to the presentation of Prof. Richard Lazarus' rejuvenation device. Uncovering the disastrous effects of Lazarus' work, the Doctor, Martha, and her sister Tish helped to kill the monster Lazarus had become. Afterwards, the Doctor offered Martha one more trip, but she refused. She no longer wanted to be just a passenger, and so the Doctor invited her aboard the TARDIS, as a full-time companion. (TV: The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nFollowing a Calamity Lamp, the TARDIS landed on the planet Loam inside the head of a High Goliax, which was being controlled by a child called Kipe. Martha was separated from the Doctor when Kipe ejected her from the head. She was caught in a winged flying chariot piloted by Sugarpea, the planet's former prime minister who was responsible for having her world demolished after being unable to pay a loan to the Krib bank, who hoped to save the world. Martha, Sugarpea and Sweetleaf went to the Museum of Politics, but Sugarpea locked the others inside to sacrifice her life to end her debt to the Krib. She used a loophole in her contract with the Krib to become dictator of Loam, and nullify the planet's debt after being punished by the death penalty. Martha followed her to the Krib and reunited with the Doctor, but was unable to save Sugarpea. The Doctor and Martha ran through a space portal to a High Goliax head while followed by \"giant leggy things that used to be the insides of a computer\", which the Doctor went on to explain were the minds of the High Goliax finding their way home after being ripped from their skulls centuries before. After the children inside the High Goliax heads were evacuated, Martha told the planet's Prime Minister that it would be \"a good time to welcome your new immigrant population\". (COMIC: The Woman Who Sold the World [+]Rob Davis, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2007).)\n\nThey answered a distress signal in the 42nd century Torajii system: a ship falling towards the sun. The sun was a sentient being possessing the crew members and killing them off, and Martha herself was nearly jettisoned entirely from the ship when she took refuge in an escape pod. She later played an instrumental role in saving the ship when the Doctor found himself possessed as well. During this adventure, Martha had a brief romance with one of the ship's crew, Riley Vashtee. He wanted her to stay but she chose to remain with the Doctor. (TV: 42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor and Martha visited the Great Solar Shield, which was used to partially block sunlight from 21st century Earth to ease the effect of global warming. A race called the Silhouettes began leeching energy from the Shield and its crew. The colour in Martha's shirt scared off the Silhouettes, who instead began heading for Earth. The Doctor realigned the Shield's prismatic mirrors to refract a rainbow towards the Silhouettes, scaring them off. This caused the Silhouettes to flee and the Great Solar Shield's crew were returned to Earth in the TARDIS. (COMIC: Sunscreen [+]Jonathan Morris, Doctor Who Storybook 2008 (Doctor Who Storybook, Panini Comics, 2007).)\n\nTo escape the Family of Blood, who were hunting him, the Doctor used the Chameleon Arch to turn himself into a human with no memory or knowledge of the Doctor, containing his true self inside a fob watch. Before doing so, the Doctor recorded a video of instructions for Martha to follow so she might reference them in the future. He then became John Smith, a teacher at an English public school in 1913, where Martha took a job as a maid at the school to keep an eye on him, hiding the TARDIS in a shed. Martha watched helplessly as Smith fell in love with the school nurse, Joan Redfern, as he had not mentioned falling in love in his instructions. exclaiming he \"had to go and fall in love with a human and it wasn't [her]\". When the Family of Blood tracked them down after student Tim Latimer opened the fob watch, wreaking havoc on the town and school, Martha convinced John Smith to sacrifice his human life and love by reverting to the Doctor. He defeated the Family of Blood, left a heartbroken Joan and rejoined Martha in the TARDIS. (TV: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)./The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nWhen the Doctor used a time machine to follow time assassins from 27th century Mars to 21st century London, Martha received a phone call from the Doctor in the past telling her that he had saved the Mayor of London's lineage from being destroyed, but the assassins had found him. Assisted by DI Moloch, Martha attacked a time assassin controlled laboratory to reverse the controls of the time machine that brought the Doctor back in time. After returning to the 27th century, the Doctor destroyed the unsafe time machine to prevent anyone else from fiddling with it. (COMIC: Bus Stop! [+]Rob Davis, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor took Martha to Antarctica in 1915 to see the aurora australis. They met Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition near where the Endurance was trapped in the ice. When the biologist Robert Clark had begun turning into a Skith after being in contact with a whale whose DNA was altered by the Skith, a group including the Doctor, Martha, and some of Shackleton's crew followed Clark to the Skith ship Oppressor One. The Skith imprisoned the group and prepared to study and dissect them, but after Shackleton got through to Clark, Clark released them. Martha brought most of the group apart from the Doctor and Shackleton back to the Endurance in the TARDIS, and watched as the Doctor and Shackleton sent the Oppressor One into the sun. Martha reversed the controls of the TARDIS to head back to the Oppressor One and rescue the Doctor and Shackleton. (COMIC: The First [+]Daniel McDaid, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2007).)\n\nAt some point, while dealing with \"four things and a lizard\" in London minutes before the Red Hatching in the 2000s,[nb 2] the Doctor and Martha met Sally Sparrow, who seemed to know them; however, Martha and the Doctor did not know her yet. Sally gave the Doctor and Martha a folder full of photographs and other documents; claiming that they would need it in the future. (TV: Blink [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow (Steven Moffat), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nSome time later, after a brief adventure on a planet filled with fictional characters, (PROSE: The Mystery of the Haunted Cottage [+]Derek Landy, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).) Martha and the Doctor travelled to Wester Drumlins in the 2000s, where Weeping Angels sent them back to London in 1969, with the TARDIS stuck in the 2000s. (TV: Blink [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow (Steven Moffat), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nWith her and the Doctor stranded, Martha took a job as a shop girl at a London clothes shop called Face Fashion. During one of her shifts, she was visited by the Thirteenth Doctor, who was hoping to figure out why she had been bought back to this time and place. After the Doctor took her for tea and ultimately revealed her identity to her, Martha and the Doctor investigated the sudden appearance of the Autons in London. The Tenth and Thirteenth Doctors were eventually forced to meet and, with the help of Martha and the Thirteenth Doctor's friends, they discovered the Nestene Consciousness below the River Thames. Luckily, a Weeping Angel had followed them, and it sent the Consciousness back in time, ending a new invasion after it had barely began. (COMIC: A Little Help from My Friends [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2020).)\n\nWhen Billy Shipton was sent back to 1969, he was welcomed by Martha and the Doctor. From there, the Doctor, with Billy's aid, helped Sally Sparrow recover the TARDIS in the future, finally enabling them to leave 1969. She briefly appeared in the video message the Doctor had made for Sally, complaining that the Doctor promised her all of space and time but she had to work in a shop to support him, before apologising for bursting in. (TV: Blink [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow (Steven Moffat), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor and Martha landed at Research Base Truro, where they found the dead bodies of aliens after something \"terrible\" had happened. Unknown to them, the aliens had killed each other after assuming the Doctor was among them following the death of Kraarn in an electrical accident. (COMIC: Death to the Doctor! [+]Jonathan Morris, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2007).)\n\nAt some point, the Doctor and Martha took a quick jaunt to Atlantis. They initially wanted merely to visit, but when the Doctor detected the presence of vortex manipulator signals, they rushed to their source only to be confronted with River Song, time-travelling archaeologist and the Doctor's future wife. The Doctor was surprised to hear River call him \"sweetie\" and call herself his wife, and River realised this was an earlier version of the Tenth Doctor than she was meant to encounter. As a result, before making her escape, she \"slapped a Memory Worm on [him] while [he was]n't looking\", causing him — but not Martha — to forget the encounter. (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).)\n\nAn energy stream from a distress beacon forced the TARDIS down to a planet, where a girl called Cora had been attacked in the woods by a beast. After returning Cora to the village, Martha had discovered the villagers had similar bite marks on them and were anaemic. The bio-mechanical beast, Viktor, tried taking both the Doctor and Martha to the Thane's castle, but Gideon freed the Doctor. Martha realised that the Thane had unwittingly given the villagers septicaemia from his biopsy device. When the Doctor and Gideon arrived, Martha tried and failed to stop the Doctor from destroying the neuropathic generator that was pacifying the Khamirae villagers, but also prevented them from transforming into beasts. After the Doctor destroyed the generator, Gideon and the rest of the villagers began transforming into bestial forms. When the Doctor knocked out Gideon, he realised that the Thane and Viktor were using DNA samples from the villagers to extend the Thane's lifespan so they could continue watching over them after repeated cloning of the Thane degraded his pattern. Martha held off the attacking Khamirae as the Doctor repaired the generator at the cost of Viktor's life. The Doctor suggested to the Thane to lower the output of the generator every so often so the Khamirae could control their transformations. The Thane refused to clone himself any further and decided to spend the remainder of his life letting the Khamirae come to terms with who they truly were. (COMIC: Universal Monsters [+]Ian Edginton, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2008).)\n\nWhile the Doctor tried tracing an etheric beam in a town centre, Martha relaxed at a coffee shop. She watched people walk past, and noticed the same identical old woman appearing to walk past in different directions and in and out of different shops. Martha followed the old woman into an antiques shop, where she discovered twenty identical women, who were members of an alien species using etheric antennae to report to the fleet commander. Martha threatened the disguised aliens with one of their guns, and they stumbled into one another, causing one of them to drop its antennae. The aliens lost their etheric energy and were unable to contact their fleet. They were enveloped in a green light and vanished. (PROSE: Needle Point [+]Justin Richards, Doctor Who Files (2007).)\n\nThe Doctor and Martha travelled back in time to the creation of Stonehenge to figure out why it was there. They waited inside the TARDIS as it materialised for a few moments at the same time each year and had a series of snapshots taken with the TARDIS scanner for the Doctor and Martha to look at as the stone structures were set up over time. The Doctor found it fun but not very instructive. Though the Doctor and Martha refused to go outside the TARDIS, parking the TARDIS at the same spot each year during dawn at the summer solstice had unwittingly influenced the construction of Stonehenge. (PROSE: The Secret of the Stones [+]Justin Richards, Doctor Who Files (2007).)\n\nMartha was relaxing on the beach of a planet when she heard a voice call her name in the jungle. She saw faces in the water, on the ground and on the tree bark and leaves, all staring at her. Martha ran back to the beach, and the Doctor pulled her by the hand. The Doctor explained that the environment collapsed, causing one hundred years of acid rain, dissolving the planet's people and their civilisation, somehow making them into a collective mind that was part of the planet for millions of years. Because they had run out of stories, the world intended to make the Doctor and Martha join them as they had new stories to tell. The Doctor rushed Martha back to the TARDIS before the falling acid rain could hit them. (PROSE: The Planet That Wept [+]Justin Richards, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2008 (Doctor Who annual, 2007).)\n\nThe Doctor and Martha visited a fanatically religious planet about to be struck by an asteroid, (AUDIO: The Last Diner [+]James Goss, The Year of Martha Jones (Big Finish Productions, 2021).) and helped a group of miners in Nevada who had been forced to mine silver to repair an alien spaceship. (AUDIO: Silver Medal [+]Tim Foley, The Year of Martha Jones (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nFollowing a short pit-stop in Cardiff, and unknowingly picking up Captain Jack Harkness, the TARDIS took Martha and the Doctor to the end of the universe, and the planet Malcassairo. Martha was taken back by Jack's immortality before the two discussed the circumstances of Jack's last encounter with the Doctor, becoming increasingly jealous of Rose and concerned that she was going to be abandoned just as Jack was one day. After fleeing from the Futurekind, they stayed at Silo 16, where they encountered the last humans in the universe, who were assisted in reaching Utopia by Professor Yana, and Martha briefly befriended his assistant Chantho. An observant Martha noticed that the Professor had a watch similar to the Doctor's biodata module, prompting him to open it. The human Yana was transformed back into the Doctor's Time Lord nemesis, the Master, and escaped in the TARDIS. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nMartha, Jack, and the Doctor used Jack's vortex manipulator to travel back to 21st century Earth, arriving the day after Harold Saxon was voted Prime Minister. Mr Saxon was in fact an alias of the Master, who had been living on Earth for months since his departure from Malcassairo; the Doctor explained that, before the Master fled Utopia, he sabotaged the TARDIS by fusing the coordinates with his sonic screwdriver so that it could only travel between 21st century Earth and the end of the universe, adding that he could've only landed up to 18 months prior to the day they picked Jack up from Cardiff. The Doctor also constructed three perception filters using TARDIS keys in order to avoid detection, the three of them declared Earth's most wanted. The Master, who had been manipulating Martha's family since she became a full-time companion, had Francine, Clive, and Tish arrested, although Leo escaped, Martha calling and warning him before the Master could find him. As her family, Jack, and the Doctor were all taken prisoner aboard the Valiant, Martha teleported back to Earth with a mission to defeat the Master. (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nMartha knew what she had to do: spread the word of the Doctor. She first travelled from England to rebel camps in Europe, where she met the Brigadier's son Erik Calvin, and was later interned in a concentration camp in Japan. Throughout her travels she also visited the ruins of New York City, and fusion camps in China. (PROSE: The Story of Martha [+]Dan Abnett, The Story of Martha (2008).)\n\nIn America she visited the last diner and was reunited with Holly. To her surprise she was also reunited with her mother, claiming to have escaped the Valiant, however found her scepticism of the Doctor undermined her stories. She was encouraged when a large group gathered to hear her at the diner, however to her horror a rocket hit the diner before she entered, with Holly the only survivor. (AUDIO: The Last Diner [+]James Goss, The Year of Martha Jones (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nMartha, Holly and Francine travelled to Nevada to meet the Hope, the largest resistance group in America who were in contact with aliens. Martha disliked their system of competition to earn food, to their leader Jessie's annoyance, and told a story about her and the Doctor visiting a mine in the area a century earlier. After the camp's satellite camouflage was compromised, she helped perusade them to leave to a new camp and then set off to Las Vegas with Francine and Holly. (AUDIO: Silver Medal [+]Tim Foley, The Year of Martha Jones (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nMartha grew suspicious of Holly's behaviour on their way to Las Vegas and confided in Francine whilst they rested at a hotel. She became concerned about Francine's health, though she insisted she was fine, and they were attacked by Toclafane, exposing Holly as an agent of the Master in disguise. She and Francine were cornered by the Toclafane and their leader Miss Beecham, whose certainty Martha was there enabled her to see through the perception filter. To Martha's horror, Beecham revealed Francine was a clone, with the original still a prisoner, and killed her. Beecham subsequently interrogated Martha, wanting to know if she was building a way to kill the Master which Martha realised meant she was trying to replace him. Refusing to give in, Martha hid when the Master's forces arrived to capture Beecham for her treachery and was rescued from hanging over a ledge by the real Holly. She and Holly resolved to continue travelling together in America. (AUDIO: Deceived [+]Matt Fitton, The Year of Martha Jones (Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nAfter a year travelling around the world, she met fellow resistance member Tom Milligan. She had spent a year on Earth telling everyone to think of the Doctor at a specific time so the Master could be defeated. This plan worked; the Doctor, who had been previously aged several hundred years by the Master using his laser screwdriver combined with the research of Lazarus, returned to his original form and the Master was shot by his wife, Lucy Saxon. As a result of the destruction of the Master's paradox machine, only Martha, her family, and the people aboard the Valiant retained their memories of that year under the Master. Although the Doctor wanted her to stay with him, Martha felt her family needed her more. She also needed to get out of what she saw was an unhealthy relationship of her hoping the Doctor would finally notice her, and she stayed on Earth to complete her training as a doctor. To keep in touch, Martha gave the Doctor her phone, saying that she would call him when she needed him. (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nMartha was later recruited by UNIT, something that she and Captain Jack believed happened because the Tenth Doctor put in a good word for her; as Martha recalled, a woman from UNIT \"rang out of the blue\". She visited Torchwood Three in Cardiff as a UNIT officer, and soon became embroiled in their investigation of the Pharm, acting as an undercover agent. Mayflies were put into her body when she was discovered and captured, prompting Owen Harper to twice save her life: once with an alien surgical device to remove the Mayfly and soon after by taking a bullet meant for her. (TV: Reset [+]J. C. Wilsher, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nMartha witnessed Owen's return as an undead being through the resurrection gauntlet and gave him a posthumous physical. \"Death\", a force possessing Harper, made the gauntlet attack Martha which aged her considerably, but she reverted back again after Owen defeated the Death being. (TV: Dead Man Walking [+]Matt Jones, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nMartha also mended Harper's injured hand when, in a fit of self-destruction after Jack decided to relieve him of duty at Torchwood, he deliberately wounded it. She left once Owen Harper was returned to duty and resumed her work at UNIT. (TV: A Day in the Death [+]Joseph Lidster, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nBack at UNIT, she became engaged to her boyfriend, Thomas Milligan, though he left Britain for a while to go to Africa. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)./The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nMartha attended Owen and Toshiko Sato's funeral. Some time later, she was informed by Julia Swales of eleven people who had gone missing from CERN and called Jack for Torchwood's help after Julia too went missing and UNIT's own investigation was fruitless. She eventually found the missing people in a building absent from the site plans and discovered that Oliver Harrington, her boss, had been working with a neutron eater in the belief that he could get his late wife back. Harrington and the neutron eater were both killed in the Large Hadron Collider. (AUDIO: Lost Souls [+]Joseph Lidster, BBC Torchwood Audio Drama (BBC Radio, 2008).)\n\nWhen Ianto woke up as a woman, Jack sent several emails to Martha, who promised to look into it. (PROSE: Almost Perfect [+]James Goss, BBC Torchwood novels (BBC Books, 2008).)\n\nMartha called the Doctor when UNIT were about to attack the ATMOS factory which secretly formed a key part of a Sontaran invasion plan. She was working under the \"by-the-book\" Colonel Mace, who was in charge of the operation, and met the Doctor's companion Donna Noble. Contrary to the Doctor's expectations, the two got along very well, though Martha warned Donna how her own relationship with the Doctor had come at the expense of the wellbeing of her family, and advised her not to repeat her mistake.\n\nNot long after UNIT took control of the factory, Martha was kidnapped by two Sontaran-controlled soldiers and connected to a cloning pool to be copied. She was put to sleep but kept alive; her clone needed her clothes and access to her memories while helping the Sontarans. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nMartha's clone died soon after the Doctor rescued Martha and broke the connection, but Martha was able to convince the clone to help them. Before the clone died, it said Martha had many things she wanted to do and she should do them. While chatting with the Doctor and Donna after the Sontarans' defeat, Martha turned down the Doctor's offer to travel again with him. As soon as she had made her refusal clear, the TARDIS dragged them into the Time Vortex. (TV: The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nMartha walked out of the TARDIS onto the planet Messaline, remarking that even though she did not want to travel with the Doctor any more, she still loved the first step on a new planet. The Doctor was grabbed by human colonisers and his hand put in a Progenation machine, which created his \"daughter\", Jenny. Soon after, they were attacked by the Hath, which resulted in Martha becoming separated from the Doctor and Donna by a cave-in, and taken by the Hath. After helping the injured Hath Peck, and earning the Hath's trust, they showed her a map of their location. Martha, alongside Hath Peck, went onto the planet's surface in order to meet up with the Doctor and Donna. She slipped into a pit of killer quicksand, but Hath Peck saved her life by sacrificing his own.\n\nMartha found the Temple and was reunited with the Doctor, Donna, and Jenny. It was here they discovered what the humans and Hath were fighting over: the Source, a terraforming device which would make the planet's surface habitable. As the Hath and the humans appeared, the Doctor released the Source. General Cobb was enraged and shot at the Doctor, but Jenny leapt in the way of the bullet, and was killed instead. When the Doctor said that there was a possibility she would come back to life, Martha shook her head and confirmed she was dead. The Doctor returned Martha to Earth. She said a fond farewell to Donna and him, and went off to reunite with her fiancé, Thomas Milligan. (TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nMartha moved to New York after a promotion to the post of Medical Director on Project Indigo, a teleport device using recovered Sontaran technology. Whilst she was working at UNIT HQ in New York City, Earth was transported to the Medusa Cascade. When Daleks attacked the base, General Sanchez ordered Martha to use Project Indigo to escape and contact the Doctor. Sanchez also gave her an Osterhagen Key and ordered her to use it should the need arise. Project Indigo, which had never been tested, (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) was diverted by the time eddy created by the Crystal of Kronos, and Martha arrived in the crystal chamber in Atlantis. She made notes of the coordinates but, realising she was clearly in the wrong place, then activated Project Indigo again, thinking \"There's no place like home\". (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).) Tapping into her mind, Indigo delivered her back to her house, where she was greeted by her mother.\n\nHarriet Jones had created a low-level signal and contacted Martha, Torchwood and Sarah Jane Smith to assist Earth and defeat the Daleks. Together they contacted the Doctor and summoned him to help them to fight the Daleks. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nUnsure of whether the Doctor would come, Martha decided to use the Osterhagen Key. Leaving her mother, she teleported to Germany and a secret UNIT base, one of several Osterhagen Project activation points. Martha and two other UNIT operatives in other locations prepared to activate the Osterhagen Project, but first contacted the Crucible, warning the Daleks and Davros that she would use the key to destroy Earth rather than let it fall into their hands, giving them the chance to escape unharmed. They transmatted her to the Crucible, however, where she rejoined the Doctor, alongside Rose Tyler, Mickey Smith, Jackie Tyler, Jack, and Sarah Jane. After the arrival of Donna and the Meta-Crisis Tenth Doctor, they defeated the Daleks and their plans, and the Doctor's companions assisted the Doctor in piloting the TARDIS, towing Earth back to its solar system. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nAfter Earth was returned to its proper place, Martha exited the TARDIS with Jack Harkness, who offered her a job with Torchwood. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) She ultimately turned it down, feeling that there was too much sadness \"baked into the bay\" after the deaths of Owen and Tosh. (AUDIO: Dissected [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nMartha thought that her accidental discovery of Atlantis should be investigated by UNIT and returned there, calling for UNIT backup. Because of the time eddy caused by the Crystal of Kronos, it arrived not in the form of one of her contemporaries but of a young Liz Shaw straight from the mid-20th century. Together, they were confronted with a Sea Devil who explained that the temporal disturbances had awakened their colony, and that they were about to send out a signal to awaken all the other Sea Devils around the world. Martha and Liz convinced them to wait and negotiate, and called the Doctor for help using Martha's mobile phone. The Doctor who arrived was the Thirteenth Doctor. (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).)\n\nAround the time of Torchwood's Christmas party, Martha separated from Tom, hence why she did not attend. (AUDIO: Dissected [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) In 2009, Torchwood phoned Martha for her help identifying how to defeat the Vam. (PROSE: Risk Assessment [+]James Goss, BBC Torchwood novels (BBC Books, 2009).)\n\nOn her last day at a victim-retrieval station in Hereford, Martha agreed to perform an autopsy on Jonathan Dee for Gwen, although she was initially sceptical about the body coming under UNIT's jurisdiction. She reconnected with Gwen, telling her that she and Tom had broken up and that she missed the excitement that she got travelling with the Doctor. After blowing up the station to kill the chameleon, Martha took up Gwen's suggestion of faking her death and going freelance, (AUDIO: Dissected [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) eventually asking Mickey to join her. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nMickey agreed to go into freelance alien fighting, off the grid, with Martha and the two married, (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) going on their honeymoon by the time the 456 incident began. (TV: Children of Earth: Day One [+]Russell T Davies, Torchwood series 3 (BBC One, 2009).)\n\nOne adventure saw Martha and Mickey battle a Sontaran, Jask. Unknown to them, Jask had them cornered and was about to shoot them from a distance. The Doctor stepped in and knocked out Jask, saving them as his final gift to them prior to his next regeneration. Martha spotted the Doctor. She and Mickey called out to him, but he walked away without saying a word. As the TARDIS left, Martha embraced her husband sadly. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nAt some point, Sarah Jane Smith and Martha started to occasionally meet up for coffee. They became friends. Sarah Jane told Martha everything about her son Luke Smith. In 2010, Luke Smith was starting to get nightmares and didn't feel well. Sarah Jane thought that Martha could help and wanted to call her. However Luke told her that he was alright and Sarah Jane didn't call Martha. A short time later Martha and her husband Mickey came to Luke's farewell party after which Luke wanted to go the University of Oxford. (PROSE: The Nightmare Man [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nMartha called in the Eleventh Doctor to assist the Japanese branch of UNIT with investigating a mysterious beverage. This was Martha's first interaction with the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor. (COMIC: The Golden Ones [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 2016 she was transformed into a Gargoyle due to the effects of a wormhole passing through San Francisco. Mickey aided the Ninth Doctor to close the wormhole, which returned Martha to her normal state. (COMIC: The Transformed [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2016).)\n\nMickey and Martha attended Sarah Jane Smith's memorial on a \"bright, cold Spring day\" with their son August, where they discussed Sarah Jane with other guests, and helped fight the Jackals of the Backwards Clock to foil the Trickster's revenge plot. (WC: Farewell, Sarah Jane [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (YouTube, 2020).)\n\nIn 2022, Martha was one of many former allies of the Doctor who had recently gone mysteriously missing, including Graham, Ryan, Luke, Clyde, and Jo, (AUDIO: Hysteria [+]Juno Dawson, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).) due to a psychic virus infecting the Thirteenth Doctor and targeting people who had had contact with her. The Doctor and Cleo Proctor eventually restored the disappeared. (AUDIO: Salvation [+]Juno Dawson, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).)\n\nMartha once had a date with Leonardo DiCaprio. (PROSE: The Frozen Wastes [+]Robert Shearman, The Story of Martha (2008).)\n\nMartha's record as a companion of the Doctor was taken by UNIT in the Black Archive. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor felt some guilt regarding Martha while in his eleventh incarnation. (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAlice O'Donnell, a native of the year 2119, knew of Martha, Rose Tyler and Amy Pond as past companions of the Doctor due to her work in military intelligence. When the Twelfth Doctor took her back to 1980, O'Donnell voiced her doubt that Martha would have vomited following her first trip in the TARDIS as her colleague Mason Bennett had done. (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nShortly before his regeneration began, the Twelfth Doctor dreamt of Martha saying his name. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nMartha was an intelligent, brave and kind-hearted woman with a great sense of humour. When she was a prisoner of the Daleks, one of them confirmed that she possessed high intelligence. (TV: Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) The Doctor was impressed with her theory about having air on the Moon, and he asked her to join him in the hospital balcony to see if they could breathe. (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) She rose to every challenge the Doctor gave her: watching after him while he was human, and walking the world for a year. (TV: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nMartha was willing to accept and defend non-humans as friends. She greeted unusual looking species with wonder and even treated injuries. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) She quickly adapted pattern of speech and gesture to communicate more effectively with other species. (TV: Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nMartha quickly developed a crush on the Doctor and always wondered if he even noticed her. Martha was envious of Joan Redfern when the Doctor made himself a human named John Smith and fell in love with her. (TV: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)./The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nIn the Year That Never Was, Martha admitted that she loved the Doctor, but after the Master's defeat, she decided that holding on to the hope that he would return her feelings was not good for her. Her feelings for him, in addition to the enormous ordeal she had been put through, strained her relationship with the Doctor to the point that she decided to leave the TARDIS. (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) She was later engaged to Tom, but eventually married Mickey Smith instead. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nHer time walking the Earth gave rise to a more soldier-like and less naive side of Martha. Nevertheless, she retained her kindness, sense of adventure, and fierce determination to do the right thing. Despite their strained relationship, she remained loyal to the Doctor, and indeed took many of his teachings to heart. For instance, despite her work at UNIT, she very rarely carried a gun. She explicitly stated that by working inside UNIT, she might be able to change it for the better. (PROSE: The Story of Martha [+]Dan Abnett, The Story of Martha (2008)., TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nAlthough she had cause to be jealous of Rose Tyler, Martha seemed genuinely happy for the Doctor when he and Rose were reunited. She got along very well with Donna Noble. After the Year That Never Was, Martha became a close friend of Jack Harkness and although she did not seem to return his overtures, she did not mind when he flirted with her. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) She even kissed him when she left her temporary assignment to the Torchwood team, claiming that \"everyone else has had a go.\" (TV: A Day in the Death [+]Joseph Lidster, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nMartha had a scientific mind. Her knowledge, analytical and problem solving skills were frequently on display. (TV: Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Daleks in Manhattan [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)./The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007). The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Reset [+]J. C. Wilsher, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).) Her knowledge and logic allowed her to execute very complicated coordinated plans based on very little information from the Doctor. (TV: Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) She was shown to competently speak German. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) She also proved handy with a gun. (TV: The Family of Blood [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) Of course, her medical skills were her most developed, especially after the experience she gained with aliens and other unusual medical situations, finding her working with organisations such as UNIT and Torchwood Three. (TV: The Doctor's Daughter [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Reset [+]J. C. Wilsher, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008)., A Day in the Death [+]Joseph Lidster, Torchwood series 2 (BBC Three, 2008).)\n\nMartha Jones had her life changed for the worse on 25 June 2007, when Donna Noble created a parallel world by turning right instead of left. She was inside the Royal Hope Hospital when it was transported to the Moon. (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) There, the hospital was invaded by Judoon. (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) A woman - Sarah Jane Smith - took control of the situation. With the hospital running out of air, Martha gave the last oxygen tank to one of her colleagues, Oliver Morgenstern. She died as a result, leaving him the only survivor. (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nMartha's last scene in Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008). was interpreted as opening the door for a possible return to Torchwood. Although there were unconfirmed rumours that Agyeman was seen at a Torchwood filming location, she did not appear in the Children of Earth miniseries; she was referenced in dialogue as still being with UNIT. Her subsequent appearance at the end of TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010). again fuelled speculation of a possible future Torchwood appearance, which did not come about in the revived Torchwood.\n\nRussell T Davies originally intended for Martha to appear in Torchwood: Children of Earth miniseries and Enemy of the Bane, the series 2 finale of The Sarah Jane Adventures. Freema Agyeman's casting in the ITV series Law & Order: UK resulted initially in her Torchwood appearance (along with an appearance by Mickey Smith) being reduced to a cameo, and then eliminated completely.\n\nLater, her schedule also precluded Agyeman from appearing in Sarah Jane, resulting in Nicholas Courtney returning as the Brigadier instead. (REF: Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale - The Final Chapter) Had she appeared in these two productions, she would have been the first major character to play an important role in Doctor Who and both of its direct spin-offs (even including the Doctor, who to date has not appeared in Torchwood).",
