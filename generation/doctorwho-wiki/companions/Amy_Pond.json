  "content": "Amelia Jessica Williams, (née Pond) more commonly known as Amy in her adulthood, was a companion of the Eleventh Doctor.\n\nShe was Rory Williams's girlfriend and later wife and the mother of Melody Pond, who later became known as River Song. Amy died aged eighty-seven at some point prior to 2012 after allowing a Weeping Angel to send her back in time, hoping to be reunited with her husband who had just been attacked by the same Angel. She was buried beside Rory in a graveyard in New York City.\n\nAmelia was born in Scotland in 1989. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) During her early years, Amy lived in Inverness, (PROSE: The Forgotten Army [+]Brian Minchin, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2010).) and often went camping with her father in the Highlands. (COMIC: Power of the Mykuootni [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter her family moved to the small town of Leadworth in England, Amelia's parents, Augustus and Tabetha Pond, were swallowed by the crack in her bedroom wall and Amelia was raised by her aunt Sharon. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Her favourite cat was named Biggles. (TV: The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Despite living so long in England, she never lost her Scottish accent. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nShe visited Barry Island as a child where she played the 2p machines, ate rock candy and enjoyed donkey rides. (COMIC: Summer Wholiday [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) In school, during Key Stage Two, Amy learned all about ancient Egypt. (PROSE: The Water Thief [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The story The Devil in The Smoke meant a lot to Amelia when she was growing up. (PROSE: Summer Falls: Introduction [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt Leadworth Primary School, (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Amelia met Rory Williams, (WC: Rory's Story [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (YouTube, 2020).) who became her best friend, along with Mels Zucker. Amelia was consistently the dominant member of her trio with Rory and Mels. Throughout primary and secondary school, Amelia unwittingly reared Mels, serving in loco parentis and lecturing her after each of her myriad discipline problems. Meanwhile, Rory went submissively along with Amelia's instructions so long as it allowed him to be near her. Because of Rory's timidity toward making any romantic overtures toward her, and his obvious disinterest in other girls, Amelia would incorrectly come to assume him to be gay. (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nIn 1994, Amelia was at a fairground when she dropped her ice cream, but a red-haired woman in a odd white dress bought her a new ice cream cone to replace the one which she had dropped. Dropping and losing the ice cream, and receiving the new one, remained among her saddest and happiest memories respectively for years. It later turned out this was Amy's future self who had travelled back to that moment. (HOMEVID: Good Night [+]Steven Moffat, 2011.)\n\nAmelia met the Eleventh Doctor around Easter in April 1996. The Doctor's TARDIS, damaged by his regeneration, crashed in her backyard garden. As she had been praying to Santa Claus to send a policeman to investigate the crack, Amelia initially took the TARDIS's anachronistic police box appearance at face value and asked the Doctor if he was the policeman whom she had requested from Santa. The Doctor had a \"raggedy\" appearance, as he was still wearing the tattered remains of his tenth incarnation's suit and was adjusting to his new body and tastes. He examined a crack in her wall, which was actually a rip in space-time that acted as a portal to another time and place. A prisoner of the Atraxi, known as Prisoner Zero, escaped through it into Amelia's house. However, before the Doctor could assist further, the Cloister Bell went off, causing him to return to the TARDIS to prevent the engines from phasing out of existence. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nHe offered to take her with him in the TARDIS, but first needed to stabilise the engines. He took the TARDIS for what he thought would be a quick five-minute trip into the future. Amy took the opportunity to pack a small suitcase and return to the garden, waiting for the arrival of the \"magic doctor\", (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) However, she quickly fell asleep on her suitcase in the garden. Her Doctor returned from much later in his future and carried her up to bed. As she continued to sleep, the Doctor told her about the \"magic box\" he had stolen, that he had really only borrowed it, having always intended to return it; \"Big and little at the same time, brand new and ancient, and the bluest blue ever.\" He said she would dream about the adventures that they would never have, and he told her to love Rory Williams. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) The next morning, the Doctor visited Amelia, telling her to be patient, and of the many incredible adventures that she would later have with him. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAmelia did not see the Doctor again for twelve years, and during this time was unaware that a criminal multi-form called Prisoner Zero was hiding in her house. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nWhile waiting, Amelia was obsessed with her \"Raggedy Doctor\". She created dolls, comics and dress-up games about him and compelled her friends to take part. Amy's Aunt Sharon sent Amelia to four psychiatrists who told her the Doctor wasn't real. She bit each of them. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) When Amelia was nine, she put Rory Williams' Action Man figure in a microwave oven. (AUDIO: I, Rorius [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Eventually, Amelia started calling herself \"Amy\" to distance herself from her \"fairy tale\" name. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nAside from the Doctor, Amy's other interests included the Roman occupation of Britain, on which she had several books as she considered them sexy, along with her favourite book, The Legend of Pandora's Box. She didn't receive a good grade for her paper on the Romans due to titling it \"Invasion of the Hot Italians\". (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nIn Christmas Eve of 1990, Amelia's school put on a nativity play starring one of Amelia's main tormenters Veronica Stackmore when a member of the Pantheon of Discord named Krampus showed up. Krampus sought to erase Amelia Pond from history in order to prevent the future Amy and Rory from getting married and joining the mad man in the box, and conceiving their child who would go on to kill the Doctor.\n\nKrampus captured them with his goblins Otto, Siegfried and Ludwig. However, Veronica notices that the doll he had given her was nothing more than a lump of coal. So she threw it into a mirror, causing Krampus and his goblins to sucked through the portal in the mirror. Amelia and Rory forgot about the events but Mels remembered. Since Veronica was knocked out, Amelia became the new Mary, with Rory as her Joseph. Rory's father commented that they make a lovely couple, to which Mels enthusiastically agreed. Amy and Rory eventually did remember this incident years later, long after they stopped traveling with the Doctor. (COMIC: Imaginary Enemies)\n\nIn her late teens, while she and Rory were lecturing Mels on her behavior, Mels caused Amy to realise Rory's feelings toward her and she returned his affections. (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) The two would begin dating at some point before 2008, though Amy was uncomfortable with admitting her relationship with Rory, at least to the Doctor. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nThe Doctor, thinking that only five minutes had elapsed, returned in 2008 when Amy had begun work as a kissogram. At the time of the Doctor's return, she was wearing a mock woman police constable uniform, causing him to believe her to be a police officer just as she had assumed him to be twelve years earlier because of the TARDIS's exterior. Though dubious, she helped the Doctor defeat Prisoner Zero and warn the Atraxi never to return to Earth. He took two years to take the TARDIS to the moon to break in the new engines. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nAt some point before the Doctor's next return, Amy attended a fancy dress party with Rory. She wore her WPC uniform, whilst he dressed as a Roman centurion. She tucked a snapshot from the party into a book on Roman Britain. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nAmy was engaged to wed Rory on 26 June 2010. On the night of 25 June, the Doctor returned to keep his fourteen-year-old promise. She joined him on condition she be returned before morning but did not mention her wedding. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nUpon first entering the TARDIS, Amy hyper-actively questioned the Doctor about its nature and his, whether the Doctor was really \"a little slug in a human suit\", what police boxes were, and if the TARDIS's roof light ever needed changing. Quickly tiring of her questions, the Doctor threw Amy into an atmospheric bubble beyond the TARDIS, to float weightlessly in space. (HOMEVID: Meanwhile in the TARDIS 1 [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who - Minisodes series 5 (2010).)\n\nAmy's first trip in the TARDIS took her to Starship UK in the 33rd century. It was secretly propelled by a star whale who was tortured to keep the ship moving. Amy freed it, and it continued to pilot the ship because it was kind-hearted. In the process, Amy met the future British monarch, Queen Elizabeth X. She was amused by being recognised and accepted by government computers as a 1,306-year-old British subject and eligible voter but concerned by her marital status being unknown. (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nHeeding a call for help, they went to war-torn London in 1941 to meet Winston Churchill, who was using Daleks to help in the war, believing them to be drones created by Dr Edwin Bracewell. When the Doctor tried having her tell Churchill about their true nature, Amy had no answers for him despite having lived through the Battle of Canary Wharf and the 2009 Dalek invasion, something that left him shocked and confused. After the Daleks tricked the Doctor into helping facilitate the rebirth of their race, they escaped through time. Amy helped deactivate the Oblivion Continuum inside Bracewell, an android created by the Daleks, by convincing him he was human. (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nThen the Doctor and Amy found the Daleks had destroyed the human race in 1963, using the Eye of Time to alter history. They went through the Eye to Skaro before the Daleks arrived. Amy began disappearing. She used this condition to collect parts for the Doctor to build a vision disruptor and sneaked by the Daleks to set it to blind them as they arrived. The Doctor overloaded the magnetic field generators. The Daleks lost the Eye and never used it to alter history. (GAME: City of the Daleks [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).)\n\nThe Doctor and Amy arrived in GSO Arctic Drilling Station. A nano-virus spread by Cybermats had turned the crew into Cyberslaves to recover Cybermen trapped beneath the ice millennia before. Amy used a reprogrammed distress beacon to disable the Cybermats. The Cyberslaves captured Amy and nearly converted her, but the Doctor rescued her and defeated them. (GAME: Blood of the Cybermen [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).)\n\nAmy next ended up on a rubbish asteroid called the Gyre far into her relative future, which was to be destroyed by a nanobomb. She befriended the Sittuun Charlie and saved the Doctor from the devolved descendants of humans stranded there centuries before. (PROSE: Night of the Humans [+]David Llewellyn, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2010).)\n\nThe Doctor next took her back to June 2010, in New York City, for the best burgers in all history, buying the street they were sold on in her name to get them for free; she wanted to shop with the psychic paper instead. However, this plan was derailed when she had to save him and all Manhattan from being kidnapped by tiny aliens known as the Vykoids. She was remembered by them as the reason they failed in their mission. (PROSE: The Forgotten Army [+]Brian Minchin, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2010).)\n\nAmy and the Doctor visited the Skeleton People and the Doctor freed them from the Toad-King's rule. Amy could not understand why they were angry with him for saving them, but the Doctor theorised it was because he took their \"squiggly whatsit.\" (PROSE: Nothing O'Clock [+]Neil Gaiman, Puffin eshort (Puffin Books, 2013).)\n\nThey next went to a museum in the 171st century, where they found the Byzantium's Home Box with a message, \"Hello, Sweetie,\" in High Gallifreyan, cut into its case with a torch. They travelled to a space-time point in the 51st century, adjacent to the Byzantium and opened the TARDIS doors just as River Song blew herself out of the doomed ship. The Doctor introduced the two women, neither he nor Amy being aware that River was both Amy's future daughter Melody and her lifelong friend, Mels. When at one point she was left alone, a video recording of Angel Bob came to life and nearly escaped out of the television. Although Amy neutralised it in time by pausing it on a blip, she looked into its eyes for too long, her eyes becoming infected by a mental image of the Angel. All three proceeded to the Byzantium's wreckage on Alfava Metraxis to help the Church defeat an army of Weeping Angels aboard the ship, which had been awakened by the crashed ship's engines. While travelling through the wreckage, Amy started counting down from 10, although was initially unaware she was doing so, this, in fact, being the Angel; to prevent it from killing her, she was forced to keep her eyes shut. Although all of the Church's men were soon either killed or erased from time by the time cracks that appeared, the Angels were all eventually sucked into the time cracks themselves when the artificial gravity was disabled, erasing the mental image of the Angel from her eyes and temporarily closing the cracks. However, she was left shaken by her close encounter with death.\n\nWhile her Angel-infected eyes were required to be closed, the Doctor returned to her and admonished her to remember what he told when she was seven; this incarnation of the Doctor was from weeks or months into her relative future. (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)./Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nAfter this trauma, Amy told the Doctor she wanted to go home and was getting married. They arrived on the night of 25 June 2010, minutes before midnight. She aggressively attempted to seduce the Doctor. The Doctor resisted her sexual demands and pushed her back into his TARDIS just at the stroke of midnight. (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Amy protested that he was \"a bloke\" who flirted with all of the ladies and laughed at all the men in each room he entered; he explained his compulsion to travel with companions stemmed from his lost ability to marvel at the universe and that he took companions in order to experience the wonders vicariously through them. Wondering how many other women had travelled with the Doctor, Amy tricked him into unlocking the visual records, something that was amusing to her as he lied about the number of women companions. This forced the Doctor to collect Rory from his stag party. (HOMEVID: Meanwhile in the TARDIS 2 [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who - Minisodes series 5 (2010).)\n\nAmy and the Doctor flew the TARDIS a few hours back in time to collect Rory from his stag night. As a wedding gift, the Doctor took them to romantic Venice in 1580 as travelling with him and returning to normal lives ruins relationships, in the hopes that this would repair theirs. They discovered \"vampires\", who were, in fact, Saturnyns attempting to repopulate their species by transforming human girls into compatible mates for the sons of Rosanna Calvierri. After barely escaping conversion herself, Amy rescued Rory from Rosanna's eldest son, Francesco, killing for the first time. (HOMEVID: Meanwhile in the TARDIS 2 [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who - Minisodes series 5 (2010)., TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nThe TARDIS crew was trapped between two worlds by the Dream Lord. He taunted Amy about her confused relationship with the Doctor and Rory, forcing her to choose between them. When Rory died in one dream, she realised that she did not wish to live without him. On finding him alive in reality, she made it clear to him for the first time that his feelings were fully reciprocated. (TV: Amy's Choice [+]Simon Nye, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nIntending to visit Rio, Amy and Rory instead arrived in Cwmtaff, Wales in 2020. Amy was dragged underground by the Silurians, (TV: The Hungry Earth [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) where she was nearly dissected by the Silurian scientist Malohkeh. After an aborted attempt to form an alliance between humans and the Silurians, during which Amy spoke for mankind, the Silurian leader Eldane fumigated the city with a gas to stop the military forces led by Restac from attacking humanity. The troops were forced to return to the cryo-stasis pods to hibernate for a thousand years. Rory was killed with a shot intended for the Doctor by Restac and erased from reality by another of the cracks in space and time. Amy lost all of her memories of him. (TV: Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nThe Doctor, feeling guilty for Rory's loss, took Amy to wonderful places including Arcadia and the Trojan Gardens. Amy asked the Doctor why he was being so nice to her. He defensively told Amy that he was always nice to her, hiding his feelings of guilt. Amy told the Doctor that she was just joking, but wondered why he wasn't.\n\nOne of these trips was back to 2010 to visit the exhibit of the works of Amy's favourite artist, Vincent van Gogh at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. There, the two discovered that van Gogh had painted a Krafayis in The Church at Auvers. In response, the pair flew off to Auvers-sur-Oise, France, on 1 June 1890. Amy developed a close bond with Vincent and convinced the Doctor to take the tortured man to 2010 and show him how he would be revered. Amy was convinced that their intervention would prevent Vincent's suicide and, after returning him to 1890, bounded up the Musée's stairs to see all of the new paintings. She was devastated to discover that Vincent had still killed himself and the only change was a dedication on Sunflowers, \"For Amy, Vincent\". Also during this adventure Vincent proposed to Amy, but Amy turned him down believing herself to be \"not the marrying kind\". (TV: Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nThey visited Smyslov 3 for the first time to find their future selves had just visited and caused much damage. Tanik threatened to imprison them, but the TARDIS took off before he could disable the ship. (PROSE: Wish You Were Here [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile looking for parts for a tractor beam to rescue the Doctor from a spacetime riptide, Amy accidentally released the Entity from its container in the TARDIS. The Entity created a lesion in time, sent her a thousand years into the future and began to feed on her timeline. The Doctor sent Amy a tachyon feedback loop to return to him. He captured the Entity and sent it into the riptide to gorge on the four-dimensional Chronomites without harming them. (GAME: TARDIS [+]James Moran, Phil Ford and Sean Millard, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).)\n\nThey found a vacation spot, Poseidon 8 in the 23rd century, attacked by a Zaralok, occupied by the Vashta Nerada and its people suffering \"sickness\". Amy helped the Doctor restore power to the undersea farming facility. She was led to a World War II era warship, the USS Eldridge. It had brought the Zaralok and Vashta Nerada through a dimensional vortex caused by a malfunctioning cloaking device. The Doctor and Amy deactivated the device, returning the Zaralok and Vashta Nerada to their proper timelines. (GAME: Shadows of the Vashta Nerada [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).)\n\nAmy and the Doctor next followed a distress signal to a family spaceship where a Dalek scientist was attempting to steal the technology. When the engine overloaded, the whole Jones family were scattered into space and time, and the Doctor and Amy travelled to many different locations, such as an ancient Ican temple facing many different monsters like Cybermen and Silurians on their quest to find and help the family. (GAME: The Mazes of Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe TARDIS dematerialised from a park in Colchester, Essex, leaving the Doctor stuck there and Amy trapped in the TARDIS. After they were reunited, the Doctor directed her to write a note to his past self to direct him to rent a flat from Craig Owens. She got upset at the Doctor for getting Craig and Sophie together when he couldn't get her a man. While searching the Doctor's jacket pocket for a pen, she discovered a jewellery box, containing her engagement ring from the now-erased Rory. She could not attach any memories to it, but felt a strange connection. (TV: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, adapted from The Lodger (Gareth Roberts), Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nReceiving an invitation to a reunion, the Doctor and Amy arrived at galactic space-time co-ordinates 2-0-0-0-11-0 by 01, where they were met by a Dalek, a Cyberman, a rogue Ood and a Weeping Angel. All four attempted to kill the Doctor first, resulting in them attacking each other and allowing the Doctor and Amy to escape in the commotion. (COMIC: Doctor Who and the Last Stand [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Amy landed on an asteroid where an old house stood. They discovered Professor Landale and Miss Crisp had laid a claim to salvage rights of the house, which contained books and films from the Ninth Dynasty of Arkatron and deactivated its alarms. They met a man purporting to be the house's curator called \"Lester Forge\". Amy found the body of Miss Dellman and the Doctor and Amy realised that the \"curator\" was in fact a prisoner called Maxim Klart, the mastermind behind the Ninth Dynasty's killings and disappearances and Miss Dellman's murderer. Klart had been released from his imprisonment in a stasis bed when the alarm failed. The Doctor reconnected the alarm system, and the robot guards put Klart back in his bed. The Doctor, Amy, Landale, and Crisp all decided to leave the place as it was found, and not to tell anyone about it. (PROSE: Secret of Arkatron [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAmy and the Doctor visited Space Florida a week before the events of the Doctor's erasure. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nThe Doctor then took Amy to see the oldest writing on the oldest planet of the universe. Its meaning had never been discerned. Using the TARDIS's translation matrix, he was excited that he and Amy would be the first to ever read it. Arriving at the cliff face, they discovered the translated greeting, \"Hello, Sweetie,\" and a set of coordinates for Stonehenge on 21 January 102 AD. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nUpon landing at a Roman encampment near Stonehenge, Amy and the Doctor met River Song again. She showed them a long-hidden painting by Vincent van Gogh, The Pandorica Opens, which depicted the Doctor's TARDIS exploding and bore the current date and location encoded in place of the telephone instructions. In a cave below Stonehenge, they found the legendary Pandorica which bore a striking resemblance to the illustration of Pandora's Box on the cover of Amy's favourite book from childhood. She was attacked by the disembodied head of a Cyberman. The centurions turned out to be Autons who believed themselves to be real, the first one of whom to volunteer to join River at Stonehenge was an Auton incarnation of the erased Rory Williams. Amy did not recognise him at first but gradually came to remember, finally embracing him and welcoming him to place the ring on her finger, the Doctor having returned it to him in the cave. The Pandorica Alliance activated the Autons, including Rory who was unable to resist the programming to shoot Amy dead. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nFortunately, the Doctor promptly arrived via River's vortex manipulator, before Amy had fully died. He instructed Rory to free him from the Pandorica and place Amy inside to save her life. His younger self, free of the trap, helped Rory to seal Amy within it to keep her alive for the next two millennia. Over the Doctor's objections, Rory opted to stay behind and ensure her safety, drew his sword and sat down to wait.\n\nIn 118, Amy unknowingly travelled to Rome in the Pandorica, essentially unconscious. Rory continued to guard her. He was unable to keep the Pandorica from being taken by the Franks during a raid in 420 but ensured Amy's continued safety therein. By 1120, the Pandorica had become a prized possession of the Knights Templar, and it was donated to the Vatican in 1231. Sometime thereafter, it was sold by Marco Polo. All the while, the legend grew of the Lone Centurion who loyally guarded the box. The Pandorica was taken to London. The warehouse in which it was stored was set ablaze in 1941 during the German Blitz; it was found unscathed the next morning, a safe distance from the fire. Eyewitness accounts told of a man in Roman armour dragging the Pandorica to safety; the last sighting of the fabled Lone Centurion. By 1996, the Pandorica was on display at the National Museum in London. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nIn 1996, the Pandorica was opened by the touch of Amy's seven-year-old self who had been lured to the exhibit by the Doctor. Adult Amy emerged healed and healthy, telling Amelia, \"Okay kid, this is where it gets complicated.\" Amy again demonstrated immunity from the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, touching her younger self without incident. The two watched a brief video about the Pandorica and its mythical protector, bringing Amy to tears. Her grief over Rory's sacrifice was cut short by the entrance of a security guard: Rory. After running from Daleks, watching the Doctor rescue River Song from her time-loop in the exploding TARDIS which had become the Sun, and seeing the Doctor appearing to be killed, Amy found that he had returned to the Pandorica, wired it to the vortex manipulator, and was about to launch himself into the heart of the exploding TARDIS in order to reboot the universe. Amy was horrified when River explained that the Doctor would be trapped on the other side of the sealed Crack and be erased from time and memory.\n\nAmy awoke on 26 June 2010, surprised and ecstatic to see her parents, but could not figure out why. She was married to the restored human Rory Williams that day. At the reception, Amy was startled by a vaguely familiar blonde woman passing the windows. She then discovered an old diary on the table in front of Rory; despite its very weathered blue cover, the pages were all blank. Rory explained a blonde woman had left it for her. Amy began to cry but could not understand why. She looked around and noticed a man wearing a bow-tie, and another holding his trousers up with braces. Once a tear landed on the diary, she remembered what the Doctor told her while she slept that night fourteen years earlier. Embarrassing her family, she began to call out for her Raggedy Doctor. The diary jogged her memory of the Doctor and the TARDIS. Like the diary, the Doctor's TARDIS was \"Something old, something new, something borrowed, ... something blue.\" The TARDIS materialised in the banquet hall, and the Doctor congratulated the happy couple before returning to his ship briefly to move it to her garden nearby and thus clear room on the floor for dancing.\n\nAfter a night of dancing, Amy and Rory spied the Doctor quietly slipping away, and followed him back to her garden and his TARDIS. There, they bade good-bye to Leadworth and departed on another adventure: an Egyptian goddess loose on the Orient Express in space. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nAmy and Rory told their friends and family that they were honeymooning in Thailand. (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) Instead, they travelled through space and time. They spent the first night of their marriage in their quarters aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, travelling through the time vortex. Despite the inherent inconvenience of their bunk beds, Amy and Rory quickly conceived a child while transiting time-space, inadvertently causing a mutation in their zygote. (TV: Space [+]Steven Moffat, Comic Relief specials comic relief 2011 (BBC One, 2011)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAmy told the Doctor and Rory to go on a boys' trip to a party, whilst she sunbathed, in an attempt to make them get along better. (PROSE: The King in Glass [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).)\n\nThe Doctor left them on to a honeymoon planet — a planet on a honeymoon with an asteroid — just before his TARDIS was stolen by the Claw Shansheeth of the 15th Funeral Fleet. (TV: Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).) Amy insisted the Doctor carry her mobile phone with him to keep in touch. (PROSE: The Night After Hallowe'en [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) On other honeymoon trips they visited 1605 where James I arrested them, encountered giant bees at the Gardens of Zul-Thep in 3104, met Wyatt Earp and went on a beach holiday to Drago14. (PROSE: Honeymoon Horrors [+]David Llewellyn, The Brilliant Book 2012 fiction (BBC Books, 2011).)\n\nAmy and Rory continued their honeymoon aboard an interstellar cruise ship. While the couple engaged in role-play in their WPC and centurion uniforms, their ship almost crashed into a planet. Amy took on the role as the Ghost of Christmas Present to coax Kazran Sardick into letting the ship land safely. After Abigail Pettigrew and the Doctor's broken sonic screwdriver opened the planet's cloud belt to save the ship, the Doctor suggested a moon made of honey as a destination. He said there were some lovely views, but it was technically alive and slightly carnivorous. (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nNear the end of their honeymoon, the TARDIS materialised inside itself after Rory was distracted by the view through the TARDIS's glass floor and up Amy's skirt, thereby dropping the thermal couplings he was helping the Doctor to install. Amy encountered a future version of herself, (TV: Space [+]Steven Moffat, Comic Relief specials comic relief 2011 (BBC One, 2011).) with whom she flirted, arousing Rory. The Doctor used the resulting space loop to end the paradox. (TV: Time [+]Steven Moffat, Comic Relief specials comic relief 2011 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAmy and Rory returned to Earth sometime before the spring of 2011. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Their families believed they had been in Thailand the entire time. (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAs a couple, Amy and Rory were captured by Adam Mitchell and trapped with many other companions of the Doctor in Adam Mitchell's fortress. (COMIC: The Choice [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) Along with the others, they were released by Frobisher and assisted the first eleven incarnations of the Doctor as they fought through the Tremas Master's army of Autons. During this ordeal, Amy and Rory briefly caught the Eleventh Doctor with a \"new girl\", who he introduced as Clara Oswald. After Adam thwarted the Master's plot to destroy the universe at the cost of his life, all the Doctors and their companions oversaw his memorial before taking their leave. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nAmy and Rory got on with their home life, occasionally seeing what appeared to be the Doctor \"waving\" to them from history until they received a TARDIS blue invitation. The Doctor later said that before responding to the invitation, Amy was kidnapped by Madame Kovarian and the Church, who had found out that she was pregnant. She was replaced by a ganger duplicate to whom her mind was linked, making it seem to both her and those around her that she had not been abducted. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Almost People [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nRory and Amy joined the Doctor and River Song for a picnic at Lake Silencio, Utah on 22 April 2011. Amy and the others stayed back at the Doctor's orders, as a younger version of River hidden inside an astronaut suit shot the Doctor dead, though he was actually a Teselecta double. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) They gave the \"corpse\" a Viking funeral afloat on the lake, using gasoline brought by the other invitee, an elderly Canton Everett Delaware III. Amy, Rory and River went to a diner to find a younger Eleventh Doctor had been invited as well. Amy persuaded him to find the younger version of Delaware in 1969. They found him in Richard Nixon's Oval Office on 8 April of that year. Delaware joined them to find the frightened little girl in Florida who was able to telephone Nixon wherever he was. They discovered the Silents, who were aliens which had been ruling Earth since the Stone Age. After Amy was hypnotised by a Silent, she told the Doctor that she was pregnant, before she had even told Rory. Seeing a space suit approaching the Doctor, Amy grabbed Delaware's revolver and fired. Inside was a little girl whom Amy was grateful for having not injured. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAmy became a renegade to give the Silent a false sense of security, travelling to North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington and Idaho to find more about them. (PROSE: A Silent Influence [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) After three months of running, Amy faked her death by appearing to have been shot and killed by Agent Delaware who delivered them in body bags to the Doctor at Area 51. Leaving in the TARDIS, Amy opened the entrance and the doors leading to the swimming pool for River Song's arrival from the 50th storey of a New York City skyscraper. Amy and Delaware investigated a nearly abandoned orphanage in Florida which was filled with Silents. There, Amy found a photograph of herself holding a baby, in a girl's bedroom, and momentarily saw a woman with an eye-patch looking through a slot that disappeared. When the Doctor and Rory came to find her, she had vanished, leaving a device that was supposed to be permanently bonded to her on the floor. When Amy regained consciousness, she was strapped to a table. The Silents told her she would \"bring the silence\". After she was rescued by Rory, the Doctor, and River, Amy informed the Doctor that she was not pregnant after all, and explained that she spoke to him first because she was worried that all of her travels would cause her baby to be born with a \"time head\" or other mutation, a concern the Doctor dismissed. Nevertheless, he surreptitiously scanned her and found her pregnancy status oscillated positive and negative. (TV: Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nLanding in the 17th century, Amy helped the Doctor stop a Siren abducting the crew of Henry Avery's pirate ship, the Fancy. While she slept aboard the Fancy, Amy awoke to notice the woman again looking through a hatch, this time looking directly at her. The Siren was really a virtual doctor from an invisible spaceship in the same space as the Fancy. Amy saved a drowned Rory's life with CPR after he convinced her she could do it. The Fancy's crew commandeered the spaceship to see the stars. (TV: The Curse of the Black Spot [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe Doctor steered the TARDIS into a bubble universe to look for the Time Lord the Corsair, who had sent a distress signal. Amy and Rory were trapped inside the TARDIS by House, who planned to use it to escape to find new food. To amuse itself, House used the TARDIS' temporal nature to torment Amy; she was made to believe Rory had died of old age. They were saved by the Doctor, who regained entry to the TARDIS and used its very soul to expel/kill House. (TV: The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nWhile the Doctor performed recalibrations on the TARDIS, Amy decided to go shopping at the spaceport and shopping complex Spaceport One. A boy called Paulus ran out of a bakery, slamming straight into Amy. The Reptilodon baker falsely accused the boy of stealing a doughnut. Paulus told Amy about a man in the back of the room, and Amy asked him to go around the back of the bakery and talk to him to find out what was going on, while Amy kept the baker busy. (PROSE: Amy's Escapade [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Amy was unaware that this man was Rory. (PROSE: Rory's Adventure [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Running from the back of the bakery, Paulus warned Amy about an invasion as dozens of Reptilodons who had arrived through a transmat gateway. Amy and Paulus pushed back the invading Reptilodons by throwing cakes at them, and blocking them with a counter until the Judoon security officers arrived. Amy watched as the Judoon arrested the Reptilodons before she returned to the TARDIS. (PROSE: Amy's Escapade [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nA solar tsunami sent the TARDIS crash-landing in the 22nd century. Amy became involved in a ganger revolution, helping them achieve equality despite being wary of the ganger Doctor.\n\nDuring this time, Amy saw the Eyepatch Lady twice. The Doctor dismissed her as a \"time memory\". Amy let his impending death slip to the Doctor. After the ganger Doctor had stopped the revolution, the Doctor promised to find her and destroyed her ganger body. Amy awoke in her real body on Demons Run. She was full-term pregnant and the Eye Patch Lady, Madame Kovarian, ordered her to push. Amy entered labour with a horrified scream. (TV: The Rebel Flesh [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)./The Almost People [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAmy named her and Rory's daughter Melody for their friend who was generally known by the nickname, Mels. Despite her marriage to Rory, Amy bestowed her maiden name, Pond on her daughter, opining that \"Melody Williams\" sounded like a geography teacher, whereas \"Melody Pond\" was the name for a superhero. In the end, she would be essentially both, albeit under a modified name. Amy told her baby that she would never be alone; Melody's father was coming for them, he would never let them down, he looked young but had lived for hundreds of years, he had a name, but the people of Earth knew him better as \"the Last Centurion\". (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to Amy, Melody was taken by Madame Kovarian and replaced by a Ganger to help trap the Doctor. One of the Marines, Lorna Bucket, gave Amy a prayer leaf which she had embroidered with Melody's name in the language of her home, the Gamma Forests, The Doctor and Rory came with an army, took Demons Run and rescued Amy. After the Battle of Demons Run, Amy discovered Kovarian's ruse far too late, as Ganger Melody disintegrated in her arms. River Song appeared and showed her the prayer leaf again. The TARDIS' translation matrix back-translated Lorna's language into English, but her people had no word for \"pond\", as the only water in the forest was the river, and \"melody\" showed as \"song\". River Song was Melody. The Doctor left in search of the baby, leaving Amy, Rory, and others to be returned home by their adult daughter. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Because of what she underwent at Demons Run, Amy was rendered incapable of bearing additional children. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAs the Doctor tried to track down Melody Pond, Amy began to call the TARDIS insistently hoping to be updated with his progress on the search and hopefully receive good news. Unfortunately, the Doctor's search was a complete failure and he felt too much regret to take her calls, letting the answering machine pick them up one by one.\n(WC: Prequel to Let's Kill Hitler [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nTired of waiting \"all summer\" for the Doctor to find the infant Melody/River, Amy navigated as Rory drove through a field in Leadworth to make a crop circle spelling out \"Doctor\". The TARDIS arrived and, shortly after, so did Mels, who hijacked the Doctor at gunpoint and demanded a ride in the TARDIS as she was on the run from the police for stealing a car. At Mels' insistence, the TARDIS landed in the office of Adolf Hitler's Berlin office in 1938. They accidentally saved Hitler's life from being taken by a Justice Department division piloting the Teselecta, who had assumed the form of Erich Zimmerman. Hitler opened fire on the Teselecta in a panic, and Mels was shot as his aim was lousy. Mels regenerated into River. Controlled by her brainwashing, Melody gave the Doctor a poisoned kiss. Amy convinced her the Doctor was worth saving and saw her daughter sacrifice her remaining regenerations to revive him. Amy, Rory and the Doctor divulged the alias \"River Song\" to her, before leaving her to recover at the hospital and find her own path. (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe TARDIS landed in England in 2011, following a distress signal from a Tenza named George to a block of flats. Amy and Rory knocked on many doors but failed to find him. They entered a lift and were inadvertently desposited into George's dolls house in his cupboard which had become a psychic repository for his fears. The house was inhabited by peg dolls. Amy was caught and added to their ranks to chase Rory and other people there. Her outfit was modified, with a hat added to suit the doll costume. When George overcame his fears, Amy was restored to normal along with the other victims. (TV: Night Terrors [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nOn the universe's second most popular vacation planet, Apalapucia, Amy accidentally admitted herself into a facility for Chen-7, a plague deadly to beings with two hearts like the Doctor. The Handbots running the facility mistook her for a patient and kept almost killing her, as their medicine was deadly to humans. Amy hid and waited for rescue. She was ultimately rescued by the Doctor, Rory, and a future version of herself trapped on Apalapucia for thirty-six years. (TV: The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAmy and Rory went to China in the 13th century. The guards of the Liao Palace attacked them for taking food. After the TARDIS took off, it collided with a Rutan ship, which crashed on the future site of the Houses of Parliament. The ship put its occupants in stasis until 1605, at which time it sent a distress call. The TARDIS responded and landed in London. Beneath Parliament, Amy and Rory discovered Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby plotting with the Rutan Lady Winters to blow up Parliament and kill King James I. Amy and Rory found the Rutan ship and helped find the power rods for the ship to take off. They were caught in a conflict between Sontarans and Rutans over the Rutans' two doomsday weapons. The Doctor reprogrammed one of the weapons to target Rutans, resulting in a stalemate. (GAME: The Gunpowder Plot [+]Phil Ford, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2011).)\n\nAfter an adventure in Ancient Egypt, the TARDIS was drawn into a parallel universe where The Doctor, Rory and Amy joined forces with the crew of the USS Enterprise-D to defeat a Borg-Cyberman Alliance, preventing the Cybermen from assimilating the Borg Collective and conquering both realities. (COMIC: Assimilation² [+]Scott & David Tipton and Tony Lee, IDW Star Trek crossovers (IDW Publishing, 2012).)\n\nIn a prison for a Minotaur, where everyone had a room holding their nightmare, Amy found hers: her younger self, waiting for the Doctor. To defeat the Minotaur, the Doctor destroyed Amy's faith in him. After this, he returned Amy and Rory to a new house sometime before they had left, leaving them behind to save them from further risks. Amy was upset but reluctantly accepted it. She asked the Doctor to tell River to visit them if he saw her. (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAmy became a model and was involved in a campaign for a perfume called Petrichor. By the time the Doctor and Craig Owens defeated a Cyberman invasion, Amy was famous enough to be seen signing autographs. (TV: Closing Time [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nIn an alternate timeline, the Doctor wasn't killed at Lake Silencio and a fixed point in time was altered. Amy, due to the cracks, retained her memories of the real timeline and led a group that included Rory and River. She had an office on board a train and had to draw images of the original timeline to remember them. Despite this, while she knew she loved Rory very much, she didn't recognise him until later, only knowing him as Captain Williams and not recognising what was right in front of her. They tried to fix time without killing the Doctor. When Rory tried to sacrifice himself to buy her time to escape, Amy finally remembered him and rescued him from the Silence. After killing Madame Kovarian for what she did to River, Amy asked Rory out and to marry her. Rory, who was in love with her in that timeline as well, happily agreed and the two remained holding hands for the rest of their time together. Amy helped River explain the timey-wimey distress beacon to the Doctor and had to explain who River was to them to Rory. While stunned, she gave her permission as the mother of the bride to the Doctor to marry River and witnessed the marriage. She later displayed knowledge of the events of this timeline. After the alternate timeline was reverted, Amy sat in her garden, despondent over the Doctor's death and her own cold-blooded murder of Kovarian. River, fresh from the crash of the Byzantium, arrived to tell Amy the truth behind her lies, including the Doctor's \"death\". This lifted Amy's spirits until she realised she had been destined to be her best friend's mother-in-law since she was seven. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nTwo years later, the Doctor joined Amy and Rory for Christmas dinner. (TV: The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2011 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe Doctor continued to travel alone, but kept in touch with Amy and Rory at least monthly. Once, in the middle of the night, he stopped by to pick the couple up to help save the universe, but realised he had arrived too early and they did not know what he was talking about. Later, an Ood wandered out of the TARDIS and into their bathroom. With the Doctor unable to pick up the Ood right away, he acted as Amy and Rory's butler while he stayed there, which made the couple very uncomfortable. At one point, the Doctor was able to pick the Ood up and return him to his proper time and place. (WC: Pond Life [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) During this time, Amy and Rory tried having more children; however, Amy discovered that she was now infertile as a result of what was done to her while imprisoned on Demons Run. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nThe Doctor left Amy and Rory a message saying he would be seeing them again very soon; this occurred as Amy and Rory had a fight, and Rory stormed out. (WC: Pond Life [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Amy admitted it was a misguided attempt to let Rory have a happier life and have children, which she was now incapable of having. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) After leaving the message, the Doctor thought better of it and used the sonic screwdriver to erase the message over the phone. Amy, upon entering and seeing the answering machine with no messages, tearfully said, \"We need you, Raggedy Man. I need you.\" (WC: Pond Life [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nSometime after their fight, Amy and Rory prepared to divorce. At a photo shoot, Amy signed a paper to make this official, but Rory never got the chance to turn their papers in and finalise the divorce. He was cornered by a Dalek puppet on the bus, while Amy encountered one in her makeup room. The puppets neutralised Amy and Rory and teleported them off the Earth. Another subdued the Doctor. The Daleks took Amy, Rory and the Doctor to the Parliament of the Daleks. There, the Daleks asked them to save the Daleks from the insane Daleks from the Dalek Asylum by switching off the planet's defences. They were fired into the planet. Amy was slowly being converted into a Dalek puppet by the nanocloud with her love being drained. Rory tried to save her by giving her his protective bracelet, though Amy had already been given the Doctor's bracelet without her realising. Amy told Rory that she had only divorced him because she knew she couldn't have children and the pair reconciled. The converted Dalek Oswin erased knowledge of the Doctor from the Daleks' Pathweb and lowered the Asylum's defences. At the last moment, the Doctor and his companions teleported into the TARDIS and escaped the Daleks. Amy and Rory returned home. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nSometime following her return from the Dalek Asylum, Amy gave up her modelling career. Ten months after their last adventure, the Doctor materialised the TARDIS around Amy, Rory, and Rory's father, Brian, who were repairing a light in Amy and Rory's living room. The Doctor took them, Queen Nefertiti of Egypt and John Riddell, a 20th-century game hunter, to 2367 to investigate a ship that was headed straight to Earth and would reach it in six hours. Upon entering, they immediately found it contained dinosaurs.\n\nAmy discovered the vessel was a Silurian Ark. Solomon, who had forced the Doctor to bring him back to health so he could make off with the cargo, had killed all the Silurians on the ark. Discovering he had a few hours until the ISA launched missiles at the ship and unable to pilot the ark, Solomon took the most valuable thing on the ship identified by his IV system, Nefertiti. The Doctor magnetised the ark, trapping Solomon's ship inside. Amy and Riddell defended the control deck from raptors with non-lethal rounds while the Doctor searched for the object emitting the ark's signal. The Doctor released Solomon's ship once he put the signal of the ark inside Solomon's ship. The ISA missiles destroyed Solomon and Rory and Brian piloted the ark to safety. The Doctor returned Amy and Rory home and took Brian on a tour through time and space, from where he sent postcards to his son and daughter-in-law. (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAttempting to take his in-laws to Mexico's Day of the Dead festival, the Doctor ended up in 1870 Mercy, Nevada. Mercy was under siege by the Kahler cyborg Kahler-Tek, also known as the Gunslinger. Tek was after scientist Kahler-Jex, whom the townsfolk had taken in, and had cut off supply deliveries. Tek warned the Doctor he would start killing if Jex wasn't handed over. Tired of the innocents getting hurt due to his mercy, the enraged Doctor nearly handed Jex over to Tek, only to be talked down by Amy. Mercy's marshal Isaac was accidentally killed when he pushed Jex out of the path of Tek's weapon. In his dying breath, Isaac made the Doctor marshal. Amy released Jex from his cell and helped him escape to his ship while Tek was preoccupied with a duel with the Doctor. Jex, feeling guilt for the experiments he conducted, committed suicide by blowing up his ship. (TV: A Town Called Mercy [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAmy began working as a writer of travel articles. The Doctor discovered a strange occurrence on Earth during Amy and Rory's time; black cubes had appeared all over Earth in July 2012. (PROSE: The Whoniverse [+]George Mann and Justin Richards, BBC Books (2016).) Since they seemed harmless and he lacked the patience to stick around, the Doctor left after only a few days and Amy, Rory and Brian continued examining the cubes. Amy and Rory had started struggling over the choice of life with the Doctor or life on Earth. Amy committed to being a bridesmaid, something she wouldn't have done before. On Amy and Rory's wedding anniversary, the Doctor returned and got them sidetracked on a trip for seven weeks. They found a Zygon ship that had been buried under the Savoy Hotel and Amy accidentally married King Henry VIII. (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAs an anniversary gift, the Doctor took the Ponds to the Great Exhibition where they thwarted the plans of Hypothetical Gentleman. (COMIC: Hypothetical Gentleman [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) When Rory and the Doctor came to blows over the latter's recklessness, Amy decided that the two needed alone time to properly bond. Leaving the two in a London pub in 1814, Amy crossed paths with a Silence agent who went on to cause the London Beer Flood, a fixed point in time. Discovering that the death toll was not fixed, Amy saved as many victims as she could before reuniting with the Doctor and Rory. Irate at their not being caught in the flood, Amy declared that there would be no \"boys' nights\". (COMIC: The Doctor and the Nurse [+]Brandon Seifert, Doctor Who (2012) (IDW Publishing, 2012-2013).)\n\nAfter this trip, the Doctor missed the Ponds and decided to watch the cubes with them. A year after the cubes appeared, they finally activated, behaving in an unusual manner. Kate Stewart, head of scientific research at UNIT and the daughter of the Brigadier, summoned the Doctor and Amy to UNIT to investigate the cubes. The cubes released an electric pulse that stopped the hearts of a third of humanity, and one of the Doctor's hearts, but Amy restarted the Doctor's heart. The Doctor traced the cubes to the Shakri, who wished to wipe out the \"plague\" of humanity before they could colonise space. He reversed the electric pulse, restarting the hearts of those affected, blowing up the Shakri ship in the process. On Brian's urging, the Doctor took his in-laws back as full-time companions, as travelling with him was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nIn 2012 Manhattan, Rory was transported back in time to 1938 by the Weeping Angels whilst carrying coffee back to Amy and the Doctor in Central Park. While the Doctor read to her from the pulp paperback he had discovered in his coat pocket, Melody Malone: Private Detective in Old New York Town, they realised that it was about River and Rory on the night of 3 April 1938 and the narrator was in fact River. New York of that era was saturated with time energy, inhibiting the Doctor's ability to pilot the TARDIS without a form of \"landing lights\". Amy read in the novel that River and Rory were taken to the home of Julius Grayle a mobster and collector of early Qin Dynasty artefacts. Accordingly, she and the Doctor flew to China in 221 BC, the first year of the dynasty, where they commissioned a vase to read \"Yowza\" in clerical script, to signal River to activate her vortex manipulator as \"landing lights\" to guide the TARDIS. They and River followed Rory to Winter Quay where he had been sent by baby Weeping Angels. They found him in a room where an old Rory died in a bed before their eyes. The Doctor realised that the Angels took over Manhattan and transported people into the past, trapping them in the Quay to feed off of their time energy. Amy and Rory jumped off the roof of Winter Quay in order to create a paradox causing Rory to have never been taken by the Angels. The paradox worked, and the Angels were destroyed.\n\nThe Doctor, Rory, Amy, River and the TARDIS appeared in the graveyard in New York in 2012 again with all of them alive. Relieved, they decided to go on a family outing, but before they entered the TARDIS, Rory found his own grave and was immediately sent back in time by a surviving Angel. Amy, devastated, decided to risk her life again in the hope of being reunited with Rory, exiled in the past. The Doctor pleaded with her not to go through with such a dangerous plan. River, however, believed (or already knew) that the plan would work and encouraged Amy. She kept her eyes on the Angel as she bid farewell to the Doctor and River. Reaching backwards, she took her daughter's hand and addressed her by the name she had given her at birth, telling Melody to take care of the Doctor. She turned her back to the Angel and said good-bye as the Angel sent her away. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nRiver later sent a manuscript to Amy to publish. Posing as a pulp detective novel, Melody Malone: Private Detective in Old New York Town, was actually River's memoir of the events leading up to Amy and Rory's exile into the past, and a guidebook for Amy, the Eleventh Doctor and Rory to use at that time. With the Doctor unable to approach New York at the risk of an even more catastrophic paradox, River asked Amy to write an afterword for the novel, as an open letter to the Doctor. In it, she told him that she and Rory both loved him and asked him not to travel alone. She explained that she and Rory were happy and lived in relative comfort. At the end of the afterword, Amy made two final requests of the Doctor. The first was that he go back to the morning when he never came back for her, explain to her seven-year-old self that she would have to be patient and that it would be worth the wait. She asked him to tell her of the adventures they would share and that she would fall in love with a man who would wait two thousand years to keep her safe. The second was that he should find a new companion because he should never be alone. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nRiver gave the royalties of the Melody Malone novel, and its prequel The Angel's Kiss, to Amy and Rory so they could buy a home in New York legitimately. In 1939 a pile of papyrus attached to a vortex manipulator appeared in their home, with instructions for Amy to turn the contents into a third Melody Malone novel, The Ruby's Curse, and have it delivered to River's New York home at a specific time. Not wanting to cause a paradox, Amy followed the instructions. She and Rory later met River who explained what had been going on. In light of her encounter with Melody, Amy suggested she take over the writing of the books now as River was too close to her subject, which River agreed to. (PROSE: The Ruby's Curse [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nUnder her married name, Amelia Williams, Amy eventually wrote a multi-chapter children's book, Summer Falls. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nIn 1946, she and Rory adopted a son, Anthony. By this time she had written at least one other book in the Melody Malone series. (WC: Rory's Story [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (YouTube, 2020).)\n\nOn 23 November 1963, Amy wrote a letter talking about her time with the Doctor. (PROSE: A Short History of Everyone [+]Craig Donaghy and Justin Richards, Official Guides (BBC Books, 2022).)\n\nAt some point, Amy wrote a famous book called the Night Thief of Ill-Harbour. She lived on the third floor of a building in the Upper West Side at the time she was interviewed by Chrissie Allen in 1969, for the Brooklyn Fayre. Amy revealed that she and Rory had just returned from a vacation to Florida and Washington, where they \"watched\" friends and family that were \"having a rough time.\" She also stated that next book was going to be about a little girl who was lost on the streets of 1969 New York: \"Imagine that — me, a crazy old bag lady wandering the streets of New York looking for a lost girl. But yes, I do go looking for her.\" (PROSE: Summer Falls and Other Stories)\n\nAmy died at age 87 and was buried in New York, next to her husband, whom she outlived by five years. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nIn his diary, the Doctor included Amy, along with photographs of her, when recapping his adventures in the Dalek Asylum and the Silurian Ark. When he attempted to write about losing her and Rory in New York City, he couldn't find the words to do so. (PROSE: The Doctor's Diary [+]Moray Laing, The Official 50th Anniversary Annual (Penguin Group, 2013). Page 8.)\n\nShortly before the Eleventh Doctor's regeneration, he hallucinated a young Amelia running around the TARDIS control room, surrounded by drawings of the Doctor and the TARDIS drawn by the townsfolk of Christmas. An older Amelia then walked down the TARDIS staircase and stroked his face lovingly. She said to him, in his final moments, \"Raggedy Man, good night.\" (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nSoon after his regeneration, while both fastened, when Clara Oswald showed difficulties in recovering his screwdriver with her feet, the Twelfth Doctor claimed to miss Amy \"at times like this\". (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nIn a parallel universe, Amy was a fictional character on the television series, Doctor Who. In one episode, she could be heard saying \"Raggedy man... Goodbye!\" (COMIC: The Girl Who Loved Doctor Who [+]Paul Cornell, 2013 Doctor Who Special (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nAlice O'Donnell, a native of the year 2119, knew of Amy, Rose and Martha as past companions of the Doctor due to her work in military intelligence. When the Twelfth Doctor took her back to 1980, O'Donnell voiced her doubt that Amy would have vomited following her first trip in the TARDIS as her colleague Mason Bennett had done. (TV: Before the Flood [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nWhen visiting Clara's TARDIS, the Twelfth Doctor remembered the diner he went to with Amy and Rory in his previous incarnation. (TV: Hell Bent [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).')\n\nShortly before his regeneration began, the Twelfth Doctor dreamt of Amy saying his name. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nAs a result of Amy's pregnancy on Demons Run, Madame Kovarian created numerous clones of Melody through stolen embryonic DNA and each clone was given a name inspired by water: Lake, Rindle, Tarn, Creek, Stream, Wadi, Beck, Brooke, H-One, H-Two, and O. When Brooke, H-Two, and O wanted to torture Kovarian to exact their revenge for what she'd done to them, River told Kovarian that it was a trait they all received from their mother, Amy. (AUDIO: The Lady in the Lake [+]Nev Fountain, The Diary of River Song: Series Three (The Diary of River Song, Big Finish Productions, 2018)., The Furies [+]Matt Fitton, The Diary of River Song: Series Three (The Diary of River Song, Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nWhile facing the Weeping Angels alongside the Tenth Doctor in London in 1969, an enraged Thirteenth Doctor told them that they had no idea just how much they had taken away from her, much to the confusion of her younger self. (COMIC: A Little Help from My Friends [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2020).)\n\nA joke book that the Thirteenth Doctor and Yasmin Khan were trapped in contained jokes featuring constructs of both Amy and Rory. Two jokes saw the couple go to a literal honeymoon that they found too sticky, and to a restaurant on the moon that had \"no atmosphere\". A third and final joke involved the pair discovering the Eleventh Doctor's \"anything slide\". Amy used the slide to wish for chocolate. (PROSE: Knock! Knock! Who's There? [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Toymaker performed a puppet show about the fates of the Doctor's companions, it featured a puppet of Amy and mentioned how the Doctor lost to the Weeping Angels, but the Fourteenth Doctor mentioned she died of old age in the past. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAt some point, Amy was taken to the Black Archive by UNIT to have her record as a companion of the Doctor taken. Her memories of the visit were subsequently erased and she was sent on her way. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAt another point, Amy and Rory were both abducted by Adam Mitchell as part his plan to get revenge on the Doctor, in collaboration with the Tremas Master. They were placed in stasis alongside the Doctors' multiple other companions, before being released by the Doctor's first eleven numbered incarnations with the help of Frobisher. (COMIC: The Choice [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013)., Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nAmy was adventurous and reckless, with a dry wit and a stubborn streak. She had a difficult childhood being an orphan raised by her aunt, her parents having been wiped from existence by the time field in her childhood bedroom. She felt abandoned by the Doctor. She was rarely open with her feelings and often mistrustful and wary, but held people she cared for at arm's length, as she did in her early relationship with Rory (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and the Doctor when he returned. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Amy had jokes made about her Scottish heritage by mostly the Doctor and Rory, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) or even herself. (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAs a child, Amelia was stoic and able to care for herself. She prayed to Santa Claus for help with the crack in her wall and was unsurprised to meet the Doctor. She lusted for the adventure of travel with him. When he did not return, she grew into a cynical and aggressive young woman. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nDuring her earlier adventures with the Doctor, Amy showed she could be very clever and observant; when they encountered the last of the star whales being tortured by and carrying 29th Century humans from England, she saw how similar the star whale was to the Doctor, in that they were both the last of their kind and couldn't bear to see children cry, realising that stopping its torture wouldn't kill the humans and spared the Doctor an incredibly painful task in making the star whale a vegetable to prevent it feeling further pain. (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) She also prevented the Oblivion Continuum inside Edwin Bracewell from going off and destroying the Earth; while the Doctor was unsuccessful in doing so by having him feel the pain of traumatic events, such as the loss of his parents, Amy got him talking about a girl he was once in love with, successfully disarming it. (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) When in peril when a recording of a Weeping Angel was climbing out of a television, she was told that \"anything that holds an image of an Angel becomes itself an Angel.\" She realised that she could kill the Angel by pausing the recording on a blip, breaking the image. (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nAmy was often flippant in the face of danger, (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) with the exception of her traumatic experience in the forest aboard the Byzantium. (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) She traded barbs with Rosanna Calvierri when facing a forcible blood replacement, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) cracked jokes while confronting apparent doom on the TARDIS, (TV: Amy's Choice [+]Simon Nye, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and mocked the Cyberman without a body. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nAmy was also very flirtatious. In Leadworth, she worked as a kissogram. She was attracted to the Doctor, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Vincent van Gogh (TV: Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and the Roman soldiers at Stonehenge. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) She once tried to seduce the Doctor (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and a computer. (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) Rory claimed she only passed her driving test on her first go because of a revealing skirt. (TV: Space [+]Steven Moffat, Comic Relief specials comic relief 2011 (BBC One, 2011).) Amy also once flirted with herself when the TARDIS materialised inside itself and this meant she got to see two versions of herself from the future and flirted with both. (TV: Time [+]Steven Moffat, Comic Relief specials comic relief 2011 (BBC One, 2011).) She had no problem being naked in front of the Doctor after a mutation into a butterfly-woman was reversed. (COMIC: Supernature [+]Jonathan Morris, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2010).) However, despite being flirtatious herself, she proclaimed that \"I will not have flirting companions\", and was especially bemused when the Doctor and River started flirting just before rescuing her from the Silence. (TV: Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAmy was troubled and lonely. She was often left alone by her aunt Sharon, who refused to deal with her fear of the crack in her wall. After meeting the Doctor, she was obsessed with her \"Raggedy Doctor\" and refused to believe he was imaginary, biting psychiatrists when they tried to convince her otherwise. Mels, a school troublemaker, her close friend and daughter, once pointed out she often misbehaved in school. Despite this, she was a protective, maternal figure for Mels, leading her — while regenerating into River Song after being revealed as Melody Pond — to remark, \"You got to raise me after all.\" (TV: Let's Kill Hitler [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAlthough she seemed dismissive of Rory early on, Amy eventually began to respect him. Amy grew to love her husband, Rory, passionately and called the Doctor her best friend. (TV: Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) She felt he could fix anything. (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Despite her tough exterior, Amy could not always hide her emotions and was devastated when faced with the loss of loved ones such as Rory, (TV: Cold Blood [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Doctor's Wife [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Melody, (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) the Doctor (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) and Vincent van Gogh. (TV: Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) She broke down in tears when the Doctor left her on Earth with Rory. (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Once she discovered that something had been done to her at Demons Run which made her sterile and unable to give birth to any more children, Amy tried forcing Rory out of her life to give him a better chance at having children with someone else. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nIn her time on the TARDIS, Amy was heroic, saving the lives of the Doctor, Rory, River and others. She was willing to remain in the clutches of enemies to let her friends escape. (TV: The Time of Angels [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Day of the Moon [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) She was also ready to fight to save others. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Curse of the Black Spot [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nLike other \"complex space-time events\", she could remember alternate timelines to a degree. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., HOMEVID: Good Night [+]Steven Moffat, 2011.) Additionally, Amy's mind, altered by her growing up with a crack in space and time in her bedroom wall, subconsciously held memories of beings and elements which had otherwise erased by the total event collapse. This allowed her to remember them back into existence in and immediately following Big Bang Two (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).)\n\nHaving learned that \"time could be rewritten\", she was sometimes unreasonably optimistic about such things, hoping against hope that there was a way to rewrite the events at Lake Silencio even though they had been turned into a fixed point in time. (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAmy showed herself to be arrogant and irresponsible. She refused to accept the Doctor's warnings about Daleks; only to help forge the New Dalek Paradigm. (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) She broke a glass bottle and freed the Entity, but blamed the Doctor for the mess until he revealed it was her fault. (GAME: TARDIS [+]James Moran, Phil Ford and Sean Millard, The Adventure Games (BBC Wales Interactive, 2010).) She believed she can change Vincent's life, only to see she failed do. (TV: Vincent and the Doctor [+]Richard Curtis, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) She initially acted with prejudice to the Ganger Doctor, viewing him as a monster rather than a valid continuation of her best friend, until she saw how wrong she was about him and how she was the monster. (TV: The Almost People [+]Matthew Graham, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAmy showed a ruthless streak. She threatened River Song who she held responsible for her daughter's disappearance, only to learn they were one and the same. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) In an alternate timeline, Madame Kovarian was being killed by her eye drive and was able to get it most of the way off; she asked Amy to help her because it was what the Doctor would do. Amy said, \"He's not here\", and put Kovarian's eye drive back on, killing her for having stolen her baby from her. She was conflicted about this later. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAmy's worst fear was being \"the girl who waited\", which stemmed from her childhood of waiting for the Doctor to take her with him in the TARDIS. This fear continued into her adulthood when she became worried about a day where the Doctor might disappear from her life forever, and she would continue to spend her life waiting for a return that would never come. (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nDuring her adventure aboard the Silurian Ark, Amy told the Doctor that she had quit her recent job. She admitted that she could not settle down because she was always listening for the TARDIS to materialise nearby to take her and Rory away. (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAmy described herself to Eldritch Valdemar as a science fiction fan. She cited Jules Verne as an example of a science fiction author whose work she had read. (COMIC: The Screams of Death [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAmy also shared the Eleventh Doctor's fondness for fish custard. (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAmy was skilled at using a sword (TV: The Curse of the Black Spot [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) as well as firearms. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) She could also pick a lock with only a hair-pin. (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Amy could tell what others were thinking the more she knew them; when the Doctor was making silent movements, she could tell what he was thinking. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) Amy was able to easily find information in a complex computer system on the Silurian Ark, which aided the Doctor in finding out where the ship came from and was going to. (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nIn addition to taking jobs based around her physical appearance (first that of kissogram, later as a model) Amy was highly intelligent, able to solve intricate mysteries using observant analysis and even, on one occasion, to single-handedly build her own sonic screwdriver. (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nGrowing up with a crack in time in her bedroom wall gave Amy a unique ability to remember timelines that had been altered. This meant that she could remember those erased by the crack, including those tied to her own history which other time travellers could not. This allowed her to remember the Doctor when he sacrificed himself to reboot the universe. She could also restore those erased simply by remembering them, as she did with the Doctor. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) Also, when River altered the events at Lake Silencio, creating a new timeline, Amy retained her memory of the true timeline while Rory lost his until the timeline was restored. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAmy Pond was 5 foot 10 inches tall and long-legged, inspiring the Doctor to introduce her to the President of the United States as \"codename; 'the Legs'\". (TV: The Impossible Astronaut [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Clara Oswald also noticed her legs when looking at a photograph of Amy, remarking them as \"the most legs of any living human\". (HOMEVID: Clara and the TARDIS [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She had coppery red hair, freckles and green eyes, although they were blue during her childhood. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) She frequently wore short skirts, (TV: Victory of the Daleks [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., etc.) often with opaque or coloured tights or leggings. (TV: Flesh and Stone [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., etc.) .\n\nShe liked to paint her fingernails in different colours, most often red. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) She worked as a kissogram, (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and later a model. (TV: Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nTowards the end of her time with the Doctor, she took to wearing reading glasses. (TV: The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nFollowing her wedding in The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Amy's actual last name was a matter of speculation. Throughout most of series 6, the Doctor continued to call her \"Pond\", leaving open the possibility that she didn't necessarily take Rory's last name. His lone use of \"Amy Williams\" in The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011). — at a time when he was trying to make her see her life through a more \"real\" lens — suggested, but did not confirm, that she actually was \"Amy Williams\". Similarly, the Doctor had taken to referring to Rory as \"Rory Pond\", meaning the continued use of \"Pond\" in reference to Amy may have been erroneous also, and in at least one instance in The Girl Who Waited [+]Tom MacRae, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., gave her own name as Amy Pond. However, speculation ended with Asylum of the Daleks [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., where she was definitively shown signing her legal name to a divorce document as \"Williams\". In The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., she uses Amelia Williams in the afterword of her daughter's detective novel, another novel she published before her death, and the gravestone she shares with Rory.\n\nAmy is the first companion in Doctor Who history to have two concurrent recurring portrayers, namely Karen Gillan and Caitlin Blackwood. The two, despite being first cousins, had never met prior to the read-through and filming for The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).. Though Blackwood and Gillan are physically similar, they have different eye colours: Gillan has brown eyes, while Blackwood's are blue.\n\nWhile several companions have been portrayed by one or more juvenile actors in flashbacks and visits to earlier points in their timelines, Amy is the only companion whose role was originated by her juvenile actor and subsequently taken over by her regular adult actor, or who was invited to travel with the Doctor as a child, or who closed-out the role. (TV: The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nAfter the premiere of The Eleventh Hour [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Amy was criticised as too sexy for a family programme like Doctor Who. Piers Wenger, a series 5 executive producer, said, \"The whole kissogram thing played into Steven's desire for the companion to be feisty and outspoken and a bit of a number. Amy is probably the wildest companion that the Doctor has travelled with, but she isn't promiscuous. She is really a two-man woman and that will become clear over the course of the episodes.\"[1]\n\nEarlier in 2010, Amy's red hair was used to defuse the so-called \"Ginger controversy\" that erupted in early January 2010 due to misinterpretation of a statement made by the Eleventh Doctor on his regeneration. Pointing out the programme's history of employing red-headed actors, the BBC noted that Amy was the second consecutive main TV companion to have red hair.[2]\n\nThe Brilliant Book 2012, a non-narrative source, states that:\n\nP.S., a cancelled DVD extra, gave some additional details about what happened to Amy after the events of The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).. Despite the fact that the scene was released by the BBC, however, it can't be taken as necessarily valid, any more than any other deleted or unfinished scene.\n\nAccording to the scene, Amy and Rory arrived circa 1938, roughly fifty years before their births. They settled in New York and bought a house with a small yard which Rory cultivated as a garden. Observing the convention of the time, she adopted her husband's surname, Williams. They adopted a baby boy in 1946, whom they named Anthony Brian Williams, and told of their travels through time and space.",
