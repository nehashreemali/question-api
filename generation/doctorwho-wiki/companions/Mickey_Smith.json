  "content": "After travelling with the Tenth Doctor and Rose, Mickey chose to remain in another world to care after the grandmother of his parallel counterpart after his death at the hands of the Cybusmen. For a while, Mickey and his counterpart's grandmother lived together in the mansion belonging to that world's Tyler family, and Mickey joined the Torchwood Institute, however his counterpart's grandmother eventually passed peacefully. After several years, he was able to return to his home universe, where he stayed and eventually married Martha Jones and became \"freelance\" alien fighters together.\n\nMickey Smith was born to Odessa and Jackson Smith around 1983, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) although he once indicated he was merely a year older than Rose, placing his birth around 1985. (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) \"Family lore\" held that on the day Rose Tyler was born (around early 1986), Mickey visited her in hospital. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) By other accounts, Rose was born on 27 April 1987, (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005)., TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and on 7 November 1987, he briefly encountered the adult version of Rose, though the two had minimal contact. He ran up to Rose, and clung onto her leg. Rose hypothesised that she had just imprinted on him. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhen Mickey was five years old, his mother committed suicide. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Rose said that Mickey's mum \"couldn't cope\". His dad, Jackson Smith, stayed around for a while but \"just sort of wandered off\". Mickey said to his parallel universe counterpart that Jackson Smith \"went to Spain [and] never came back.\" He grew up with his grandmother, Rita-Anne Smith, who later died, (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) on Waterton Street. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nFor Mickey's sixteenth birthday, Rita-Anne had put Mickey's name down for a flat, with the Powell Estate being \"first preference\". By this time, Rose Tyler began going out with Mickey, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) though she maintained that \"it [was] nothing special\"; (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) however, Rose's mother, Jackie, was \"delighted\" by their relationship. (AUDIO: Flight Into Hull! [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nHe performed the bass guitar for the local band No Hot Ashes, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) after Rose fell in love with Jimmy Stone in September 2002, dumping Mickey and running off with Jimmy. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) Jackie was unimpressed with Rose's choice, (AUDIO: Flight Into Hull! [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018).) though Rose still moved out. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) Mickey seemed to be the heart and leader of the band, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) although Cleo Proctor seemed to remember that Sally Salter was the leader. (AUDIO: Ghosts [+]Doris V Sutherland, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).)\n\nBy age eighteen, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) in late 2002, (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) he got a flat, 90 Powell Tower, though Rita-Anne told him that he was \"a pain and a nuisance and she wanted him out.\" The first thing Mickey did when he got his flat was make sure his friends were welcome inside. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) Rita-Anne was described by Rose Tyler as having \"brought up\" Mickey until her death. She died after tripping and falling over a tear in the stair carpet, which Mickey never got round to fixing; this left him with feelings of guilt. (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Over three-hundred people attended Rita-Anne's funeral, and Waterton Street was closed off for the night, where people \"danced and wept\" until 5am. At the end, Mickey was carried on \"the crowd's shoulders like a king\". (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nFive months after Rose ran off, she and Jimmy broke up, and Mickey was still waiting for Rose, \"patient and uncomplaining and forgiving.\" (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) Before meeting the Ninth Doctor, Mickey was interested in \"footy results\" (PROSE: The Doctor's Companions [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who Atlas (Puffin Books and BBC Children's Books, 2021). Page 16.) and cars. (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005). Chapter 16; Page 189.)[additional sources needed]\n\nThe night Rose was almost killed when her workplace, Henrik's, was blown up, Mickey offered to take her to the pub to recover. She refused, and told him to dispose of an Auton arm she picked up while escaping from the Autons. The following day, Rose used Mickey's computer to find more out about the Ninth Doctor, finding a website, Doctor Who?, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) while Mickey's band No Hot Ashes worked on a new name in Mickey's kitchen, settling on Bad Wolf. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) After contacting its webmaster, Rose got Mickey to drive her to the house of the conspiracy theorist webmaster, Clive Finch.\n\nWhile waiting in the car, Mickey saw a bin move on its own. He checked on the bin, which pulled Mickey inside to be replicated as an Auton by the Nestene Consciousness. Kept a captive by the Nestenes to maintain the duplicate Auton, Mickey was overwhelmed by the revelation that alien life existed, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and Bad Wolf had to get Big Bone Bill in to play the bass guitar in Mickey's absence. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) He reunited with Rose when she and the Doctor tracked down the Consciousness' signal, but was in a state of paralysed panic through their confrontation with the Consciousness. Mickey's cowardice did not impress the Doctor, and when he asked Rose to travel with him, he made it clear Mickey was not invited. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) After Rose left, Mickey was dumped, yet again, but was still waiting for Rose. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).)\n\nMickey, by all accounts, began researching the Ninth Doctor across the Internet and history books following the attack. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) He signed up to various websites about aliens and UFOs, (PROSE: Taking Mickey [+]Justin Richards, Doctor Who Files (2006).) and by many accounts, began running the website Doctor Who? that had been created by Clive Finch, (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Rose Tyler [+]BBC webteam, U.N.I.T. (BBC, 2005)., The Secret Lives of Monsters [+]Justin Richards, BBC Books (2014)., etc.) or by another account, ran a blog. (PROSE: Mickey's Blog [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013).) He had a particular interest in UNIT. (PROSE: Alien landing confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Hoax This! [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Rose Tyler [+]BBC webteam, U.N.I.T. (BBC, 2005)., Taking Mickey [+]Justin Richards, Doctor Who Files (2006).)\n\nWithin the week after what he dubbed the \"Dummy Massacre\", Mickey visited Clive's widow, Maggie, where they agreed that he could take on Clive's mantle. Mickey considered this an honour, resolving to prove the truth to the world even if it meant he may meet his death, not unlike Clive, as Mickey valued this undertaking more than even his own life. (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) Mickey later did feel as if he had inherited his dedication to researching the Doctor. (PROSE: Taking Mickey [+]Justin Richards, Doctor Who Files (2006).) To this end, he anonymously began using Clive's Doctor Who? website, (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., The Secret Lives of Monsters [+]Justin Richards, BBC Books (2014)., etc.) which he renamed to Who is Doctor Who?, to write about his experiences and quest to reveal the truth about the Doctor. (PROSE: Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., etc.) Shortly after, he posted about the Dummy Massacre, sharing people's stories of the attack. (PROSE: Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nOn 2 April, a full week after the attack, he wrote on the Who is Doctor Who? website, speculating about the Ninth Doctor; he found the lack of the Doctor appearing on CCTV footage within the \"Killing Grounds\" to be suspicious and he considered the Doctor's motives, if he was there to prevent the attack or, more insidiously, to contribute to it. He also wrote about the footage captured from a CCTV within the restaurant where the duplicate of Mickey took Rose Tyler, expressing his worry about the nature of the duplicate and if it still posed a danger, the growing conspiracy about how people were going back to normal, wilfully forgetting the attack in part due to their fear of something even the World Media refused to cover, as well as his meeting with Maggie and the supposed claims that millions of people heard a \"strange disembodied voice\" over the weekend. (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nIn the same post on his website, he had asked his readers if they had seen Rose, who had not been seen since the night of the Dummy Massacre (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) and had been reported missing the following day. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., PROSE: The Secret Lives of Monsters [+]Justin Richards, BBC Books (2014).) The police suspected Mickey as being responsible for Rose's disappearance, being her boyfriend, (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., PROSE: The Secret Lives of Monsters [+]Justin Richards, BBC Books (2014).) and they began taking him in for questioning. (PROSE: Rose sighting confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., The Secret Lives of Monsters [+]Justin Richards, BBC Books (2014).) Jackie Tyler also spread rumours around the Powell Estate about Mickey being responsible for Rose's disappearance. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nMickey often received emails from the websites he followed, hoping to find out more information about the Doctor and UNIT. One Wednesday, he received an email from a woman based in London calling herself Jill, who said she could tell him about UNIT and the Doctor. When he arrived at Jill's house, she tried to trick Mickey into telling her about the Doctor after giving him basic information he already knew. Becoming increasingly suspicious of the woman, who had begun to look more monstrous the longer he looked at her, she revealed herself as an alien Trimestrian called Jillonga who sought revenge on the Doctor for the death of her husband, the Trimestrian Warlord Bloodgrudge. She intended to send her house, which was actually a spaceship, on a sixty-year trip to her home, questioning Mickey all the way there. Mickey tricked Jillonga's children into playing a game where he waited outside the airlock until he knocked. With the ship unable to change course on its trip home, the ship launched and Mickey was left behind on Earth. (PROSE: Taking Mickey [+]Justin Richards, Doctor Who Files (2006).)\n\nAccording to a book written by Clara Oswald, (PROSE: The Companion's Companion [+]Craig Donaghy, Official Guides (Penguin Group, 2017).) which was later adapted by the Thirteenth Doctor, on 29 September 2005, whilst Rose was travelling with the Doctor, Mickey sent her an email asking where she was and if she was okay. On 3 October, Rose sent emails to both Mickey and her mother, telling them about her adventures. (PROSE: A Short History of Everyone [+]Craig Donaghy and Justin Richards, Official Guides (BBC Books, 2022).) However, most accounts agreed Mickey and her mother had no idea of her adventures until the full year had passed upon her return. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., etc.)\n\nShortly prior to the return of Rose and the Doctor, (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Mickey wrote on the Who is Doctor Who website after not posting for a while, where he revealed that he had been taken in for questioning again, despite the police's lack of evidence as well as his discovery of evidence to the contrary, an old photograph of Rose and the Doctor present in 1869 Cardiff, (PROSE: Rose sighting confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) a time period which Rose and the Doctor did travel to, (TV: The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) although the police didn't look at the photograph properly and believed it wasn't real. This culminated in Mickey giving up trying to convince them, however Mickey was relieved that Rose was at least was safe, despite being \"out of reach\". Mickey continued on, expressing his belief that a government conspiracy was growing since MP Joseph Green's weight gain, and that he was scared that he may be arrested again, and admits that the only thing keeping him going was the support and belief in him from his readers. (PROSE: Rose sighting confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nBy early March 2006, had been taken in for questioning on five different occasions despite the lack of evidence. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) According to one account, the police questioned him these five times all prior to 3 June 2005. (PROSE: Mickey's Blog [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013).)\n\nMickey was one of the last to know of Rose's return on 6 March 2006 and learned she was back only in the evening. This led to an awkward confrontation between the two Tylers and Mickey. He told Rose what had happened during her absence and her mother's actions. Rose convinced Mickey she was sorry and that she hadn't meant to stay away so long. The two reconciled. When the TARDIS was surrounded by people wishing to escort the Doctor to deal with the crisis surrounding the crashed spaceship in the Thames, Mickey ran away and hid. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nUnder the alias \"Mx\", he wrote on the Who is Doctor Who? website about the crash, ecstatic about how he and Clive would finally be believed about the Doctor — how where he went, danger and death followed — and how the government would have no choice but to respond to alien life, unable to deny it any longer. He shared pictures of the spaceship and its pilot, convinced that it wasn't a hoax, despite not knowing many specifics about the alien itself. He was glad that everyone knew he was innocent, lovingly welcomed Rose back, and asked his readers for their stories of the crash. (PROSE: Alien landing confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nMickey saved Jackie from Sip Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen's attack and brought her to his flat. When Sip Fel-Fotch tracked them down, Mickey defended Jackie while she looked for vinegar-based objects in the flat to kill the calcium-based lifeform that was weakened by his compression field. Following the Doctor's orders, Mickey launched a missile at 10 Downing Street, blowing it up. The Doctor and Rose survived, (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) but all but one of the remaining Slitheen were killed. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nHis help in ending the alien threat earned him the Doctor's respect. The Doctor offered him a place aboard the TARDIS but Mickey declined, admitting the lifestyle was too much for him. He asked the Doctor not to tell Rose that he had done so. The Doctor gave Mickey a compact disc containing a computer virus that would wipe out all mention of him on the internet. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nIn the hours following the incident, Mickey published the picture he took of the Slitheen to the Who is Doctor Who? website, along with a link to the UNIT website and its passwords. As of that writing, Mickey confessed that he could not use the computer virus but decided to keep the CD in case the Doctor proved too dangerous. Mickey also a bit, introspectively self-critical of his personality, as well as how he sometimes found himself doubting the evidence he collected. (PROSE: Hoax This! [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) Mickey maintained a \"grudging\" respect from the youths local to the Powell Estate, given he was a bit older than them, had an interest in cars and had gone out with Rose, the most attractive local girl. He had further kudos given that had been suspected of murdering Rose, and although he was proven to be innocent, there were still whispers that he had a collection of guns and knives and had dismembered blondes under his floorboards. (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005). Chapter 16; Page 189.)\n\nA week later, Mickey conducted an interview with US dotcom giant Henry Van Statten, which he posted on Who is Doctor Who?. In this interview, Mickey asked Van Statten about his thoughts on last week's attack, why he thought people were so willing to forget, and about Van Statten's ambition to collect leftover alien artefacts. Van Statten also \"generously\" gave Mickey a pile of Geocomtex Hardware to award as a prize to a writing competition about why his readers would want to meet an alien. (PROSE: Henry Van Statten [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) This competition was won by fourteen-year-old Adam Mitchell, who wrote an essay about his belief that aliens weren't truly evil and were capable of imparting knowledge currently unbeknownst to humanity. At the same time, Mickey was shown a video of a wedding in the 1980s from Jackie, and was shocked to find that the Doctor and Rose were there. (PROSE: Essay Competition [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) A week later, Mickey reported further images of the wedding, disturbed to think that the Doctor had taken Rose back to see her father die. (PROSE: Rose's Dad? [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nMickey became involved in an alien war being fought by remote control. The \"soldiers\" in the war were abducted humans controlled by other humans who thought they were playing a video game. After Rose got abducted, the Doctor was forced to control her himself from the alien homeworld, but he was able to use this and Rose's superphone to contact Mickey for help. Following the Doctor's instructions, Mickey rounded up a few of his friends and they located all of the active games they could find and took control of the \"players\" themselves. Mickey led his \"players\" to Rose who the Doctor controlled to use the sonic screwdriver to deactivate a command in their control disks that would keep them from leaving the Mantodean base alive. Mickey and his friends led the \"players\" back to the Quevvil base and at the right moment, made them break in to the Quevvil control room. The \"players\" disruptors disabled the Quevvils' control systems and atomised them as they were in mid-teleport. The Doctor was left somewhat impressed with Mickey for being able to accomplish this nearly impossible task which required precise timing, but refused to tell him so. Thanks to Mickey's efforts, several of the people the Quevvils' kidnapped were rescued and returned to Earth by the Doctor who was also able to rescue Rose. (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nMickey received reports on the Amarillo Hoax of 2004 and the Empty Child Syndrome during the Second World War, the latter of which involved the Doctor. (PROSE: Amarillo Hoax [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) A week later, Mickey linked the Empty Child Syndrome to UNIT's press release warning concerning Schlechter Wolf bombs. (PROSE: Hitler's Last Secret? [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) At the same time, Mickey received word from Rose, and plans for the Blaidd Drwg nuclear power station from cleaver12. A week later, Mickey was to receive word from cleaver12 which did not come and was called to Cardiff by Rose (PROSE: Hitler's Last Secret? [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Meltdown [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nArriving in Cardiff by train the next day, Mickey reported to Doctor Who?. (PROSE: Meltdown [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) As the TARDIS recharged from a scar in the Cardiff Rift, Rose had invited Mickey over to Cardiff, claiming that she might need her passport if she ended up lost on Earth, an excuse Rose later admitted was just to see Mickey. After reuniting, Mickey teamed up with the Doctor, Rose and Captain Jack Harkness to stop Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen, a surviving member of the Slitheen family from the attack on Downing Street.\n\nThough Blon tried fleeing, the Doctor reversed her teleportation device several times until she gave up and took her prisoner aboard the TARDIS until he could return her to Raxacoricofallapatorius to face execution after her family had already been sentenced to death in their absence. The Doctor confiscated her extrapolator to use as a \"power-booster\". Meanwhile, Mickey offered Rose a hotel room. He later claimed to be seeing Trisha Delaney; Rose felt he was lying about the woman he was supposedly with, while Mickey claimed to keep running for Rose every time she contacted him. While trying to reconcile, Rose ran for the TARDIS when earthquakes started hitting Cardiff. The TARDIS was able to stop the world from being torn apart by the extrapolator, but Mickey walked off; rather than run after him, Rose thought that he deserved someone better to rely on. (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) A week later, Mickey wrote on Who is Doctor Who?, dejected about coming to terms with his relationship with Rose being over, not giving heed to his saving of the world. (PROSE: World Saved. Who Cares? [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nAfter months of no contact with Mickey or Jackie, (PROSE: Mars [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) Rose was sent back to 21st century Earth from Satellite Five and Mickey helped her return to the Doctor to defeat the Daleks. At first happy to see her, he was angered by Rose's dismissal of the life she had led, until she reminded him that the Doctor had also shown him a better way. Mickey remained doubtful about getting Rose back to the Doctor until she said there was \"nothing\" left for her on the estate now. Mickey swallowed his pride and used first his car, then a tow truck to pull open the TARDIS console so that Rose and the TARDIS could communicate. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Rose left him and Jackie standing in the road, alone, and did not contact either of them afterwards, leading Mickey to believe she had died. He wrote about this on whoisdoctorwho.co.uk, also writing about his suspicions of the Guinevere probe. (PROSE: Mars [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Mickey heard the sound of the TARDIS and came running for the Doctor and Rose. The newly regenerated Tenth Doctor collapsed from the TARDIS and was taken into Rose's flat to recover. When he stopped the Roboform Christmas tree from attacking the flat, the Doctor told Rose and Mickey that he was woken up \"too soon\" and the Roboforms that controlled it were \"just pilot fish\", warning them of something else coming. On Christmas morning, when the Sycorax spaceship arrived over London, Rose and Mickey took the Doctor to the TARDIS for safety. Running outside and shutting the door behind him when the Sycorax discovered the TARDIS and brought it aboard their ship, Mickey dropped a flask of tea near the Doctor; the Doctor was revitalised, and made the Sycorax leave the planet. Prime Minister Harriet Jones then ordered the ship's destruction as it fled. Mickey joined the Doctor and Rose for Christmas dinner. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) Later, he saw them off on their travels. (TV: New Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nHe spent several annoying days with the Doctor, an uninvited guest. The Doctor dominated Mickey's life without trying. He impressed all of his friends, ended Mickey's doomed attempts at a rebound girlfriend and beat him at video games until Mickey snapped that he didn't need impressing and sometimes people didn't need the Doctor. The Doctor set things up so Mickey could have a normal Sunday with Rose. (COMIC: The Lodger [+]Gareth Roberts, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).)\n\nOne Wednesday, Jackie found that Mickey along with the rest of her friends had gone missing. In reality, she was being isolated from N-Space by the Harvesters in their plot to lure the Doctor and Rose. (AUDIO: Wednesdays For Beginners [+]James Goss, The Lives of Captain Jack (The Lives of Captain Jack, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nIn 2007, Mickey found unusual activity at Deffry Vale High School while researching aliens and UFOs, (WC: Tardisode 3 [+]Gareth Roberts, Tardisodes series 2 (2006)., TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) and called the Doctor and Rose home. Meeting Sarah Jane Smith, Mickey was amused to find his suspicions validated; the Doctor had had companions before Rose. When he met K9 Mark III, he drew an unwelcome parallel between the \"tin dog\" and himself. He helped evacuate the school as K9 blew up the Krillitanes and the Doctor accepted his request to join the TARDIS crew. (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Around this time, Mickey met David R. (PROSE: Who Am I? [+]Joseph Lidster, Cheapserve website fiction (BBC, 2006).)\n\nMickey was delighted to visit a futuristic spaceship, the SS Madame de Pompadour in the 51st century, on his first trip in time and space. He travelled through a time window the ship had created into 1744 France, where he learned the ship's crew were killed by the repair droids to power the ship and they were using time windows to look for Reinette's \"complete\" self. (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nHe was involved in an escapade on the planet Iagnos. When Rose was infected by the jealousy-eating Iagnon, he helped make her intensely jealous to drive out the creature. (COMIC: The Green-Eyed Monster [+]Nev Fountain, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).)\n\nWhilst travelling through time, the Doctor, Rose and Mickey fell through a crack in time, ending up on a parallel Earth that was more technologically advanced. The TARDIS died as it had no power from their universe to get back. However, the Doctor managed to power a surviving piece of the TARDIS, although it meant giving up ten years of his life. The Doctor considered this kind of world \"like a gingerbread house\" and \"full of temptation\", but the piece of the TARDIS required a twenty-four hour recharging cycle before the TARDIS could restore itself. The Doctor and Rose went to see Rose's late father, Pete, who was alive in this universe, while Mickey reunited with his grandmother, who had also died. Mickey was then suddenly kidnapped by the Preachers, after being confused for his parallel universe counterpart, Ricky. Upon getting new intel from \"Gemini\", the Preachers, along with Mickey followed one of John Lumic's vans, where the Cybermen attacked Pete Tyler's party. (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) At some point, Mickey sent a message to the readers of his website. (WC: Secret Code [+]Joseph Lidster, Defending the Earth! (BBC, 2006).)\n\nAfter rescuing the Doctor, Rose and Pete from the Cybermen, Mickey infiltrated Cybus Industries to stop them. He and Jake Simmonds then made their way to Lumic's zeppelin to disable the transmitter controls of the EarPods which the zeppelin used to send the humans to be upgraded into Cybermen. After hacking the security cameras, Mickey saw the Doctor subtly telling him to hack the Lumic family database to find the cancellation code to the already-converted Cybermen's emotional inhibitors. Mickey texted Rose the code, and the Doctor connected the phone with the code to deactivate the Cybermen's inhibitors.\n\nThe Cybermen began exploding, along with Cybus Industries. Mickey rescued the Doctor, Rose and Pete by piloting the zeppelin. However, Mickey was increasingly unsure of his place in his home universe and the TARDIS. He stayed behind to care for his grandmother and, to an extent, replace Ricky, who had been killed by the Cybermen. The crack between universes had to be closed, however, as the Doctor and his companions only reached this world by accident. One of his first actions was to head to Paris to liberate it from the Cybermen. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThree years passed, from Mickey's perspective, in which he continued to battle the Cybermen. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)./Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nWhen the Cybermen crossed the Void to his home universe in 2007, Mickey was the first to travel there to fight them and ensure Rose's safety. He went undercover at Torchwood One, worked as a lab assistant under the name Samuel and showed far more confidence than before. When the sphere, which he believed would contain a Cyber-Leader, opened to reveal the Cult of Skaro, (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) he was put to the ultimate test. He took part in the Battle of Canary Wharf. The Doctor trapped Cybermen and Daleks in the Void and Mickey was left in the parallel universe with Rose, Jackie and Pete Tyler. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nRose Tyler left Pete's World to find the Doctor. Mickey and Jackie later crossed over as well, arriving on Earth after it was relocated to the Medusa Cascade in the 2000s.[nb 1] As the two arrived, they opened fire on and destroyed a group of Daleks about to exterminate Sarah Jane. Mickey then accompanied Sarah Jane and Jackie aboard the Crucible. Here, he was also reunited with Jack Harkness and, ultimately, the Doctor and Rose.\n\nAfter the Earth was restored to its proper place, Mickey left the TARDIS, following a tearful goodbye with Jackie. He told the Doctor there was nothing for him on Pete's World any more, \"certainly not Rose\". His grandmother had passed away after living out her final years in Pete Tyler's mansion. He ran to catch up to Jack Harkness and Martha Jones as they left for their own futures. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWhile \"on [his] own\", Mickey was captured by Adam Mitchell and trapped with many other companions of the Doctor in Adam Mitchell's fortress. (COMIC: The Choice [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) Along with the others, he was released by Frobisher and assisted the first eleven incarnations of the Doctor as they fought through the Tremas Master's army of Autons. During this ordeal, Mickey briefly met the Doctor and Martha while they were travelling together. After Adam thwarted the Master's plot to destroy the universe at the cost of his life, all the Doctors and their companions oversaw his memorial before taking their leave. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nMickey eventually went into \"freelance\" alien fighting along with Martha, whom he married. One adventure saw them battle a Sontaran. As they were pinned down, the Sontaran had them in his weapon's cross-hairs without them knowing it. Before he could fire, they were saved by the dying Tenth Doctor, who knocked him out from behind, as a final gift to them. They spotted the Doctor and Mickey called out to him, but he walked away without saying anything. Mickey and Martha embraced as the TARDIS left, perhaps realising what the Doctor's appearance meant. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nIn 2010 Mickey and his wife Martha went to Luke Smith's second farewell party before Luke was going to the University of Oxford. (PROSE: The Nightmare Man [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 2016, having called the Doctor to help Martha after she was transformed into a Gargoyle due to the effects of a wormhole passing through San Francisco, Mickey was unexpectedly answered by the Ninth Doctor while he was travelling with Rose and Jack. Mickey aided the Doctor to close the wormhole, which returned Martha to normal, while taking care not to allow himself to be seen by Rose and Jack or tell the Doctor anything specific about his wife, the encounter leaving the Ninth Doctor with a better opinion of Mickey that would influence his future/past interaction with him. (COMIC: The Transformed [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2016).)\n\nMickey and Martha attended Sarah Jane Smith's memorial on a \"bright, cold Spring day\" with their son August, where they discussed Sarah Jane with other guests, and helped fight the Jackals of the Backwards Clock to foil the Trickster's revenge plot. (WC: Farewell, Sarah Jane [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who: Lockdown! (YouTube, 2020).)\n\nAt some point, Mickey was taken to the Black Archive by UNIT to have his record as a companion of the Doctor taken. His memories of the visit were subsequently erased and he was sent on his way. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAt another point, Mickey was abducted by Adam Mitchell as part his plan to get revenge on the Doctor, in collaboration with the Tremas Master. He was placed in stasis alongside the Doctors' multiple other companions, before being released by the Doctors first eleven numbered incarnations with the help of Frobisher. (COMIC: The Choice [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013)., Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nMickey Smith was very loyal, (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005)., etc.) initiative, and able to see things that were of greater importance than himself. (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) He loved Rose, despite her lack of reciprocation, and remained faithful to her even when she left to pursue a relationship with Jimmy Stone, possessing virtues of patience and forgiveness, and was uncomplaining. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005)., Alien landing confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., etc.) However, after a while, he became conscious to Rose's lack of reciprocation and the fact that even after that he was still loyal to her, which made him feel worthless, so he later claimed to be going out with Trisha Delaney to get at Rose, though they seemed to reconcile (TV: Boom Town [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and he accepted that he couldn't keep waiting for her. (PROSE: World Saved. Who Cares? [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) He was known to be the \"heart\" of the band No Hot Ashes. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) He also had an interest in cars (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005). Chapter 16; Page 189.)[additional sources needed] and football. (PROSE: The Doctor's Companions [+]Steve Cole, Doctor Who Atlas (Puffin Books and BBC Children's Books, 2021). Page 16.)\n\nDespite being greatly shaken after his abduction by the Nestene Consciousness and Rose's departure from the 21st century to travel with the Ninth Doctor, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) he remained hopeful for her safe return, (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Rose sighting confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., etc.) and took it upon himself to prove his innocence in Rose's disappearance, in spite of frustration and fear caused by the false arrests by the police and baseless accusations by Jackie Tyler, Rose's mother. (PROSE: Rose sighting confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Alien landing confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Mickey's Blog [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013)., etc.) He also found it to be an \"honour\" to take on Clive Finch's mantle of proving the truth about the Doctor to the world, as well as embracing the fears that he faced during the \"Dummy Massacre\" despite everyone else's willingness to forget and move on. (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) He was also shocked by the lack of coverage of the attack in the news. (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Mickey's Blog [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013).) Mickey did, on occasion, begin doubting the evidence, although he always came around. (PROSE: Hoax This! [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nMickey speculated the Doctor could've been involved in the Dummy Massacre, (PROSE: The Doctor Was Involved in the Dummy Massacre [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) and began resenting him. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Despite initially believing the Doctor to be exactly as dangerous as Clive described when the Doctor returned in 2006, (PROSE: Alien landing confirmed [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) he began trusting the Doctor after they stopped the Slitheen from destroying the world. (PROSE: Hoax This! [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005)., Mickey's Blog [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013)., etc.) At that point, Mickey showed his bravery, by attempting to hold off a Slitheen to give Jackie time to escape. The Doctor changed his opinion of Mickey and invited him on board, which he declined. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Although still unwilling to travel in the TARDIS, Mickey later changed his mind, inviting himself along, unwilling to just be \"technical support\" (or the tin dog) any more. (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nHowever, Mickey didn't consider himself to be brave, (PROSE: Hoax This! [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).) not wanting to make choices that could result in people's deaths (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005). Chapter 19; Page 218.) feeling that, if he did, he would have become a doctor or a soldier; he felt as if he had never been given a choice in being responsible for saving the world, believing that he would've actually refused if given the choice, but since he was already involved he couldn't back away, like any decent person, despite him feeling it was unfair. (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005). Chapter 18; Page 204.) He also didn't want to follow the Doctor's instructions to release a computer virus given to him by the Doctor, as he felt that the Doctor shouldn't make decisions on humanity's behalf. He also didn't consider himself to be strong or even particularly open-minded, but was steadfast in the fact that he wasn't a liar, regarding the information he spread about the Doctor on the Internet. (PROSE: Hoax This! [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nMickey's loyalty didn't just extend to his feelings about Rose, (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005)., etc.) as he was willing to fight a Slitheen with a baseball bat to protect Jackie despite her having made his life Hell following Rose's disappearance, (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and refused to leave the Doctor, Rose or Pete behind in a cyber-factory that was about to blow up, knowing full well he and Jake would die too if the Doctor, Rose and Pete didn't get to the roof in time and their zeppelin went up along with the factory. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nAt first, Mickey and the Doctor did not get along at all, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) the Doctor constantly teasing him and calling him Ricky, and Mickey in turn resenting the treatment he had received when Rose was away for a year travelling with the Doctor, who showed no guilt or regret for what had happened as a result. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)./World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Following the defeat of the Slitheen, a mutual respect began to develop between the two, (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) and by the time of the battle between the Cult of Skaro and the Cybermen from Pete's World the two were on very good terms. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nMickey held a rigid dislike towards the Ninth Doctor, who was much more aloof and callous towards Mickey than his more sociable successor. While the Ninth Doctor grew to respect Mickey and invite him on board the TARDIS, (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and briefly bonded over video games, although he quickly resented the Doctor for his better performance of them, (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) Mickey believed that the Doctor regenerating improved their relationship, and was upset to learn he summoned the wrong Doctor for help in 2016 San Francisco, even willing to turn down the Ninth Doctor's offer to help. The Doctor, in turn, realised how little Mickey thought of him when Mickey believed the Doctor would think to joke about his wife's transformation into a gargoyle, and earned more of the Ninth Doctor's respect by helping him close the wormhole causing the transformations. (COMIC: The Transformed [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2016).)\n\nMickey reached a turning point when he met Ricky and witnessed his death at the hands of the Cybermen. Shown a version of himself that was braver, he rose to the challenge. (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)./The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) He played a crucial part in the Cybermen's defeat and chose to help rid the alternate Earth of their threat. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) When the Cybermen found a way to cross over to the other Earth, Mickey was the first to pursue them. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) When all of reality was threatened, Mickey again crossed Earths, this time with Jackie in tow. They faced Daleks and Mickey held their creator, Davros, at gunpoint. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Choosing to return home, Mickey found love with Martha Jones; they became freelance alien hunters. Far from his shock at the existence of aliens, Mickey now actively pursued dangerous aliens. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nMickey was skilled with computers, once using this talent to save the world from the Slitheen. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Mickey once told Jake Simmonds that he was good with computers, and managed to override the control to the earpieces, henceforth saving thousands of lives. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) He considered himself to be Rose and the Doctor's \"technical support\", likening himself somewhat reluctantly to being their \"tin dog\", similar to K9. (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) After spending some time on Pete's World fighting the Cybermen, Mickey demonstrated skill at using guns. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)",
