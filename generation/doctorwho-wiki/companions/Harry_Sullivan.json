  "content": "Surgeon-Lieutenant Harold Sullivan, also known as Harry, was a companion of the Fourth Doctor and the Seventh Doctor.\n\nHe was a Royal Navy surgeon in the employ of UNIT and later worked for NATO and MI5.\n\nHarold Sullivan, who preferred to go by Harry, (PROSE: Millennium Shock) was born in London (AUDIO: Operation Dusk) in May 1942. (PROSE: Harry Sullivan's War) His great-grandparents were Athena James and Albert Sullivan, a 19th century navy surgeon whom he greatly resembled. (COMIC: Gaze of the Medusa) He was christened in Harrow on the Hill. (PROSE: Harry Sullivan's War)\n\nAs a boy, Harry enjoyed reading the adventures of Captain Jack Harkaway in The Ensign magazine (PROSE: Scratchman) and, at Christmas and on birthdays, Harry would visit his step-brother, Will Sullivan, who viewed him as more of an uncle than an older brother. (AUDIO: Buried Secrets) He studied medicine at Dartmouth Naval College, (PROSE: Harry Sullivan's War, PROSE: The Face of the Enemy) where he befriended Teddy Bland, played rugby and rowed with the Dartmouth College Ace Eight, (PROSE: Harry Sullivan's War) and became a Surgeon-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, telling Will stories about his experiences and encouraging him to study medicine as well. (AUDIO: Buried Secrets)\n\nDuring his first year as a fully commissioned officer, he served on the Ark Royal. (PROSE: The Face of the Enemy) Whilst at Pompey Barracks, he caught his nose in a sliding door. (TV: The Ark in Space) He was posted at Faslane in Scotland and was occasionally visited by Esther, Teddy's sister whom he fancied. According to one account, it was during his time there that he first encountered UNIT, meeting Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. (PROSE: The Face of the Enemy) He often boxed whilst in the navy. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Giant Robot)\n\nHarry felt useless stuck at sea during the Silurian plague and, a year or so later, planned a career change and applied for a job at a hospital in London. He investigated the massacre at 17 Foxworth Drive and came into contact with the Brigadier, who decided to invite him to join UNIT as the new medical officer. (AUDIO: London Orbital) He was given a loud send-off at barracks (AUDIO: Kaleidoscope) and was unable to continue his relationship with Esther, whom he had planned to propose to. (PROSE: Harry Sullivan's War)\n\nShortly after joining UNIT, the Brigadier had Harry test Kaleidoscope's powers under laboratory conditions. It was whilst doing so that he saw the TARDIS for the first time, although he did not know its true nature. He went to the old UNIT HQ with the Brigadier, Kal and Jenny Nettles to transport the Grid and later checked on Kal's headache. (AUDIO: Kaleidoscope)\n\nThe Brigadier summoned Harry to help see the Third Doctor through during his apparent coma. However, when Sergeant John Benton woke the Doctor up by offering him a cup of coffee, the Brigadier cancelled the call for his assistance. (TV: Planet of the Spiders)\n\nHarry was summoned to the laboratory by the Brigadier some weeks after the false alarm to see to the recently regenerated Fourth Doctor. He had him taken to the sick bay and, after being tied up and left in the cupboard by his patient, joined him and the Brigadier in visiting Emmett's Electronics, the scene of one of K1's robberies. He volunteered to infiltrate the Scientific Reform Society and escaped with the help of Sarah Jane Smith after being discovered and tied up.\n\nFollowing K1's defeat, Harry saw the Doctor and Sarah go to enter the TARDIS and expressed his incredulity, prompting the Doctor to invite him in. (TV: Robot) Despite the Brigadier shouting that the Doctor was forbidden to leave, he quickly dematerialised the ship, taking Harry on his first adventure in time and space. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Giant Robot)\n\nPromised a journey to the Moon, Harry fiddled with the helmic regulator, causing the TARDIS to instead arrive on Space Station Nerva. Harry found Sarah after she was put in suspended animation and, in trying to find a resuscitation unit, came across the corpse of a Wirrn, later working with the Doctor to perform a brief autopsy on a Wirrn Queen. Following the Wirrn's defeat, Harry joined the Doctor and Sarah in going to the uninhabited Earth by transmat. (TV: The Ark in Space) By another account, they went down to Earth in the TARDIS, which was accidentally returned to Space Station Nerva by the transmat after they disembarked onto the surface. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Ark in Space, Doctor Who and the Sontaran Experiment)\n\nOn Earth, Harry found himself separated from his companions, eventually spotting Sarah and Roth as Styre took them prisoner. He attempted to help a man who soon died due to Styre's experiments, looked after Sarah when she passed out from fear and, on the Doctor's instruction, removed the terullian diode bypass transformer from Styre's ship, causing the Sontaran's death. (TV: The Sontaran Experiment)\n\nThe trio were intercepted by the Time Lords as they returned to Nerva and were instead transported to Skaro to prevent the creation of the Daleks. Harry and the Doctor were interrogated and scanned by the Kaleds, eventually escaping and rescuing Sarah from the Thal City before returning to stop Davros, to which end Harry dressed as a guard in an attempt to stop Nyder. Upon reclaiming the Time Ring given to them, they departed (TV: Genesis of the Daleks) and were scattered across the Adelphine Cluster due to temporal disruption.\n\nAlone on Jand, Harry utilised his medical skills to save lives during a battle. He was reunited with Sarah after leaving the planet aboard the Oranos and went on to find the Doctor, whose amnesia Harry inadvertently resolved by mentioning the TARDIS. The three were given a new Time Ring (PROSE: A Device of Death) which took them to the Desolii. There, Harry was believed to be a patient and was tortured by robot psychiatrists, making him wonder if he wanted to continue travelling with the Doctor. (PROSE: The Last Thing You Ever See)\n\nAccording to one account, the travellers arrived on Nerva centuries before they left and had to wait for the TARDIS to drift back to them. In the meantime, Harry transmatted to Voga with Sarah to save her from the Cybermen's virus. (TV: Revenge of the Cybermen) According to another account, the three of them arrived on Nerva later than intended and fought the Cybermen before eventually learning of the TARDIS's location. (AUDIO: Return of the Cybermen)\n\nHaving received a summons from the Brigadier on the space-time telegraph, the Doctor attempted to pilot the TARDIS to Scotland (TV: Revenge of the Cybermen / AUDIO: Return of the Cybermen) but instead landed in 24th century Prague where Harry performed an autopsy on the body of Professor Hrabal. (PROSE: Nanomorphosis) Further adventures took the travellers to the Zephyr, which Harry was able to save by becoming a celebrity on Deraxis, (AUDIO: #HarrySullivan) and to 2086 Takhail, where Harry began turning into a zombie. (COMIC: Black Destiny)\n\nHarry was accidentally stranded in England in November 1936 when the TARDIS took off without him and met the Eighth Doctor. He helped combat werewolves and defeated Hester Stanton using the Holy Grail before rejoining his Doctor and Sarah in the TARDIS. (PROSE: Wolfsbane) On their way to Scotland, Harry dropped the crystal ball containing the Carrionites, freeing them. They took no notice of Harry and were defeated when the Doctor allowed them to be devoured by the Reapers, after which the TARDIS finally landed in Scotland. (PROSE: Toil and Trouble)\n\nReturning to Earth, the trio then assisted UNIT in defeating the shape-changing Zygons and their giant, dinosaur-like beast, the Skarasen, in Scotland. After the Zygons' defeat, Harry decided to stay on Earth, choosing to take a train back to London. (TV: Terror of the Zygons)\n\nOne of the core reasons he decided to stay, he later told Sarah, was his realization that he had never had the ability to appreciate the places the Doctor took him due to his focus on the instinct of survival. He noted, for instance, that he had no idea how many moons Skaro had, nor any memory of the sky.\n\nThe next time Harry had leave from his UNIT work, he returned to the Highlands and explored them again by foot, now having time to appreciate his surroundings, causing his neck to become \"sore from looking up.\" (PROSE: Hello Goodbye)\n\nHarry wrote reports on his adventures with the Doctor and included everything he knew about the Wirrn. (AUDIO: Hosts of the Wirrn)\n\nSometime after the attempted Zygon invasion, Harry developed a Zygon-killing gas called Z-67 while working on captive Zygons at Porton Down. However, the gas was confiscated by the Doctor. (TV: The Zygon Invasion/The Zygon Inversion)\n\nWhen the Doctor and Sarah returned to Earth, Harry helped them against the Kraals, who had also created an android duplicate of him. (TV: The Android Invasion)\n\nOn one occasion when the Doctor and Sarah left a note that simply said \"Gone on holiday\", the Brigadier questioned Harry on the letter but he did not know anything as he had recently returned from leave. (PROSE: A New Life)\n\nAt some point during his UNIT career, Harry was put in charge of a team and sent to the West Country to investigate a missing UNIT team member and a subsequent series of \"monster\" sightings. He met up with the Ninth Doctor and his companions, Rose Tyler and Jack Harkness, and together they found the missing man and solved the mystery of the \"monsters\". (COMIC: Official Secrets)\n\nAccording to some sources, Harry did not travel in the TARDIS again by the time the Doctor \"quit UNIT,\" (PROSE: Hello Goodbye, Harry Sullivan's War) while other stories suggested that Harry did travel with the Doctor and Sarah after the Zygon and Android encounters. (PROSE: Scratchman, et al)\n\nHarry rejoined the Doctor and Sarah on their travels after a time. The Doctor was in UNIT HQ working on an Oscillating Reverberator Unit to improve the TARDIS. After being briefly interrupted by Benton, the Doctor convinced Harry and Sarah to join him to test out the gadget, after relieving the former about the worries he had deserting his post at UNIT by telling him it would only take five minutes. They found themselves under attack from a galleon in space. Sarah and Harry were forced to walk the plank of the ship by the captain before being rescued by the Doctor. (PROSE: Avast There!)\n\nThe TARDIS brought the trio to a Scottish island where they had a picnic. They discovered villagers being transformed into living scarecrows and sheltered the remaining humans together in the church. Devising a plan to stop the scarecrows with evolved moths, the Doctor sent Harry to fetch supplies from a local store, with Harry luckily avoiding the scarecrows pursuing him. After the Doctor was forced to surrender to the scarecrows after the villagers turned on him, Harry and Sarah used his moths to rescue him on the beach. The scarecrows' masters, three Cybermen, and their benefactor, Scratchman, then revealed themselves to the trio. Scratchman took Harry and Sarah to his universe to force the Doctor to come. Harry and Sarah were reunited with the Doctor when Scratchman challenged him to a fight. Scratchman drew on Harry's memories to create a giant game of pinball to trap them in and caught Harry in a cage. After the Doctor won by denying Scratchman the high score, Scratchman dropped Harry through a hole towards lava however he landed on a ledge and made his way through a pipe, where he found Scratchman's servants and convinced them to abandon their master. This interrupted Scratchman's energy supply, bringing down his castle, and in the ruins Harry found the Doctor and Sarah. He and Sarah faced an army of scarecrows based off the Doctor's old foes whilst the Doctor confronted Scratchman. In the aftermath Harry and Sarah fell into quicksand but they were rescued by the Cyber-Leader, and then found the Doctor. After departing Scratchman's universe in the TARDIS they resumed their picnic. (PROSE: Scratchman)\n\n\"Not far off\" the 1980s, Harry and Naomi Cross travelled with the Fourth Doctor. (AUDIO: Fire and Ice) Following an encounter with the Dominators in which many lives were lost, the Doctor tried to return Harry and Naomi to their own time. However, they found themselves in the 2010s. (AUDIO: London Orbital)\n\nHarry and Naomi joined UNIT, led by Kate Stewart, due to their familiarity with the organisation. (AUDIO: London Orbital) They went to Australia to give UNIT Australia a talk on UFO sightings and became aware of a crashed Ice Warrior spacecraft. When Kate contacted Harry to help Petronella Osgood duplicate the Eleven's antitoxin, he invited her to Australia to help. (AUDIO: The Enemy Beyond)\n\nPosing as a journalist, Harry met with Ros Green to learn more about the Ice Warrior that she had found and, when Jakernia attacked, he fled with her and Naomi. Ros eventually tricked Harry into giving her the keys to Naomi's van, allowing her to escape whilst he and Naomi were left behind and joined by Kate and Osgood. On board Jakernia's ship, Harry used Martian data to duplicate the Eleven's antitoxin and later returned to the United Kingdom. (AUDIO: Fire and Ice)\n\nHarry, Kate, Osgood and Josh Carter followed an anonymous tip-off to a remote house inhabited by a family hypnotised by the Eleven. He later performed an autopsy on Ava Drake to find out exactly how the Eleven had killed her and located an electronic implant which he sent photographs of to Osgood. (AUDIO: The Curator's Gambit)\n\nDuring the Eleven's imprisonment at UNIT HQ, Harry performed weekly medical examinations. Jacqui McGee was taken to see him after she returned through the Arch from the Void World. (AUDIO: The Man From Gallifrey) He believed that she was fine but seemed distracted.\n\nHarry and Naomi recognised Director Prast as a Dominator and went with Kate and Osgood to investigate Portstone New Town. He and Kate pretended to be journalists and searched Engineer Sabo's office, finding a screen from which they learn that humans were being enslaved. They escaped from the Quarks by forcing them to use up their energy. (AUDIO: Power of the Dominators)\n\nAt Porton Down, Harry's analysis found that Axonite was present in the soil in Houston, in Rio de Janeiro, the waters of the River Thames, the trees in Paris and in Singapore. (AUDIO: Axos Unleashed)\n\nHarry investigated an arch on Wimbledon Common and was joined by Naomi. They watched the time field greatly expand. (AUDIO: Time of the Vulpreen)\n\nCorrectly believing that the sighting of elf-like creatures at Clerkenwell tube station was connected to the massacre at 17 Foxworth Drive, Harry investigated with Naomi and met the Seventh Doctor, whom they recognised from UNIT files, after the two of them were attacked by Keryth at the station. They became separated from the Doctor, meeting the Ljósálfar and being attacked by the Dökkálfar, but he eventually came to their rescue and the trio exposed Keryth's warmongering, after which Harry inadvertently buried him in rubble. He and Naomi accepted the Doctor's offer to return them to the 20th century and they joined him in the TARDIS. (AUDIO: London Orbital)\n\nThe Doctor took Harry and Naomi to 1969 Chester when the TARDIS picked up the sound of screams and found numerous centuries-old bones which he went back in time to investigate, unwittingly leaving Harry in 1969. Harry observed a breach in spacetime and tricked the patrons of Shockstock into evacuating by claiming that the Beatles had arrived before Daleks emerged from it and began attacking. He helped keep Cavan and Gilly safe until the Doctor defeated the Daleks and stopped the visions that their Pathweb had been creating. (AUDIO: Scream of the Daleks)\n\nIn the early 1980s, Harry worked at NATO. (TV: Mawdryn Undead, PROSE: Harry Sullivan's War) According to one source, he did not see Sarah again until ten years after he left her and the Doctor in Scotland. (PROSE: Harry Sullivan's War)\n\nBy 1997, he was Deputy Director at MI5. At that time, via the agency of time travel, he met up once again with a familiar version of the Doctor, as well as a much younger Sarah Jane Smith, for whom little time had passed. (PROSE: System Shock) He still worked for MI5 in 1999, (PROSE: Millennium Shock) and became Chief of Staff at some point prior to 2015. (PROSE: Damaged Goods)\n\nBy 2005, he was back at NATO, having achieved the rank of Commodore. The Brigadier asked him for a favour at the time. (AUDIO: The Wasting)\n\nHe encountered The Two who tricked him into thinking that the was the Doctor and worked with him in an experiment. He also encountered Doctor during his degeneration crisis initially looking like his Third Incarnation and then after a degeneration his Sixth incarnation. He was looking at a desentherium crystal which the Doctor realised caused cellular degeneration. He bought the necklace the Doctor was after for the Two. The Doctor revealed to him that he was working for the Two and to call in actual UNIT to decommission the Two's work. (AUDIO: Two's Company)\n\nTo commemorate an anniversary date, Sarah Jane had yearly meetings with Harry Sullivan. By 2006, Harry had been missing in action for some time, though Sarah kept coming to the same place they used to meet. She \"talked\" to him and raised a toast to him wherever he was. (AUDIO: Buried Secrets) Harry was still missing in 2009. (PROSE: The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith)\n\nSarah Jane had a photo of Harry in her attic at 13 Bannerman Road. (TV: Invasion of the Bane) In 2010, Sarah Jane recalled that Harry had worked in developing vaccines that had saved thousands of lives. (TV: Death of the Doctor)\n\nIn June 2015, though, Harry was alive and discovered a possible cure for HIV in blood taken from David Daniels. (PROSE: Damaged Goods)\n\nA parallel Earth version of Harry served on a nuclear submarine in a world taken over by the Silurians after the death of the Third Doctor. He saved the life of the Seventh Doctor's companion Bernice Summerfield. (PROSE: Blood Heat)\n\nIn a timeline created by the War Master's usage of the Anti-Genesis codes, the Fourth Doctor, as in the primary timeline, was sent back to the creation of the Daleks to undo it. Knowing he would come, the Master had his Daleks ambush the Doctor, Harry and Sarah Jane Smith, exterminating them. (AUDIO: Shockwave)\n\nAt some point, a photo of Harry existed in UNIT's Black Archive alongside Sergeant Benton and Sarah Jane to record him as a companion of the Doctor. (TV: The Day of the Doctor)\n\nAt another point, Harry was abducted by Adam Mitchell as part his plan to get revenge on the Doctor, in collaboration with the Tremas Master. He was placed in stasis alongside the Doctors' multiple other companions, before being released by the Doctors first eleven numbered incarnations with the help of Frobisher. (COMIC: The Choice, Endgame)\n\nAt some point, Harry traveled in the TARDIS with the Sixth Doctor and Peri Brown. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Rebel's Gamble [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nA version of Harry appeared in a \"hellscape\" dream the Eleventh Doctor created while the mind parasite Mr Waites fed off the worst thing Doctor could imagine. In the dream, the Doctor worked with Harry at the Department of Commonality. Harry revealed that the protest at the \"square\" was much larger than reported and that his sister's boyfriend had proof on his camera. After the Doctor didn't enjoy working at mediation and wanted to return to records, he reported to Mr Waites about the camera, and the peace officers arrested Harry. (COMIC: John Smith and the Common Men)\n\nIn a parallel universe where Sarah Jane convinced the Doctor to avert the creation of the Daleks, he sent her and Harry to the laboratory where the Time Ring was held. As the two made their way there, they were delayed by Sarah's memories rewriting themselves allowing the Doctor to catch up to them and a prototype Dalek to intercept them. It opened fire on Harry, killing him. (AUDIO: Dust Devil)\n\nHarry was rather old-fashioned and stereotypically English in his attitudes. He often employed slightly archaic language, referring to Sarah affectionately as \"old girl\" or \"old thing\" — which somewhat annoyed her. (TV: The Sontaran Experiment, PROSE: Doctor Who and the Ark in Space) He was brave, one time saving the Fourth Doctor's life from a land mine on Skaro. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks) He had a \"can-do\" attitude, adapting well to the many strange situations in which he found himself. He could, however, be quite clumsy and unsubtle. This led the Doctor to declare in a moment of frustration, at the top of his lungs that \"Harry Sullivan is an imbecile!\", before passing out from the effects of a rockfall on Voga – caused by Harry. (TV: Revenge of the Cybermen) He flirted a bit with Sarah. Despite an outward annoyance at that attitude, once when thinking him dead, Sarah admitted she found it endearing. (PROSE: Wolfsbane)\n\nHe was good at cricket, and was able to throw a cricket ball over at least a metre. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Ark in Space)\n\nHarry left the TARDIS considerably early compared to many other companions, such as Sarah Jane. When speaking with Sarah later, he reflected that he had chosen to leave the ship after realising the Doctor had taken him to amazing places, but that he had been too \"distracted by alien invaders\" to appreciate them. It was his failure to take in Loch Ness due to the Zygon attack which truly had convinced him of this, but he also referenced Skaro as being an example of this problem. He had been to an alien world, he noted, but had no memory of what the sky looked like, or how many moons there were, because he had been too focused on the instinct of survival. Leaving the TARDIS gave him the chance to explore Earth. (PROSE: Hello Goodbye)\n\nHarry was a big and cheerful man with a square jaw, fair curly hair and blue eyes. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Giant Robot) He had sideburns which he shaved off after leaving UNIT, refusing Esther's requests that he grow them back. (PROSE: Harry Sullivan's War) By 1998, he was grey at his temples, his hair had started to thin and recede and his face was lined, softer and round. (PROSE: System Shock)\n\nHarry was in top physical condition, (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Giant Robot) having rowed and played rugby in college, (PROSE: Harry Sullivan's War) boxed in the navy (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Giant Robot) and regularly exercised in the gym. (PROSE: Harry Sullivan's War) He still looked fit and well in his late forties. (PROSE: System Shock)\n\nSarah thought that Harry looked like the hero of a Boy's Own Paper adventure, reminding her of Biggles and Bulldog Drummond. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Giant Robot)",
