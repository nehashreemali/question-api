  "content": "Leaving the TARDIS with K9 Mark II to assist the Tharils in E-Space, Romana eventually returned to Gallifrey and became President with the goal of liberalising the planet, culminating in the Gallifreyan Civil War. Following the war, she was re-elected but later resigned and acted as Coordinator of the CIA during the Last Great Time War until its dissolution.\n\nVarious accounts gave different reasons for Romana's first regeneration, in which she tried various genetic configurations before settling on her \"definitive\" second self. (PROSE: Original Sin [+]Andy Lane, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).) Romana seemed carefree as she tried on these various bodies, (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).) and one account claimed that she had regenerated purely \"for the fun of it\". (PROSE: City of Death [+]James Goss, adapted from City of Death (David Agnew (writer)), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2015).) This cavalier attitude to regeneration was not uncommon among children of Newblood houses. (PROSE: The Book of the War [+]Lawrence Miles, et al., Faction Paradox novels (Mad Norwegian Press, 2002).)\n\nHowever, other accounts, while agreeing that she voluntarily chose to regenerate, ascribed it a more utilitarian motive: to purge the malicious influence of Pandora, which had begun to resurface after her ordeal with the Shadow. (AUDIO: Lies [+]Gary Russell, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) Yet another account claimed that the strain of the Key to Time was absorbed into her after leaving Princess Astra of Atrios, prompting her regeneration; (AUDIO: The Chaos Pool [+]Peter Anghelides, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2009).) Romana's second incarnation was unaware of the exact details of her regeneration for most of her life. (AUDIO: The Chaos Pool [+]Peter Anghelides, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2009)., Lies [+]Gary Russell, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2005).)\n\nDue to her exceptional performance at the Time Lord Academy, Romana had great control over her regeneration, (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from Destiny of the Daleks (Terry Nation), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1979).) and was able to try out several bodies before settling on a form identical to that of Astra of Atrios, having thought that the body had \"looked very good\" on Astra. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).)\n\nYet another account claimed the transformation itself was facilitated by the TARDIS and took place inside a force field in the ship; the metamorphoses witnessed by the Doctor were not Romana at all, but the TARDIS itself adopting Romana's form and trying to replace her as the Doctor's companion in a fit of jealousy. Realising her mistake after one adventure, the ship helped the real Romana complete her regeneration (sans interim bodies) and freed her. (PROSE: The Lying Old Witch in the Wardrobe [+]Mark Michalowski, Short Trips: Companions (Short Trips, 2003).)\n\nStill using the randomiser to evade the Black Guardian, Romana's first adventure was on Skaro where she was captured and interrogated by the Daleks and made to work as a slave before using her respiratory bypass system to feign death and escape. She met Davros and assisted the Doctor in defeating the Daleks, the Movellans and freeing the slaves. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).)\n\nRomana and the Doctor thwarted Gevaunt's plan to make humans edible to Quolls (COMIC: Victims [+]Dan Abnett, DWM Comics (1994).) and, after attempting to make repairs to the TARDIS, landed in 51st century Reykjavik where she gave Magnus Greel the idea of time travel and gave him a card for a plastic surgeon in 1998. (COMIC: Under Reykjavik [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) With K9, the two Time Lords responded to a distress call from the Karsudan and repaired the ship. (PROSE: All Snug in Their Beds [+]Scott Alan Woodard, Short Trips: The Ghosts of Christmas (Short Trips short stories, 2007).) They also visited Arkinen and decided to head to Paris. (AUDIO: The Old Rogue [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRomana's feelings towards the Doctor become romantic, but she did not communicate this directly. Instead she acquired a Prime Computer, a powerful sentient machine also used on Gallifrey, and installed it in the TARDIS. It helped them to calculate the orbital coordinates of nine hundred planets in the constellation of Kasterborous, averting the end of the universe. (TV: Step Into the 80's! [+]Tom Baker, Prime Computer ads (1979).) Later, when the Doctor found a way to increase the Prime's power, and discussed using it for various tasks such as designing ships and running power stations, Romana told him to \"Ask it how to handle a woman.\" The Prime instructed him: \"MARRY THE GIRL, DOCTOR.\" The Doctor proposed to Romana, who accepted, and together they praised the computer. When Romana was taken hostage by aliens from Liprogopolis, who demanded the name of \"the supreme computer\", she told the Doctor not to reveal anything; however, when he told them it was a Prime, they freed her immediately, as they merely want to purchase one themselves. (TV: On Through the 80's! [+]Tom Baker, Prime Computer ads (1980).)\n\nArriving in Paris in 1979, Romana and the Doctor enjoyed the city before uncovering Scaroth's plan to use the Mona Lisa and a number of copies to fund his time travel experiments. She provided Scaroth with time travel technology but, after realising her mistake, helped the Doctor stop him. (TV: City of Death [+]David Agnew, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).)\n\nOn a planet made of confectionery, Romana realised it was K9's birthday. After defeating an alliance made up of the Master, the Daleks and the Cybermen, she returned to him with a sponge cake to celebrate, although after it came to life they allowed it to live out its life on the confectionery planet. (PROSE: The Not-So-Sinister Sponge [+]Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman, Short Trips and Side Steps (Short Trips short stories, 2000).) At the end of the universe, the Doctor gave Romana the universe's last Rolo (PROSE: Do You Love Anyone Enough? [+]Norman Ashby, Short Trips and Side Steps (Short Trips short stories, 2000).) before they left Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart a Christmas present (PROSE: Better Watch Out, Better Take Care [+]Steve Burford, Short Trips and Side Steps (Short Trips short stories, 2000).) and ruminated on the nature of their lives. (PROSE: Playing with Toys [+]David Agnew, Short Trips and Side Steps (Short Trips short stories, 2000).)\n\nRomana, the Doctor and K9 attended Queen Elizabeth II's recoronation and were pointed out by the Brigadier to his wife, Doris, (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) and an academic conference on Mars where they passed Bernice Summerfield. (PROSE: Beige Planet Mars [+]Lance Parkin and Mark Clapham, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1998).) They returned to Paris in 2000 where they defeated Taureau (COMIC: The Forgotten [+]Tony Lee, IDW mini-series and one-shots (IDW Publishing, 2008-2009).) and met Kaj Jepperson in 30th century Prague to stop his time experiments. (PROSE: The End of Now [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) On a Kroton ship, Romana and the Doctor encountered the Krotons, Quarks and Ogrons from a different universe. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nOn Chloris, Romana was captured by a party of bandits. She became involved in Lady Adrasta's plans to kill the Tythonian ambassador Erato when she made the mistake of showing what K9 could do. (TV: The Creature from the Pit [+]David Fisher, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).)\n\nAfter the TARDIS landed on the Rock of Judgement, Romana assisted in Frank Spiggot's investigation into the prison, involving the two in Xais's attempted resurrection. The station manager attempted to force the mask that would resurrect her onto Romana, but her Gallifreyan status allowed her to overcome the possession and assist the Doctor in defeating Xais. (PROSE: The Romance of Crime [+]Gareth Roberts, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).)\n\nRealising that the Doctor had bypassed the Randomiser in order to return some overdue library books, she became cross with him as she was worried that the Black Guardian would be able to find them. Landing in London, she discovered a time tunnel being used by humans that was blocked by Zodaal's space ship. She accidentally accelerated Zodaal's plan and gave him secrets of Gallifreyan time travel in the process. (PROSE: The English Way of Death [+]Gareth Roberts, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).)\n\nWhen two spaceships, the Empress and the Hecate, collided, Romana helped separate them. She also helped to uncover a drug-smuggling plot involving the lethal drug vraxoin via Tryst's Continuous Event Transmuter and the Mandrels it contained. (TV: Nightmare of Eden [+]Bob Baker, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).)\n\nThe Doctor and Romana landed on the Myriad that was looking for the Doctor. The Doctor told her that the ship was in the constellation of Kasterborous, which she was delighted at but she had by this time decided that she did not want to go back to Gallifrey. She was fascinated when she met CAIN as she had not seen an artificial intelligence with a working fungoid brain before. She later told Suri about the Pyralis and helped to defeat them. (AUDIO: The Pyralis Effect [+]George Mann, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2009).)\n\nRomana prevented the Nimon from continuing their cycle of taking over planets by posing as gods. She travelled to Crinoth and met Sezom, the sole survivor of the people there who had formerly welcomed the Nimon in the hope they would give them higher technology, only to realise too late the Nimon were parasitic nomads who consumed them and their world. (TV: The Horns of Nimon [+]Anthony Read, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979-1980).)\n\nShe was initially annoyed when they landed in what appeared to be Rome, saying that there was no point in the randomiser if it was going to take them to places they already had been in, but discovered that it was the Luna Romana theme park. She stopped Stoyn from changing time. (AUDIO: Luna Romana [+]Matt Fitton, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2014).)\n\nRomana and the Doctor decided to stay in their house in London in June 1964 whilst K9 led the Black Guardian on another wild goose chase through time. He returned having been affected by a wave-cancellation frequency modulator, which the two Time Lords investigated. Romana discovered that Jill Lanchaster was a Vardan and later cancelled-out the Vardan invasion force by plugging the modulator into Mark Lanchaster's pirate radio. (AUDIO: Wave of Destruction [+]Justin Richards, The Fourth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nRomana and the Doctor landed in Budapest in 1980 in order to take in the sights and defeated the vampire-like Zoltán Frid. (AUDIO: The Labyrinth of Buda Castle [+]Eddie Robson, The Fourth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2016).) After arriving in Aoris's past due to the TARDIS's collision with a Time Tank, Romana and K9 prevented a civilisation from discovering time travel and deactivated a bomb. (AUDIO: The Paradox Planet [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) They searched for the Doctor and prevented Drang's attack. (AUDIO: Legacy of Death [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Romana went to Cambridge in 1979, intending to meet Professor Chronotis. Whilst punting up the River Cam, (WC: Shada [+]Douglas Adams and Gary Russell, adapted from Shada (Douglas Adams), BBCi animations (2003).) the Doctor's first four incarnations, along with their companions, were taken by a time scoop to the Death Zone on Gallifrey. The Doctor and Romana were caught in a time eddy and failed to arrive in the Death Zone. They were released several hours later once Borusa was sealed in the Tomb of Rassilon. (TV: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special (Public Broadcasting Service, 1983).)\n\nThe Doctor, having gone \"nowhere\" for several hours, went back to the TARDIS, demanding everyone to put their bathing suits on as they were going to Brighton. The Doctor and Romana, though retaining memories of the punting trip, had forgotten they intended to visit Chronotis. The Doctor said that they had intended to be back \"before lights out\", but \"went on somewhere else\", according to Romana, after only being away from the TARDIS for two hours and twenty-one minutes. (WC: Shada [+]Douglas Adams and Gary Russell, adapted from Shada (Douglas Adams), BBCi animations (2003).)\n\nThe Doctor and Romana were asked by the Ra'ra'vis Tigil and Kemos to retrieve a psychic sales voucher stolen by Mrs Oppenheimer-Mason in 1985 New York City. While Romana distracted Mrs Oppenheimer-Mason, the Doctor was able to swipe the voucher from her dog, and return it to the Ra'ra'vis. (COMIC: Time Lady of Means [+]Richard Dinnick, The Many Lives of Doctor Who (Titan Publishing Group, 2018).)\n\nThe Doctor, Romana and K-9 went on holiday to Cimmerian II, she and K9 spent three days trying to find souvenir but couldn't find one. During the Doctor's stint as a witness in the trial for the destruction of Earth, her time sensitiveness meant that she could detect the Children of Pyxis, but didn't know who they were. She tried to claim that the Children of Pyxis was after them but Perigord Trent didn't believe him. She went to find evidence that Skorpios used the Children of Pyxis. She worked out the creatures that were sent to attack him were Liborts so could distract them with the fine wine in the cellar. This escape caused Skorpios to sent another set of assassins after him. She learnt that Smilax's true interest in rescuing Earth was to turn it into a habitat for Hobkinson's Greater White-Crested Spergasaurians. She took Trent to earth to get evidence. (AUDIO: The Doomsday Contract [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\nLanding in Brighton in 1833, too early for the Brighton Pavilion, the Doctor planed to stay around for the opening, Romana initially planned to visit the sites of Europe and popular figures of the age. At Mary Barnes' waxworks, she spotted Goole stealing a waxwork of Marie Antoinette and went with the Doctor to Goole's Gallery of Ghouls and learnt that Goole was a wax creature. She was caught up in an explosion but she managed to escape via the drains. (AUDIO: Gallery of Ghouls [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRomana warned the Doctor not to return to Brighton too soon after their previous visit. She was used as a hostage by Drax as part of his eleven incarnations' elaborate con to have the Doctor steal and return a Blinovitch Limitation Effect limiter, being appalled at Drax's irresponsibility once she deduced what was going on. (AUDIO: The Trouble with Drax [+]John Dorney, The Fourth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2016).) Mr. Dorrick placed Romana in a chamber to become the pilot of the Laan's time engine, (AUDIO: The Pursuit of History [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) but she did not have sufficient exposure to the Time Vortex. She later learnt that the Black Guardian was involved. (AUDIO: Casualties of Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn Barclow, Romana and the Doctor were separated after a missile landed near their position, after which Romana was captured and met Menlove Stokes again. (PROSE: The Well-Mannered War [+]Gareth Roberts, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) After arriving in London in 1899, she helped the Doctor track an energy pulse to the New Regency Theatre and later assisted George Litefoot and Percival Quick. (AUDIO: The Beast of Kravenos [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Planning to take Romana to a pencil museum in the Lake District, the Doctor instead landed in a battlefield where they encountered the Sontarans. (AUDIO: The Eternal Battle [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn Hollywood 1930, she confronted Julius about his clinic that specialised in keeping film-stars young and started a mob to rescue the Doctor. (AUDIO: The Silent Scream [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Romana wanted the Doctor to use the randomiser again and switched it on, taking them to a submarine in the 1940s that was suspended in space where she again saved the Doctor. (AUDIO: Dethras [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt one point, Romana had a Prime Computer brought to the TARDIS, and showed the Doctor its abilities, including calculating the length of the Doctor's scarf and suggesting to him that he should marry Romana. Romana was then kidnapped by the Liprogopolisians, who wanted a Prime Computer for themselves. She was safely returned to the TARDIS afterwards. (TV: Prime Computer advertisement [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor arrived in Brighton, but in the wrong season. Bored and with K9 out of action after going in the sea, Romana suggested they visit the Leisure Hive. There, they prevented the rebirth of Argolin civilisation. Despite her protests, the Doctor removed the randomiser from the TARDIS, making them vulnerable to the Black Guardian finding them again. (TV: The Leisure Hive [+]David Fisher, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980).)\n\nAfter arriving in London in 1922, Romana and the Doctor stayed at Baker Street for some time. Travelling to Kent, the two investigated and solved a case of alleged ghostly activity at Malkin Place. (AUDIO: The Haunting of Malkin Place [+]Phil Mulryne, The Fourth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).) The TARDIS later materialised underground where it was captured by a drill town, after which Romana was interrogated by Maxwell Wilberforce Bell. She was to be converted into a Silex but managed to escape and reunite with the Doctor. (AUDIO: Subterranea [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Staying again at Baker Street in 1980, the two looked into a Movellan ship and found Chenek, an anti-Dalek weapon. She helped the Doctor reprogram him to remove his Movellan programming and give him free will. (AUDIO: The Movellan Grave [+]Andrew Smith, The Fourth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nOn Funderell, Romana was rescued from a current by Rolf and taken to see Greygul, where she encountered her old friend Sartia from the Time Lord Academy. She broke into Sartia's stolen files and was later left by her in the middle of nowhere to die. (AUDIO: The Skin of the Sleek [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) However, she survived and reunited with the Doctor, with whom she defeated Sartia. (AUDIO: The Thief Who Stole Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn Tigella, Romana freed herself from the Bell Plants' harassment before she was captured by Gaztaks. She bluffed the Gaztaks by claiming she was leading them to the TARDIS before taking them around in circles. She lost them by leading them into the Bell Plants. (TV: Meglos [+]John Flanagan and Andrew McCulloch, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980).)\n\nAfter forgetting all about the matter, the Doctor received an order from the Time Lords to return Romana to Gallifrey given that they had assembled the Key to Time. Romana, having tasted a life of adventure with the Doctor and bonded with him, did not want to return and spend the rest of her life there. The TARDIS entered a Charged Vacuum Emboitment and entered E-Space where they landed on the planet Alzarius. Infected by an Alzarian spider, Romana was controlled by its venom to complete tasks to help the Marshmen. The Doctor restrained her and she soon recovered. (TV: Full Circle [+]Andrew Smith, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980).)\n\nRomana and the Doctor began searching for a CVE to return home. They came across a planet and landed upon it. They found an Alzarian, Adric, had stowed away on board. Romana was taken by a group of vampires as a sacrifice to the King Vampire. The Doctor rescued her and they resumed searching. (TV: State of Decay [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980).) Romana and the Doctor also encountered a future incarnation of the Doctor within a time bubble. (PROSE: The Eight Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) The Doctor was injured and Romana placed him in the Zero Room to recover. The TARDIS was captured by Ballustrans. Romana was questioned by Marni Tellis in a murder enquiry. However, a Farrian attack lifted suspicion from her. Romana kept the Farrian talking long enough for the Doctor to destroy their CVE entrance. They were unable to follow and so continued their search. (AUDIO: The Invasion of E-Space [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRomana also arrived on a planet with a rainforest that was home to the Tantalus (AUDIO: Chase the Night [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and Purgatory 12. (AUDIO: Purgatory 12 [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Later, the TARDIS crew arrived at the Gateway where they encountered the Tharils. With K9 damaged by time winds and unable to return to N-Space, Romana chose to remain with him in E-Space where they could help release the Tharils from captivity. (TV: Warriors' Gate [+]Steve Gallagher, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).) She fought for Tharil rights for many years and liberated them. (PROSE: Blood Harvest [+]Terrance Dicks, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).)\n\nThere existed a series of accounts that involved K9 and his 487 year old \"mistress\" travelling throughout \"Ecto-Space\". This mistress (AUDIO: The Choice [+]Nigel Fairs, Adventures in a Pocket Universe (BBV Productions, 1999)., The Search [+]Mark Duncan, Adventures in a Pocket Universe (BBV Productions, 1999).) was very similar to Romana in voice, personality, and appearance. (TV: Warriors' Gate [+]Steve Gallagher, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981)., et. al) By another account, this mistress travelled with a robot animal instead named B.E.S.. (PROSE: The Choice [+]James Mulholland, adapted from The Choice (Nigel Fairs), Novelisations in Time & Space (BBV Productions, 2022).) Romana and K9 eventually decided to return to N-Space, (AUDIO: The Invasion of E-Space [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) passing through a mirror with K9 to return to their universe. (AUDIO: Zagreus [+]Alan Barnes and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nRomana visited the vampire planet to check upon its residents where she encountered Bernice Summerfield. The pair and the Seventh Doctor became aware of Agonal's plan to resurrect the Great Vampire, after which they went to the Tomb of Rassilon where Agonal was tricked by Rassilon. Romana elected to remain on Gallifrey. (PROSE: Blood Harvest [+]Terrance Dicks, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).)\n\nRomana met Ruath and was trapped by her in a miniscope to prevent her from stopping her plan to turn the Time Lords into vampires. Romana was later picked up by Spandrell and, according to one account, received a position on the High Council. (PROSE: Goth Opera [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).) She was shocked that the Fifth Doctor had become President and then run away from his responsibilities. (AUDIO: Extermination [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWorking closely with the High Council, Romana planned to bring Amy (later known as Abby) to the Time Lord Academy in order to convince them to begin admitting non-Gallifreyan students. (AUDIO: The Chaos Pool [+]Peter Anghelides, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2009).)\n\nThere were multiple contradictory accounts of how Romana became the President. According to one account, Romana ran against an individual in an election held after her predecessor was found drunk whilst in charge of the Sash of Rassilon. She narrowly won, winning 53% of the vote to her rival's 47% according to Spandrell. (PROSE: Happy Endings [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).)\n\nAccording to other accounts, she won the Presidency by invoking the ancient right of challenge against her predecessor. (AUDIO: Insurgency [+]Steve Lyons, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2005)., PROSE: Gallifrey: A Rough Guide [+]Steve Lyons and Chris Howarth, DWM short stories (Panini Publishing Ltd, 2000).) In one telling, the President whom she challenged and ousted was Flavia herself, even though it had been Flavia who had invited her onto the High Council. (PROSE: Gallifrey: A Rough Guide [+]Steve Lyons and Chris Howarth, DWM short stories (Panini Publishing Ltd, 2000).) In another, a coup to which Romana had no ties overthrew Flavia, and a new, male President was sworn in. It was against him that Romana invoked a right of challenge against the President and been successful, succeeding him, after she had been \"asked to become President\", in spite of her lack of political experience. (AUDIO: Lies [+]Gary Russell, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2005).)\n\nOne of Romana's first actions as President was to establish a Tharil embassy and, in her first speech, she called an end to Gallifrey's policy of isolationism. (PROSE: Happy Endings [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).)\n\nAccording to one account, soon after taking office Romana suffered an epileptic fit caused by the Carnival Queen, who wished to threaten the rational underpinnings of the universe. During this fit, she signed an executive order releasing three hundred prisoners from Shada, including Grandfather Paradox. (PROSE: Christmas on a Rational Planet [+]Lawrence Miles, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996)., Crimes Against History [+]Lawrence Miles, The Spiral Politic Database (2001-2002).) However, another account stated that Salyavin, upon leaving Shada on his own centuries before Romana's time, used his powers to make the Time Lords forget about Shada. Romana herself told Skagra she had \"never even heard of it\", referring to the prison as \"the actions of previous administrations\". (WC: Shada [+]Douglas Adams and Gary Russell, adapted from Shada (Douglas Adams), BBCi animations (2003).)\n\nIn the early days of her Presidency, Romana was abducted by the Daleks and spent more than two decades in captivity before escaping with the help of the Doctor, now in his sixth incarnation. During her absence, a predecessor stepped in for her. (AUDIO: The Apocalypse Element [+]Stephen Cole, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2000).) Upon returning to Gallifrey, she resumed the Presidency. (AUDIO: Weapon of Choice [+]Alan Barnes, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2004)., etc.)\n\nRomana sanctioned an experiment with the Celestial Intervention Agency to look into the phenomenon of anti-time. As part of this experiment, she went with Coordinator Vansell on an extraction mission to collect the Eighth Doctor and his companion Charlotte Pollard, informing them that Charley's survival after the crash of the R101 had caused damage to the Web of Time. Travelling into the universe of anti-time, they discovered the Neverpeople that resulted from the Gallifreyans' use of the Oubliette of Eternity. As Sentris was manipulating Vansell to explode a critical mass of anti-time in the Panopticon, she reset her presidential codes in the Matrix. Rassilon claimed that she had the Matrix's favour and a door was created that returned her to Gallifrey, with Charley's survival resolved. (AUDIO: Neverland [+]Alan Barnes, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).)\n\nRomana had Cardinal Braxiatel monitor the section of the galaxy where the Doctor's TARDIS had been staying since the anti-time explosion. She and Leela entered the Matrix to talk to Rassilon, who had appeared in Leela's dreams, and encountered the infected Doctor and a manifestation of the TARDIS. Romana helped the Doctor recover before banishing him to the Divergent Universe as a precaution against the spread of anti-time. She told Leela that she believed that they had the beginnings of a beautiful friendship. (AUDIO: Zagreus [+]Alan Barnes and Gary Russell, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2003).)\n\nAfter Nepenthe of the Free Time movement took possession of the Timonic Fusion Device that had allegedly been disassembled, Romana interrogated arms dealer Mephistopheles Arkadian about the movement. With the Monan Host threatening invasion of Gryben to obtain the device, she had to stop Coordinator Narvin from launching Battle TARDISes and Cardinal Braxiatel from stopping an evacuation. She used her position to stop a war by going to the planet herself, as she knew if she was on the planet any action which would kill Monan forces would also kill herself. She learnt that the device was a bluff. (AUDIO: Weapon of Choice [+]Alan Barnes, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2004).)\n\nRomana organised a fake temporal summit to draw out Free Time, sending Narvin as the Time Lord delegate and Leela as an undercover agent. Hossak caused a number of changes to the timeline, culminating in Romana, who joined the conference, becoming a paradox. Over the course of the summit, Romana identified the Monan delegate V'rell as a member of Free Time and Hossak as the one behind the timeline alterations. Hossak tried to kill Romana due to her paradoxical nature, after which she was arrested. (AUDIO: Square One [+]Stephen Cole, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2004).)\n\nInquisitor Darkel presided over a judicial inquiry into Romana's actions on Gryben. Romana provided evidence that she had reason to believe that the device was genuine, assisted by information from K9 and Narvin and a data bomb planted in the Matrix by Braxiatel. She also learnt about how and why Braxiatel began his collection and went back in time to stop the retro-crime that occurred in stealing the device. (AUDIO: The Inquiry [+]Justin Richards, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2004).)\n\nArkadian invited Romana to Earth to discuss the Timonic Fusion Device, meeting on the Calais Transcontinental Express in 1939. Romana learnt of Commander Torvald's plan involving Sissy Pollard and, later, that he was an incarnation of Andred. (AUDIO: A Blind Eye [+]Alan Barnes, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2004).)\n\nAs the High Council was comprised of herself and three cardinals who were not especially sympathetic to her, Romana appointed the Arcalian Chapter Castellan Wynter to the Council. Cardinal Braxiatel attempted to have Romana make him her High Chancellor to support her, but she was loath to be seen to hand high offices to her friends.\n\nRomana, Leela and K9 Mark I encountered Pandora in the vaults and finally came to understand why her first incarnation had initiated her regeneration. Pandora told her that Romana was the result of centuries of genetic manipulation and intended to be her new host body. (AUDIO: Lies [+]Gary Russell, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2005).)\n\nRomana took Leela on a short holiday to Davidia after she decided that she wanted to leave Gallifrey. Their break was cut short by the arrival of a charred body that arrived in an anomalous TARDIS, a TARDIS that they learnt from Braxiatel must be from the future. Hoping to help the charred Time Lord, Romana and Leela entered a sensory tank with him, where she experienced the world through Leela's viewpoint, bringing them to more of an understanding. (AUDIO: Spirit [+]Stephen Cole, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2005).)\n\nDarkel manipulated Romana into appointing Braxiatel as her High Chancellor, causing some controversy. She also put Braxiatel in charge of the Academy, now educating off-world students from the Temporal Powers. After Wynter released Pandora, Romana realised that he was the charred man, having gone back in time to warn her of Pandora. Braxiatel absorbed the past and present aspects of Pandora and, to protect the Time Lords, he was exiled. (AUDIO: Pandora [+]Justin Richards, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2005).)\n\nRomana gave Leela a job at the Academy and had her monitor the situation there, fearing that Darkel might incite civil war. Influenced by Pandora, she became more paranoid and agitated about the Inquisitor Prime's actions and murdered Andred, (AUDIO: Insurgency [+]Steve Lyons, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2005).) harming her friendship with Leela. She started having dreams of being Imperiatrix.\n\nAfter a terrorist bombing at the Academy, Romana had a political debate with Darkel and wanted to put her and Narvin on trial for their actions. In response to Darkel making a bid for the presidency and at Pandora's suggestion, she declared herself Imperiatrix of Gallifrey and crowned herself with the Coronet of Rassilon. This connected her to the Matrix and gave Pandora form as Romana's first incarnation, declaring herself to be Imperiatrix. (AUDIO: Imperiatrix [+]Stewart Sheargold, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2005).)\n\nFreed by her Chancellery Guards, Romana began the Gallifreyan Civil War. She targeted the Capitol's infrastructure and stopped TARDISes from functioning rather than attacking people, not wanting anyone to be hurt and seeking to avoid a time war. In addition to this, she asked Commentator Gerber to broadcast propaganda to win support. She travelled to the Anomaly Vault in order to get Wynter's TARDIS to have an advantage against Pandora, but whilst she was there she was attacked by Aesino who she thought she might be able to use. (AUDIO: Fractures [+]Stephen Cole, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nFollowing her experience in the vault, Romana was weakened. However, she managed to trick Pandora into having a meeting inside the Matrix where she was taken by the Anomaly Vault's sentience before Romana had the Matrix completely wiped. (AUDIO: Warfare [+]Stewart Sheargold, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nDue to Romana's weakened status, Chancellor Valyes became Acting President before appointed Darkel as his successor. Romana argued that this was not politically sound and both she and Cardinal Matthias laid claims to the presidency, with Romana agreeing to regenerate should it be deemed necessary. (AUDIO: Appropriation [+]Paul Sutton, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) Darkel and Matthias had her arrested for high treason, but she was released after Braxiatel returned and made a superior claim for the presidency, immediately resigning and naming Matthias his successor before returning to exile. (AUDIO: Mindbomb [+]Justin Richards, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2006).)\n\nRomana decided to return to the House of Heartshaven, where she found Janartis exhibiting signs of the Dogma Virus. She attempted to find a cure and learnt that Braxiatel had named Matthias as his successor as whoever was President would be doomed to fall to the virus. She found that the only way to cure the virus was to end the Time Lords' regenerative abilities, which she was hesitant to do. With the help of K9, Braxiatel used a Time Scoop to collect the biodata archive and asked Romana to decide whether to administer the cure or to let Gallifrey die and then rebuild it using the biodata. She made her decision (AUDIO: Panacea [+]Alan Barnes, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2006).) but Braxiatel then took her to the Axis. (AUDIO: Reborn [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt the Axis with Braxiatel, Leela, K9 and Narvin, Romana resolved to explore alternative versions of Gallifrey to find a new home or a way to cure the Dogma Virus. In a world where regenerations were currency, she found out that she had not met the Doctor and that she had married Andred. She met her counterpart and her son, Antonin. (AUDIO: Reborn [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn another Gallifrey, Romana met a ruthless counterpart that went to great lengths to maintain order and have the Web of Time woven to Gallifrey's benefit. Her counterpart assigned the Burner Doctor to execute the prime Romana and Braxiatel was lost, falling into one of the Axis's portals after their escape. (AUDIO: Disassembled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter losing Braxiatel, Romana discovered a world where the Great Vampires had defeated the True Lords of Gallifrey. Lord Prydon attempted to make Romana his consort but, thanks to the immunity she gained in E-Space, this failed and she helped Lady Borusa to destroy them and, in the process, Gallifrey. Destroying another world - another Gallifrey - distressed Romana. (AUDIO: Annihilation [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe group also visited a Gallifrey where the Time Lords were simian. (AUDIO: Forever [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen an alternative Romana was assassinated, Romana took her place and attempted to help the people of that world perfect their Eye of Harmony. Narvin's counterpart realised that she was from another world and threatened the slaves to make sure that she would comply with his wishes. However, the Eye turned out to be a prison for the Krilig and it was closed, stranding Leela, Narvin and herself on the alternative Gallifrey and K9 in the Axis. (AUDIO: Forever [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRomana, as President, declared that she would form a New Gallifrey, banning slavery, instituting liberal policies and investing time in alternative time technologies. She identified exposure to the Time Vortex as a possible cure to the Dogma Virus. She mediated a dispute about access to Zeiton-7 between the Outsiders, led by Leela, and the Mining Guild led by Councillor Allora. (AUDIO: Emancipation [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRomana attended a conference into alternative time technologies and used money as an incentive to get the progress she needed. She was informed by Castellan Slyne that Kavil had discovered a signal in the Time Vortex, which they later discovered was the word \"Axis\". (AUDIO: Evolution [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nShe argued with Zakar about a section of land which the Outsiders controlled, prompting Narvin to advise moderation between the two parties. Kavil's signal was amplified and a portal opened in the Panopticon, through which arrived the Daleks. (AUDIO: Arbitration [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRomana escaped the Daleks in the Panopticon and managed to tell Castellan Slyne their only weakness, going to the armoury with Leela to halt the Daleks. They were successful in preventing the Daleks' plan to invade the multiverse and managed to return home, complete with a cure for the Dogma Virus. She killed a Dalek herself before leaving. (AUDIO: Extermination [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nShortly after arriving on what seemed to be her own Gallifrey (actually the Matrix), Romana was greeted by her next incarnation, calling herself Trey, who entered into a deal with her to return Gallifrey to its former state, thus saving herself thousands of years of work. She became increasingly tired sorting out the calculations and the negotiations. Trey was worried about her and Romana wanted her exiled, but was exiled herself by Trey for the death of Kolspen of Unvoss. She returned to Gallifrey just as there was trouble with the transduction barrier and the Eye of Harmony. (AUDIO: Renaissance [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRomana learnt that she had been saved by K9. Arriving in the real world, she was reinstated as President following Matthias's resignation. She could not decide whether or not to use the measure that would cure the Dogma Virus, but Leela decided for her, after which a Dalek force invaded from the Matrix. Romana tricked them into re-entering the Matrix before trapping them there, as was planned by Trey, who turned out to be a Matrix projection. She then set about rebuilding her Gallifrey, which was crippled by disease and war, and was unaware that Narvin had attempted to avert the creation of the Daleks to save her when he believed her to be trapped in the Matrix. (AUDIO: Ascension [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRomana travelled to Earth after Leela disappeared during an investigation that Romana sent her on. Whilst there, she encountered the Sixth Doctor again, as well as Mike Yates, and helped them defeat Rees after freeing Leela's captive consciousness. (AUDIO: Second Sight [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRomana sent the Seventh Doctor to recover the Master's remains from Skaro (PROSE: Lungbarrow [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Lungbarrow, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997)., AUDIO: The Eleven [+]Matt Fitton, Doom Coalition 1 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) shortly after he and Rasmus captured the Eleven. (AUDIO: The Eleven [+]Matt Fitton, Doom Coalition 1 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Doom Coalition, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) By one account, she asked this of him in person after events involving the House of Lungbarrow, (PROSE: Lungbarrow [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Lungbarrow, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) whereas another account had her contacting the TARDIS to deliver the request. (PROSE: The TV Movie [+]Gary Russell, adapted from Doctor Who (Matthew Jacobs), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2021).)\n\nThe Nine captured Romana and placed her in his prison for the Doctor's companions. The Nine was later defeated thanks to River Song, Liv Chenka, Helen Sinclair, Charlotte Pollard and Bliss. (AUDIO: Companion Piece [+]John Dorney, Ravenous 3 (The Eighth Doctor Adventures: Ravenous, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nWhen a paradox began diminishing the Time Lords' power, Romana became aware of herself and Leela both having memories of visiting Henlen, the location of the first flight of the original prototype TARDIS. They travelled back in time to correct the timeline but instead prevented the experiment, which had been sabotaged by the Sirens of Time, from happening at all, causing a timeline in which the Time Lords' mastery of time travel never came to be. With the help of the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Doctors, she completed the first flight without the Sirens' interference, restoring the timelines. (AUDIO: Collision Course [+]Guy Adams, The Legacy of Time (Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nRomana went to fix the engines of the Moros as a gesture for the Monan Host after diplomatic relations broke down. She planned to use her regeneration as a power boost to stop the ship from becoming a black hole, but her next incarnation sent Braxiatel back in time to stop her so as to avoid the war with Omega. To be doubly sure that this future would be avoided, Romana stepped down from the presidency and named Livia as her successor, appointing herself as Coordinator of the CIA.\n\nOne of her first acts was to investigate the death of Narvin. She then discovered that it was Gaal, a Warpsmith of Phaidon, that was behind the destruction of Moros and the Monan embassy on Gallifrey. With the help of Braxiatel she tracked the source of the paradoxes and found the Leela from the original timeline (i.e. Romana III's world) who was left on Legion. After negotiating with the Watchmaker, Romana found a way to stop the black hole and created a new timeline in which Narvin did not die. (AUDIO: Enemy Lines [+]David Llewellyn, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nRomana was concerned when Narvin, whom she had made her Deputy Coordinator, told her of a secret facility belonging to the War Council, already suspicious of them and greatly angered by them due to their conduct and rhetoric when the Joint Council discussed the matter of granting asylum to the Warpsmiths. She and Narvin became aware of a War Council facility resurrecting dead Time Lords in the Death Zone and later gave Braxiatel and Ace permission to go on a mission. (AUDIO: Celestial Intervention [+]David Llewellyn, Time War: Volume One (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nAfter Narvin informed Romana that Ace seemed to be dead and that Braxiatel had disappeared, she planned to use the War Master in the fight against the Daleks. (AUDIO: Soldier Obscura [+]Tim Foley, Time War: Volume One (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2018).) Narvin warned her against it, but she proceeded with the plan, sending him with Leela to get information from Finnian Valentine concerning a weapon. She greatly regretted her decision after the Master went AWOL and Leela apparently died. (AUDIO: The Devil You Know [+]Scott Handcock, Time War: Volume One (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nRomana secretly came into contact with the Dalek Emperor and attempted to find a diplomatic solution to avoid further death. She decided to run for presidency again after Livia resigned and named Admiral Valerian as her successor. However, she was unsuccessful after Valerian made her conversations with the Emperor public, albeit heavily edited, and she denounced Valerian as a puppet President for the War Council. Valerian was used as a host body for the resurrection of Rassilon. Narvin gave Romana a message from Braxiatel - that he was right to abandon the war and that she ought to do what the Doctor had. After learning from Narvin what had happened on Project Revenant, Romana realised what the War Council planned and hurried to the Panopticon where they witnessed the Matrix Rassilon's resurrection in Valerian's body. Romana was then arrested for treason for her negotiations with the Emperor. (AUDIO: Desperate Measures [+]Matt Fitton, Time War: Volume One (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2018).) To her surprise, Rassilon exonerated her and reinstated her as Coordinator.\n\nPresident Eternal Rassilon's policies were very much against Romana's own views and she found herself at odds not only with the War Council but with the newly created Interior Defence Unit led by Cardinal Mantus, the Chancellery Guard having been dissolved. Trave arrived from the future and told them that Rassilon's rule would lead to ruin, but Rassilon executed his earlier incarnation. (AUDIO: Havoc [+]David Llewellyn, Time War: Volume Two (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nRomana oversaw the CIA's intervention in Ysalus' civil war and arranged the planet's preservation in a time freeze after the intervention failed, due to coming into conflict with a rival War Council Intervention, which instead escalated the war. (AUDIO: Partisans [+]Una McCormack, Time War: Volume Two (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nShe was later informed by General Dalia that the freeze had been breached and Scythes were scavenging the planet. Together they worked with a native, Knyla Shen, to organise an evacuation of Yslaus, with Romana sending Eris back in time one year to meet Kynla and enable her to make contact with Gallifrey in the first place. The War Council erased Ysalus from time, with Kynla being too late to reach the CIA's TARDISes. After learning Rassilon has arranged this whole Incident as a example, Romana discovered that Eris had helped Kynla send a signal across time calling for a resistance against the Time War. She arranged the signal's preservation and helped Eris escape Gallifrey. (AUDIO: Collateral [+]Lisa McMullin, Time War: Volume Two (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nAlthough Narvin was unwilling to assist, Romana and Livia planned to assassinate Rassilon using the Sicari. Whilst the plan was almost successful, Rassilon survived. Romana and Narvin, who had sacrificed the chance of a new regeneration cycle to come to her aid, were locked away but freed and framed for killing a guard so as to avoid making martyrs of them. Mantus escorted them to a old TARDIS and exiled them from Gallifrey, informing them that the CIA was being subsumed into the IDU. They decided to find Leela. (AUDIO: Assassins [+]Matt Fitton, Time War: Volume Two (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nRomana and Narvin landed Dreadnought Septima after escaping one of skirmishes in the war. Finding that there were TARDISes on board they hoped to get spare parts for their now damaged TARDIS. As the ship was launched before their exile, her CIA codes still worked. She found a fully equipped TARDIS and asked Narvin to collect anything that was useful. They discovered the results of Project Fury and how it related to the Sicari. She realised that Trellick knew how to help them escape as many Time Lords had come before. They escaped the collapsing ship and replaced the broken dematerialisation circuit. (AUDIO: Hostiles [+]David Llewellyn, Time War: Volume Three (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2020).) Trying to trace Leela, they something went wrong with the signal and they decided to land to Njagilheim which proved a bit difficult. She was bitten by something even though there were no life nearby to do it. She then started hearing a low hum. They sort shelter with Agata and Ivor. She was warned about the ghosts by Aldiss and she later heard them screaming. She thought that they were coming a temporal storm. She realised that the planet's time line had been cracked by the Time War, and theorised that Leela was the start of the Paradox. Romana worked out that it was the Orrovix that was being hunting her because of her extensive travels with the Doctor. They managed to escape the time loop and the Orrovix before it collapsed. (AUDIO: Nevernor [+]Lou Morgan, Time War: Volume Three (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2020).) During their travels they encountered members of the resistance against Rassilon (AUDIO: Deception [+]Lisa McMullin, Time War: Volume Four (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) and heard of what had become of the Doctor, that he'd changed for the worse. (AUDIO: Beyond [+]David Llewellyn, Time War: Volume Four (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nThey finally found Leela on Unity but were exposed to the Daleks when local crimeboss Jarred McKenzie noticed their TARDIS. Romana had finally tired of the endless cycle of death and destruction bought about by the war and elected to stay behind to cover Leela and Narvin's escape from an imminent Dalek attack. At first intending to use a chameleon arch to \"wipe the slate clean\" she believed such a chance was undeserved given her previous actions, instead surrendering to the approaching Daleks. The Daleks opened fire after she refused to reveal where Narvin and Leela had escaped to (AUDIO: Unity [+]David Llewellyn, Time War: Volume Three (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2020).) but she was saved by Braxiatel using his TARDIS' shields. (AUDIO: Dissolution [+]Lou Morgan, Time War: Volume Four (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2021).) Braxiatel took Romana with him into the Beyond, as he needed a second Time Lord to activate the Parallax. They journeyed through an alternate timeline where President Romana had authorised the destruction of the Cannavar system. They were pursued by the Ravenous, eventually ending up on this timeline's version of Gallifrey where Romana was horrrified to witness Leela's death. They were retrieved from Gallifrey by Braxiatel's TARDIS controlled by the creator of the Parallax, an older version of Braxiatel. He revealed the Parallax was not actually a weapon but rather a gateway to a possible timeline where the Daleks never existed, which he'd stabilised, and offered to let Romana come with him. Whilst she decided the younger Braxiatel angrily returned to his TARDIS, but was killed by the Ravenous. Romana refused the older Braxiatel's offer and he let her use his TARDIS to return to normal space. (AUDIO: Beyond [+]David Llewellyn, Time War: Volume Four (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nUpon returning to the universe Romana was ambushed by the Daleks and captured. On the Time Strategist's advice, the Emperor had her kept prisoner rather than killed. She was used as the Daleks' spokesperson during their gambit to conquer Gallifrey with null zone technology but was freed by Leela. As they fled through the saucer, they were joined by Narvin, Livia and Mantus. After Mantus was exterminated and Livia wounded, Narvin and Livia decided to detonate his TARDIS to destroy the Daleks' null zone power source but insisted Romana and Leela escape, believing they were more valuable to the war effort. Romana and Leela fled in Braxiatel's TARDIS as the saucer was destroyed but were diverted to the Cloisters by Rassilon. He had Romana imprisoned in a pocket dimension where she would serve as an archivist, including of documentation of her own past glories, whilst Leela was conscripted. Romana urged Leela to fight with the better Time Lords and was then sent away. (AUDIO: Homecoming [+]Matt Fitton, Time War: Volume Four (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nIn the original timeline, during her second term Lady President Romana went on a mission to fix the engines of the Moros where she regenerated in a third incarnation in a desperate bid to stop the ship's core from turning into a black hole. (AUDIO: Enemy Lines [+]David Llewellyn, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2016).) She would subsequently live through a devastating war precipitated by the return of Omega (AUDIO: Intervention Earth [+]Scott Handcock and David Llewellyn, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2015).), which left her the last of her kind on a ruined Gallifrey. (AUDIO: Luna Romana [+]Matt Fitton, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2014)., Enemy Lines [+]David Llewellyn, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2016)., etc.) However, Braxiatel later rewrote history to prevent this regeneration, claiming he was doing so on this third incarnation's own instructions. (AUDIO: Enemy Lines [+]David Llewellyn, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nIn the lead-up to the War in Heaven, Romana II - on a version of Gallifrey which may (PROSE: Crimes Against History (first edition) [+]Error: Code 4 - no data in variables or cache and SMW returned information for multiple variants, the one required here not being clear., ect.) or may not (PROSE: Crimes Against History (second edition) [+]Error: Code 4 - no data in variables or cache and SMW returned information for multiple variants, the one required here not being clear.) have been the original - ended up regenerating into a \"form more suitable for war\". This Romana III adopted the title \"War Queen and Mistress of the Nine Gallifreys\". (PROSE: The Shadows of Avalon [+]Paul Cornell, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000)., The Ancestor Cell [+]Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2000).)\n\nAfter the Time War, the Tenth Doctor found K9 Mark II, who informed him that he had been placed by Romana. Reuniting with Leela, the Doctor admitted that he missed Romana, whilst Leela acknowledged her as one of those who were \"gone\". (AUDIO: Splinters [+]John Dorney, Tenth Doctor Classic Companions (Big Finish Productions, 2022).)\n\nAt some point, Romana was taken to the Black Archive by UNIT to have her record as a companion of the Doctor taken. Her memories of the visit were subsequently erased and she was sent on her way. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAt one point, Romana had a Prime Computer brought to the TARDIS, and showed the Doctor its abilities, including calculating the length of the Doctor's scarf and suggesting to him that he should marry Romana. Romana was then kidnapped by the Liprogopolisians, who wanted a Prime Computer for themselves. She was safely returned to the TARDIS afterwards. (TV: Prime Computer advertisement [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt another point, Romana was abducted by Adam Mitchell as part his plan to get revenge on the Doctor, in collaboration with the Tremas Master. She was placed in stasis alongside the Doctor's multiple other companions, before being released by the Doctor's first eleven numbered incarnations with the help of Frobisher. (COMIC: The Choice [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013)., Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nIn an alternate timeline in which Aubertides succeeded in getting the Seventh Doctor's biodata and invaded Gallifrey, Greeneye and August tried to persuade Romana to tell them about secrets of the Matrix. When Romana refused their order, they killed her. (PROSE: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor saw a version of Romana in a projection built by the Matrix to show Gallifrey after being affected by anti-time. Romana had taken the title \"Imperiatrix\" and was much more ruthless than the Doctor expected. In the projection, she presided over the obliteration of a Dalek Fleet trapped in a time loop. (AUDIO: Neverland [+]Alan Barnes, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2002).)\n\nMany versions of Romana existed in alternate timelines accessible via the Axis. One version of Romana came from an alternate Gallifrey where the Time Lords sold their weapons to other species. (AUDIO: Reborn [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Another version came from a Gallifrey where Time Lords were Interventionists. In this timeline, Romana was regularly informed of the interventions, which her prime counterpart was horrified by. At the same time, this Romana was more bloodthirsty and short-tempered compared to her counterpart. (AUDIO: Disassembled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) A final version came from a Gallifrey where the Time Lords were known as Regenerators, and had yet to discover time travel. (AUDIO: Forever [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., Emancipation [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn an alternate timeline in the Beyond, President Romana ordered the Dreadnought Servia to destroy the Cannavar system, which was home to 22 billion people, to strike back against an enemy who were using it as a staging post to attack Gallifrey and had killed Leela in a previous attack. (AUDIO: Beyond [+]David Llewellyn, Time War: Volume Four (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2021).)\n\nRomana was confident, intelligent (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979)., The Leisure Hive [+]David Fisher, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980)., etc.) and witty, (TV: City of Death [+]David Agnew, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979)., Shada [+]Douglas Adams, Doctor Who (1992).) more than capable of separating from the Doctor and resolving situations on her own. (TV: Nightmare of Eden [+]Bob Baker, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979)., The Horns of Nimon [+]Anthony Read, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979-1980)., AUDIO: The Paradox Planet [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., etc.) She felt that she had learnt from (TV: Meglos [+]John Flanagan and Andrew McCulloch, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980).) and grown thanks to him, (AUDIO: The Thief Who Stole Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) although some of her previous incarnation's iciness remained early on. (TV: The Creature from the Pit [+]David Fisher, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).) Whilst she could be fearful, she remained quick to react. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979)., Meglos [+]John Flanagan and Andrew McCulloch, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980)., The Horns of Nimon [+]Anthony Read, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979-1980).)\n\nNarvin listed Romana's virtues as \"compassion, intuition, emotion, honesty, integrity, pragmatism and extreme competence\". (AUDIO: The Inquiry [+]Justin Richards, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) Whilst she claimed that she never lied, this was not always true. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).; AUDIO: A Blind Eye [+]Alan Barnes, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) When talking to people from a lower social standing, she did not talk down to them, in fact doing quite the reverse. (AUDIO: The Labyrinth of Buda Castle [+]Eddie Robson, The Fourth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2016).) She also had something of a maternal side (TV: The Horns of Nimon [+]Anthony Read, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979-1980).) and did not appreciate being bowed and scraped and fawned at. (AUDIO: Legacy of Death [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Unlike the Doctor, she was capable of identifying when a woman was attractive. (AUDIO: The Labyrinth of Buda Castle [+]Eddie Robson, The Fourth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2016).) She never carried guns as she found that they had little defensive value, (AUDIO: The Paradox Planet [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) but she was not above using them when absolutely necessary. (TV: The Horns of Nimon [+]Anthony Read, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979-1980)., AUDIO: Extermination [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She obeyed the Time Lords' strict rule of non-intervention when it suited her. (AUDIO: The Paradox Planet [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She was annoyed when there wasn't any explanation, preferring the inexplicable to be explained. (AUDIO: The Haunting of Malkin Place [+]Phil Mulryne, The Fourth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nDue to her new lifestyle of exploration and adventure, Romana dreaded the thought of spending the rest of her life on Gallifrey, (TV: Full Circle [+]Andrew Smith, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980).) finding that her life aboard the TARDIS was one full of \"thrills and spills\". (AUDIO: The Silent Scream [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Upon returning from E-Space, however, she returned to her homeworld (AUDIO: The Apocalypse Element [+]Stephen Cole, Main Range (Big Finish Productions, 2000).) and endeavoured to liberalise Time Lord society during her presidency, frustrated with the monopolistic and isolationist policies of Gallifrey. Her subjects saw her as a radical but she herself did not think so, simply believing that power gave her the responsibility to do what was right. (AUDIO: Weapon of Choice [+]Alan Barnes, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2004).) She was willing to sacrifice her position for the planet's safety, but made herself Coordinator of the CIA so that she might still steer the Time Lords in what she saw as the right direction. (AUDIO: Enemy Lines [+]David Llewellyn, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2016).) She was also willing to regenerate in order to become President once more and lead the planet during the Last Great Time War. (AUDIO: Desperate Measures [+]Matt Fitton, Time War: Volume One (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nIn her free time, Romana enjoyed embarking on constructive and intellectual activities, finding recreation such as walking along a beach dull and pointless (TV: The Leisure Hive [+]David Fisher, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980).) and finding shoe-shopping neither emancipating nor intellectually stimulating. (AUDIO: Wave of Destruction [+]Justin Richards, The Fourth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nThe Doctor described her as \"wonderful\", which she supposed she was, (TV: State of Decay [+]Terrance Dicks, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980).) and as \"the noblest Romana of them all\", (TV: Warriors' Gate [+]Steve Gallagher, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1981).) saying that he could not ask for more from a companion. (AUDIO: The Thief Who Stole Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He also found her fun when she was being bossy and, as a result, was uncertain if he liked it or not when she agreed with him. (AUDIO: Dethras [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She inspired loyalty from Braxiatel, Leela and Narvin (AUDIO: Weapon of Choice [+]Alan Barnes, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2004)., Lies [+]Gary Russell, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2005)., etc.) and, despite her controversial policies, was broadly popular. (AUDIO: Ascension [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRomana was initially resentful of how Adric had forced himself upon them in joining their travels, but soon came to like him. (AUDIO: The Invasion of E-Space [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nDuring the early days of the Last Great Time War, Romana sought diplomatic means to end the conflict with the Daleks, (AUDIO: Desperate Measures [+]Matt Fitton, Time War: Volume One (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2018).) intending to fight the war in her own way. (AUDIO: Celestial Intervention [+]David Llewellyn, Time War: Volume One (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2018).) When such measures failed, she still believed that the war could be won without using Dalek-like methods. (AUDIO: Partisans [+]Una McCormack, Time War: Volume Two (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2019).) The actions of Gallifrey under President Rassilon led her to believe that the planet was not the world that she had fought for and that it was no longer her home. (AUDIO: Assassins [+]Matt Fitton, Time War: Volume Two (Gallifrey: Time War, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nRomana proved a scientific genius. Her intellect rivalled and sometimes surpassed the Doctor's, as proven by her superior sonic screwdriver. (TV: The Horns of Nimon [+]Anthony Read, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979-1980)., AUDIO: The Labyrinth of Buda Castle [+]Eddie Robson, The Fourth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2016).)\n\nRomana had great strength, as shown when she took on Sharrel unarmed. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).)\n\nRomana was a small, neat woman, (PROSE: Blood Harvest [+]Terrance Dicks, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).) noticeably shorter than her previous incarnation, (AUDIO: Luna Romana [+]Matt Fitton, The Companion Chronicles (Big Finish Productions, 2014).) and was aristocratically beautiful with long fair hair and a high forehead. (PROSE: The Five Doctors [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from The Five Doctors (Terrance Dicks), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1983).) She had pert lips, a noble brow and fair skin. (AUDIO: The Romance of Crime [+]John Dorney, adapted from The Romance of Crime (Gareth Roberts), Novel Adaptations: Volume 1 (Novel Adaptations, Big Finish Productions, 2015).) After regenerating, she described herself as having an imposing forehead, nice hair, a neat little chin and slightly overlong arms, although the Fourth Doctor assured her that their length was fine. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from Destiny of the Daleks (Terry Nation), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1979).) Duggan thought that she looked twenty-five. (PROSE: City of Death [+]James Goss, adapted from City of Death (David Agnew (writer)), BBC Books novelisations (BBC Books, 2015).)\n\nRomana once donned a pink version of the Doctor's coat, with a white version of his scarf. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks [+]Terry Nation, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).) She also wore a variety of dresses, building on her previous incarnation's sense of style. (TV: The Androids of Tara [+]David Fisher, Doctor Who season 16 (BBC1, 1978)., The Creature from the Pit [+]David Fisher, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979).) On Tigella, she wore a frilled dress. (TV: Meglos [+]John Flanagan and Andrew McCulloch, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980).) When defeating the Nimon, she wore a crimson frockcoat, a gold brocade waistcoat, an ivory stock tie, beige trousers, and brown boots. (TV: The Horns of Nimon [+]Anthony Read, Doctor Who season 17 (BBC1, 1979-1980).) Once she returned to Gallifrey, she wore traditional Time Lord garb. (PROSE: Goth Opera [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin Missing Adventures (Virgin Books, 1994).)\n\nThe designation \"Romana II\" is not precisely derived from DWU fiction. Rather, it comes from various reference works like The Companions of Doctor Who [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW. and Doctor Who Magazine [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW. itself. However, stories in the Gallifrey [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW. audio series, such as Warfare [+]Stewart Sheargold, Gallifrey (Big Finish Productions, 2006)., stated that the Lalla Ward Romana was the second incarnation of Romana, and her predecessor the first.\n\nSo, while these names — \"Romana I\" and \"Romana II\", and so on — never appeared in any work of fiction that this Wiki covers, valid or not, the convention of these Roman numeral based names are so prevalent in official usage that they are simply the logical choice given that they're best known under these names.",
