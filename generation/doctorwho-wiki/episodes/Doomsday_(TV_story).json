  "content": "Doomsday was the thirteenth and final episode of series two of Doctor Who.\n\nIt was the final regular appearance of Billie Piper as Rose Tyler and introduced Catherine Tate as the future companion Donna Noble in its closing moments. The episode also marked the first onscreen meeting between the Daleks and the Cybermen.\n\nNarratively, the destruction of Torchwood London seeded the way for the spinoff Torchwood, where Torchwood Three eventually became all that remained of the Institute. The Cult of Skaro escapes at the climax of this episode, starting a string of Dalek stories which eventually concluded with the reestablishment of the Daleks as a race beyond survivors of the Time War in Victory of the Daleks, four years later.\n\nTardisode 13 occurs during the events of this episode, when the battle reaches a climax. It is the last of the Tardisode series, ending with the series 2 finale.\n\nA secret order of Daleks emerge and the Cybermen from Pete's World make their way to Torchwood Tower. As the two deadly forces fight over Earth, the Tenth Doctor realises that in order to stop the threat, sacrifices will be made.\n\nDr Singh, Mickey Smith and Rose Tyler are trapped in a sealed room within Torchwood Tower as the four Daleks (one black and three bronze) who have emerged from the void ship approach them, with a vaguely Dalek-shaped artefact following. As they cry out their intent to exterminate, Rose bellows their name which stops them in their tracks. She approaches the black Dalek and offers to tell them how she knows about the Daleks and the Time War if they keep them alive, with Mickey and Dr Singh playing along. The black Dalek decides that they are necessary and asks about the status of the artefact — which he calls the Genesis Ark. He orders the awakening to begin (with one of them proceeding to monitor the Ark) and declares that the Ark must be protected above all else. The black Dalek giving commands exudes leadership.\n\nThe Cybermen hold Jackie Tyler, Yvonne Hartman, and the Tenth Doctor hostage. The Cyber-Leader demands to speak to the world leader. Yvonne says they don't have one, to which the Cyber-Leader replies that they have now. The Cyber-Leader interrupts all television and radio to make a message in which it promises to convert all humans into Cybermen. There appear to be Cybermen in every home on Earth, and Cybermen are said to be on every landmass. However, despite the call for surrender, the British Army mobilises and soon fighting and fire have spread across the whole of London, with both sides taking losses. Watching the chaos from the window, the Cyber-Leader is confused, as he remarks that he ordered surrender, to which the Doctor angrily says that mankind is not taking instructions; the Cybermen are \"on every street, you're in their homes, you've got their children! Of course, they're gonna fight!\", pointing out that humanity are not going to willingly surrender the very things that make them human.\n\nThe black Dalek demands that the trio identify which is least important which Rose refuses to answer, but Dr Singh volunteers, knowing he is of no importance compared to the two time travellers. The black Dalek orders him to kneel down, saying that they need to know everything they can about current Earth history. Singh begins to respond but the Daleks say that speech is not required. Three of the Daleks place their plungers around his skull and drain his brain. A few minutes later, his mutilated corpse drops to the floor. Rose yells at the Daleks that they didn't need to kill him, but they coldly state they didn't need him alive either.\n\nThe Cybermen then notice other lifeforms in the building and send Cyber units Ten-Six-Five and Ten-Six-Six to the Void Room to investigate. At the same time, the Daleks notice lifeform readings and the black one orders one of his compatriots, addressing him as Dalek Thay, to investigate. The Cybermen and the Dalek meet in the corridor outside the Void Room. The Doctor, Jackie, Rose and Mickey can see them both through video transmissions and the Doctor is visibly horrified to see the Dalek, whose presence automatically makes the situation much worse.\n\nThe Cybermen ask that the Daleks identify themselves and the Daleks demand the same. Neither complies and there is a stand-off, which Mickey describes as \"Stephen Hawking meets the Speaking Clock\". The Daleks accidentally slip up when Dalek Thay says that \"Daleks do not take orders\", but recognise the Cybermen, comparing them to their own universe's Cybermen. The Cybermen and the Daleks exchange insults until the Cybermen offer to form an alliance with the Daleks to overtake Earth, and eventually upgrade the universe, together. The Dalek refuses and the Cybermen respond with laser fire; the Dalek shrugs off the shots and almost dismissively exterminates them both in seconds.\n\nThe Cyber-Leader contacts the Daleks and warns them that they have declared war on the Cybermen, to which the black Dalek replies, \"This is not war, this is pest control!\", confident that the entire Cyberman race  would be unable to defeat even a single Dalek; let alone the four currently present. He then mockingly states that Cybermen are only superior in one respect; they are better at dying. One of the other Daleks then spots the Doctor on the screen, and the Daleks register him as an enemy but fail to recognise who he is exactly. The black Dalek recognises that Rose's heartbeat has increased, causing Mickey to say, \"Yeah, tell me about it!\" The Daleks demand to know who the man on the screen is. Rose tells them that it is the Doctor and the Daleks actually scoot back a few inches in fear, their earlier bravado vanishing. Rose notes this with clear amusement: \"Five million Cybermen, easy. One Doctor? Now you're scared.\"\n\nAfter a brief conversation with the Doctor about Rose's safety, Jackie is dragged away to be upgraded along with Yvonne Hartman. The Doctor promises he will save Jackie and get her out alive before she is taken away. The Cyber Leader comments that the Time Lord is proof of how emotions weaken humans. The Doctor agrees but then says that he quite likes hope, and in that instant, hope arrives in the form of a team with guns that destroy all Cybermen in the Breach Room. The leader of the team reveals himself to be Jake Simmonds.\n\nIn the area the Cybermen were hiding in, sparks and screams are coming from the Torchwood personnel as they are converted into Cybermen. Yvonne explains to Jackie that their brains are going to be placed in the Cybermen shells, angering Jackie who screams that Torchwood have doomed all of humankind. Yvonne is taken away, and she willingly walks into the upgrading stations to be upgraded. Shortly after, the Cybermen receive an update that the original Cyber-Leader has been killed and begin to download its files into another Cyberman unit. Jackie uses this distraction to slip away from the Cybermen and escape down a stairwell.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor tells Jake that they cannot just hop from one universe to another. Jake shows the Doctor the disc-shaped devices they developed with their world's version of Torchwood, and before the Doctor can stop him, Jake transports the two of them. Jake explains that they found out what the parallel Torchwood was doing and the People's Republic took control. As the Doctor asks Jake to take him back, Pete Tyler steps out of the shadows, telling the Doctor that this is their world and for once, he is going to listen.\n\nDalek Thay returns to the Sphere room, suggesting that they should concentrate on the Genesis Ark before attempting to battle the Cybermen. The black Dalek orders the other Daleks to begin the awakening and all four attach the ends of their manipulator arms to four spheres which are positioned on the Ark's four sides.\n\nPete and Jake explain that they tried sealing up the Cybermen in their factories, but a lot of debate surrounded this as there were arguments that they were still people and needed help. Meanwhile, the Cybermen infiltrated the parallel Torchwood, found the Doctor's universe and vanished; they realised their home world was too prepared to fight them off, but the Doctor's universe had less advanced weapons that could destroy them. Their sending their five million strong army all over at once is why it took them three years to cross while individuals could pop across in a second.\n\nMickey reveals to Rose that he has one of the dimension-jumping devices, but it can only transport him, saying the Daleks won't need him or Rose. Rose proceeds to wonder aloud why the Daleks would build something they couldn't open (having realised that the Daleks need a time-traveller's touch to open the Ark). The black Dalek, having overheard the conversation, declares that the Daleks did not build the Ark, stating it is of Time Lord design, claiming the Ark is the last remnant of Time Lord society (other than the Doctor and the TARDIS). When Rose asks what is inside, the Dalek only replies enigmatically, \"The future.\"\n\nPete shows off his world, where Great Britain is apparently enjoying a Golden Age, and where Harriet Jones is President. However, ambient temperatures are rising and the ice caps are melting. Pete correctly surmises that it has to do with the breach; the Doctor confirms that every time someone crosses over damage is done, and if it keeps up both worlds will fall into the Void. Pete believes the Doctor can close the breach, but when the Doctor says that doing so will leave the Cybermen and Daleks on his world, Pete replies that he is only interested in protecting his Earth. The Doctor points out there is a parallel Jackie who is still alive but Pete says that there are more important things at stake and asks the Doctor to help them. Revitalised by Pete's faith in him, the Doctor agrees to help.\n\nThe Doctor, Pete and Jake cross back. The Doctor calls up Jackie on her mobile phone, telling her to keep a low profile in the stairwell. The Doctor takes Jake's rifle and modifies it so it can affect polycarbide, the skin of a Dalek. He then surrenders a \"very good idea\" unto the Cybermen (using a piece of white A4 paper on a stick in place of a little white flag) and the two sides agree to work together.\n\nThe black Dalek demands that Rose activate the Ark, threatening Mickey's life. Rose steps forward to do so, but then decides to bring up how she met the Dalek Emperor. The black Dalek is astonished (as much as it can convey) to learn that the Emperor survived, but Rose gleefully recounts how she used the Time Vortex to turn him to dust. After she exclaims with delight at having destroyed the God of all Daleks, the furious Dalek is about to exterminate her for this when the Doctor appears in the doorway, which changes its priorities somewhat.\n\nThe black Dalek asks how the Doctor survived the Time War. The Doctor says that he did that by fighting on the front lines, whereas these Daleks fled. Rose tells the Doctor that these Daleks have names, a fact which the Daleks confirm by declaring each of their names respectively: Dalek Thay, Dalek Sec, Dalek Jast and Dalek Caan. The Doctor realises that these four Daleks are members of the Cult of Skaro, a secret order above even the Emperor. The Cult's purpose was to think as the enemy thinks, to find new ways of killing, including daring to take on individual identities. When Mickey asks the Doctor about the Genesis Ark, the Doctor replies that he doesn't know what it does; both sides had secrets.\n\nDalek Sec gloats that Time Lord science will ensure the supremacy of the Daleks, and orders the Doctor to open the Ark. The Doctor laughs off the suggestion and produces his sonic screwdriver. He explains that, while it cannot kill, wound or maim, it is very good for opening doors, a fact he demonstrates by using it to explosively open all the doors leading into the sphere chamber. The Cybermen enter and open fire on the Daleks using the modified energy rifles, temporarily disrupting Dalek Thay's shields and weapons and giving the Doctor and humans time to escape. However, the Daleks quickly adapt and regain control of their weapons and return fire without mercy, concentrating their attacks on the Cybermen. As the Doctor and the humans rush out of the chamber, Mickey is knocked into the Ark by a damaged Cyberman and his hand presses against its surface. After the Daleks easily exterminate the Cybermen, the Ark is primed, steam gushing from the bottom vents, but Dalek Sec says that it needs a space of thirty square miles to activate. The Daleks begin to escort it out of the chamber.\n\nThe Doctor and the humans retreat towards the stairwell. As they are running, Mickey apologises for his slip-up, but the Doctor tells him that he did them a favour because the Daleks would have otherwise tried to open the Ark by force and to do so they would have blown up the Sun.\n\nJackie is found by two more Cybermen who lurch forward to capture her for upgrading but are shot from behind by Pete, with the Doctor, Rose and Mickey following him. Jackie and Pete see each other for the first time and have an awkward exchange as their parallel counterparts are dead. Although Pete tries to rationalise that Jackie is not really his wife, the two end up running into each other's arms and embracing.\n\nThe Daleks and the Ark move into the Torchwood storage area, battling another force of Cybermen. Some human soldiers break in and add to the chaos. The Doctor stumbles into the area as well, grabbing two magna-clamps before leaving. As the Daleks blast their way through all opposition, the new Cyber-Leader calls for reinforcements, commanding all Cybermen to report to the tower. Dalek Sec overrides the roof mechanism, and elevates upward with the Ark. As the Doctor and the others watch, the Ark opens above London and starts spinning, disgorging Dalek after Dalek. The Doctor realises that the \"Time Lord science\" Dalek Sec referred to was the fact that the Ark is bigger inside than outside: the Ark is a prison ship, containing millions of Daleks. As hundreds of Daleks line up in aerial formation, an army of Cybermen marches through the street. The Cybermen deploy their wrist blasters and begin firing on the Daleks. The Daleks and Cybermen soon begin fighting on a global scale, with the human race caught in the crossfire.\n\nPete believes the situation to be hopeless, and prepares to escape back to his world while offering to take Jackie along with him. The Doctor, however, is more optimistic. Wearing his 3-D glasses, he explains that it allows him to see that everything that has crossed the Void between universes has picked up background radiation from it: \"Void stuff\". Since the Daleks and Cybermen have been hiding in the Void, they will be saturated in it and will be pulled back into the Void if he re-opens the rift, which will then collapse in on itself and seal the breach between worlds.\n\nRose, however, points out that they are covered in \"Void stuff\" too. The Doctor explains that he will open the breach here, but if Rose and the others go back to Pete's world, they will be safe. The Doctor will hang on to the magnetic clamps so he will not be pulled in. Rose realises that if the breach seals she will never be able to return and refuses to leave the Doctor despite the prospect of never seeing her mother again. While Rose and Jackie argue about who is leaving, the Doctor and Pete slip the devices around their necks and Pete transports them all across. However, Rose reactivates her device and returns, telling the Doctor she will never leave him. Pete stops Jackie from returning too, telling her that every time they cross the breach, it damages both worlds.\n\nRose sets all the coordinates on the Void controls to six on the Doctor's instructions. As the Cybermen climb the stairs intending to use the breach to retreat to and retake Pete's world, they are met by a Cyberman with a female-sounding voice, that of Yvonne Hartman. She declares that they shall not pass and shoots them with an energy rifle. As she repeats that she did her duty for Queen and country, a tear of oil leaks from the duct below her left eye.\n\nThe Doctor and Rose fix the magnetic clamps on the walls. When they open the breach, Dalek Sec senses the breach is active, deduces that the Doctor is behind it, and sends a squad of four Daleks to exterminate him. Rose and the Doctor pull the levers, activating the breach, holding on as tightly as possible to the clamps. Outside, the Daleks released from the Ark and even the Ark itself are drawn towards Torchwood Tower and are rapidly sucked into the breach. The Cybermen, still firing at the Daleks, are also pulled upward into the sky. However, Dalek Sec (along with the rest of the Cult) initiates an emergency temporal shift and escapes.\n\nThe power lever on Rose's side begins to shift to the off-line position, threatening to abort the process while there are still Daleks left. Unable to reach her lever while still holding on, Rose lets go of her clamp to do so. She pushes the lever back up and power is restored, but Rose is left clinging on as the Void tries to consume her. The Doctor yells at her to hold on.\n\nAs the last of the Daleks fall into the breach, Rose finally loses her grip, flying towards oblivion. The Doctor screams in anguish, but at the last moment, Rose is saved by Pete who materialises in front of the breach, grabs her and vanishes again. The breach ripples, and seals itself leaving Rose trapped in Pete's world. On the parallel world, Rose beats the wall, sobbing hysterically, as Pete notes that his device has stopped working. On both sides of the breach, the Doctor and Rose lean against the wall, resting their cheeks against it for a moment. The Doctor then walks away sadly, alone.\n\nSome time later, Rose has a dream where she hears the Doctor's voice calling her. Rose, Jackie, Pete and Mickey follow the voice to a deserted beach fifty miles outside Bergen, Norway, on the coastline of Dårlig Ulv Stranden, which roughly translated is Bad Wolf Bay. There, an image of the Doctor appears; he tells Rose that he found the last of the breaches, and is transmitting the signal by using the TARDIS to harness the power of a supernova, commenting that he is burning up a sun to say goodbye. Rose tells him that he looks like a ghost, and the Doctor increases the image of himself to maximum projection — making it look as if he is really standing there, but he regretfully tells Rose that he is still just an image, and that she cannot touch him. With only two minutes left, the two share their final farewell. Rose tells the Doctor that her mother is three months pregnant. At first, Rose jokes that she is now back working as a shop girl, but then reveals that she is with the parallel Torchwood, which has re-opened, as they could use her expertise with aliens. The Doctor smiles proudly and says, \"Rose Tyler: Defender of the Earth.\"\n\nThe Doctor tells Rose that she is officially dead back home; the battle may have lasted less than a day, but so many died that anyone missing is assumed dead, fulfilling the words of the Beast that Rose would die in battle. Rose tearfully asks the Doctor if she will ever see him again, and the Doctor replies regretfully, \"You can't.\" Breaking down, Rose asks what the Doctor will do, and he says he will go on, alone. Weeping, Rose tells the Doctor she loves him. As it is his last chance to do so, he begins to reply, \"Rose Tyler...\" but his image fades. Rose, still in tears, turns and runs back into Jackie's arms.\n\nIn the TARDIS, the Doctor stands for a minute, lips still parted, and a single tear rolls down each cheek. He takes a deep breath to regain his composure and regretfully starts to work the console again. Suddenly, he looks up to see a woman in a wedding dress standing in the console room. Dumbfounded, all the Doctor can repeat is, \"What?\", as the bride demands sharply that he tell her where she is and \"what the hell\" the place is...",
