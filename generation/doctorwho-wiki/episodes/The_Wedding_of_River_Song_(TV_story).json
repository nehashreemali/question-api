  "content": "The Wedding of River Song was the thirteenth and final episode of series 6 of Doctor Who.\n\nThe episode featured an unusually extreme alteration to the course of history resulting from a change to a fixed point in time. It also showed how the Doctor survived his supposed death and it concluded a long-running story-arc when the Doctor married River Song. However, a new arc arose in its place with a prophetic statement about the Doctor's future battles, which would become a pressing matter in due time. It's also the first time since the first half of Series 6 that Amy's pain of losing Melody on Demon's Run is mentioned, and she takes her anger out on Kovarian by killing her.\n\nThis episode was notable for featuring Simon Callow to briefly reprise his role of Charles Dickens, who was last seen six years prior to this episode in the Ninth Doctor story, TV: The Unquiet Dead. The Eleventh Doctor stories had up until then remained somewhat detached from the Russell T Davies-era, introducing a purely new entourage of human and humanoid characters to work with instead of bringing back the old ones. This cameo, as well as stories after this one, effectively broke the practice.\n\nEqually notable was the surprise appearance of American celebrity Meredith Vieira as herself in an announcement for The Today Show.\n\nFinally, this story formally retired a close ally of the Doctor who had made numerous appearances in Doctor Who's original 1963-1989 run: the Brigadier. His actor, Nicholas Courtney, had died of cancer the February of the same year, and his character was written out to pay respect to his passing. The character had made numerous recurring appearances from The Web of Fear in 1968 to Battlefield in 1989, and regularly starred in the series from 1970's Spearhead from Space to 1974's Robot, having made a guest appearance in The Sarah Jane Adventures story Enemy of the Bane in 2008 (three years before he passed away), which is also his last appearance on TV.\n\nThe death of Lethbridge-Stewart would be commonly referenced in future UNIT stories (which often included his daughter Kate) until Death in Heaven, when he returned as a Cyberman converted by Missy in a scene paying tribute to the late Courtney.\n\nSomething is wrong, in the fullest sense of the word. At first glance, the world seems fine, but upon closer inspection, dinosaurs, Romans, and other things throughout time have appeared. Oddly, nobody seems to be bothered by it, like it was part of everyday life.\n\nAnother oddity has occurred. Despite the sun rising and setting like normal, the time is always the same. Only the Doctor has the answer, and boy oh boy, it's gonna be a whopper!\n\nThe War of the Roses enters its second year as London picnickers are warned not to feed the pterodactyls and Charles Dickens is interviewed on television about his new Christmas ghost special. Holy Roman Emperor Winston Churchill returns to Buckingham Senate on his personal mammoth.\n\nChurchill complains about his conference with Cleopatra in Gaul, saying that she's an excellent dancer, but annoying. He asks his Silurian physician, Malohkeh, for the time; it's 5:02 PM on 22 April 2011. He finds this very troubling, despite being reminded it has always been the same date.\n\nHe orders that his soothsayer be dragged from the Tower. Upon the soothsayer's arrival, Churchill reminds him about his constant rambling about how something has happened to time. He asks to be told in simple terms what happened. Slowly, the soothsayer looks up, revealing himself as the Eleventh Doctor, who tells him why: \"A woman.\"\n\nIn a flashback, the Doctor walks up to a figure from the shadows in a dark, damaged room with a fire burning in a corner. Speaking at a fizzling monitor, he addresses it with cold tranquillity: \"Imagine you were dying. Imagine you were afraid and a long way from home and in terrible pain. Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, you looked up and saw the face of the devil himself... Hello, Dalek.\" It's revealed that a Supreme Dalek is damaged beyond repair; the Doctor takes it apart, scanning its memory banks for any information regarding the Silence.\n\nThe Doctor next arrives at a bar, asking the barman for a Father Gideon Vandaleur. The barman doesn't give a straight answer until the Doctor brandishes the eyestalk of the same Dalek he dismantled. Vandaleur meets with the Doctor as he reads Knitting for Girls, but the Doctor knows the envoy has been dead for 6 months. The Doctor zaps him with the sonic, revealing Gideon as the Teselecta in disguise. He stares into the eyes of the vehicle and asks to speak with the captain. The Doctor knows they've been spying on the Silence; he wants to find their weakest link.\n\nWith the Teselecta's information, the Doctor tracks down Gantok. He challenges Gantok to a game of live chess, an illegal game that has electricity run through the pieces that increases with each move. The Doctor corners Gantok, with the queen being his only legal move; however, the voltage is too much, even with the protective glove he wears. Gantok asks the Doctor to concede in exchange for a favour; though fearful of retribution from the Silence, Gantok agrees to take the Doctor to Dorium Maldovar, who can answer the Doctor's questions. Gantok brings the Doctor to the Seventh Transept, where the Headless Monks keep their heads. The richest have their heads preserved in boxes, which shocks the Doctor upon finding Dorium's, which sneezes. Gantok then tries to kill the Doctor in revenge for being beaten at chess; however, he falls into a trapdoor that drops him into a pile of ravenous skulls.\n\nThe screams awake Dorium, who jokes about his condition. The Doctor asks about the Silence, and why he got stuck being killed at Lake Silencio; the location was chosen as it was easier to create a fixed point to ensure that the Doctor died without fail. Dorium insists that if the Doctor lives, on the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the Eleventh, when no creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a question that must never be answered will be asked: the first question, hidden in plain sight. To Dorium's surprise, the Doctor doesn't know the question, despite its significance to him. He asks if his visitor wants to know the question. The Doctor agrees nervously.\n\nTaking Dorium's head with him, the Doctor determines to continue his farewell tour. However, when he learns his old friend the Brigadier is dead, his bravado crumbles. He accepts his time has come. He gives the Teselecta invitations to deliver since it would involve crossing his own timeline, which is a bad idea. He goes to Lake Silencio with Amy Pond, Rory Williams and River Song, where they drink a bottle of wine Napoleon threw at him. An impossible astronaut rises from the lake and he goes to meet it; as before, he orders his companions to stay back and not interfere no matter what they see. The astronaut's visor lifts to reveal River Song, trapped in the suit by the Silence. She has no control over the suit as it prepares to kill the Doctor. He explains she won't remember murdering him and will serve time for a crime she doesn't remember and committed against her will. He forgives her unconditionally, shutting his eyes as her arm rises to deliver the three deadly blows.\n\nThere are five bursts that make him flinch. The Doctor opens his eyes and demands to know what she has done. River smiles. She has discharged her weapons systems harmlessly, saying that fixed points can be rewritten. The Doctor demands to know who gave her such an idea as everything sudden fades away into white.\n\nThe Doctor and Churchill discuss these events; the Doctor compares to how time now being stuck due to River's mistake to a record skipping. They see they are holding weapons. Tally marks have appeared on the Doctor's arms. They look up. The ceiling is infested with dozens of Silents. Before they can attack, a grenade rolls into the hall and a troop of soldiers under the command of an eyepatched Amy Pond invade. She shoots the Doctor.\n\nThe Doctor awakens in Amy's office on a train; he tries reasoning with her, and make Amy remember the proper timeline. However, he stops once he sees that the walls of the office are lined with drawings of their adventures. Thanks to the crack in the universe which Amy grew up next to, she can remember alternate timelines; however, she doesn't recall that Captain Williams, a soldier in her force, is Rory. The train is bound for the Great Pyramid of Giza - Area 52. Amy wonders if things can stay like they are, but the Doctor tells her that this mess on Earth will spread to the rest of the cosmos until all of reality will fall apart.\n\nIn Area 52, the Doctor and Amy walk past more than 100 captured Silents; he is given an eyepatch, which is explained as an external memory storage system to remember the Silents. They arrive in the King's Chamber, where River awaits them. Kovarian is a prisoner, tied to a chair, annoyed at how the Doctor continues to live. \"Did my best, dear; I showed up. You just can't get good psychopaths these days.\" River taunts Kovarian, telling her it was a big mistake to kidnap and raise a girl into a perfect psychopath and introducing her to the Doctor; who else would River fall in love with?\n\nThe Doctor goes to take River's hand, but she knows they are opposite poles of an explosion waiting to destroy this timeline. She has him handcuffed and tries to convince him to live. The Silents, who have actually just been waiting, escape because it is their trap. As the soldiers retreat to the King's Chamber, their eye drives electrify and kill them. Kovarian mocks them by explaining that the Silents never allow a true advantage, but her gloating is cut short when her own eye drive sparks too, showing that the Silents are perfectly willing to sacrifice her too. Rory stays to hold off the Silents, while River, Amy and the Doctor go to the apex of the pyramid to see what River has built. The door flies open; Rory falls to his knees as the Silents enter and begin to electrocute him, but Amy, at last remembering who he is, returns to kill them with a machine gun.\n\nA weakened Kovarian begs Amy to help her, having gotten her eye drive partially off. But Amy burns with hate and rage, stating that Kovarian stole and hurt her baby and that even though her child is okay now, she will never see her baby again. Kovarian says that Amy will help her as she wouldn't want to disappoint the Doctor. Amy points out that while the Doctor means a lot to her, he's also not with them. Kovarian's face goes blank with terror as she realises, too late, that Amy intents to take revenge on her for all the suffering Kovarian and her followers have caused. Amy places the eye drive back on Kovarian, coldly stating \"River Song didn't get it all from you, sweetie.\" Amy and Rory then go to join the Doctor and River, leaving a screaming Kovarian to be electrocuted to death. Amy then suggests to a very happy Rory that they should get a drink when everything is over, and then married. Rory complacently agrees to both suggestions.\n\nAtop the Great Pyramid, River has built a beacon, signalling to the universe across all of time: The Doctor is dying. Please help. She goes on to explain that the sunspots that keep getting reported in the news are actually replies to her message. And every reply is, \"Yes, of course\". To the Doctor's own surprise, River explains that he's done so much to help others, they are more than willing to return the favour. The Doctor, however, insists that no one can help him. He must die to prevent all of time disintegrating.\n\nRiver despairs, claiming that she will suffer more than every living thing in the universe if she has to kill the Doctor. Seeing that there is only one way to pacify River, the Doctor tells Amy to uncuff him. He uses his bow tie to marry River in a rushed ceremony. He whispers a secret into his bride's ear and tells her she must never tell anyone what he has just told her. As she looks at him in wonder, the Doctor asks for her help.\n\nThey kiss and time moves again. River shoots the Doctor thrice, preventing his regeneration. He dies. The distorted timeline vanishes.\n\nSometime later, River, fresh from the crash of the Byzantium, arrives at her mother's home to split a bottle of wine. Amy wonders what the events in the aborted, frozen timeline say about her, particularly her murder of Kovarian. Although River tries to reassure her mother that the events in the alternate timeline do not apply, Amy believes that since she can still remember those events, Kovarian is still dead in the correct timeline, which means Amy is still guilty of murder. She needs to talk about her guilt with the Doctor, but he is dead. River disagrees. Amy notes that her daughter is still having adventures with him in the centuries before his death, but River tells her a secret which she probably shouldn't. As Rory joins his wife and daughter, they dance for joy until Amy realises to her horror she is the Doctor's mother-in-law.\n\nA monk carries Dorium's head back to the Seventh Transept. Dorium recognises the Doctor and asks how he escaped. Discarding his disguise, the Doctor explains that he asked for some help from the Teselecta crew; he had it disguise itself as him while he and the TARDIS were safely inside of it. Simply, he was at Lake Silencio but had someone else take his place.\n\nThe Doctor goes on to explain that he got too big, too noisy; now that the universe believes him to be dead, it's time to step back into the shadows. Dorium points out that River Song has been imprisoned for the rest of her days for a false murder; however, the Doctor says that her nights are between her and him. Dorium offers to help keep the Doctor's secrets but calls him a fool since the prophecy is still waiting for him.\n\nThe Doctor heads back to the TARDIS. Dorium calls after him with the question that must never be answered at the fields of Trenzalore, the question the Doctor has been running from his entire life: \"Doctor who?\"",
