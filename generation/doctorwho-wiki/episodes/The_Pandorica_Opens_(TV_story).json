  "content": "The Pandorica Opens was the twelfth and penultimate episode of series 5 of Doctor Who.\n\nIt was the first of a two-part series finale. Its narrative concluded in the following episode. River Song, Winston Churchill, Vincent van Gogh, Edwin Bracewell and Liz 10 all made a reappearance in this episode, as did the Autons, along with the stunning return of Rory Williams, after losing his life and every trace of his existence, save one link that provided the means for his resurrection. Dorium Maldovar makes his first appearance in this episode.\n\nAt the time of its release, it was unique amongst BBC Wales series finales as the first series-ender with significant principal photography outside Wales. It was also the first to have been the Doctor Who debut of its director and cinematographer. It was the first finale to have used major guest actors — aside from companions — who had featured in previous single episodes of the series. Finally, it featured the largest number of individual alien species seen in a single episode of Doctor Who ever.\n\nIn Doctor Who Confidential, Steven Moffat noted that the first time Russell T Davies was the head writer, he always made his season finales bigger and bigger than the previous year. Steven took this into consideration when writing the two part finale of Series 5, hoping it would continue the tradition.\n\nA Van Gogh painting ferried across thousands of years offering a terrifying prophecy, a message on the oldest cliff-face in the universe and a love that lasts a thousand years: in 102 AD England, Romans receive a surprise visit from Cleopatra. Nearby, Stonehenge hides a legendary prison-box. As it slowly unlocks from the inside, terrible forces gather in the heavens. The fates are closing around the TARDIS. The Pandorica, which contains the most dangerous threat in the Universe, is opening. Only one thing is certain: \"The Pandorica will open... Silence will fall\".\n\nIn France in 1890, Vincent Van Gogh, who has finished his sunflower painting and dedicated it to Amy, screams and sobs unceasingly. Doctor Gachet and Madame Vernet are at his bedside; Gachet tries to calm Vincent with Vernet complaining about how much worse Vincent's screaming is compared to his drinking as the whole neighbourhood can hear him. Gachet firmly tells Vernet that Vincent is ill before she notes the painting displayed on a nearby easel is worse than his usual work. Gachet stops attending to Vincent briefly to see the painting; both wonder what it can be.\n\nIn the Cabinet War Rooms in 1941, Professor Edwin Bracewell, now with a working replacement left hand carries a rolled-up canvas to Winston Churchill's office. Bracewell shows it to the Prime Minister, explaining it's a Van Gogh original found behind a wall in an attic in France. The painting is a message; Churchill doesn't understand it. However, Bracewell points out that he's not to understand it, but to deliver the message instead; they both know who needs to see it.\n\nAt the Stormcage Containment Facility in 5145, a guard answers the phone outside River Song's cell; he asks if the \"Doctor\" the caller is looking for is Dr Song. River tells the guard she's entitled to phone calls and receives the phone. Once she realises it's not the Doctor on the other end of the line, Churchill demands to know where the Doctor is. River explains that phoning the Time Vortex doesn't always work; however, the TARDIS rerouted the call to her. As the connection between their eras won't last long, River demands the message. She returns the phone to the guard and asks if this is his first day. When he says it is, she apologises and pulls him into a kiss, much to his shock.\n\nAlarms go off, with the guard pointing his gun in the cell as backup arrives; he states that she attempted to use her hallucinogenic lipstick on him, but it didn't work. The other guards give him a confused look as the first guard tells Dr Song that her trick won't work. It turns out that he's pointing his gun at a stick-figure drawing with River's signature curly hair. Next to it is a speech bubble simply saying \"Bye\".\n\nIn the Royal Collection that same year, River walks among the paintings in the gallery. She finds the one she is looking for, but trips an alarm on her way out and is held at gunpoint by Liz 10, who now has some grey hair due to being 450 years old. River asks Liz if she has met the Doctor, making the Queen smile while remembering her adventure with him. River explains to Liz that the Doctor is in trouble, making the Queen wonder why she is stealing a painting if it's true. River explains that the Doctor must see the painting; she has Liz look at the painting, which horrifies the Queen.\n\nRiver speaks to Dorium Maldovar at the Maldovarium. Dorium has heard rumours that she is seeking time travel; he offers her a vortex manipulator taken from the wrist of a Time Agent. Dorium informs her that it is not cheap, wondering if she's brought him another \"pretty toy\". River offers him a Callisto Pulse, which can deactivate micro-explosives from up to twenty feet away. Dorium wonders why he'd need it and learns that she has slipped some micro-explosives into his wine.\n\nIn the TARDIS, Amy is sitting on the swing below the console floor, examining the ring she earlier found in the Doctor's jacket. The Doctor pops his head down from above, shouting gibberish, and she quickly hides the ring. The Doctor tells her that he has just had the most brilliant idea; they're going to visit Planet One, the oldest planet in the universe, where a message has been carved into a diamond cliff face and has never been translated before. The TARDIS translation matrix will crack the inscription and reveal to them the oldest message in creation. When they step out to see it, the message reads, \"Hello, sweetie\" with a set of temporal coordinates carved beneath. The Doctor looks annoyed, while Amy smirks with a nod; both know River wants the Doctor's attention.\n\nThe coordinates lead them to Roman Britain in the 2nd century, where Amy notes that Roman history was her favourite topic at school. They are greeted by a Roman soldier with a lipstick smear across his mouth; he thinks the Doctor is Caesar. He takes them to meet \"Cleopatra\", who is actually River in disguise. He scolds River for her graffiti, only for her to retort that he doesn't answer his phone. She shows them Vincent's painting; they are shocked to see it's a painting of the TARDIS exploding. As the Doctor has already retrieved a TARDIS fragment from a Time Field in a Silurian city, this new find worries him. He asks if it has a title; River informs him it's \"The Pandorica Opens\", and that Vincent left coordinates in the painting to lead him there. Amy wonders what it is; River explains that the Pandorica is a prison designed to contain the most feared thing in all the universe. The Doctor then begins looking at maps, despite River's protest that it won't be on one; however, the Doctor says that if someone buried the most feared thing of all, they'd want to remember where.\n\nThe Doctor, Amy and River ride to Stonehenge to find the Pandorica. Amy explains to River that she warned them about this after climbing out of Byzantium; River says that she hasn't, but will. Amy, still not really understanding that this is an earlier version of River, is silenced by the Doctor to avoid giving away spoilers. River's scanner gives a reading that shows energy weapons have been fired in this spot, implying that the Pandorica is there. The Doctor quickly deduces that they need to get underground.\n\nBy nightfall, River has placed devices that move a stone on the ground away from a secret entrance. The three of them descend, not noticing a Cyber-head, which begins to reactivate.\n\nThey discover the Pandorica, much to the Doctor's disbelief, as he thought it was simply a fairy tale. He goes on to reexplain that the most feared being in all creation, a trickster soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies, who could not be reasoned with, was locked in the Pandorica. Amy wonders how; the Doctor says that like most fairy tales, a good wizard tricked it. River expresses her hatred for good wizards in fairy tales as she feels they always turn out to be the Doctor. Amy notes that the name is similar to Pandora's box, her favourite childhood story, and the Doctor quickly notes the link between the Pandorica and the Romans... both of them have been claimed by Amy to be her favourites. He tells her that one should never ignore a coincidence, \"unless you're busy; in which case, always ignore a coincidence\".\n\nScanning the Pandorica and the surrounding area, River finds its security failsafes are turning on and the box is opening. Amy then wonders how Vincent could know about it, prompting the Doctor to scan the pillars of the room; the pillars are acting like big transmitters, sending a warning across time and space that the Pandorica is opening. Poor Vincent heard the message in his dreams. River then makes the Doctor realise that anyone who can hear the message might be showing up; they quickly reverse the signal to scan for any time-active species, learning, much to their horror, that there are at least ten thousand ships in Earth's orbit. Every one belongs to the Doctor's enemies: Cybermen, Daleks, Sontarans, Slitheen, Draconians, Chelonians and many more.\n\nThey return topside, where they see several ships entering Earth's atmosphere.\nRiver warns the Doctor that \"everything that ever hated you is coming here tonight,\" asking him to run for once. The Doctor asks where he can run, making River wonder how he can fight. The Doctor simply tells his worrying companions, \"the best fighting machine in the history of the universe — the Romans!\"\n\nThe Doctor sends River back to camp to appeal to the Roman commander for help. However, the commander has realised that she is not actually Cleopatra, who is dead in Egypt, and refuses. River calls the Romans \"barbarians\" compared to what is coming this night, firing her energy weapon, disintegrating a cabinet to demonstrate her power. Before the commander can grasp the implications, a centurion arrives to volunteer.\n\nBack at Stonehenge, the Doctor monitors the Pandorica and uses its force field technology to buy them half an hour. Amy wonders what the Pandorica has to do with the TARDIS exploding, but the Doctor tells her that they have to focus on one problem at a time. Amy then asks about the engagement ring she found in his jacket pocket. The Doctor explains that it belongs to a friend of his and that it's a memory of that friend; he says sometimes people fall out of the universe, but leave traces behind that can bring them back. Not getting what the Doctor is encouraging her to try to remember, Amy asks if his friend was nice. He then asks her if she remembers the night she flew away with him. He admits he was lying when he told her there wasn't a reason he was taking her. He draws her attention to her house; it's too big with too many empty rooms. Before she can respond, a laser fires.\n\nThey hide behind the Pandorica. The Doctor tells Amy that he usually has great plans, but not this time; he needs to draw its fire to find out what's shooting at them. \"Look at me! I'm a target!\" he yells as he briefly jumps into the open and hides again. The Doctor tells Amy that it's the arm of a Cyberman firing. Due to the cracks, Amy asks what a Cyberman is, and the Doctor explains that its is a cyborg, except it's like being a screaming organ donor. He tells Amy to distract it so he can disable it. The plan succeeds, with the Doctor grabbing the arm and scrambling its circuits with the sonic screwdriver. However, he warns her to stay back as the arm could be bluffing. Amy scoffs at the idea but complies.\n\nAmy leans on the Pandorica, but she is grabbed by the wires coming out of the Cyber-head, which has worked its way down the steps. The arm then shocks the Doctor unconscious. The head grabs Amy's arms with its wires and opens, ejecting the skull of its last occupant. Amy smashes the Cyber-head against the Pandorica until the wires come off her arms. As Amy watches the head flail around, it shoots a dart into her neck, which she promptly removes. The head tells Amy that she will be assimilated, prompting her to ask \"You and whose body?\" At that moment, the Cyber-body arrives and reattaches its head. It advances on an increasingly drowsy Amy.\n\nShe takes cover in a side chamber, where she hears it banging on the doors in its attempt to get in. However, when things grow silent, she wonders if the Doctor has woken up and stopped it. Suddenly a blade comes through the door, barely missing her head, and the doors open to reveal the Cyberman stuck to the door with a Roman sword. Seeing the centurion who offered River his help on the other side, Amy asks who it is. The centurion steps into the light and removes his helmet to reveal Rory Williams. Amy finally succumbs to the dart's effects and faints.\n\nThe Doctor wakes and enters the side chamber to find Amy alright. He initially doesn't register Rory's reappearance, as he's trying to puzzle out the latest attack. He notices that the room is a sentry box with Cyberman weaponry, and the \"headless wonder\" was a sentry that the Cybermen left behind that got damaged by the locals. However, the Doctor is only left further confused; is it a Cyberthing in the box? He then thinks better of the idea, knowing the Cybermen won't lock up one of their own. He tells Rory that he is missing something standing right in front of him. As he still hasn't really noticed him, Rory emphatically agrees; the Doctor says he'll figure it out in a minute. He leaves the room, only to return a moment later to prod Rory in the chest in disbelief. They have an awkward conversation. Rory knows he died near the Silurian city, but can't account for how he ended up in 102 A.D.\n\nThe conversation is interrupted by the sound of spaceships descending. The Doctor leads the way outside, seeing several different ships flying around. He stands on a rock and addresses his enemies over a communicator, telling them to stay in place as he's talking; all the ships hover silently, knowing what incurring the rage of the Doctor will do. The Doctor informs them that he has possession of the Pandorica and that it's opening. Though they have plenty of weapons, he has nothing to lose. He reminds them of all the times he has defeated them in the past and encourages them to \"do the smart thing\" and \"let someone else try first\". With that, the fleet promptly flees. The Doctor says he's bought an additional half hour; all the aliens will be bickering over which of them should be cannon fodder.\n\nRory and the Doctor return to the Pandorica and try to make sense of what has happened; Rory explains his time with Amy and the Doctor felt like a dream he woke from when he found himself a Roman in this era. Amy then wakes but fails to recognise Rory, devastating him. He is told by the Doctor that the crack should have erased him from completely, though he's still here; Amy's memory of her time with the original version was wiped. The Doctor admits he can't explain Rory's appearance, supposing it to be something like a miracle, which he hasn't seen in all his years. He gives Rory the engagement ring and encourages him to go after Amy.\n\nHaving seen the Doctor scare off his enemies, River calls him, wondering what he plans to do next. He tells her that he needs some equipment, so he needs the TARDIS. River complies and heads to the TARDIS. Once inside, River notices that the engine take-off noise is not quite right, making her wonder what's wrong with it. The TARDIS is thrown through the vortex and materialises outside Amy's house on 26 June 2010, the date of the explosion that caused the cracks in time and space. As she leaves the TARDIS to explore, a crack splits the scanner screen and a voice cries, \"Silence will fall!\"\n\nRiver notes landing patterns of alien crafts in Amy's front yard and enters the house, which has had the door broken off. In Amy's room, she finds a book on Roman Britain and a copy of The Legend of Pandora's Box. There is also a photograph of Rory and Amy, where Rory is dressed as a centurion. All of the pictures from the books resemble things and people back in the second century, thus explaining why there's another Rory; whoever copied the people in the book mistook him for one of the characters due to his costume in the picture. She rushes to the TARDIS and, once there, contacts the Doctor to warn him.\n\nThe Doctor has become impatient with River and demands to know where she is. River explains her discovery and is confused as to how they can be fake as her lipstick works on them. The Doctor comes to the conclusion that these projections or duplicates may believe that they're real — the perfect disguise. However, when River tells him the date, the Doctor tells her about the cracks and to go to any other date to prevent them from occurring. When this doesn't work, he tells her to land and leave the TARDIS as the engines will shut down automatically when there is no-one inside. Though she manages to land, the doors are locked.\n\nA piercing, shrill noise comes from the Pandorica and the Romans begin falling asleep on their feet. Even Rory, who is talking to Amy, has to resist shutting down; Amy only pays attention to Rory, who is in noticeable pain. The Romans wake and advance on the Doctor. They are Autons controlled by the Nestene Consciousness. They seize the Doctor, declaring that the Pandorica is ready. Much to the Doctor's shock, he sees Daleks, Cybermen, Sycorax, Judoon, Silurians, Sontarans, Roboforms, Hoix, Zygons, Terileptils, Slitheen, and many other past foes materialise in the room. The Supreme Dalek says that the Pandorica is ready for him; inside the box is a chair covered in restraints.\n\nAbove, the Auton Rory continues to fight against the Nestene's command to drop his personality and join the other mindless drones. Repeatedly yelling that he is Rory, he manages to finally jog Amy's memory. She asks him if he remembers the ring he never let her wear in case she lost it; he shows her the ring. As Rory continues crying, Amy hugs him, saying she won't lose him again. However, Rory's Auton body betrays him as his hand opens to reveal the gun inside; he shoots Amy in the stomach. Amy hugs Rory as she dies; Rory is left to grieve while fighting for control of himself.\n\nBack below, the Autons drag the Doctor to the prison and clamp him into the chair inside. The Doctor is aghast that all of these races have managed to form an alliance and asks how that is possible. They explain that it is an alliance against him, as he will cause the end of the universe. They know that the TARDIS will be at the centre of the explosion that ends the universe and, as they wrongly believe he is the only one who can fly the TARDIS, they will imprison him in the Pandorica to stop the explosion. To lure him to this spot, they built the perfect trap, using Amy's memories as a basis.\n\nThe Doctor shouts his innocence, that the threat to the universe is the TARDIS, not him, and that he can stop the explosion. The alliance refuses to listen to their hated enemy, and the Cyber-Leader orders the Pandorica closed over his desperate pleas.\n\nSomewhere in time, River improvises a way to open the TARDIS doors by using a controlled explosion. However, upon opening the doors, River finds a stone wall blocking her departure. \"I'm sorry my love,\" River says, turning to the console. It sparks and eruption begins.\n\nExplosions occur in the space around Earth, signifying that the stars have gone supernova and that the cracks have finally begun eating the universe entirely. When the explosions cease, Earth is left alone in the middle of a spreading, black void.",
