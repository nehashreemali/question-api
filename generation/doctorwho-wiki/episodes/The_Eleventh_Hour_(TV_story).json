  "content": "The Eleventh Hour was the first episode of series five of Doctor Who. It was written by Steven Moffat in his first story as showrunner and was directed by Adam Smith.\n\nThe Eleventh Hour was the first full story to feature Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor, and introduced Karen Gillan as the new companion Amy Pond and Arthur Darvill as recurring character and future companion Rory Williams.\n\nIt further debuted the presence of cracks in the universe, and sparked the beginning of a critical plot thread that trailed deep into the Eleventh Doctor's tenure with three words: \"silence will fall\". This was compounded by the mention of a Pandorica which was fated to open.\n\nThough not the first episode of the 2010 series filmed, it was the public's first full exposure to a new production ethos, as shaped by new executive producers Moffat, Piers Wenger and Beth Willis. It was also the public's first exposure to director Adam Smith's work on a Doctor Who universe programme. A new title sequence by Framestore debuted with this episode, along with yet another Murray Gold theme arrangement. The theme change, however, garnered significant public backlash in the United Kingdom, forcing the Doctor Who production team to respond to criticism in a long segment on the public comment programme, Points of View.\n\nThe episode was extensively previewed before broadcast, with theatrical screenings in several British cities as part of a promotional tour at the end of March 2010, and on the east and west coasts of the United States. The first minute of the episode was released as a special preview on the digital Red Button service a week before its first BBC One broadcast.[1][2]\n\nAfter a literally explosive regeneration, the brand new Eleventh Doctor survives a crash-landing to Earth. However, he has little time to recover. With a mysterious crack in a little girl's wall and a missing alien prisoner, the Doctor is in for an adventure. However, with the TARDIS damaged and the sonic screwdriver destroyed, can the Doctor capture the rogue alien before its jailers burn Earth to a crisp?\n\nSuffering major damage after the Tenth Doctor's regeneration in the previous adventure, the TARDIS flies wildly over London as it enters the atmosphere. An explosion on the console inside causes the doors to unlock and the Eleventh Doctor (still dressed in the ragged and torn remains of his predecessor's clothes) to fall out, barely hanging onto the edge of the entrance. He tries to pull himself up as the TARDIS momentarily stabilises, though it is still heading downwards. Getting halfway in, he notices the TARDIS is heading straight for Big Ben; using the sonic screwdriver, he diverts the TARDIS just enough to miss the clock tower's spire. Pulling himself back in and locking the doors behind him, the Doctor sighs in relief. However, another explosion throws him as the TARDIS spins madly off into the distance.\n\nIn 1996, Amelia Pond prays to Santa Claus in her bedroom; a crack in her wall frightens her, and she wants him to send someone to mend it. Suddenly, a crash outside catches her attention, and running to look, she sees the TARDIS lying sideways in her back garden, having crushed her shed on landing. She thanks Santa, and goes to investigate. The TARDIS doors swing open, and a grappling hook flies out, hooking onto a wheelbarrow. A soaking-wet Doctor struggles to pull himself out; he looks at the puzzled Amelia and gives her a reassuring smile, though it comes more off as goofy. He asks for an apple as they're the only thing he can think of; his regeneration is giving him a craving, which he's never had before. As he starts climbing out, he has a look down into the TARDIS, explaining that he'd had to climb up from the library. When Amelia points out that he's soaking wet, the Doctor explains that the swimming pool is also in the library right now. The Doctor has a momentary spasm, causing him to fall to the ground before breathing out a stream of golden energy. She asks him who he is, but the Doctor doesn't know yet himself; he's \"still cooking\". Amelia tells him about the crack, and the Doctor introduces himself, informing her to do what he says and not wander off; he promptly walks into a tree and knocks himself down — \"Early days. Steering's a bit off\".\n\nInside, the Doctor tries eating an apple but spits out the bite he took, saying it tastes terrible. He then requests yoghurt, but spits it out as well. Amelia is confused, as the Doctor had said it was his favourite. The Doctor explains, \"New mouth, new rules\". More food follows: bacon, baked beans, bread and butter all being asked for, prepared, tried and thrown out. Searching Amelia's fridge, the Doctor rejects carrots before he finds just what he needs: fish fingers and custard.\n\nWhile the Doctor tries out his new delicacy, Amelia eats ice cream from the tub. The duo bonds. During their conversation, the Doctor discovers the child's name is Amelia Pond — a great name, according to the Doctor, \"like a name in a fairy tale\". He asks, based on her accent, if they're in Scotland. Amelia tells him that they're actually in England, where they had to move to and she doesn't like. When the Doctor notes that he'd have thought Amelia's parents would have been woken up by now, she tells him that she doesn't have a mum or dad but lives with her Aunt Sharon. Upon learning that her aunt is out, the Doctor notes that because Amelia is neither afraid of him nor his strange arrival in her garden, it must be one hell of a scary crack in her wall.\n\nAmelia takes the Doctor up to her room to examine the crack in the wall. She also offers him an apple with a smiley face carved into it, as her mother used to make for her to help her like them. He thanks her and pockets the apple, \"for later\". The Doctor examines the crack, telling Amelia that even if the wall was removed, the crack would still be there; the crack exists in that space, not the wall, describing it as \"two parts of space and time that should never have touched\". Upon inspecting the crack more closely, the Doctor is astonished to hear a voice on the other side of the crack transmitting the message, \"Prisoner Zero has escaped.\"\n\nAscertaining that an alien prison lies on the other side of the crack, he opens it fully with the sonic screwdriver and is faced with the alien guard — which appears to be a giant eyeball — who sends him a message on the psychic paper before the crack finally shuts. The message reads the same thing: \"Prisoner Zero has escaped.\" The Doctor, realising the prisoner has escaped through Amelia's bedroom, rushes out into the corridor to investigate and deduces that he's missing something out of the corner of his eye. Before he can discover it, though, the Cloister Bell chimes.\n\nHe rushes outside with Amelia, telling her that the TARDIS' engines are in danger of phasing out of existence. Amelia wonders how a box can have engines, and the Doctor tells her his TARDIS is a time machine. She asks to come with him, but the Doctor says it's too dangerous now, and he'll do so after taking a quick five-minute trip into the future to begin repairs. Yelling \"Geronimo!\", the Doctor jumps back into the TARDIS and it dematerialises before Amelia. Excited, the little girl returns to her bedroom to collect her things, not noticing that the door at the end of the corridor — the thing the Doctor was missing — has opened...\n\nThe TARDIS returns in the daylight, with the materialisation giving off a great deal of smoke; the wheezing sound it gives off is even worse than normal, due to the damage. The Doctor exits in a hurry, yelling to Amelia that he's figured out what he was missing; however, Amelia is no longer outside waiting.\n\nThe Doctor runs up to the door, finding it locked; he gets the barely-functioning sonic to open the door. Rushing upstairs to the door he now knows exists, the Doctor yells Prisoner Zero is there with them. Trying to get the sonic working to open the door, the Doctor is unknowingly watched by someone from Amelia's room. Hearing someone approach, the Doctor asks if it's Amelia. However, he is instead greeted by a cricket bat to the face.\n\nElsewhere, at the town hospital, nurse Rory Williams informs his supervisor, Dr Ramsden, that coma patients have been calling for her. She dismisses this, drawling that they are comatose. As she berates him, the patients repeatedly cry out \"Doctor\" much to her shock and horror.\n\nBack at Amelia's home, the Doctor awakes to see he is handcuffed to a radiator; he is confronted by a young woman in a police uniform, who informs him that he'd better stay still as she just called for backup. The Doctor recalls being hit by a cricket bat, to which the police woman states he was breaking and entering. He then inquires to Amelia's whereabouts, wishing to apologise to her for being late coming back. The police woman informs him that Amelia's been missing for six months and that she lives there now; she radios her sergeant, telling him that she has detained a white male breaking and entering, and he might have information on Amelia Pond.\n\nAt the hospital, Rory and Ramsden examine the patients carefully, but they still appear to be in comas. Rory attempts to inform his supervisor of other suspicious circumstances pertaining to the coma patients, even proffering his phone with the suggestion that the pictures on it can prove his theory. She impatiently orders him to take some time off.\n\nBack in Amelia's house, the Doctor orders the policewoman to count the rooms on the floor; she counts five, but the Doctor quickly informs her that there are, in fact, six — one is hidden by a perception filter. He tells her to look out the corner of her eye. The police woman oddly mutters that she's lived there her whole life and never noticed the door; the Doctor asks to be uncuffed, only to be told that she lost the key. She approaches the door, despite his protests; she enters the room. \"Do I have one of those faces people ignore... again?\" the Doctor wonders.\n\nThe Doctor checks his pockets for the sonic screwdriver, finding it's not with him. He yells for her to check and see if it's in there; it could've rolled under the door when she hit him. The sonic is there, but is stuck in a puddle of goo on the table. She yells to him that it \"must have jumped on the table\", making the Doctor order her to leave at once. The woman picks up the sonic, but senses something is in the room with her. The Doctor orders her not to try looking at it as it will kill her if she sees it. Despite the warning, the police woman manages to trick Prisoner Zero into revealing himself, seeing it's a serpentine alien multi-form.\n\nThe police woman runs back to the Doctor, closing the door behind her. The Doctor locks the door with the screwdriver and tries to free himself, but the thing is damaged from the goo. She asks if the door will hold Prisoner Zero, making the Doctor sarcastically retort, \"It's an alien multi-form from outer space; they're all terrified of wood!\" Seeing a light coming from under the door, she asks what it's doing. The Doctor doesn't know, but tells her to run and radio for backup. However, the woman reveals herself to be a kissogram, whipping off her police hat to reveal long, red hair. Prisoner Zero breaks through the door, emerging as a man with a dog; both mouths bark, much to the Doctor's amusement as it's having trouble figuring out which mouths are supposed to make the correct sounds. He then wonders where he would have gotten the pattern from as it would need to form a psychic link with someone, which takes months.\n\nThe Doctor informs Prisoner Zero that the young woman called for backup on her police radio, but she reminds him that she can't; the Doctor explains in annoyance it was a clever lie to save them. He then tries dissuading Prisoner Zero from violence as they pose no threat without backup. The prison guard is then heard broadcasting a message that Prisoner Zero has been found and will vacate the human residence. The Doctor decides to try one more time, telling Prisoner Zero that he and the woman are safe due to the jailers coming for it. However, the prison guard is heard transmitting over and over: \"Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence, or the human residence will be incinerated.\"\n\nThe Doctor finally succeeds in freeing himself, and they run away while Prisoner Zero is looking around for the source of the broadcast. He tries opening the TARDIS for equipment, only to find the doors have sealed as it's still repairing itself. Suddenly, the Doctor notices the shed in the backyard, remembering he wrecked it when he previously crash-landed in the backyard. Licking it, he learns the \"new\" shed is 12 years old. He turns to the woman, demanding to know why she told him six months when it's been twelve years; she angrily demands to know, \"Why did you say five minutes?!\" in a Scottish accent. The Doctor can only ask, \"What?\" with increasing shock; the woman is an adult Amelia Pond! Grabbing his arm, she pulls him out of the yard and towards town.\n\nIn town, the Doctor inquires why Amelia hit him with a cricket bat; she defends her action by explaining that their meeting led her to see four psychiatrists over the last 12 years. She bit them all when they told her he wasn't real. Their argument is cut short when they suddenly realise that the Atraxi message is broadcasting over all of the town's electronics, including mobile phones, iPods, even the speaker of an ice cream van. The Doctor sees the Atraxi are not focused on simply Amelia's house as the \"human residence\", and immediately runs to the first house he sees with Amelia following.\n\nThe house belongs to Amelia's friend Jeff Angelo and his grandmother. The Doctor uses the psychic paper to pass himself off as a television repair man. Mrs Angelo thinks she's met the Doctor before, but the Doctor tells her it's not likely, seeing as he's got a new face on. The Doctor then examines the TV and radio stations around the world with help from his sonic screwdriver, and realises, to his horror, that the warning is being broadcast all over the world in every language. The human residence is not just Amelia's town, but the entire planet! The Doctor deduces that the Atraxi will need twenty minutes, prompting Amelia to ask what for. The Doctor says, \"The end of the world\". While the Doctor begins thinking of a plan, everyone else watches the Atraxi message replay on the television in disbelief.\n\nAbove the Earth, the squad of Atraxi ships continue transmitting the message around the world as they search the planet for Prisoner Zero; incinerating Earth to be rid of the menace is a last resort. However, it would seem they will never be able to find it on their own as they keep re-sending the message.\n\nBack on Earth, Jeff and his grandmother realise how they know the Doctor: he's the \"Raggedy Doctor\" (named so because of the tattered clothes he was and is wearing) that Amy used to draw cartoons of as a child. The Doctor is disappointed that, not only does she kiss people for a living, but she also dropped the name Amelia for Amy, citing its fairy tale quality — which the Doctor complimented on their last meeting — as its worst point.\n\nThe Doctor and Amy head to the town square, and the Doctor is annoyed to discover that Leadworth, where Amelia lives, has no technology to help him. In the middle of remarking about a duck pond without ducks, the Doctor suddenly convulses and falls to the ground, protesting that it is \"too early\" and he's \"not ready yet\". Suddenly, though, everything goes dark. The Atraxi have surrounded Earth in a force field to prepare the planet for boiling. Across the park, the Doctor notices Rory taking pictures of a man with a dog — whom the Doctor knows as Prisoner Zero — as opposed to the obscured sun, like everyone else.\n\nThe Doctor gleefully announces he can save the world and offers Amy a choice: she can run home and say goodbye to her loved ones, or help him. Amy opts for a different option entirely: she slams the Doctor up against a nearby car, and locks his tie in the door, trapping him. She demands to know who he is, to which he tells her that she already knows. However, Amy doesn't believe him now since she grew up; disheartened, the Doctor says she should never do that. The Doctor tosses her the carved apple, explaining that he's a time traveller, and everything he told her twelve years ago is true. Amy can tell the apple is the exact same one, proving the Doctor is telling the truth. She releases the Doctor's tie, asking what they have to do; the Doctor tells her \"stop that nurse.\" They run across the park to confront Rory.\n\nAmy introduces Rory as her \"sort of\" boyfriend, but the Doctor is not interested. He takes Rory's mobile phone and demands to know why he was taking a picture of the man and dog rather than the sun. However, Rory is stunned to see the Doctor is real; Amy forced him to dress up as the Doctor when they were little. Annoyed, the Doctor grabs Rory by the collar, demanding \"Man. Dog. Why? Tell me. Now.\" He then gets an expected response: Rory tells him that the man can't be in the park because he's in a hospital in a coma. As the Doctor explains, a coma patient fulfils a multi-form's requirement for a living, but dormant, mind to form a psychic link with. The Doctor confronts Prisoner Zero as an Atraxi spaceship flies close to the surface of the planet; Rory is shocked to learn Prisoner Zero is real as well.\n\nThe Doctor reveals, \"They're scanning for non-terrestrial technology, and nothing says non-terrestrial like the sonic screwdriver!\" He then begins using the sonic to overload technology all around him; lamps break, car alarms sound, an old woman's mobility scooter goes flying by, a fire engine drives off without occupants, and a telephone box blows up. \"I think someone's going to notice, don't you?\" However, the sonic is damaged and the strain of the task causes it to burn out completely. With a smirk, Prisoner Zero dissolves into a sewer as the Atraxi depart, making the Doctor rage at the incompetence of these alien jailers.\n\nAmy wonders about Prisoner Zero living in her house for 12 years; the Doctor explains that \"multi-forms can live for millennia, twelve years is a pit-stop\". Amy wonders why the Atraxi showed up on the same day as the Doctor did. He explains that they saw him through the crack and got a fix on him; they're only late to search for Prisoner Zero because he went 12 years into the future. The Doctor is left to ponder how he can draw Prisoner Zero into the open; he then has an idea, asking the name of her good looking friend - Jeff. Rory is feeling a little insulted. He instructs Amy and Rory to clear out the coma ward at the hospital; Prisoner Zero will likely try to ensure his psychic links are not disrupted by killing the doctors tending to the patients. While Rory is still having trouble believing that the Doctor exists, Amy forces him to comply.\n\nMeanwhile, at the hospital, Dr Ramsden is checking on a convulsing coma patient, wondering if he is aware. Prisoner Zero materialises through the vent above and bares its fangs, preparing to strike...\n\nThe Doctor returns to Jeff's home, and uses his laptop to break in on a conference call between some of the most advanced scientific minds in the world; he proves his intellect by producing multiple scientific theories and a joke. He uses Rory's phone to write a \"slightly intelligent\" virus that will turn every digital display in the world to \"zero\" at the same time; in other words, it's more of an inconvenience than a threat. He uploads this virus to the web via the laptop and encourages them to spread it across the world using every web program possible. He also gives Patrick Moore's number to Mrs Angelo, and advises Jeff to erase his internet history as he has apparently been visiting some sites of questionable taste.\n\nThe Doctor commandeers a fire engine to the hospital, communicating with Amy who's stuck outside the coma ward due to Prisoner Zero's attack and instructing her to use her police woman uniform to get past hospital security. Amy and Rory find the coma ward a mess, but oddly no corpses. They come across a mother and her two daughters, who claim to have survived Prisoner Zero's attack on the ward by hiding in the bathroom. Amy tells the Doctor that Prisoner Zero has beaten them back; he encourages them to get out of the hospital. However, one of the daughters is now talking in her mother's voice — it's Prisoner Zero again.\n\nAdmitting that it has trouble with figuring out which voice to use with multiple mouths and baring razor-sharp teeth, the alien chases Amy and Rory back into the coma ward. They use a broom to bar the handles, but Prisoner Zero manages to break in after some effort. Prisoner Zero taunts Amy, telling her that it watched her grow up; it then adds that the Doctor will not be here this time to save her.\n\nAmy receives a text saying \"Duck!\"; she forces Rory down to the floor with her. At that moment the fire truck's ladder rams through the window; the Doctor climbs in, glad to have a few minutes left before the Ataxi burn them. He asks Prisoner Zero to remove its disguise. Prisoner Zero refuses, knowing the Atraxi would kill it this time anyway, and wants the entire Earth to die in flames with it. The Doctor then suggests it leave the same way it came by creating a crack, however, Prisoner Zero explains it didn't create the crack; the cracks exist in the skin of the universe, and Prisoner Zero is amused the Doctor doesn't know where they come from. It warns him that \"the Pandorica will open, silence will fall\".\n\nThe Doctor decides to set this aside and instead enjoys a victory speech as the virus takes hold of the clock on the wall and changes the counter to zero; this occurs all across the world as a means of getting the Atraxi's attention. The Atraxi trace the virus back to Rory's phone, which holds pictures of all of Prisoner Zero's known human forms, thanks to Rory. The Doctor immediately uploads the photos to the Atraxi, gloating that he did all of this without the help of his TARDIS and sonic screwdriver, and with only two minutes to spare before certain doom— \"Who da man?\" The Doctor's self-congratulatory slang gets a series of blank stares and the flustered Doctor mumbles, \"Oh, it's, I'm never saying that again, fine!\"\n\nPrisoner Zero tells the Doctor it will have to just take a new form. Amused, the Doctor tells it that he knows it's a bluff as that kind of link takes months to make; however, Prisoner Zero adds that it's had years to make the link. Prisoner Zero starts glowing and Amy falls unconscious; it formed a backup link with Amy just in case its main disguises were ever found out. The Doctor and Rory tend to Amy before turning to find Prisoner Zero has turned into a copy of the Doctor; \"Well that's rubbish. Who's that?\" the Doctor asks. Rory tells the Doctor that's what he looks like, being confused as to why he doesn't know; the Doctor retorts \"busy day.\"\n\nThe Doctor then asks Prisoner Zero why it's taken his form when the psychic link is with Amy; a little girl's voice tells the Doctor that it's not taking his form. A young Amelia comes out from behind the faux Doctor, holding his hand; it's mimicking both of them. Prisoner Zero laughs that Amy is still little Amelia inside, waiting for her magic Doctor to return; it adds that he's been such a disappointment to her. The Doctor realises that Amy is dreaming about him because she can hear him, and her dream is enabling Prisoner Zero to take on his form. The Doctor uses his powers of telepathy to encourage Amy to instead dream of Prisoner Zero.\n\nPrisoner Zero yells in protest and fear but begins changing form once again. Smirking, the Doctor congratulates the rogue on perfectly imitating its true form. Prisoner Zero hisses in anger, as the Atraxi's searchlight finds it. Writhing, the serpent is frozen by the light. As it slowly fades away, Prisoner Zero hisses its warning again \"Silence, Doctor. Silence will fall.\"\n\nThe Atraxi leave, and Amy awakens. Rory wonders if the threat is over, and everything is back to normal; the Doctor pats him on the head. Seeing the Doctor still using his phone, Rory wonders what he's up to; the Doctor is tracing the call back. He apologises in advance for the phone bill, getting the Atraxi back on the line. He tells them that they were not given permission to leave and that their willingness to burn a Level 5 planet to get rid of a single criminal is a violation of Article 57 of the Shadow Proclamation. The Doctor demands they return to the hospital; tossing Rory back his phone, the Doctor says NOW he's done it.\n\nThe Doctor walks out of the coma ward, telling Amy that he's heading to the roof; however, he changes his mind, heading into a hospital locker room. He explains that because he's saving the world, he needs a decent shirt - \"To hell with the raggedy; time to put on a show!\" Despite Rory's protests, the Doctor discards the remains of his predecessor's outfit and begins trying on the clothes in the lockers. The Doctor tells them to turn their backs if they're embarrassed; Rory does so, but Amy watches the Doctor get dressed.\n\nThey reach the roof with the Doctor wearing a dress shirt with trousers held up with braces. The Doctor has Rory carrying coats, while a selection of ties hangs off his shoulders. Rory wonders why the Doctor has called the Atraxi back when they were leaving; the Doctor explains that while leaving is good, he intends to make sure they never come back. He calls to the Atraxi waiting for him, it lowers and scans him; it states that the Doctor is not of Earth. The Doctor admits that it's right, but he's put a lot of work into it. The Atraxi asks if the Earth is important, offending the Doctor; he explains that 6 billion people live there. As the Atraxi are scanning the entire planet, he asks it if the humans are a threat; a scan shows that they are not. He then asks if they are guilty of any Atraxi crimes; another scan confirms they are not.\n\nThe Doctor then asks his final question: is the Earth protected? He then elaborates: \"You're not the first lot to have come here. Oh, there have been so many. And what you've got to ask is, 'What happened to them?'\" The Atraxi display holograms of previous aliens that came to Earth and then of the Doctor's previous incarnations. The Doctor emerges from a hologram of his predecessor, now wearing a bow-tie and tweed jacket. With a smile, he coolly says, \"Hello, I'm the Doctor. Basically... run.\" The Atraxi take the hint and flee the Earth in pure terror; the Doctor will be the end of them if they ever threaten this planet without a just cause again.\n\nAs the Doctor observes their departure, he realises that the TARDIS key is glowing; the TARDIS has recovered and awaits him. Amy and Rory wonder if the Atraxi will be back again, but then notice that the Doctor has left. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS, which now has a brighter shade of blue and a new St. John sticker on the door. He opens the door, being awestruck by his new console room. He decides to take it on a quick hop to the Moon to run in the replacement engines. Amy returns with Rory to her garden just in time to see the TARDIS dematerialising; she is devastated, believing that the Doctor has left her again.\n\nAmy dreams of her younger self awaiting the Doctor's return in her garden but wakes up at the sound of the TARDIS rematerialising outside. Racing into the garden in her nightie, she is shocked the Doctor has come back again. Even more shocking is that he kept the clothes he stole, including the bow-tie — \"Bow-ties are cool.\" She then angrily informs him that all of the events surrounding Prisoner Zero and the Atraxi happened two years ago; thus, it has been fourteen years since fish fingers and custard, fourteen years since he first promised her a trip. Calling her \"the girl who waited\", the Doctor muses that she's waited long enough and asks her to join him as a companion.\n\nAmy refuses the Doctor's offer but changes her mind when the Doctor snaps his fingers, opening the doors of the TARDIS. He gestures inside, and she enters. She is in wonder at the TARDIS interior. To the Doctor's delight, a new sonic screwdriver pops up out of the console. Amy asks why the Doctor is offering to take her with him. He says he has become bored travelling alone; he then adds talking to himself gives him an earache. A small image of the crack from her bedroom appears on the scanner, but the Doctor adjusts the scanner and the crack quickly disappears. Amy tells the Doctor that she had come to see him as a madman with a box after all these years, now thinking she was wrong. However, the Doctor tells her that, when travelling with him, there is one very important thing to remember: \"I am definitely a madman with a box.\" Amy then makes the Doctor promise to bring her back to Leadworth by the next morning for \"stuff\", and they fly off into the Vortex — leaving behind the wedding dress that hangs on Amy's closet door.\n\nThe Eleventh Hour received its international broadcast debut on 17 April 2010 when both BBC America in the US and Space in Canada broadcast it, followed by ABC1 in Australia on 18 April.\n\nHowever, it had several pre-broadcast public screenings in North America prior to its official broadcast launch. On the west coast, it premièred on 3 April at WonderCon in San Francisco.[2] Its east coast debut was on 14 April 2010 at the Village East Cinema in Manhattan. This latter screening was sponsored by BBC America, and was attended by Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Steven Moffat, who fielded questions after the showing.[6] An additional showing occurred on 16 April at the C2E2 convention in Chicago. In addition, there were also press screenings, such as the Canadian one held in Toronto 8 April after which Moffat participated in a Q&A via Skype.\n\nOf note, the \"Next Time...\" trail at the end of each episode has been excised from this and all future episodes for the DVD/Bluray releases up to A Christmas Carol.",
