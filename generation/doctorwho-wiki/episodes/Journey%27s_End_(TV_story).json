  "content": "Journey's End was the thirteenth and final episode of series 4 of Doctor Who.\n\nIt was the second episode of a two-part story, preceded by The Stolen Earth, which itself had picked up the cliff-hanger of Turn Left. It also had an open ending, which was quite different to how the previous seasons of the revived series ended; they each led into the next season's Christmas special, but this one did not. However, several issues were concluded: the Cult of Skaro had been completely wiped out in this episode with Dalek Caan's death, and the relationship between Rose Tyler and the Tenth Doctor also received closure in the form of a unique regeneration where the Doctor did not physically change, but rather, served as the genesis for a half-human clone. However, the Tenth Doctor's choice to abort one of his regenerations would still count as a regeneration being used up, leaving him with only one left and paving the way for what would be the final incarnation in the First Doctor's regeneration cycle.\n\nThe story also saw the first exploration into how the Doctor's self-sacrificial nature caused those around him to perform the same acts, something that would come back to plague him much later on, noticeably in his twelfth incarnation, as seen in Face the Raven and The Doctor Falls.\n\nThe story notably introduces The DoctorDonna, a by product of the Human-Time Lord Meta-Crisis that resulted in the Meta-Crisis Doctor giving Donna the memories and intelligence of the Doctor. However, much like how becoming Bad Wolf would have killed Rose, Donna had her memories of her adventures with and of the Doctor completely erased to save her life at the end of the story, and the threat of remembering the Doctor causing Donna's death as well as Donna's missing memories of the Doctor and their adventures would be left unresolved until 15 years later after this episode in 2023's The Star Beast, which saw Donna reuniting with the Doctor, now in his fourteenth incarnation, played again by Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant.\n\nAll hell has broken loose! Humanity is threatened with global annihilation, as Davros and the New Dalek Empire prepare to detonate a bomb that will wipe out all of existence. The Tenth Doctor is helpless, and the TARDIS faces destruction. The only hope lies with the Doctor's companions — the \"Children of Time\" — but Dalek Caan predicts that one will die...\n\nThe Tenth Doctor's regeneration is nearly complete. Donna Noble, Captain Jack Harkness, and Rose Tyler are barely able to watch due to the light. Suddenly, the Doctor directs the rest of the regeneration energy into the container housing his severed hand; the regeneration energy dissipates and the Doctor emerges, still in his tenth incarnation, leaving his friends gobsmacked. The Doctor explains that he used the regeneration to heal himself from the Dalek energy blast, but syphoned off the remaining energy that would have changed his appearance and personality into his other hand — a matching biological receptacle. The Doctor says he didn't want to change; Rose is relieved that \"her\" Doctor is still there and the two happily embrace.\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah Jane Smith is covering her head with her arms, waiting to be exterminated by the Daleks, but with flashes of blue light, Mickey and Jackie appear beside the car and they blast the Daleks to pieces. Sarah gets out of the car, shocked, but immediately hugs Mickey. He jokes, \"Us Smiths got to stick together\". Jackie introduces herself, but asks, \"Where the hell is my daughter?\"\n\nOver at Torchwood, Gwen Cooper and Ianto Jones shoot at the Dalek, raging. But they notice something strange and they cease fire. They walk forward cautiously and see their bullets hanging in the air as if stopped by an invisible wall. Gwen reaches out slowly to touch it — she can't, but her finger makes a ripple in the air; it's a time lock that their deceased co-worker Tosh was working on. However, while the Dalek is locked out, they're locked in.\n\nElsewhere, a patrol of Daleks have found the TARDIS. Inside, the Doctor prepares to take off with his companions to figure out a strategy. However, right as he throws a switch, the Daleks use a temporal loop to make the TARDIS powerless. They then take it to the Crucible. Upon arrival, the Supreme Dalek orders the time travellers to depart the vessel. Jack thinks they are safe because of the extrapolator force field the TARDIS has, but the Doctor explains that unlike last time when they were fighting hybrid scavengers, now they're up against a Dalek Empire at the height of their power who have the expertise and technology to get past the TARDIS' defenses. As the Doctor puts it, \"...that wooden door is just a wooden door\".\n\nThe Doctor, Rose, and Jack exit. However, Donna becomes distracted by the sound of a heartbeat and, while she is looking back, the TARDIS door slams closed. The Doctor demands that Donna be released. The Supreme Dalek denies responsibility calling it \"Time Lord treachery\" and even if the Doctor wasn't responsible they consider the TARDIS to be a weapon that must be destroyed. The Daleks dump the TARDIS and send it to be destroyed in the centre-core of the Crucible, a ball of Z-neutrino energy. The TARDIS plummets into the core and, without defences, begins to burn up. As the TARDIS interior erupts in flames and debris, Donna collapses near the severed hand. Just as she's convinced she's about to die, she hears the heartbeat again and touches the container, and energy flows between it and her. The hand bursts out of the container and forms into a duplicate of the Doctor, who quickly dematerialises the TARDIS. A view of the TARDIS in the core is shown to Jack, Rose, and the Doctor, who believe Donna and the TARDIS to have been destroyed.\n\nSarah, Jackie, and Mickey, having seen the Daleks transport the TARDIS to the Crucible, lay down their guns, allowing themselves to be captured and taken to the Crucible in order to find the Doctor.\n\nMeanwhile, Martha Jones says her goodbyes to her mother and uses the Project Indigo device to take her to Germany, where one of five Osterhagen stations is hidden, and awaits contact from the other bases.\n\nAboard the Crucible, Jack creates a distraction by shooting the Supreme Dalek with his revolver, but the Dalek Supreme promptly shoots him down. The Doctor and Rose are taken to the vault where Davros is held. Rose is desolate; she doesn't know she made Jack immortal as the Bad Wolf and that his immortality has allowed him to escape.\n\nIn the TARDIS, the new Doctor has dressed in the Doctor's blue suit and has finished repairing the interior from its damages. He rambles on about how they have to be quiet — \"can't even drop a spanner\". Donna then asks if Time Lords can multiply like this — \"Chop off a bit and grow a new one\". However, the new Doctor explains that there has never been anything like him before. He then notices that he only has one heart, like a human; he's not too pleased with this, saying it's \"rubbish\". Donna tells the \"spaceman\" to watch what he says, and the new Doctor tells \"earth girl\" the same. Both of them are shocked by this; he's absorbed some of Donna's mannerisms. He then begins pondering what Davros could be doing with the planets.\n\nWith the Doctor and Rose contained, Davros explains that the twenty-seven planets form an energy pattern amplified into a \"reality bomb\", able to break apart the electrical forces holding everything together, down to the last atom, a creation Davros calls \"the apotheosis of [his] genius!\"\n\nMickey, Jackie, and Sarah have been taken with many other humans to a testing of the bomb, but they escape the test chamber just in time. The other humans are not so lucky and vanish out of existence when the bomb is activated.\n\nThe effect of the bomb is shown to the Doctor. Both Doctors are horrified as they realise how it works. But that isn't the half of it: the wavelength that the Reality Bomb produces, amplified by the twenty-seven planets, will break through the Rift at the heart of the Medusa Cascade into every single corner of creation. Davros proclaims it is his ultimate victory: \"The destruction of reality ITSELF!\"\n\nJack finds his way to Mickey, Sarah and Jackie, and, with a warp star from Sarah, creates a device that will implode the Crucible. Meanwhile, Martha makes contact with two other bases in China and Liberia. The Chinese counterpart wants to get it over and done with, but Martha, knowing the Doctor, first broadcasts a signal to the Crucible to give the Daleks a chance. She vows to use the Osterhagen key to detonate twenty-five nuclear warheads in strategic locations under the Earth's crust to destroy the planet and disable the reality bomb. The Doctor is horrified that Earth would ever construct what is essentially a giant self-destruct button. Jack and the others then contact Davros and threaten to destroy the Crucible with the warp star. The Doctor objects again and asks where they even got a warp star. Sarah steps forward and claims responsibility. Davros then interrupts her, recognising her face, and gets nostalgic, recalling how Sarah was on Skaro at the very beginning of his creation. Sarah retorts that she has learned to fight since then and demands that he free the Doctor or be destroyed by the warp star; however, seeing all his friends willing to go to such extreme measures gives the Doctor pause. Davros notices this and tells the Doctor that this is what he does to people: the Doctor may be a man who never carries a gun, but he turns ordinary people into soldiers in his war; he is told that his \"Children of Time\" have been transformed into murderers, noting that one has already sacrificed herself opening the subwave network. The Doctor is then shocked to learn from Rose that Harriet Jones died to ensure he got to Earth. Davros then asks the Doctor how many other people have died for him and/or in his name, and the Doctor is reminded of River Song, Astrid Peth, Jenny and many others who gave their lives to help him. Davros laughs that this is his final victory over the Doctor, by showing him his true self.\n\nThe Daleks lock on to their respective positions and transmat Martha, Jack, Mickey, Jackie, and Sarah to the vault where the Doctor and Rose are being held captive, thereby preventing them from using any of their devices to stop the Daleks. The Daleks then prepare to activate the reality bomb to wipe out all matter in this and every parallel universe through the rifts in the Medusa Cascade, but the new Doctor and Donna arrive in the TARDIS. Each tries to destroy Davros and the Daleks using a weapon created by the new Doctor, but both are stunned by shots of electricity from Davros' robotic hand before they can use it; Donna is sent flying while the new Doctor is put in a forcefield. Despite the revelation that Donna and the TARDIS survived, the Doctor is glum because the reality bomb is still counting down. The Doctor and his companions helplessly watch in horror as the reality bomb ticks down to 9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...\n\nNothing happens. Suddenly an alarm blares. Everyone looks over to see that Donna has used the controls to disable it. She gives a long technical explanation as to how she did it; this is astonishing because ordinarily, Donna \"can't even change a plug\". The Doctor recognises that the creation of the new Doctor has had an unintended side effect: Donna is now half Time Lord herself, sharing the Doctor's intellect — she is the DoctorDonna the Ood saw coming. She explains that the meta-crisis that created the other Doctor had also affected her, but the effect had lain dormant, needing a little spark to start it — \"Thank you, Davros!\" Donna and the new Doctor free the others and, with the help of the original Doctor, disable the Daleks. The Daleks are left literally spinning round in circles, thanks to Donna.\n\nThe Doctors then get to work and use the magnetron to send all the planets back to their correct places. Davros attempts to stop them, but Jack, who had used the commotion to sneak into the TARDIS, emerges with his defabricator gun and Rose's energy blaster; he tosses the latter to Mickey, who holds Davros at gunpoint. Turning to Dalek Caan, he demands to know why he didn't foresee this. From Caan's maniacal cackling, the Doctor realises that he did see it. Caan admits that he had seen the Daleks for what they were, had seen all the evil they had caused across time and space, and secretly aided the Doctor in their destruction, declaring \"No more!\"\n\nThe Supreme Dalek descends to the vault and accuses Davros of betraying the Daleks. Though Davros insists that Dalek Caan is the traitor, the Supreme Dalek declares that he will exterminate them all and fires at the Doctor, striking the machinery. Jack swiftly destroys the Supreme Dalek, but the shot he fired has destroyed the Magnetron, leaving the single remaining planet, Earth, stranded. Getting an idea, the original Doctor races into the TARDIS to replace the broken machine. Realising that Dalek Caan has seen the end of the Daleks, has been manipulating time to achieve this, and knowing that, even without the Reality Bomb, this Dalek Empire is powerful enough to slaughter the cosmos, the new Doctor uses the remaining machinery to maximise all dalekanium power feeds and redirect the energy output back onto itself. All around them, Daleks and their ships begin to self-destruct. The original Doctor is outraged at the new Doctor for making such a choice. The companions flee into the TARDIS. When the original Doctor offers to save Davros, he refuses. Gesturing at the destruction around them, Davros shrieks, \"Never forget, Doctor, you did this! I name you forever! You are the Destroyer of Worlds!\" — an epithet the Daleks have long associated with the Doctor. Davros howls in fury as the flames surround him, while Caan ominously predicts again, \"One will still die...\". Unable to save either of them, the Doctor flees into the TARDIS just before the Crucible is destroyed.\n\nThe Doctor comes up with a plan: he'll use the energy of the Rift as a rope and the TARDIS as a \"tow truck\" to move the Earth back to where it belongs. With the help of Torchwood's Rift Manipulator sending the energy, Mr Smith roping it around the TARDIS and K9 supplying Mr Smith with the TARDIS' base code, the Doctor is ready to go. However, he has a surprise for his companions. He explains that the reason that he has so much trouble piloting the TARDIS is that it is designed to be piloted by six people, and he has had to do it all on his own. He lets Sarah, Rose, Mickey, Martha, and Jack help him pilot while his clone, Donna, and Jackie watch — he specifically does not want Jackie to help. The Doctor flicks a switch and the TARDIS begins to fly with the immense Earth following behind.\n\nOn Earth, Luke holds onto K9 and cheers as the house on Bannerman Road shakes, Ianto and Gwen holler in delight in the trembling Torchwood Hub, Sylvia and Wilf frantically try to stay on their feet, and Francine takes cover beneath her kitchen table.\n\nWith Donna and Jackie watching, the Doctors and companions work the controls until, with a great shuddering halt, the Earth stops and begins to spin on its own, with the Moon hovering in to resume its own orbit. As the Children of Time celebrate in the TARDIS, Wilf, Sylvia and Francine revel in the sunlight and Earth celebrates its return home.\n\nWith Earth back in its proper place, the Doctor's companions leave the TARDIS. Sarah points out that the Doctor considers himself a lonely man, but he has the biggest family on Earth: his companions. She then leaves, concerned about Luke. The next to leave are Jack and Martha, but before the latter goes, he is stopped by the Doctor — \"I told you, no teleport\" — and has his vortex manipulator disabled yet again; the Doctor also tells Martha to dispose of the Osterhagen Key and \"save the world one last time\". As the two leave, Jack tries asking Martha to leave UNIT and join Torchwood. Mickey also departs after saying goodbye to Jackie; he had initially stayed in the parallel world to be with his grandmother, but she has since passed peacefully. As there is now nothing left for him on Pete's World, \"certainly not Rose\", he has decided to stay in his home universe, and catches up with Jack and Martha; Jack jokingly expresses irritation, saying that he had hoped to be rid of Mickey.\n\nUsing a closing rift, the Doctor returns Rose and Jackie to Pete's World and leaves the new Doctor with her. The original Doctor explains that by destroying the entire Dalek race, the new Doctor has committed genocide. He sees the new Doctor as similar to himself after the Time War, \"full of blood and anger\", and says that Rose had made him better. The new Doctor explains that having only one heart, he will age as a human and not regenerate; he could spend that one life with Rose. Rose, upset that it's still not the same as having the original, asks both Doctors the words that the Doctor was unable to say to her when they last parted. The original Doctor refuses to actually say them, only responding, \"Does it need saying?\" By contrast, the new, half-human Doctor, having the same memories and feelings as the original Doctor, whispers them into Rose's ear, and they passionately kiss. The Doctor and Donna quickly depart in the TARDIS and the new Doctor and Rose watch, hand in hand.\n\nReturning to their universe, Donna is eager for her and the Doctor's next adventure while the Doctor is strangely subdued and asks her how it feels to have all the new knowledge in her head. Donna claims she is fine, however it isn't long belong she starts babbling random facts then gasps in pain holding her head. The Doctor, having expected this, explains that the human brain cannot take in the Time Lord mentality: if she continues in her current state, she will die as her mind will burn up. In tears, Donna protests that she wants to continue her adventures with the Doctor as \"DoctorDonna\" and is willing to spend the rest of her life with him. Saddened, the Doctor says that he is so sorry; Donna then realises what he is about to do and begs him not to \"send her back\". The Doctor then tells her that they had \"the best of times\". Ignoring her pleas, he presses his fingers on Donna's head, wiping her mind of all her encounters with him, rendering her unconscious as a result.\n\nBack in Chiswick, Wilfred is excited when there is a knock on the door thinking Donna has returned home but his happiness turns to horror when he finds the Doctor outside with an unconscious Donna in his arms, asking for help.\n\nThe Doctor tells Sylvia and Wilfred everything that happened and warns them that Donna must never be reminded of her time with him or she will die. Sylvia tells the Doctor that the Earth's journey through space is currently all over the news, but the Doctor answers that it'll only be a story to Donna — another event she missed. Wilfred is upset that Donna has forgotten all the wonderful things she did, the people she met and the places she visited knowing that she had become a better person for all of them. Sylvia denies this but Wilfred insists she was a better person. The Doctor states that the Donna that travelled with him is \"dead\", fulfilling Caan's prediction. However, he adds that the universe will be singing songs about Donna, who was, for one shining moment, the most important woman in the entire universe. When Sylvia tells the Doctor that Donna is always the most important woman to her, the Doctor makes a point of telling Sylvia to try showing her love more often.\n\nAs Donna recovers consciousness, she storms downstairs and starts laughing about her being asleep in her clothes, but to her now, the Doctor is a stranger. She shows no interest in the Doctor and chats on the phone to her friends, who are all talking about the Medusa Cascade incident, to which Donna thinks that her friends were either drunk or that she slept through it. Sylvia tells the Doctor he should leave.\n\nOutside, the Doctor tells Wilf that the rain is the result of the atmospheric disturbance created when the Earth was moved back to its proper place but, like everything else, it will end eventually. Wilfred asks the Doctor who he's got now, and asks him what happened to all his other friends. The Doctor tells him that all his friends now have someone else, and that's fine with him. Wilfred promises he will look out for the Doctor every night while he looks at the sky on Donna's behalf. The Doctor quietly thanks Wilfred, then returns to the TARDIS; Wilf solemnly salutes the Time Lord as the TARDIS fades away.\n\nMelancholy and silent, the Doctor watches the time rotor as he sets a new course. He tosses aside his rain-drenched pinstripe blazer, leans on the TARDIS console and stares off into the distance; deep in thought, lonely and heartbroken.\n\nThe episode gained an overall, consolidated viewing figure of 10.57 million viewers in its first BBC1 airing. This placed it as the No. 1 program in the UK across all channels of the week, beating all the Wimbledon finals and all 5 episodes of Coronation Street, all 4 of Eastenders and all 5 of Emmerdale. This makes Journey's End the highest rated episode in the 45-year history of Doctor Who, surpassing Voyage of the Damned and The Stolen Earth, both of which ranked second in their respective weeks. However, the episode is not the most-watched episode of the revived series; that distinction belongs to the 13.31 million viewers obtained by Voyage of the Damned (the most-watched episode of all time remains City of Death Part 4 with 16.1 million viewers in 1979). The episode also achieved an Appreciation Index rating of 91, tying with The Stolen Earth, a number considered unprecedented for a mainstream network drama production.[3]\n\nJourney's End was broadcast on the CBC in Canada on 12 December 2008 in an extensively edited version, created in order so that the episode, which ran approximately 65 minutes without commercial interruption on the BBC, could fit into a standard 60-minute time slot with commercials, meaning the episode itself had to be whittled down to approximately 44-45 minutes. The deletion of approximately 20 minutes of scenes renders this version of Journey's End one of the most extensively edited Doctor Who episodes in the entire history of the franchise. The CBC subsequently made an unedited version of the episode available, but only on its website and only for four weeks after the TV broadcast (the broadcast occurred after Series 4 had been released to DVD in that country).\n\nSome of the most major edits included the Meta-Crisis Doctor connecting the dots between his/the Doctor's coincidental encounters with Wilf and Donna, the Doctor's farewell to his companions in the park, Rose's final question to the Doctor and her subsequent kissing of the Meta-Crisis Doctor, and the final scene of the Doctor in the TARDIS, alone.\n\nIt was subsequently announced that the CBC was discontinuing its broadcasts of Doctor Who, with the competing network Space taking over broadcasts of the series beginning with The Next Doctor and continuing into 2010.[1]\nBBC America also aired an extensively edited version of the episode in February 2009.",
