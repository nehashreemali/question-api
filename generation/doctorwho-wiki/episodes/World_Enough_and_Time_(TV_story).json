  "content": "World Enough and Time was the eleventh episode of series 10 of Doctor Who.\n\nThe episode continued the ongoing story arc concerning Missy's rehabilitation, with the Doctor taking Missy on her first adventure and entrusting her with his two companions in an experiment to test how good she has become. It also showed Bill Potts being converted into a Cyberman and displayed what appeared to be the beginning of the Twelfth Doctor's regeneration, setting the stage for the end of the Twelfth Doctor's tenure.\n\nWorld Enough and Time notably featured the return of John Simm as the Saxon Master, seven years after his last appearance in The End of Time, marking the first time a previous actor of the Master had returned to the television series after being recast. The episode also showed John Simm's Master acting alongside Michelle Gomez's Missy, marking the first onscreen appearance of more than one incarnation of the Master.\n\nIt also marked the return of the Mondasian Cybermen on television for the first time since they were introduced in 1966's The Tenth Planet, and the Cybermen's first significant appearance since series 8's Death in Heaven. The episode depicted a fourth alternative account of the genesis of the Mondasian Cybermen - different origins have been shown in the comics The World Shapers and The Cybermen, and the audio story Spare Parts. This was, however, explained in The Doctor Falls with a reference to \"parallel evolution\".\n\nIn 2023, despite World Enough and Time together with The Doctor Falls ranking as the most popular Twelfth Doctor TV story ahead of Heaven Sent in a poll by Doctor Who Magazine,[1][nb 1], a later DWM poll that year with a shortlist of 37 finalists including the two aforementioned stories declared World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls the second most popular TV story of the first 60 years of Doctor Who, behind the winner, Heaven Sent.[2]\n\nThe Doctor decides to test how good Missy has become by sending her on a trial run with Bill and Nardole. However, when things go wrong, the Doctor takes over. With Bill trapped in a different time zone, can the Doctor make it to her before it is too late, and who are all those people getting cured?\n\nThe Doctor stumbles from his TARDIS onto a snow-filled landscape, repeatedly chanting \"no\" as he falls to his knees. He begins to regenerate...\n\nSometime prior, while walking through the courtyard at St Luke's University, the Doctor decides to test if Missy can turn good, despite Bill's objections. They discuss it further in St Luke's kitchen, where their short dispute causes the Doctor to become emotional, due to Missy being the closest thing he has to someone else like him, something that amuses Nardole, who takes a selfie with him to chronicle the moment. Later that day, Bill and the Doctor eat together on the University roof, and the Doctor convinces Bill to let Missy try to prove herself. After a brief discussion about the Time Lords and gender stereotypes, Bill confesses that Missy truly scares her. The Doctor tries to promise he can ensure Bill won't die but admits it can't be guaranteed. Regardless, he assures her that he will be there should things get out of hand.\n\nThe plan set, the Doctor drops Missy, Bill and Nardole off on a colony spaceship facing a black hole in the hopes of saving it. Missy introduces herself as \"Doctor Who\" to the cameras, which she claims is the Doctor's real name despite the Doctor denying such. He soon becomes impatient with their progress, walking around the TARDIS eating crisps. Missy finally follows suit by deducing why a distress call was made. She also mocks Nardole and Bill's roles as \"comic relief\" and \"exposition\" given their genders. They are soon met by a blue-skinned humanoid named Jorj who demands to know which one of them is a human. Bill confesses that she is human, and the Doctor exits the TARDIS, taking charge as Jorj prepares to shoot Bill as creatures at the bottom of the ship begin to come up in the elevators. Despite the Doctor's pleas, Jorj shoots Bill in the chest, mortally wounding her. Figures with bandaged faces in hospital gowns collect her body, and, using voice synthesisers, claim that they will fix her but shall not return. The Doctor trusts them, leaving a psychic message for Bill to wait for him when she awakes.\n\nJorj threatens the Doctor when he attempts to scan the elevators but is threatened by Missy with her umbrella, who states only she is allowed to kill the Doctor and that it will only make the Doctor cross. Once things settle down, the Doctor explains that, due to the lower part of the ship being further away from the black hole, time moves faster on the bottom floors than it does on the top floor that they are in. He notes how lifts slowed down when they neared the top due to the difference in gravitational pull, using a red pen in his sonic screwdriver to illustrate. He also states that the creatures on board the ship are the descendants of the crew who went to the lower part of the ship when it got dragged towards a black hole and needed to be reversed, as decades have passed for them even though it has only been two days for Jorj. Jorj admits his confusion; the Doctor mocks him for his lack of knowledge despite supposedly going to \"space school\", causing the man to reveal he is only a janitor. The Doctor then knocks out Jorj using Venusian aikido so that he and the others can follow Bill. Nardole, stating it has been ten minutes for them, wonders how long Bill has been living below, to which the Doctor replies he hopes they aren't too late.\n\nMeanwhile, at the base of the ship, Bill awakes in a hospital ward with a cybernetic heart fused into her chest. A feral caretaker looks at her before running off. Coming to her senses, she briefly sees a vision of the Doctor telling her to wait for him only for him to vanish. She observes the room, noticing two clocks on the wall, one for Floor 1056 - which registers 365034 days, 23 minutes, and 26 seconds, or 999.430015 years - and another for Floor 0000, which indicates 2 days, 10 hours, 45 minutes, and 17 seconds.\n\nBill eventually clambers to her feet and begins to follow the noise of someone chanting \"pain\", soon finding it be another patient on the ward. She goes to fiddle with its voice synthesiser but has to hide as the feral man and a nurse enter the ward; the nurse mutes the synthesiser. The caretaker, revealed to be called Mr Razor, takes a liking to Bill and brings her to his room. He explains how time passes faster for them compared to those on the top floor, using a tin can to illustrate, and offers Bill tea. He explains how Bill was hurt on the upper levels so had to have her heart replaced with a \"shiny\" cyber heart and that she has been at the hospital for a few months. He also shows her a live feed of the upstairs, which Bill then spends her time watching despite its extremely slow pace. Months go by, Bill witnessing how the Doctor raised his eyebrow for a week and braced to explain the situation to his associates. While waiting, Bill recovers enough that she is eventually put to work cleaning the hospital by the nurse while plagued by the Doctor's message to keep waiting.\n\nOn one particular day, she contemplates leaving the hospital only for it to alarm the other patients on the ward, unnerving her enough to stay. After being there just over a year, she eventually convinces Razor to take her out of the hospital, where he reveals to her that the patients are being converted in preparation for \"Operation Exodus\" as the humans' finite lifespan cannot survive the journey back up to the top. They witness how the dying residents are guided to the hospital by the partially upgraded. After a while, Bill's cyber heart fails, forcing them back to the hospital.\n\nMore years pass, Bill eventually convincing Razor to take her to the elevators so she can be transferred back upstairs. They sneak in, Razor revealing he has a key to the conversion theatre, wearing a mask in skit attempt to disguise himself. However, once inside, it is revealed to have been a scheme to condemn Bill to a full conversion as, according to the surgeon, people usually scream if alerted to the real reason why they are taken into the theatre. The prototype patients in the room restrain her as the surgeon remarks how the headpiece he will fit on her head will inhibit emotion so she won't care about the pain of the process.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor, Missy and Nardole make it to the bottom floor, the Doctor having Missy delve into the ship's computer history to find out what has occurred below, annoying Nardole as that tends to be his job. He and the Doctor explore deeper into the hospital, finding a surgery room. The Doctor uses his sonic to activate the light above the bed, Nardole jumping in surprise at there being partially converted patients in the room. Elsewhere, Razor approaches Missy as she researches, asking her if she doesn't remember being on the ship before; the Time Lady threatening to kill him if he comes closer than three feet.\n\nThe others eventually learn of Operation Exodus, while Missy simultaneously learns the ship's origin: Mondas, twin planet of Earth. Razor teases her again, drawing a pistol, taunting Missy that the Doctor will never forgive her or set her free after he discovers what she did to Bill; Missy insists that she hasn't done anything to Bill, but Razor tells her that she did a long time ago. By now, Missy is agitated enough by Razor to confront him directly, threatening to extract his vital organs and make soup out of them. Razor declares that she would never be so self-destructive before dropping his gun, stating that neither would he. Razor talks to Missy about his love of disguises, wondering if she still likes them; \"Of course,\" he continues, \"they are rather necessary when you happen to be... someone's former Prime Minister\". He removes his mask, revealing himself as the Saxon Master to Missy's shock, now sporting a beard and grey hair. He greets his future self, smiles and remarks that he is very worried about his future before saying \"give us a kiss\".\n\nIn the surgery room, the Doctor opens a door, revealing a complete Mondasian Cyberman. Backing away, he confirms he means no harm and asks for Bill's location. To his horror, the Cyberman asserts that it is Bill. Missy and her predecessor enter, the latter surprising the Doctor as they profess they have made \"the genesis of the Cybermen\". Nardole runs away in fear, as the Doctor looks on in horror; his trial to test Missy's goodness has just been turned upside down in more ways than one. Not only has Missy seemingly reverted to her cruel self, the old Master is here too. Bill reaches towards the Doctor and, in the Mondasian Cyberman's stilted, sing-song voice states \"I waited. I waited for you...\" as she begins to cry beneath the mask.",
