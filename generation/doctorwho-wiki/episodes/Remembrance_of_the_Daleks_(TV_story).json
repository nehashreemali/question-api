  "content": "Remembrance of the Daleks was the first serial of season 25 of Doctor Who. The story's setting brought the Doctor back to 76 Totter's Lane in the year 1963, where the series began in An Unearthly Child.\n\nIt was notable for a marked change in character for the Seventh Doctor, who had previously maintained a jolly and comedic demeanour. Here, a Machiavellian side to his personality was brought to light, beneath the lighthearted exterior, and he began to reveal a manipulative nature that persisted into the rest of his era.\n\nClues were also given that the Doctor had a secret past on Gallifrey, the first glimpse of the so-called Cartmel Masterplan.\n\nAs with The Talons of Weng-Chiang, some members of its guest cast were deemed interesting enough to justify the creation of a Big Finish audio series. In 2012, Counter-Measures continued the adventures of the serial's Group Captain Gilmore, Professor Jensen and Allison Williams.\n\nRemembrance was the final televised appearance of the Daleks and Davros until the BBC Wales revival, although both would frequently recur in other media. It continued a narrative of chronological confrontations between the Doctor and Davros that had begun in Genesis of the Daleks, and included Destiny, Resurrection, and Revelation of the Daleks. It also concluded the Dalek Civil War story arc, which had previously spanned throughout Resurrection and Revelation.\n\nAt the time of broadcast, it unambiguously showed the onscreen destruction of the Dalek homeworld, Skaro. This act was largely forgotten by future Doctor Who writers; it was shown in the Doctor Who TV movie and in the BBC Wales episodes Asylum of the Daleks, The Magician's Apprentice, and The Witch's Familiar, along with the adventure game City of the Daleks, which was executive produced by Doctor Who series 5 and 6 executive producers Steven Moffat, Piers Wenger, and Beth Willis, and written by Doctor Who and The Sarah Jane Adventures television writer Phil Ford. Writer John Peel proposed a story called War of the Daleks, where Skaro would later be saved from destruction during the planned 27th season of the series. An explanation for Skaro's continued existence is given in The Witch's Familiar, as Davros explains that the planet has been reconstructed.\n\nPeel later adapted the unmade episode into an Eighth Doctor Adventures novel which showed that the planet destroyed at the end of Remembrance was Antalin, a decoy passed off as the real Skaro. Daleks in Manhattan, which was produced after the TV movie and before City, suggested a \"great war\" destroyed Skaro, apparently referring to the BBC Wales series' Last Great Time War which wiped out much of the Dalek race.\n\nLondon, 1963, and the Doctor returns to Coal Hill School with his new companion Ace, where he has unfinished business. His oldest foes, the Daleks, are on the trail of Time Lord technology - an artifact the Doctor himself left behind on Earth.\n\nEnlisting the assistance of the local military, the Doctor must protect the Gallifreyan secret of time travel as two opposing Dalek factions meet in an explosive confrontation, where the fate of the entire Universe is at stake!\n\nThe Seventh Doctor and his companion, Ace have landed the TARDIS in London, 1963, where they are noticed by a young girl at Coal Hill School, presumably due to Ace's ghetto blaster. Outside the school, there is a black van with no mark which the Doctor decides to examine, but Ace is more interested in going to a cafe. Investigating the school playground, the Doctor finds some strange scorch marks on the asphalt, unaware of the girl watching him. The Doctor returns to the van and enters, much to the surprise of the van's occupant, Professor Rachel Jensen. Before she can know who the Doctor is, she gets a call from her superior.\n\nIn the cafe, Ace meets a young man named Mike Smith who helps her when she finds out that the money that the Doctor gave her is pre-decimal. On the way back to Rachel Jensen's van, Ace finds out that Mike is actually a Sergeant and that the Group Captain has encountered some trouble at Totter's Lane.\n\nAt Totter's Lane, Group Captain Gilmore and his men have had one of their soldiers, Matthews, killed by an unknown force. The Doctor inspects the body, and determines he was killed by some kind of energy weapon. As two soldiers begin to take Matthews' body away, the unseen force that killed him also shoots and kills another soldier. Certain that they are dealing with a Dalek, the Doctor tries to tell Gilmore to retreat, but Gilmore refuses. Mike and Ace appear to help with the situation. When Mike attempts to radio for more help, the unseen force fires at Mike, just narrowly missing him. Gilmore then orders three rocket propelled grenades to be fired where the unseen force is hiding. Even though Gilmore tries to assure the Doctor by saying nothing remotely human could survive that explosion, the Doctor states that is the point; that thing in there isn’t even remotely human.\n\nThe unseen force then finally reveals itself; it is indeed a Dalek. As the soldiers fire at the Dalek, the Doctor borrows some of Ace’s Nitro-9 and distracts the Dalek. The Doctor lures the Dalek into the path of the lit Nitro-9, which explodes and destroys it. The army then order the destroyed Dalek casing to be covered in tarp and transported.\n\nThe Doctor and Ace borrow the black van to drive back to the school. Along the way, the Doctor explains that he has unfinished business: the Hand of Omega, an all-powerful, ancient relic of the Time Lord civilisation that the Doctor hid on Earth during a visit to 1963 in his first incarnation.\n\nUnfortunately, the Daleks have also heard about the Hand of Omega, and are trying to find it before the Doctor does. To complicate matters, there are rival factions of Daleks at work — the Daleks are currently in the midst of a civil war between those who accept and those who reject the leadership of their creator, Davros. Each side wants the Hand for itself.\n\nThe Doctor and Ace investigate Coal Hill School, where the Imperial Daleks have set up an outpost. The Renegade Faction, however, have their base in a warehouse where a Battle computer is and where Mr Ratcliffe and his group of fascists called 'The Association' work for the Renegade faction. The Doctor and Ace investigate inside Coal Hill, and locate the transmat, which is used to teleport Imperial Daleks into the school. After changing the transmat’s controls to prevent an Imperial Dalek from transmitting into the school, Ace states something this important must be guarded. As the Doctor realises this, an Imperial Dalek appears and orders the Doctor and Ace to halt. They run upstairs, but the Imperial-Dalek-controlled Headmaster of Coal Hill School knocks Ace out, and traps the Doctor in the basement with the Dalek. As the Doctor screams to be let out, the Dalek flies up the stairs, recognises the Doctor as an enemy of the Daleks and prepares to exterminate him.\n\nThe Doctor manages to escape thanks to Ace waking up in time. They escape the school, as the Imperial Dalek arrives and demands to the Headmaster that the transmat must be fixed. The Doctor and Ace find the army, and after informing them that the Imperial Daleks have set up base in the school, Mike leaves after receiving a phone call.\n\nThe Doctor and Ace head back to the school, and are promptly fired upon by the Imperial Dalek. Ace quickly destroys the Dalek with an RPG she found at the army’s truck.\n\nWhilst the Imperial Daleks are watching from their Mothership, the Renegade Daleks dispatch Ratcliffe and his men to retrieve the Hand Of Omega. Ratcliffe receives information from their informant about the school. This informant is revealed to be Mike.\n\nMike is found and interrogated by the Imperial-Dalek-controlled Headmaster of Coal Hill School in the graveyard. But Mike is not without his reflexes, and subdues the Headmaster — forcing the Imperial Daleks to terminate their agent.\n\nThe Doctor finds the Hand of Omega and has it follow him to a cemetery where he buries it with the help of a blind priest. The Doctor later gifts Ace a baseball bat imbued with the Hand of Omega’s power; but tells her to remain at the boarding house owned by Mike’s mother. Rachel, Captain Gilmore and the army make a plan to fight the Daleks. The Doctor makes a sonic device that can scramble the Daleks.\n\nAce gets bored of being cooped up in the boarding house and heads out to the school on her own so she can retrieve her ghetto blaster. Mike phones his mother to discover Ace is no longer there. The Doctor and company immediately go to try and find her. Ace arrives at the school, and is promptly chased by an Imperial Dalek, which Ace is able to blind by destroying its eyestalk with the baseball bat. Ace attempts to escape but is promptly cornered by three more Daleks who all circle her and prepare to exterminate her.\n\nThe Doctor shows up in the nick of time with the sonic device that disorientates and scrambles the Daleks, allowing the military to destroy them with plastic explosives. While Mike and the military proceed to destroy any other Daleks in the school, the Doctor is attacked by a Dalek mutant only to be saved by Allison who beats the mutant to death with Ace's baseball bat. They notice that the mutant is more advanced than that of the Dalek that was destroyed at Totter's Lane.  After healing Ace's injured leg and destroying the Imperial Daleks' transmat to prevent more Daleks from beaming to Earth, the Doctor and the others regroup in the café.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Ratcliffe finds the Hand of Omega in the cemetery. Although he and his men haul it out of the cemetery, the Imperial Daleks aboard the Mother-ship detect this. An Imperial Dalek calls the Emperor Dalek to assess the situation. Upon the Hand of Omega arriving at the junkyard, Ratcliffe is betrayed by the Renegade Daleks, and his men are gunned down by the Renegade Supreme Dalek. Ratcliffe himself is held hostage.\n\nAce travels with the Doctor to locate the location of the Renegade Daleks’ HQ. They find it, and the Doctor shows Ace the Battle Computer. He tells her that if the Daleks are over-reliant on rationality and logic, the solution would be to get a young, imaginative child to enslave to the battle computer. The Doctor tinkers with the Time Controller to 'manipulate the enemy'.\n\nHis plan works, but with consequences; the Renegade Daleks return to the base to find the Time Controller has been disabled. The Doctor and Ace flee, pursued by Renegade Daleks. Several soldiers attempt to hold off the Daleks, but are promptly exterminated. After making their way back into the school, Mike wonders aloud why the Daleks want the Hand of Omega, however he realises that he is not meant to know that. When asked how he knows this, he says Ace told him. Realising that Mike is an informant for the Renegade Daleks, she outs him as the informant, and has to be held back from attacking him. Mike attempts to reason with Gilmore, saying he was unaware that it was the Daleks he was giving information to, but Gilmore arrests Mike for treason.\n\nThe Renegade Daleks are informed of the Imperial Daleks' shuttle approaching the area and return to protect the Hand of Omega. The Doctor states that the Daleks will not land their shuttle in the playground, as it is too far from the action, only to be cut off by the shuttle landing on the playground.\n\nThe shuttle lands on the playground, and several Imperial Daleks pour out. The Supreme Dalek, via the Battle Computer, orders the Renegade Daleks to withdraw and defend the Hand of Omega from the enemy. After Imperial Daleks are sent out to retrieve the Hand of Omega, the Doctor, Ace and the soldiers plan to invade the Imperial Dalek Shuttle. Mike tries to justify himself to Ace that he just wanted to do Mr. Ratcliffe a favour in keeping the outsiders out, but Ace refuses to listen, as she is hurt by her betrayal. Upon finding out that the Imperial Daleks have control of the planet Skaro, the Doctor disables the massive ground defence and gets out of the Assault Shuttle with the team.\n\nSeveral Imperial Daleks scout the streets and are promptly fired on by Renegade Daleks. The Imperial Daleks promptly retreat after one is destroyed. The Emperor Dalek orders the deployment of the Special Weapons Dalek. Guided by several Imperial Daleks, the Special Weapons Dalek destroys two Renegade Daleks with a single powerful blast.\n\nMike escapes to the Renegade base, finding Ratcliffe a prisoner. The repaired time controller powers up, enabling the Renegades' escape. The Supreme Dalek orders the extermination of Mike and Ratcliffe, but the base is attacked by the Imperials, who overwhelm their few remaining opponents with the help of the Special Weapons Dalek. Ratcliffe and Mike flee with the Time Controller, and the Supreme Dalek orders the controlled girl to recover it. Using her Dalek-augmented abilities, she kills Ratcliffe and pursues Mike. The victorious Imperial Daleks return to the shuttle with the Hand of Omega. Meanwhile, the Doctor tells Ace to follow Mike.\n\nThe Emperor Dalek is informed of the recovery of the Hand of Omega. Soon after, the Doctor contacts him and demands the surrender of the Hand. The Emperor reveals himself as Davros. He declares his scheme to use the Hand on Skaro's sun, granting the Imperial Daleks the power to overthrow the Time Lords. The Doctor insults Davros and his Daleks, angering Davros to the point that he activates the Hand of Omega. The Doctor begs for Davros to not use the Hand of Omega, only for Davros to gloat at the Doctor’s emotions. He fires the Hand of Omega.\n\nIt turns out that the Doctor booby-trapped the Hand: It creates a supernova, obliterating the Daleks' homeworld Skaro. The Hand smashes back into the Mothership, but not before Davros and a Dalek begs for pity. Before the mothership is destroyed, Davros escapes in an escape pod. The Doctor declares that the Hand is travelling back to Gallifrey.\n\nAce is captured by Mike, who is still holding the Time Controller. The girl tracks him down and kills him before turning her attention to Ace. The Doctor seeks out the Supreme Dalek, telling it that it is the last Dalek and that Davros is dead and that Skaro is a burnt cinder circling a dead sun. Convinced of its absolute defeat, it kills itself, breaking the link with the controlled girl who screams as this happens. The girl then breaks down in tears and Ace comforts her.\n\nSmith has been denied a military funeral, and only six mourners attend the service: Mrs. Smith, Gilmore, Rachel, Allison, and Mike's uncle and aunt. Ace wonders if what the Doctor did was good. \"Time will tell,\" the Doctor replies. '\"It always does.\"\n\nReleased as Doctor Who: Remembrance of the Daleks, this was the second release of 2001 and the first to feature the Seventh Doctor. It features a different image of Sylvester McCoy on the cover to later releases (in common with The Robots of Death, The Caves of Androzani and Vengeance on Varos, the first stories released for the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Doctors).\n\nThis second release was as part of The Complete Davros Collection DVD box set (along with Genesis of the Daleks, Destiny of the Daleks, Resurrection of the Daleks and Revelation of the Daleks). The two-disc set made numerous amendments to features present within the initial release, with the SFX errors and the Multi-Angle feature being corrected, and the Photo Gallery being revised and expanded.\n\nThe use of a Beatles song created problems when it came to issuing the story to DVD Region 1 (North America). In November 2007, BBC Video announced a March 2008 release for the story, but in December 2007 this was cancelled, with licensing issues cited as the reason.\n\nIn November 2009, two years later, BBC Video announced that Remembrance of the Daleks was finally released to DVD in North America on 2 March 2010. The release, dubbed a Special Edition, included the bonus content included in the UK release of the Special Edition and substituted another recording of the Beatles song in place of the original recording.[1]\n\nThis story was released as Doctor Who: Remembrance of the Daleks.\n\nNotes: This story was released in a special edition Dalek Tin along with The Chase and a book entitled Daleks: A Brief History. The US release featured no book or tin, with both stories packaged in one box without individual artwork.\n\nNotes: W H Smith exclusive as part of the The Davros Collection box set in the early 2000s.",
