  "content": "Wild Blue Yonder was the second of the three 2023 specials of Doctor Who, broadcast on 2 December 2023[1] as part of the 60th anniversary celebrations.\n\nWild Blue Yonder marked Donna Noble's first full adventure as a companion following the Doctor restoring her memories, with Wild Blue Yonder continuing immediately on from the end of The Star Beast. Wild Blue Yonder is also the first televised story to explicitly show a male incarnation of the Doctor being attracted to another person of the same sex, with the Fourteenth Doctor shown agreeing with Donna that Isaac Newton was \"hot\". Regarding Newton's brief appearance, Wild Blue Yonder also set a new status quo by having Newton accidently retcon the word \"Gravity\" into \"Mavity\".\n\nMaking a brief appearance alongside Nathaniel Curtis as Isaac Newton was Susan Twist as Mrs. Merridew. While Twist's appearance was a minor one, this was her first appearance playing different characters who looked identical to each other, something that would become a more regular occurrence from The Church on Ruby Road onwards and would become one of the major plotlines in Series 14.\n\nWild Blue Yonder also allowed both David Tennant and Catherine Tate to play both the Doctor and Donna respectively, but also the main antagonists of the story, the not-things, making Tennant the seventh actor of the Doctor to have played both the Doctor and one of the main antagonists in a story, following William Hartnell in The Massacre [+]John Lucarotti and Donald Tosh, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966)., Patrick Troughton in The Enemy of the World [+]David Whitaker, Doctor Who season 5 (BBC1, 1967-1968)., Tom Baker in Meglos [+]John Flanagan and Andrew McCulloch, Doctor Who season 18 (BBC1, 1980)., Peter Davison and Colin Baker in Arc of Infinity [+]Johnny Byrne, Doctor Who season 20 (BBC1, 1983)., and Matt Smith in Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)..\n\nNotably, after being referenced in the previous story, Wild Blue Yonder saw the return of Bernard Cribbins as Wilfred Mott, marking Wilfred's first appearance in the series since The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010). in 2010. However, his appearance would be posthumous, as Cribbins passed away in 2022 after filming his scenes and before being able to film other scenes featuring Wilfred that had been written prior to his death, making Wild Blue Yonder the final onscreen appearance of Wilfred (although a body double was used briefly for the character in the following episode [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) and the final acting credit of Bernard Cribbins. Wild Blue Yonder was consequently dedicated to Cribbins' memory.\n\nWild Blue Yonder also explored the emotional impact of the Timeless Child revelation and the Flux on the Doctor. Particular, it showed that the events experienced by the Doctor's previous incarnation continue to weigh on the Fourteenth Doctor, with his current relationship to Gallifrey being \"complicated\".\n\nThe TARDIS, out of control, abandons the Doctor and Donna on a faraway, mysterious spaceship, with deadly secrets in every corner.\n\nThe Fourteenth Doctor and Donna Noble crash the Doctor's TARDIS in an apple tree in 1666, just as Isaac Newton was reaching his famous epiphany. Donna is delighted, in spite of the fact that that TARDIS is going haywire, and insists on making a joke about the gravity of the situation she and the Doctor find themselves in as they depart. Newton, still thinking about his epiphany, reflects on these last few words, trying to recall them. For his new discovery he has a name - \"Mavity\".\n\nThe TARDIS then lands in an unknown spaceship, heavily damaged; the Doctor and Donna narrowly avoid a fire blast from the TARDIS incinerating them as they jump out. The Doctor places his sonic screwdriver into the latch in order to prime the TARDIS to regenerate and heal itself from the damage it has sustained. As the Doctor works, Donna wonders why the TARDIS played \"Wild Blue Yonder\", recalling how her granddad hated it because it reminded him about the war. The Doctor eventually triggers the TARDIS' self-repair and they leave the room to take a look around the ship. However, they quickly race back after hearing the TARDIS dematerializing as a result of the Hostile Action Displacement System, taking the sonic screwdriver with it. The two of them at first despair, until the Doctor explains to Donna that there's a good chance the TARDIS will return to them if they resolve whatever hostile action they have encountered. The two set off into the ship with renewed determination, marching down a long corridor. As they walk, the environment shifts around them and a loudspeaker blares \"fenslaw\". Because the TARDIS isn't present to translate the word, and because the Doctor doesn't speak the language, neither he nor Donna knows what \"fenslaw\" means.\n\nThe two come across a small hovercraft and a slow moving robot marching down the hallway. The pair find their way to a cockpit and try to decipher what they can from the ship's computer. There are no life signs on board, and the airlock had been opened once three years ago. The Doctor realises that the ship is one that had fallen through a wormhole and ended up on the edge of the universe, where not even starlight has yet propagated long enough to reach.\n\nThe intercom blares \"coliss\" and the ship shifts again. The two wander into a room filled with drawers of baseplate repetition filaments. The Doctor asks Donna to move all the ones in a lower drawer to to a higher one, as the ship is on idle and needs to be powered back up. The Doctor finds another room with a spindle and works on adjusting it. As Donna moves the plates, it grows colder, which she murmurs about. The Doctor enters to acknowledge the change in temperature to her. As the two talk, the Doctor grows quiet, letting Donna lament on what her family would do if she failed to return to them, especially noting how, while her daughter would have to move on, her husband and grandfather would wait for her return every day. The Doctor then mumbles that his arms are too long. However, the Doctor is actually still back in the room with the spindle, and still working on adjusting it, as it grows cold and Donna appears to enter. The Doctor begins to ponder what would happen to the TARDIS if he never saw it again, fiddling with the panels as he fantasises it outlasting numerous civilisations while Donna uncharacteristically remains silent. Eventually, Donna mentions that her arms are too long. The Doctor turns to look at her and sees her arm to be stretched beyond all proportion, realizing that this isn't Donna.\n\nBoth the Doctor and Donna from the two rooms run back to each other, with their doppelgängers slowly following behind. They claim to be not-things that have come from the nothing outside. They chase the Doctor and Donna, who use the hovercraft to try and outpace them, but the not-things grow and twist in size, keeping pace, before eventually tangling together and blocking each other and the whole of the corridor, slowly beginning to untangle.\n\nThe Doctor and Donna climb upwards to a vent, but, as the intercom blares \"brate\" and the environment shifts, they become separated. The two walk around separately, trying to find the other, and two pairs of Doctors and Donnas unite. The four try to convince their partners that they're real, through conversation or other means. Donna manages to surmise the Doctor in front of her is fake when he fails to maintain the tie he removed. To scare her, the not-thing duplicate contorts his body and mocks Donna's stupidity. Meanwhile, the real Doctor initially believes the Donna before him is a copy before she changes his mind by revealing, because of Meta-crisis, she knows about his role in the Flux and his history as the Timeless Child. Convinced, the Doctor goes to hug her, only for the not-thing's illusion to fail. He trembles in rage at her, running as she mocks his past. The Doctor eventually stops running, before exploding with rage, striking a wall over and over. As the intercom blares \"gilvane\", he recomposes himself and carries on searching for the real Donna.\n\nEventually, the four find themselves together in a room, and the Doctor and Donna figure out which of them is real by knowing enough about how the other acts. As the not-things begin to advance, the Doctor lays down a line of salt, insisting that they can't cross it without counting every grain. At first they are dismissive, saying it's a superstition, but the Doctor insists that it's a superstition and real at the same time. Giving in, the Not-Donna bends down and begins to count as the real Doctor and Donna interrogate the Not-Doctor, who they notice is slowly acclimatising. The Not-Doctor explains that they have heard the \"noisy, boiling universe\", and wish to venture there to play the games those in the universe do, that have given shape to the not-things: they want to wage war and plan to become perfect copies of the Doctor and Donna so the TARDIS will let them command it and they can escape. The Not-Donna blows away the salt, revealing she has figured out the superstition was a lie, and the not-things advance as the intercom blares \"stond\".\n\nThe Doctor and Donna run back to the cockpit and lock themselves in, with the not-things standing outside, slowly copying them more and more as the pair stresses. The pair realise the not-things chased them to raise their adrenaline, so they would think faster, and therefore can be copied easier. To combat this, they try to think as little as possible, but the Doctor struggles - the not-things persistent questioning causes him to give in and begin to figuring the ship out again. He opens the bridge's out hatch to see outside, finding the corpse of  the ship's captain circling the ship, having killed themselves, and the not-things don't know why.\n\nThe intercom blares \"ratico\" as the Doctor explains that the captain killed themselves to stop the not-things from fully copying them and knowing what she did to stop them from reaching the rest of the universe, so slowly that the not-things could never know what it was. The Not-Doctor teases the Doctor, remarking he has now copied the Doctor's intelligence completely so, even though the Doctor tries to stop thinking, the not-things can still figure out the captain's plan: she has programmed the ship to slowly reconfigure into a bomb, with the words being a countdown and the robot as the trigger. The intercom blares \"Vandeen.\"\n\nThe plan revealed, the not-things turn to leave the bridge and stop the robot, but the Doctor uses the bridge's controls to trap them. However, it is only a matter of time before they use his copied intelligence to break out. With no other way to prevent the not-things from stopping the countdown, the Doctor speeds the countdown up and the not-things break free. The not-things run for the robot pursued by the Doctor and Donna as the intercom blares \"Blinss.\" The Not-Donna tries to keep the pair away as the Not-Doctor races towards the robot to stop it; she fails to stop the Doctor, who manages to push her away as he rushes past, but the not-thing does tackle Donna down. As the intercom blares \"Sensill\", the Doctor nearly reaches his not-thing copy, but it becomes quadrupedal in order to out speed him.\n\nThe Doctor stops running, knowing he can't possibly catch up now. But he also realises that the not-things won't be able to reach the robot in time, so the hostile action is resolved and the TARDIS should know the threat is basically over. As if on cue, the TARDIS begins to rematerialize, still playing \"Wild Blue Yonder\" from within as the intercom blares out \"One.\" The Doctor enters the TARDIS and pilots it to the pair of Donnas; he tries to determine which Donna is real, and pulls in the one that answers his questions to his satisfaction.\n\nAs he leaves, the other Donna cries, insisting that he got the wrong one, and that she's real. To her horror, the intercom blares out \"Tacsladia\", which she recognises as \"Zero\". The robot pushes the button and the explosion begins, destroying the Not-Doctor and rushing to meet Donna. On the TARDIS, the Doctor turns to face the Donna on board having scanned her - her arms are ever so slightly too long. He ejects her and the real Donna rushes in, the pair hugging as the TARDIS dematerializes, flying away from the exploding ship.\n\nAs they travel back to London, reflecting on their adventure, the Doctor ponders as to whether it was a good idea to use the salt, a superstition, on the edge of the universe where the walls of reality are thin. He dismisses it, instead questioning Donna if the Meta-crisis allowed her to really access all of his new memories. Donna says she does not, but asks if the Doctor wants to talk about what happened since he left her. The Doctor replies not, stating he will be fine \"in a million years\".\n\nThe Doctor and Donna land the TARDIS, back near the alley from which they took off in 21st century London, though a day or two off, according to the Doctor. As they exit they find Wilfred Mott, who is happy to see Donna until he notices and is shocked to see the Doctor with the same face he last saw him with fifteen years ago, and becomes emotional and overjoyed to see him again. The Doctor in turn hugs him in delight, saying seeing Wilf again has made him feel so much better and now there's nothing wrong in the world. Wilf says that he's never lost faith in the Doctor, believing he would come back to save them. As the Doctor asks what they need saving from, small explosions and riots break out, and a plane crash lands not far away. Wilf tells him the entire world is coming to an end, as Donna and the Doctor rush him to cover.\n\nThere are slight differences between the version broadcast on BBC One and the one shown on Disney+:\n\nThis story was released on DVD and Blu-Ray in the United Kingdom on 18 December 2023, along with The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023). and The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)..
