  "content": "Spearhead from Space was the first serial of season seven of Doctor Who.\n\nContinuing from the final episode of The War Games, the story marked the introduction of Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor as well as a significant change in the format of Doctor Who. The Doctor was from now on serving his Time Lord-imposed sentence of exile on Earth. It also continued some elements from The Web of Fear and The Invasion in depicting a renewal of the Doctor's association with UNIT and re-introducing Nicholas Courtney's Brigadier as head of its British branch. Both would be regular features of this era of the programme.\n\nThe story also introduced the Doctor's binary cardio-vascular system, which became an oft-repeated feature of Time Lord physiology thereafter. Moreover, it introduced both the Nestene Consciousness and its android agents the Autons, who reappeared in future stories. Russell T Davies used this story as a template as he wrote the first episode of the 2005 series. It also had some common features with both Steven Moffat's and Chris Chibnall's first stories as producers, in that both this story, The Eleventh Hour, and The Woman Who Fell to Earth introduced a new Doctor and new companions after the departure of all those from the previous story, effectively making a \"clean break\" from the previous era of the show.\n\nSpearhead from Space was also the first Doctor Who serial to be produced in colour. Behind the scenes, it was the last contribution of producer Derrick Sherwin, after he was convinced by his Doctor Who predecessor Peter Bryant to join him on the BBC's crisis-hit detective drama, Paul Temple, in the middle of principal photography. All the BBC's studio cameramen walked out on strike between the time of location filming and the first studio recording date, demanding more money for operating the technically more sophisticated new electronic colour cameras. This required Sherwin to commit the story to 16mm film, since the film cameramen were in a different union, and therefore not on strike. Spearhead from Space thus became not only the first colour Doctor Who story, but also the only story to ever be shot entirely on film. Over forty years later, Sherwin's decision to switch to film made it possible for Spearhead to easily adapt to new media: it is the first Doctor Who story of the classic era (discounting the 1996 telemovie) to be released in the Blu-ray format, and the first Classic story to receive an HD remaster specifically for the format.\n\nForbidden to continue travelling the universe by his own people, the Time Lords, and exiled to Earth in the late 20th century, the newly regenerated Doctor arrives in Oxley Woods accompanied by a shower of mysterious meteorites. Investigating the occurrence is the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce (UNIT for short), an organisation which had previously been associated with the Doctor during the Cybermen's invasion.\n\nLed as before by Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, UNIT is soon in action when people and meteorites start going missing. Most puzzling is the attempted kidnapping of a strange hospital patient: a man with two hearts, who insists that he knows the Brigadier.\n\nThe new Doctor soon joins forces with his old friend, with UNIT, and with the recently recruited Dr Elizabeth Shaw, but time is running out. Irregular things are happening at a nearby plastics factory, while faceless creatures lurk in the woods. The Nestenes have landed a spearhead force and plan to conquer the country by substituting plastic Auton replicas for men and women in key government and military posts.\n\nIt is the late 20th century on Earth, and there is a heatwave in England. At a tracking station, a radar technician is scanning the screen and calls for the duty officer. She comes in, and he shows her what looks like a meteor storm — but when they scan closer, it emerges that the meteors are flying in formation.\n\nA local poacher, Sam Seeley, hears the meteors falling to the ground and runs for shelter. As he emerges from the undergrowth, he finds one of the meteorites, which is pulsing with energy.\n\nThe radar technician remarks that the meteorites have landed in Oxley Woods, in Epping. He cannot get over the fact that they were in formation. The UNIT officer has phoned her superior, who also does not believe they were meteorites. The technician wonders what else they could be.\n\nThe TARDIS also materialises in Oxley Woods, and the newly changed Doctor — still dressed in his previous incarnation's black frock coat and check trousers — emerges and collapses to the ground.\n\nMeanwhile at UNIT headquarters, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart interviews Doctor Elizabeth Shaw of Cambridge University for the position of UNIT's scientific advisor. She says she has been approached by the security services before and is not interested. The Brigadier says that UNIT personnel are not exactly spies, that they deal with the odd and unexplained — on Earth and even beyond. She is rather dubious at the prospect. The Brigadier tries to entice her by talking about a thin funnel of super-heated air that has heralded the landing of meteorites at the same place twice in the last six months. This intrigues Dr Shaw.\n\nThe Doctor is brought into a local hospital, where Doctor Henderson says he will examine him.\n\nThe Brigadier tries to explain the importance of UNIT, saying that there are 500 planets known to be capable of supporting life, and that Earth needs to be prepared, adding that Earth has drawn attention to itself over the years. Liz is openly derisive when the Brigadier claims that Earth has interacted with alien races. The Brigadier mentions a mysterious man, known only as \"the Doctor,\" who has aided UNIT in the past.\n\nCaptain Munro telephones the Brigadier from Ashbridge Cottage Hospital., informing him that nothing has been found of the meteorites, but one of his patrols found a man collapsed in the woods next to a police box and have brought him to the hospital. The Brigadier tells Munro that he wants the police box to be guarded, but that the police are not to be notified.\n\nAt the hospital, Dr. Henderson looks over his patient's x-rays and is incensed that someone in the radiography department has played a joke, making him appear to have two hearts. En route to voice his anger, he receives a page from Dr. Lomax in the pathology lab. Lomax is similarly furious with Henderson for sending him non-human blood, but Henderson assures Lomax that he took the blood sample himself, and that even if the patient's blood is different, he still has to look after him. Alas, Mullins, a porter, overhears Dr. Henderson's end of the conversation and goes to the hospital telephone booth to contact the press in hope of a reward, telling them of the strange things happening at the hospital.\n\nMeanwhile in Oxley Woods, Sam Seeley has returned for the meteorite, with a shovel — and a burlap sack normally used for poaching. He digs up the meteorite, uncovering an object that is not a clump of rock, but a pulsing, trilling plastic orb. He hoists it from its earthy resting place and stows it in his poacher's sack. Suddenly, Seeley hears voices, and through the trees sees three soldiers, before sneaking back to his find.\n\nAt the hospital, the Doctor wakes up and leans over the side of his bed, looking for his shoes, but a nurse puts him back into bed. Dr. Henderson comes in. The nurse tells him the patient tried to get out of bed but has fallen asleep again.\n\nA military staff car pulls up outside the hospital, and the Brigadier and Liz Shaw step out of it. Inside the hospital, the lobby is overrun with the press, who are asking Captain Munro about the hospital's mysterious patient and what UNIT is doing there. The Brigadier offers them only the cliché explanation, \"training exercise,\" which the press do not believe. The reporters speculate about a \"man from space\" — and whether the man has been injured by, or is hiding, one of the meteorites.\n\nThe furious Brigadier orders that the guards at the police box are to be issued live ammunition. The Brigadier and Liz then enter the ward and introduce themselves to Doctor Henderson. He tells them that his patient has two hearts and blood that cannot be identified. The Brigadier is pleased. This must be the Doctor. He walks over and looks at the man's face. Liz asks the Brigadier if he knows the patient, but owing to the Doctor's changed appearance, the Brigadier fails to recognise him and asserts that he has never seen the man before in his life.\n\nThe Doctor awakens and recognises the Brigadier, much to the latter's confusion. He borrows a little mirror from Liz, and examines his new visage. He seems initially disappointed before deciding that it is distinctive. Everyone else looks on confused. The Doctor falls unconscious again. The Brigadier tries to wake him, but Doctor Henderson stops him. The Brigadier tells Munro he wants the Doctor taken to UNIT H.Q. as soon as he is able, although Dr. Henderson is not sure when that will be. The Brigadier further directs Munro to look for the meteorites. They all leave. As soon as he is alone again, the Doctor opens his eyes.\n\nJournalist Michael Wagstaffe sees Lethbridge-Stewart leaving by car and tells his colleague Jimmy that the UNIT group must have left by the back door. Jimmy asks Mullins when he and the press can see Doctor Henderson, but Mullins tells them they will have to wait. Wagstaffe goes to telephone his newspaper but discovers that a strange man (later identified as Channing) is using the only phone. He asks which newspaper he is on, but Jimmy says he does not know. Mullins comes over and tells them that Channing must have come in with them. Wagstaffe politely asks the man if he could use the telephone. The man, who has just been standing in the phone booth, like a waxwork, not actually using the phone, pushes past them and leaves.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam Seeley is found lurking in Oxley Woods by Munroe's subordinate, Corporal Forbes. Forbes tells him the woods are restricted and expresses his displeasure with Sam's poaching activities. Forbes asks Seeley if he saw the patrols; Seeley responds that they did not see him. Forbes declines Seeley's attempt to sell him freshly poached rabbits, instead telling him to leave and not to come back into the woods until they have been de-restricted. Seeley asks Forbes about the \"thunderballs\" (meaning the meteorites) and asks if there is a reward for finding one. Forbes demands to know if Seeley knew where one landed, but Seeley evades the question and Forbes just ends up telling him to push off.\n\nAt the cottage hospital, the Doctor wakes up and leans out of bed again, still looking for his shoes, but the nurse tells him that he is not going anywhere. Dr. Henderson enters, and the nurse tells him the Doctor's pulse has settled down — to a mere ten beats per minute. Dr. Henderson asks the Doctor how he is feeling, but the Doctor says only, \"Shoes.\" The nurse tells Dr. Henderson that he is worrying about his shoes and presumably thinks someone has stolen them. Dr Henderson asks where they might be, and the nurse tells him they are probably in his locker. Dr. Henderson takes them out and holds them out to the Doctor, who snatches them out of his hands and hugs them. The nurse remarks that the Doctor has been behaving very oddly, so Dr. Henderson tells her he will take the Doctor's blood pressure again, worried he may have suffered brain damage. Behind their backs, the Doctor looks in his shoes and finds the TARDIS key — which he conceals in his mouth instead.\n\nTwo burly men appear and knock out Dr Henderson, then put tape over the Doctor's mouth, before sitting him in a wheelchair and kidnapping him. Dr. Henderson wakes up and discovers the Doctor has gone. As Henderson chases after him, he is intercepted by Captain Munro, whom he alerts to the situation. Outside the hospital, the Doctor is being pushed to an ambulance, but he escapes in his wheelchair. The ambulance drives off at speed in pursuit, with the mystery man Channing at the wheel. Munro orders a soldier to shoot out the tyres, but the ambulance escapes. The UNIT soldiers find the wheelchair abandoned in the woods.\n\nThe Doctor reaches Oxley Woods, but as he crashes through the trees, he is shot by a nervous UNIT soldier guarding the TARDIS, who has been startled by the distant sounds of gunfire. The Doctor collapses...\n\nCorporal Forbes is incensed by the soldier's action. He, Captain Munro, and the private who fired the shot all converge over the unconscious Doctor.\n\nThe Doctor is returned to the hospital, and the Brigadier questions Dr. Henderson about his condition. The bullet only grazed his scalp, but the Doctor is in a deeper coma than Dr. Henderson has ever seen – which Henderson speculates is self-induced. Henderson still states that the Doctor cannot be moved. Before the Brigadier leaves the hospital, Dr. Henderson shows him the TARDIS key and says the unconscious Doctor's hand had to be pried open in order to get it.\n\nThe Brigadier tells Captain Munro to double the guard at the hospital, as the police box is now en route to UNIT H.Q. Munro shows him a broken-up meteorite and says it was destroyed when it hit the ground. It is lightweight and appears to be made of plastic. They discuss why whoever is behind this wants the Doctor. Munro shows the Brigadier a picture of Channing, the lead figure behind the attempted kidnapping. The only other detail that Munro can recall is that there was something odd about the kidnappers' faces.\n\nAt the nearby Auto Plastics factory, salesman John Ransome visits the production manager, George Hibbert, tailed by the mysterious Channing. Ransome argues with Hibbert over his sudden sacking and the cancellation of production of the new toy doll which Ransome had designed and sold to an American company. Ransome also demands to know why everything and everybody has changed in the factory; and asks what is going on inside his old workshop — which now has an OUT OF BOUNDS sign on the door. Hibbert tells him they have developed a new process and have a new policy: they have stopped manufacturing dolls, and have turned over to other work. Ransome asks why he can't get into his old workshop, and is then told by Hibbert to stay away from there and not go in, as it isn't safe; Ransome's personal tools and equipment will be sent on to him. He wants to know more, but Channing appears and Hibbert seems to go into a trance; he then comes to and tells Ransome there is nothing more to discuss before dismissing him. As he leaves, Ransome tries to investigate his workshop, but Channing again appears and Ransome has to depart.\n\nBack at UNIT H.Q., Liz is trying to identify the debris from space. It is definitely not a meteorite; it shows signs of having been manufactured. She is still sceptical about alien involvement, and even more so about the Brigadier's claims regarding the Doctor.\n\nChanning and Hibbert argue, but Channing has a firm hold over Hibbert. Channing reports that two energy units are still missing. Hibbert speculates that the Doctor may have one, but Channing thinks they are more likely embedded in soft earth. To locate them, Channing will increase their pulsation signals.\n\nMeanwhile, Seeley removes the meteorite he found from an old metal trunk in his garden shed and takes a closer look at it. As he does so, a mannequin dressed in blue overalls that looks superficially human, at least from a distance, comes to life in the woods.\n\nSeeley's wife Meg comes into the garden, and he hurriedly pushes the energy unit out of sight into the shed. Meg inspects the trunk to make sure he is not hiding stolen goods in it. After seeing that it contains only an old blanket, she tells Sam she will not have the dirty old trunk in the house. After she goes back in the house, Seeley again hides the energy unit in the solid metal trunk, muffling the trilling effect. In the woods, the hunting mannequin loses the signal and deactivates.\n\nThe Brigadier welcomes Major-General Scobie, UNIT's liaison with the regular army, and introduces him to Liz. Scobie asks what a police box is doing in the lab, and with an ironic look, thinking her remark is merely a joke, Liz tells him it is actually a spaceship.\n\nBack at the hospital, Forbes is guarding Dr. Beavis' vintage car at his request. Captain Munro orders him into a jeep; they are off to join Section 3, who have turned up another of the meteorites. Meanwhile, the Doctor — clad only in a hospital gown — sneaks into the staff locker room in search of some clothes.\n\nWhen Doctors Henderson and Beavis enter, the Doctor jumps into the shower and breaks into tuneless song, therefore hiding his face from them and avoiding being recognised. Beavis takes off his coat, hat and scarf and leaves them behind the door.\n\nAs the UNIT soldiers dig up a pulsating, trilling meteorite, the Auton standing silently in the woods begins to move again, swinging from side to side like a radar scanner, until it locks on to the signal.\n\nThe Doctor has dressed himself in a selection of in-patients' clothes he has \"borrowed,\" and adds Beavis' hat, cloak and overcoat. As he escapes, an alert is raised. Hurriedly he tries to find a car to steal, settling on Dr. Beavis' antique jalopy.\n\nAt UNIT H.Q., the Brigadier is told of the Doctor's escape. He says that the Doctor will home in on the TARDIS. The Brigadier again tries to open the TARDIS, but fails; Liz suggests he has the wrong key.\n\nMunro orders Corporal Forbes to deliver the meteorite to UNIT H.Q. But on the way, Forbes swerves to avoid the hunting Auton, which emerges without warning from the woods beside the road. He crashes the Land Rover into a tree, and is killed. The Auton takes the meteorite.\n\nIn Ransome's old workshop, which is now full of similar-looking mannequins, Hibbert tells Channing that General Scobie will soon arrive.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor drives into UNIT's vehicle entrance. Before the commissionaire can even ask to see his documents, the Doctor berates him, declares that he has no pass, and demands to see Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart at once.\n\nThe commissionaire telephones the Brigadier and is told to allow the Doctor entry. The Doctor enters the lab. When asked how he knew where to find UNIT H.Q., he shows the Brigadier his wristwatch, which doubles as a TARDIS magnet.\n\nThe Doctor asks if the Brigadier has the key. The Brigadier says it does not fit, but the Doctor tells him that it will work for no-one but himself. The Brigadier has a lot of questions, but the Doctor explains that he has lost his memory. The Brigadier asks how is he to know that the Doctor is not an impostor; but the Doctor replies that only he knows that. The Doctor studies his new appearance in a mirror and thinks he looks very smart, opining that his new face would be quite useful on Delphon, whose inhabitants communicate with their eyebrows. The Brigadier introduces him to Liz Shaw, to whom he says, \"How do you do?\" He does so in Delphon — using his eyebrows!\n\nThe Doctor examines the broken bits of the meteorite and finds them rather interesting: given the shape of the fragments, he deduces that they were hollow spheres, transporting something to Earth. The Brigadier asks the Doctor to assist UNIT with the investigation, and the Doctor asks for the key to the TARDIS in return, to which the Brigadier replies, \"Possibly.\" The Doctor asks him how many meteorites came down, and the Brigadier says there were fifty of them. The Doctor then asks how many have been found, and the Brigadier says only one — and even that has disappeared. The answer to the Brigadier's question is obvious to the Doctor: the meteorites had been collected and taken somewhere by the time the soldiers arrived to look for them. The question is: where?\n\nRansome returns to the Auto Plastics factory, climbing over a high wall to enter the grounds.\n\nIn Hibbert's office, Channing and Hibbert are showing General Scobie a plastic facsimile dummy of Scobie himself, rather like a waxwork, before showing him to his car. Channing explains to Scobie that they invited him to the factory because although their measuring techniques are very accurate, the equipment is not transportable.\n\nRansome enters the factory, climbs the staircase, and breaks into his old workshop, finding it full of new modern electronic equipment and a line of blue-overalled mannequins. As he inspects a strange computer-like device, he hears a noise from behind him. He slowly turns around — and is horrified to see one of the mannequins step down from a plinth and halt in front of him.\n\nThe mannequin's hinged hand drops away, revealing a small nozzle. It discharges a powerful energy bolt at Ransome, but he evades it. Fleeing the workshop, he escapes down the fire escape with the mannequin in rapid pursuit. In the factory, the mannequin is on the point of blasting Ransome down, until it sees that Channing and Hibbert are accompanied by General Scobie. Channing glances in the direction of the mannequin, and appears to telepathically order it to conceal itself. In the car park, as the General bids them goodbye, Channing refuses to shake his hand: it would be too obvious that he was not human. Scobie asks if he can see the waxwork they are making of him before it is sent to Madame Tussauds. Channing tells Scobie that they will arrange that.\n\nLater, Channing and Hibbert discuss the fact that Ransome was here. Channing knows because the machines registered his brain pattern. Channing says he will send an Auton. Hibbert protests, saying it will kill him. Channing brainwashes him and convinces him that it is a good thing. He sends an Auton off.\n\nMeanwhile, a terrified Ransome runs out into Oxley Woods where he collapses and is rescued by UNIT.\n\nMeg Seeley discusses the local goings on with her husband. She is sure the meteorites are linked into the soldiers' activity.\n\nRansome is shell-shocked and can only mutter something about creatures made in the factory. Munro sends him to UNIT H.Q.\n\nThe Doctor and Liz can get no readings from the energy unit. Liz is frustrated. The Doctor blames the primitive equipment. He says he has a lateral molecular rectifier in the TARDIS that they could use. Liz is dubious. The Doctor assures her that the TARDIS is not just a police box — it is, in fact, dimensionally transcendental. He persuades Liz to try to get the key from the Brigadier.\n\nIn a UNIT tent, Captain Munro telephones headquarters and is confident that his cordon will keep whoever took the meteor from getting far. Seeley is brought in after asking about the reward for a \"thunderball\", and Munro demands to know where he found one. Seeley pleads ignorance.\n\nChanning reports that the Auton has lost track of Ransome. Hibbert is concerned that he may end up at UNIT. Hibbert is also worried that the \"swarm leader\" meteor is still missing, but — like Munro — Channing is confident that it will be found. He also says that if Ransome returns, the Autons will kill him.\n\nRansome is in Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart's office, telling the Brigadier what he has seen at the factory — describing an army of men with smooth, shiny, plastic faces. Liz interrupts and tries to plead on the Doctor's behalf, but is stopped short by the Brigadier. Liz sees the key on the desk, and takes it without the Brigadier noticing. The Brigadier is sceptical of Ransome's story. He notices that the key is gone.\n\nLiz hands the key to the Doctor. She is shocked when it turns in the lock, due to fact that it failed to do so when the Brigadier tried it. The Doctor states it has a metabolism detector. He disappears into the TARDIS. The Brigadier enters and corners Liz. He calls her gullible and says they will never see the Doctor again now. To prove his point, the TARDIS starts to make its dematerialisation noise, but suddenly cuts out and begins to smoke. The Doctor emerges, shamefaced. He admits that he cannot contemplate a life in one place and time. The Brigadier asks for the key back. The Doctor asks what the point is of giving up the key, as he is now trapped. The Time Lords have changed the dematerialisation codes. He resigns himself to helping the Brigadier. The Brigadier says he has more evidence for him.\n\nThe Brigadier questions Ransome about the other man at the factory. Ransome says he is called Channing and appears to have a mental hold on Hibbert. The Doctor suggests they visit the plastics factory.\n\nSeeley wants to leave, but Munro says he can only go when he has handed over the information. Seeley, again, asks about a reward. Munro is more forceful.\n\nMeg opens the trunk in the shed and discovers the swarm leader.\n\nHibbert and Channing watch the progress of the Auton towards the cottage.\n\nSeeley tells the truth just as the Brigadier, the Doctor and Liz arrive. Munro informs them of the latest developments. They go to investigate.\n\nMeg puts the energy unit back in the trunk. Suddenly, she hears a strange noise coming from inside the house. She enters the house and encounters an Auton that has broken in and is knocking things over in its search for the swarm leader. Meg runs outside into the garden and gets Sam's shotgun out of the shed. When the creature emerges into the garden, Meg loads the gun, aims it and warns the Auton \"You get away from here, or I'll blow a hole in you!\" The Auton ignores the warning and keeps advancing. Meg fires, but the shotgun blast has no effect on the Auton. It continues to approach.\n\nMeg has been knocked unconscious. The Auton is checking the house. It begins to look in the shed. When UNIT arrive at the cottage, they enter the living room looking for Meg. They run out into the garden and find the Auton standing over the trunk. The soldiers and the Brigadier shoot at the Auton, but this has no effect. The Brigadier calls for a platoon.\n\nChanning recalls the Auton. The Auton obeys and makes its escape, but is forced to leave the swarm leader behind.\n\nChanning tells Hibbert the swarm leader has been taken by some UNIT soldiers. Hibbert asks why the Auton did not kill the soldiers, and Channing tells him he recalled it because it is too early for a major confrontation. He then tells Hibbert that UNIT must be delayed. He also notices Ransome's brain pattern back in the area and sends an Auton to kill him.\n\nLiz puts a blanket over Meg while the Brigadier goes to telephone for an ambulance. The Doctor investigates the meteorite and tells Liz the signal for it must have been muffled by the metal from the trunk it was in. Liz tells him to be careful with it as it may explode, but the Doctor tells her it will be all right as long as they treat it gently. Liz is worried that the Auton will return for it.\n\nThe Auton discovers Ransome in the UNIT tent, cuts its way in and blasts him down with an energy bolt. Channing orders \"Destroy! Total destruction!\" There is a flash of light as the Auton obliterates Ransome's body, which explodes without a trace remaining.\n\nMunro reports that the soldiers have lost track of the Auton. The Brigadier orders a cordon around the plastics factory. The Doctor urges caution.\n\nWhen he discovers Ransome's disappearance, the Brigadier is infuriated with the sergeant whom he had left in charge. The sergeant had posted a guard at the front of the tent, but left the back unguarded, allowing what appears to have been Ransome's abduction. The Doctor presumes Ransome has been taken to the plastics factory, and off they go to investigate.\n\nThe Doctor, the Brigadier, and Liz meet Hibbert in his office. Channing overlooks their entrance.\n\nThe Brigadier tells him about Ransome's story, omitting that they too had encountered the Auton. Hibbert denies everything and insists that Ransome was making up stories to discredit Auto Plastics after being let go for his supposedly impractical ideas to produce electronic dolls. The Doctor asks what they make at the factory. Hibbert states dolls and, more recently, mannequins.\n\nAt UNIT H.Q., the Brigadier says he recognises Channing from the photograph at the hospital. He is to ask General Scobie to launch a raid on the factory. The Doctor uses an electroencephalograph and finds the the swarm leader is emitting brain waves and wonders if it could be communicated with. Major-General Scobie telephones the Brigadier. The Brigadier asks for authority to raid the factory. Scobie agrees to meet the Brigadier and offers any support needed, and then hangs up to answer a knock at his front door. Scobie opens the door to reveal an exact replica of himself, which enters and advances towards him...\n\nAt UNIT, the Doctor and Liz are investigating the meteorite. The Doctor says that inside it is part of a brain that makes up a larger consciousness. He speculates that it is sending signals to the other globes. Just then the buzzer sounds and the Brigadier picks up the telephone. It is General Scobie's replica, who tells the Brigadier the factory is off-limits and that there is to be no raid. Before the Brigadier can argue with him, he hangs up. The Brigadier crossly puts the phone down, telling the Doctor he will go over Scobie's head to the Home Secretary or Geneva. He tells the Doctor the replica of General Scobie made by Auto Plastics probably flattered him.\n\nLater, the Doctor and Liz visit Madame Tussauds and discover a tableau of dummy replicas of important government officials. The Doctor discovers from an attendant that all the replicas are made not of wax but plastic; the attendant also mentions that the model of General Scobie arrived today. The Doctor investigates the model Scobie and discovers a wristwatch, wound and still at the right time, which he considers to be very odd. The Doctor telephones the Brigadier, but Captain Munro tells him he's not there. The Doctor tells Liz they are going to hide away until closing time.\n\nIn the factory workshop, Channing shows Hibbert a tank containing a body of an alien. He tells Hibbert that the meteorites have created a body for the creature. Hibbert asks what it will look like, and Channing says he doesn't know. Channing says he needs the swarm leader back and that they have the help of General Scobie's replica to do so. He says the facsimiles created are far more sophisticated compared to the Autons. They have the same brain cells and memory traces. He also says that tonight, the facsimiles will be activated.\n\nIn the Doctor's lab, General Scobie's replica has arrived, along with two military policemen, and orders Munro to hand over the last meteorite. Munro is reluctant, but Scobie threatens to have him arrested if he doesn't.\n\nMeanwhile at the waxworks, an attendant turns off the lights and leaves the room. The Doctor enters the dark room with a torch. Liz is frightened, but the Doctor tells her there is nothing to be scared of. Liz asks if he thinks the model of Scobie is the real Scobie — he says that is what he suspects. Just then, the Doctor and Liz hide behind a curtain as Channing and Hibbert enter the room. Channing senses an alien lifeform and Hibbert asks if it could be Scobie. From behind the curtain, the Doctor and Liz watch as the facsimiles are activated and leave the room. Channing tells Hibbert the facsimiles are going to take their places and start their work. The Doctor and Liz hear the door close and emerge only to meet Hibbert. The Doctor tells him about the Auton that killed Ransome. Hibbert tells the Doctor he had to kill Ransome because Channing told him to, but the Doctor convinces him to realise that Channing is controlling his mind and that he is Hibbert's enemy. Hibbert says that Channing is his partner. The Doctor tells Hibbert he has to escape from Channing and asks him to come to UNIT so he can help him. Just then, Channing enters the room again, calling for Hibbert, and the Doctor and Liz hide just in time. Channing orders Hibbert to come with him, as they have finished their task.\n\nLater, the Doctor and Liz tell the Brigadier about the waxworks and tell him he has to move against the factory quickly.\n\nIn Channing's workshop, General Scobie's replica tells Channing that if the Doctor and UNIT move against him, he will stop them. Scobie also says that Hibbert can be disposed with as he has served his purpose. Channing takes the meteorite and puts it under a pipe, which sucks the meteorite into the body. Channing tells Scobie's replica that in the morning, the Autons will be activated.\n\nIn the lab, the Doctor is building a device to destroy the Autons.\n\nAt dawn, the Autons posing as shop window mannequins are activated. They smash their way out, and kill anyone who gets in their way — including a policeman and a queue of people at a bus stop.\n\nBack in the lab, the Brigadier tells the Doctor that the Auton invasion has started. They are seizing police stations, barracks and communication centres. The Doctor shows him the weapon that will destroy the Autons. The Brigadier tells the Doctor his headquarters staff can help the Doctor access the factory.\n\nIn Channing's workshop, Hibbert is now free of Channing's control, and uses a metal bar to open the tank containing the creature, but breaks a small button on the tank. Channing enters and stops Hibbert, telling him he should not have left the factory grounds but Hibbert tells him that he has been controlling his mind. Channing says he is part of the alien species called the Nestenes, who have been colonising other planets for a thousand million years, and now they will colonise Earth. Channing promises that they will spare Hibbert.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor and the soldiers leave UNIT and head for the factory.\n\nChanning tells Hibbert there is nothing he can do. Hibbert attempts to kill Channing and the Autons by hitting the tank with the pipe, but is killed when an Auton shoots him with an energy bolt. Channing orders the Auton \"Destroy! Total destruction!\" and, like Ransome before him, Hibbert's body explodes into nothingness.\n\nThe Doctor and the soldiers reach the plastics factory. The Doctor opens the door, and everyone enters the factory grounds.\n\nJust then, General Scobie's replica arrives with UNIT forces and tells the Brigadier that he and his men are under arrest. The Doctor points his device at General Scobie's replica, and the replica collapses. A soldier accuses the Doctor of having killed General Scobie, but the Doctor tells him he was never really alive. He turns the body of Scobie over to reveal the face of a mannequin.\n\nMeanwhile, in Madame Tussauds, the real General Scobie suddenly awakes and there are gasps of surprise from visitors.\n\nThe Brigadier explains the situation to the UNIT forces whilst the Doctor and Liz sneak away. They enter the factory, and the Doctor uses his device on a passing Auton.\n\nAn army of Autons enter the grounds. The soldiers attack them, but they discover the creatures cannot be destroyed by gunfire. The Doctor and Liz enter Channing's workshop.\n\nThe Doctor sneaks up on Channing, who tells him that the Doctor is too late. Channing explains that the Nestene are a collective and killing just one of them will not work. The Doctor says that means there must be a way of destroying them collectively. Channing says they are indestructible.\n\nThe Doctor tells Channing that with his device, he can destroy him and the Autons, but Channing says \"No-one can destroy the Nestenes!\" and turns up the tank to full power. The Doctor finds his weapon is not working. The Doctor goes over to the machine and discovers that the Nestene Consciousness has created a monstrous tentacled body for itself. The creature roars in anger and wraps its tentacles around his mouth. As the Doctor struggles with the creature's tentacles, Liz finds the trouble: a loose connection. She fixes it and uses the Doctor's machine to shut the Nestene Consciousness down.\n\nWithout the motive power of the Consciousness, the Autons collapse. The invasion is over.\n\nLiz is glad to see the Doctor is all right, but then she discovers Channing. He has been revealed to be nothing more than a sophisticated Auton and has likewise been deactivated.\n\nAt UNIT H.Q., the Doctor and Liz explain that the machine was a simple ECT (ElectroConvulsive Therapy) device. The Brigadier asks if they might attack again. The Doctor says they are telepathic so it is possible. The Brigadier floats the offer to the Doctor to let him work on a means to repair the TARDIS, while also helping UNIT stop future alien invasions. The Doctor, with misgivings, accepts the offer once Lethbridge-Stewart agrees to help him find a car and clothes similar to those he had stolen at the hospital, as well as providing him with a laboratory, equipment, and the services of Dr. Shaw. The Brigadier goes to prepare the paperwork but stops, realising that he does not even know the Doctor's name. \"Smith,\" says the Doctor, with a smile. \"Doctor John Smith!\"\n\nReleased as Doctor Who: Spearhead from Space, this release was slipped into the DVD schedule by BBC Worldwide so that a second DVD could be released in 2000. Despite this intention, the DVD was ultimately delayed until the following year.\n\nA Special Edition DVD release of this story later took place in the UK as a one disc set on 9 May 2011 as part of the Mannequin Mania alongside Terror of the Autons. It was subsequently released individually in the US the following year.\n\nSpearhead From Space was released as a Blu-ray Special Edition in July 2013. The back cover states, \"This classic Doctor Who story is the first to be upgraded into stunning HD.\" The Blu-ray was released in 1080i (or 1080p in Region A) full HD with DTS-HD Master Audio.\n\nIntended as a companion piece to the 2011 Special Edition DVD, the Blu-ray release carries none of the extras from the previous releases of this story, but does feature several newly commissioned special features, mastered in HD. The UK release features a reversible cover, matching the standard Classic Series DVD template.",
