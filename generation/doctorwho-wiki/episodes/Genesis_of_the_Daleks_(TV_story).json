  "content": "Genesis of the Daleks was the fourth and penultimate serial of season 12 of Doctor Who. It introduced Davros, creator of the Daleks, and showed the story of their origins. Davros later played a prominent role in every following Dalek serial up to Remembrance of the Daleks in 1988.\n\nGenesis of the Daleks is also notable for being the second in a run marking the only time in the classic television series that the TARDIS does not appear whatsoever for two consecutive serials.\n\nAlso notable is the fact that this is one of the only two Dalek serials in all seven years of Tom Baker's run on the show, the other being 1979's Destiny of the Daleks. This became the start of a practice throughout the classic series where most recurring enemies would see a significant reduction in the amount of encounters between them and the Doctor; the Daleks, to name an example, only starred in one televised serial during each succeeding Doctor's tenure for the remainder of the 1963-1989 run.\n\nIn a 1998 poll conducted by Doctor Who Magazine,[nb 1] Genesis of the Daleks was praised by fans as their favourite Doctor Who story of all time.[1] In 2023, despite Genesis of the Daleks ranking as the second most popular Fourth Doctor TV story behind City of Death in a poll by Doctor Who Magazine,[2] a later DWM poll that year with a shortlist of 37 finalists including the two aforementioned stories declared Genesis of the Daleks the third most popular TV story of the first 60 years of Doctor Who, followed by City of Death in eighth place.[3]\n\nIn 2020, Genesis of the Daleks became part of the Time Lord Victorious multimedia event.\n\nIntercepted while travelling between Earth and the Ark, the Fourth Doctor and his companions are transported to the planet Skaro, thousands of years in the past, on a mission for the Time Lords — to prevent the creation of the Daleks.\n\nOn a foggy battlefield, men wearing red gas masks, and armed with archaic rifles, advance out of a trench and are brutally cut down by machine gun fire. The enemy squad marches over their fallen bodies.\n\nThe Fourth Doctor walks through the cold mist, wondering why he hasn't arrived on Space Ark Nerva. Suddenly, a Time Lord messenger appears in front of him. The Doctor realises that they intercepted the transmat beam he and his companions were riding to Nerva, and points out to the Time Lord how dangerous that is. The Time Lord tells him \"We Time Lords transcended such simple mechanical devices when the Universe was less than half its present size.\" The Doctor is angry that the Time Lords are still interfering in his life, but the Time Lord explains that for the freedom they allow him they will occasionally ask for something in return. The Doctor refuses until he is told his mission involves the Daleks. The Time Lord tells the Doctor that they have foreseen that the Daleks will eventually exterminate all other life in the universe unless they're stopped. They want the Doctor to travel back to the time of their beginning to avert their creation, affect their genetic development to make them less aggressive, or find some inherent weakness in their makeup. The Doctor agrees — \"All right. Just one more time!\" — and asks the Time Lord for the space-time coordinates for Skaro, the Dalek homeworld. The Time Lord tells the Doctor that he is already on Skaro, saying \"We thought it would save time if we assumed your agreement.\" The Time Lord gives the Doctor a Time Ring that will return him to the TARDIS when his mission is complete, warning \"Be careful not to lose it. That Time Ring is your lifeline.\" The Time Lord wishes the Doctor good luck and then vanishes, leaving the Doctor calling \"Don't just disappear! What about Sarah and Harry?\"\n\nSarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan find the Doctor. As they explore the battlefield, they come across bodies equipped with a curious mix of ancient and modern equipment. The Doctor theorises that the war has been going on for a long time, perhaps a thousand years, with technology regressing as resources get more scarce.\n\nIn the distance, they see yet another sight — a protective dome large enough to cover an entire city. The trio cross the lines into another trench, where the bodies of the fallen have been propped up to make the place appear more heavily guarded. Suddenly, gas shells drop as a squad of soldiers attacks. Another door bursts open, and black-uniformed soldiers emerge, counterattacking with sub-machine guns. Having dealt with the enemy, they drag Harry and the Doctor into their bunker, leaving an unconscious Sarah behind among the dead.\n\nThe soldiers, all very young men, take the Doctor and Harry to see General Ravon, who is in his early twenties. These are the Kaleds, who are fighting a war with the Thals for dominance of Skaro. Soon, Ravon boasts, they will exterminate the Thals from the face of Skaro. The Doctor notices that \"Kaled\" is an anagram of something familiar.\n\nThe Doctor and Harry disarm Ravon, forcing him at gunpoint to take them back to the surface. However, they encounter Security Commander Nyder, who becomes suspicious and orders his men to open fire. Releasing Ravon, Harry and the Doctor run for and reach the surface, but they are soon captured by the Kaleds once more. Ravon thinks the two are Mutos, the descendants of those mutated by chemical weapons in the first century of the war and cast out into the wastelands to maintain Kaled racial purity. The Doctor tells Nyder they are aliens, but Nyder is sceptical, since the Kaleds' greatest scientist, Davros, has said there is no intelligent life on other planets:\"So either he is wrong, or you are lying. And Davros is never wrong about anything.\" Nyder takes custody of the Doctor and Harry for interrogation.\n\nSarah has regained consciousness and, unable to enter the bunker, walks into the wastelands, where she is being followed by Mutos. She stumbles across a crumbling structure and peeps through to see an old and crippled man — referred to as Davros — his lower body enclosed in what appears to be a sophisticated mobile chair that resembles the bottom half of a Dalek. The wizened, hairless figure has a withered left arm, and his eyes are both closed over, with a third, blue electronic eye on his forehead blinking as he speaks. His assistant, Gharman, sets up several man-shaped targets, and Davros flicks a switch on his chair. To Sarah's horror, a Dalek — minus its sucker arm — is revealed in a dim glow of light. Davros gives it some simple commands in a grating, half-synthesised voice, \"Exterminate!\" The Dalek fires its deadly laser weapon, obliterating the targets. Davros is pleased. \"Now we can begin...\"\n\nAfter Gharman and Davros lead the Dalek away, Sarah is taken prisoner by the Mutos. In the Kaled bunker, Nyder orders that the Doctor and Harry be scanned. The scan detects the Time Ring, which is confiscated despite the Doctor's protests. It is placed with their other belongings as they are taken to Senior Researcher Ronson for further questioning.\n\nTwo Mutos argue over Sarah's unconscious body. Gerrill notes that she is a \"Norm\", and Norms are to be killed by Muto law. However, Sevrin questions why the Mutos should always destroy beauty. Gerrill says if Sevrin doesn't kill the Norm, he will, and pulls out a knife. Sevrin tries to disarm Gerrill, and the pair fight. The fight is interrupted by a patrol of Thal soldiers, who shoot Gerrill when he fails to stop when ordered to, but take Sevrin and Sarah to the Thal Dome as slave labourers.\n\nRonson, a member of the Scientific Division, examines the results of the scan and is startled to discover that the Doctor and Harry are indeed aliens. Before he can question them further, an alarm rings; Davros is arriving, bringing with him his \"Mark III travel machine \", which the Doctor identifies to Ronson as a Dalek. The Dalek has a sucker arm but is minus its gun, which Nyder installs before Davros releases the primitive Dalek to independent control; it swivels around and pauses at the Doctor and Harry, detecting their non-Kaled physiology. It grates that they are \"aliens\" and must be exterminated, but Ronson switches the Dalek off before it can fire.\n\nDavros is furious that Ronson interceded when his creation showed a natural instinct to destroy. Ronson pleads with Davros that the prisoners might hold valuable information, and Davros relents — but warn Ronson will be punished for insubordination. They will be used when the demonstration resumes, at first light, but Ronson may question them until then. The two are taken to the cells.\n\nIn the Thal dome, Sarah discovers that the Thals have placed all their remaining resources into a rocket that they hope will bring them victory in one decisive strike. The slaves are being used to pack the rocket's nose cone with distronic explosives. To reduce the weight, no shielding is provided, which means the slaves will get distronic toxaemia and die after a few hours' exposure.\n\nThe Doctor has learned that the bunker they are in is a few miles away from the Kaled dome. Years ago, the Kaled government decided to form a scientific elite for research, but over time the elite became more and more influential. Ronson tells them that Davros has just announced that the Mark III travel machine will now be known as a Dalek, and Ronson asks how the Doctor knew this in advance.\n\nWhen the Doctor reveals that he is a time traveller, Ronson confides in him that he and a few others believe the direction of Davros' research has turned immoral and evil. The elite discovered that their race was already mutating. Davros believed that this mutation could not be reversed and began experiments to determine the Kaleds' final mutated form, developing these \"ultimate creatures\" which he will put in travel machines. Ronson believes that, if the government were told about the experiments, they would shut Davros down, but he is unable to get out of the bunker. The Doctor offers to contact the right men if Ronson helps them escape.\n\nThe first load over, Sarah and the other slaves return to their cell, exhausted. She tells them they must act before they are too weak from distronic exposure to do anything. She proposes they try to escape through the dome's exit at the top of the rocket. Overpowering their guard, the slaves rush out to the silo and start climbing, as Thal troops fire up at them. Several slaves are shot, falling to their deaths. Sarah gets into difficulties, and Sevrin urges her on. Suddenly, she loses her grip and falls, screaming...\n\nSarah lands on a lower part of the scaffolding, and is unharmed. She and Sevrin make it to the nose cone of the rocket but are caught before they can escape. Meanwhile, Ronson has helped Harry and the Doctor escape, and they make their way to the Kaled dome. Back in the bunker, Davros orders further improvements to the Dalek shell's systems.\n\nAnother scientist, Kavell, tells Ronson that the Doctor and Harry have made contact with the Kaled leadership in the dome. There, the Doctor briefs the Kaled Councillors, including one named Mogran, on future events and how the name of the Daleks will terrorise the universe for generations to come.\n\nNyder tells Davros that his spies have reported that a secret meeting between Mogran and some Councillors that oppose their work occurred in the dome with the two prisoners present. Davros tells Nyder to find out how they escaped and the details of the meeting; he will deal with Ronson in his own way. Mogran and his Councillors have decided that an independent inquiry will look into Davros's experiments, and until then, all work at the bunker will cease. If the Doctor's allegations are borne out, the project will be shut down. When they leave to tell Davros their decision, Ravon tells Harry and the Doctor that Kaled agents in the Thal dome have reported that a girl led an attempted breakout. The Kaleds know about the rocket but are unconcerned because Davros has reinforced their dome. Ravon agrees to show the Doctor and Harry how to get to the Thal dome.\n\nDavros seems to take Mogran's announcement of the inquiry well, but after they leave, he orders twenty mutants to be placed within the Dalek shells. Nyder protests that they are still unstable, but Davros replies that he will place them under a degree of computer control. He and Nyder are going on a journey.\n\nHarry and the Doctor reach the Thal dome and, while making their way through the corridors, manage to spy on a meeting between some Thals and Davros, with Nyder by his side. The Kaled chief scientist tells the Thals that he is only interested in peace. He adds that the Kaled dome is currently impenetrable but gives them a chemical formula that will weaken the dome enough for the rocket to work. All he asks is that he be allowed to help in the reconstruction of Skaro when the war is over.\n\nHarry and the Doctor continue their search for Sarah. They overpower two guards and steal their radiation suits. Entering the silo, they take care of the guard there and free the slaves. Harry, Sarah and Sevrin leave for the Kaled dome to warn them and advise an immediate offensive, while the Doctor attempts to sabotage the rocket. However, before he can do so, the guard in the silo revives and activates an electric grid, sending an electric surge through the Doctor's body, shocking him into unconsciousness...\n\nThe Doctor awakens in the control room of the Thal dome, where a video screen shows the Thal chemical bombardment of the Kaled dome. The Thal leader gives the order to start the rocket countdown. In the bunker, the Kaled scientists watch the bombardment with disbelief; who could have given the Thals the right formula?\n\nThe Thal rocket fires and blows up the Kaled dome. The Doctor ruefully observes that he sent Harry and Sarah in there. In the bunker, Davros vows \"vengeance\", beginning with the \"Thal spy\" Ronson's death. With an order of \"Exterminate!\" from Davros, Ronson is blasted down by the Daleks. Davros declares the death of the Kaled race and the rise of the Daleks as the supreme being and ultimate conqueror of the universe.\n\nThe Thal leader is jubilant that the war has ended, and orders all prisoners to be freed and charges against them dropped — including the Doctor. The Doctor, however, is melancholy. A Thal woman, Bettan, asks him if he had friends in the dome, and the Doctor replies yes. However, he intends to continue to try to stop the development of Davros's Daleks. Bettan says that Davros is a hero, despite the Doctor telling her that he only betrayed his people because they were about to stop his experiments.\n\nIn the bunker, Davros tells Gharman to implement new variations to the Dalek mutants' genetic structure. Gharman notices that this will produce mental defects, making them devoid of conscience, morality or pity. Davros calls them \"improvements\" and orders Gharman to carry out his orders without question, but Gharman is obviously disturbed by this development.\n\nUnder Davros's orders, Daleks enter the Thal dome and begin exterminating people. Bettan runs into the Doctor, and the two flee the dome. The Doctor tells her that she has to form what Thal survivors there are into a fighting force and destroy the Kaled bunker.\n\nAs the Doctor makes his way back to the bunker to retrieve the Time Ring, he is attacked by Mutos. However, he is saved by Harry, Sevrin and Sarah. It turns out they never reached the Kaled dome before its destruction, because they came under attack by Mutos halfway across the wastelands at the same time the rocket was launched. Before they return to the bunker, the Doctor asks Sevrin to join Bettan and help her organise the survivors.\n\nIn the bunker, Gharman quietly tries to convince Kavell that they have to stop the Daleks. However, they are overheard by Nyder. The Security Commander approaches Gharman and convinces him that he believes Davros has become a megalomaniac and has to be stopped. He arranges to meet Gharman in the detention rooms on the lower level where Davros never goes. There, Gharman gives Nyder the names of those who oppose Davros, which is all that he really wanted. Davros appears, and Nyder knocks Gharman unconscious. At that moment, Sarah, Harry and the Doctor emerge from the ventilation shaft right in front of the two and are captured.\n\nDavros interrogates the Doctor, who tells him why he is here. Davros asks him if the Daleks always win in the future, and the Doctor tells him that they have occasionally been defeated. Davros demands to know what mistakes the Daleks make, intending to correct them, but the Doctor refuses. Davros hooks Sarah and Harry up to his machines and tells the Doctor that if he lies or does not answer his questions, his friends will suffer...\n\nAs Davros increases the power of the torture devices, the Doctor reluctantly answers Davros's questions. Over the course of the next few hours, he gives a litany of the Daleks' defeats and why they were defeated. The first session over, Sarah and Harry are taken to the detention area, while Davros asks the Doctor to stay: \"Let us talk — not as prisoner and captor, but as men of science. There is so much I wish to know.\"\n\nThe Doctor pleads with Davros to stop the development of the Daleks. The machines are not the problem — the evil creatures inside them are. Davros says that they are merely conditioned to survive, and to do so, they must become the dominant species. When all other life is suppressed, there will be universal peace.\n\nThe Doctor asks Davros a hypothetical question: if he had invented a virus that would destroy all other forms of life on contact, would he use it? Davros considers the question and observes that the power to make that choice would elevate him above the gods, and yes, he would do it. Convinced now that Davros is mad, the Doctor seizes his arm and threatens to turn off his life support systems unless he orders the Dalek mutants destroyed. However, Nyder enters and knocks the Doctor out before Davros can give the final order.\n\nNyder takes the Doctor back to the cells, but in the meantime, Kavell has knocked out a guard and freed Sarah, Harry and Gharman. Harry, dressed as a guard, tries to stop Nyder, but he gets away. Gharman and Kavell go to organise the others against Davros, but the Doctor warns them to be careful: Davros knows what they are planning. The time travellers now have two things to retrieve: the Time Ring and the tape recording with knowledge of the future.\n\nThe Daleks in the Thal dome exterminate the last of the Thals still inside and are ordered back to the bunker. Sevrin tells Bettan that there are no more survivors except those who escaped the city. In the bunker, fighting breaks out between Gharman's and Davros's supporters, with Gharman's side gaining the upper hand. To Nyder's surprise, Davros orders him to surrender. Gharman and the rebels meet Davros and deliver their ultimatum: to destroy the Daleks and cease work on the project. Davros agrees, but he wants a meeting of both the military and scientific elite in an hour and a vote to be taken on the issue.\n\nSearching through the lockers, the Doctor finds a chunk of plastic explosive and detonators. There is one option left to him to stop the Daleks: genocide. He enters the incubator room to set up the explosives, intending to destroy the Daleks forever. As Sarah and Harry wait, the Doctor staggers out, with several embryonic Dalek mutants wrapped around his throat...\n\nWith Harry and Sarah's assistance, the Doctor frees himself from the baby Dalek's suffocating embrace. Throwing the mutants back into the room, the Time Lord picks up the wires connected to the explosive charges. All he has to do now is touch the two wires together and that is it; the Daleks will be no more. Yet at this crucial moment, the Doctor finds himself confronted with a moral dilemma. Despite Sarah's urging, the full gravity of what he is about to do causes the Doctor to wonder if he has the right to do this.\n\nSarah tries her best to talk the Doctor round. She reminds him that the Daleks are utterly ruthless killing machines of hatred and war. The Time Lords sent the TARDIS crew to Skaro for this very purpose. There might not be another chance. If the Doctor does not destroy the Daleks now, untold billions will suffer because of it.\n\nThe Doctor acknowledges that all of these statements are true, but even so, he cannot bring himself to do it. The Time Lord points out that despite their own evil, the Daleks' existence did created some good in the universe. Many worlds and civilisations who would have otherwise been enemies united because of their common fear of the Daleks. Although the Doctor indicates that he knows what will happen if he does not act, it does not change his current predicament. Right now, the Dalek race is still in its infancy. The creatures in that room are innocent beings who have committed no wrong. Aside from the ones that Davros has already activated and sent to the Thal dome, the Daleks as a species are guiltless.\n\nIf the Doctor destroys that room, then he will be knowingly and willingly committing an act of genocide. Therefore, ironically, if he wipes out the Daleks, then he will become no better than his foremost enemies.\n\nBefore he can decide what to do however, Gharman arrives. He tells the group happily that Davros has agreed to their ultimatum. Hearing this, the Doctor is grateful and relieved that he does not have to make that decision after all. As Sarah and Harry follow Gharman, the Doctor disconnects the wires and then follows. The few surviving Kaleds gather in the main conference, where Davros and Gharman make their respective cases. Whilst the Kaleds are talking, the Doctor spots their confiscated gear upon one of the tables. Moving carefully, he, Sarah and Harry subtly gather it all up, including the Time Ring. Slipping the device onto his wrist, the Doctor then says that all they need to do now is to destroy the tape recording.\n\nMeanwhile, the two Kaled leaders discuss their options. Davros goes first, stating that everything he has done was for the benefit of their kind. With the rest of their species now gone, the Daleks are both the Kaleds' future and legacy. When Gharman insists that his genetic modifications have created a totally hostile creature, Davros uses Skaro's history to validate the necessity of these changes. He then tells his detractors that if they feel so strongly about it, he has set up a solution for them. On the main terminal is a large red button, which if pressed will destroy the entire bunker, save for the room that they are currently all standing in. As he points out however, if they do this, then the Kaleds will destroy everything that they have worked for. When nobody, not even Gharman, accepts the invitation, Davros labels them all cowards.\n\nWith that, Gharman takes his turn. He declares that despite his many flaws, Davros is right about one thing; the Daleks are the future of the Kaled race. He insists however that their successors should not be genetically modified creatures conditioned to hate everything. Thus, he offers an alternative solution and a compromise to Davros' original plan. They can destroy the modified specimens and then restart the Dalek project from scratch. Although the Kaleds themselves are doomed, the Daleks can continue to exist, not as an immoral creatures of hatred, but as a creature with a conscience, emotion and the freedom to do both good and evil.\n\nHaving made their cases, Davros and Gharman tell the others to decide the future of their kind. As the others talk amongst themselves, they fail to notice Davros whispering something to Nyder. The chief scientist secretly tells his loyal enforcer to wait a few minutes and then make sure everything is ready.\n\nAs the Kaleds deliberate, Davros' Daleks re-enter the bunker en masse. Bettan and her Thal rebels successfully follow them all the way back to the hidden entrance, accompanied by Sevrin. The Kaled mutant assures the Thals that with the Kaled dome destroyed this bunker is the only remaining stronghold left and it only has one entrance. Knowing that she might not get another chance, Bettan immediately sets her forces to work, telling them to set their own explosive charges on each of the support beams. The Thals plan to cave in the entrance, letting the subsequent rockfall entomb the Daleks within their own base.\n\nSevrin however realises that doing so will also leave the TARDIS crew trapped as well. Bettan acknowledges this, but declares that she has no choice, as this may be their only opportunity to stop the Daleks forever. Despite the risks, Sevrin decides to go into the bunker to try and warn the Doctor and the others. Bettan tells him that she will buy the group what time she can, but that she will act if necessary.\n\nBack in the control room, the Kaleds finally vote. Five scientists and security officers move to Davros's side, but the rest stay next to Gharman. As Davros tries to blackmail Kravos into siding with him, reminding the young Kaled that he saved his life by creating a device to keep his heart beating, The Doctor notices Nyder slip out of the room. Suspicious, the TARDIS crew follows him. They corner the Kaled off in the hallway, with Nyder refusing to give up quietly. A small struggle ensues, during which the Time Ring is knocked from the Doctor's wrist.\n\nNyder is swiftly overpowered and the Doctor asks where he's going. Nyder tries to play innocent, stating that he is getting out whilst he still can. The group don't believe him, pointing out that he simply could have joined Gharman. With his lie exposed, the Doctor forces Nyder to take them to where the tape recording is kept. Meanwhile, Sevrin continues to search the bunker, hiding from the Daleks who seem to be heading somewhere.\n\nIn Davros' office, Nyder shows the TARDIS crew the safe where the tape is stored. He insists that only Davros knows the combination, but Harry and the Doctor quickly realise this is another attempt at deception. The Time Lord points out that Davros cannot possibly open the safe due to his condition, and therefore singles out Nyder as the only one who has to do this. Begrudgingly, Nyder fetches the recording, which the Doctor then destroys with a prototype Dalek gun Sarah finds. Unfortunately, whilst the group is distracted, Nyder escapes and seals the door, locking them inside the room. The Doctor is not concerned; they have completed their mission. The tape is destroyed, Davros' power is ended and Gharman will soon destroy the active Daleks. It is only then that they realise that the Time Ring is missing. The team searches for a way to escape, not knowing how severe their situation really is. At the front of the bunker, the Thals have nearly completed their preparations and it won't be long until they detonate the explosives.\n\nAs the Doctor and Harry try working on the door, Sarah tries fiddling with one of the control terminals. Instead of opening the door, however, she manages to access the Kaled security systems, and a large video screen gives the group a view of the main control room. To their surprise, they find that meeting is still going on even though Davros has been outvoted. Despite his apparent defeat, Davros makes one final plea to the remaining rebels, imploring them to join his side. When the \"victorious\" Gharman states that it is over, however, the chief scientist declares that he has no intention of submitting and that he will not let his life's work be ended by their interference or cowardice. As Gharman declares him insane, Davros springs his trap!\n\nDavros flicks a switch on the control panel of his chariot, and all the doors to the main control room open — revealing a Dalek framed in each and every doorway. With his enemies identified, Davros has his Daleks exterminate Gharman and his supporters en masse. The only one of Davros' followers to offer any objection is Kravos, who tries to intervene on his now dead comrades' behalf. He lunges for the controls on Davros' chair, but Nyder grabs him and throws Kravos towards his deceased comrades, resulting in the young Kaled being gunned down as well. In one move, Davros has eliminated the last remaining threat to his power, whilst showing his remaining followers what will happen to anyone who opposes him and the Daleks.\n\nSafe within the office, the horrified TARDIS crew are distracted by a commotion at the door. Fortunately, it turns out to be Sevrin, who notifies them about the Thals' intentions. Exiting the office, the Doctor quickly recovers the Time Ring. Following a close encounter with a couple of Daleks, the Time Lord gives the ring to Sarah and tells the others to get out of the bunker. Meanwhile, the Doctor says he is heading back to the incubator room. With Gharman and his forces dead, he has no choice now but to finish what he started. As the others flee in one direction, he heads off in the other direction, managing to recover his hat and coat along the way.\n\nUnfortunately for the TARDIS crew, their situation is not favourable. As Davros makes plans for his loyalists to continue with their work, he promotes the Daleks to the position of their new security and military force. When Nyder informs him about the prisoners escaping, Davros orders a full search to be carried out for them, to which the Daleks comply. Even more frighteningly, back at the entrance, the Thals have finished with their preparations. Fortunately, Sevrin, Sarah and Harry manage to make it safely out of the bunker. There, despite the Thals' reluctance, they manage to convince Bettan to delay the detonation by a few minutes until the Doctor is clear.\n\nBack at the incubator room, the Doctor manages to reset his own explosives without issue. Before he can activate them, however, a Dalek spots him and opens fire, forcing the Time Lord to take cover. He tries to reach for the wires again, but a second shot forces him back. Then as the Dalek advances, the Doctor notices the position of the wires and, realising that he doesn't need to do anything else, he flees. As the Dalek glides forward, it unknowingly brushes against the wires. This causes its metal body to act like a conductor, triggering the detonation. Therefore, both the incubator room and the Dalek are destroyed in a way that leaves the Doctor's hands clean.\n\nAt the main entrance, the Doctor's companions and the Thal rebels hear the explosion, but have no way of knowing what has happened. At that moment, one of Thals manages to hack the Kaleds' security system, allowing them to view the main conference room. When they see Davros order the Daleks to secure the main entrance, Bettan declares that their time is up. With their enemies on the way, she orders the main doors to be sealed and despite Harry's plea, reluctantly orders that the final preparations be made for detonation.\n\nOblivious to what is happening, Davros plots his next move, only to be distracted by a noise from the main terminal. Turning to the controls, he discovers that the automated Dalek production line has been started. Confused, Davros demands to know who is responsible, since he did not authorise this activation. As the Kaleds look on confused, one of the Daleks states that it gave the order. Far from being impressed by this act of self-initiative. Davros turns to face the Dalek and its two comrades. He verbally reprimands the group, reminding his creations that they serve him and respond to his commands alone. He therefore orders the line to be halted immediately.\n\nTo his astonishment, however, the three Daleks do not acknowledge him or move to comply. Davros repeats his instructions twice, but the Daleks just stare silently at him. Furious, Davros orders Nyder to shut down the production, but as his loyal henchman moves to comply, one of the Daleks opens fire without provocation. As Nyder's body slumps lifelessly to the floor, the Dalek who ordered the activation of the line states firmly \"Production will continue.\" With that, three Daleks advance threateningly upon their creator.\n\nBack at the entrance, the Thals have almost finished closing the doors. Bettan, to Sarah and Harry's distress, finally gives the order to detonate the explosives. A split-second before the Thal soldier can depress the plunger, however, Sarah spots movement and shouts for them to stop; the Doctor has finally arrived. Unfortunately, he brought company. With two Thals holding them open, Sarah and Harry barely manage to help the Doctor squeeze through the gap in the doors, causing him to narrowly avoid a fatal shot from one of the Daleks' ray guns.\n\nWith everybody now accounted for, the Thals slam the doors shut, trapping the Dalek patrol on the other side with the explosives. Bettan once again gives the order, and this time the plunger is pressed. The earth shakes violently, as the Thals, Humans, Time Lord and Kaled mutant crouch down for safety. They hear the ceiling on the other side of the doors collapse, sealing the bunker and leaving the surviving Daleks and their creators trapped inside.\n\nNoticing the video screens, the Doctor heads over to them, swiftly followed by the others. They see that the Daleks have turned upon Davros and can only watch as the scientist tries to reason with his creations. He insists that the Daleks were created to serve him and that they cannot survive without his help or guidance. However, as the Doctor and Gharman had anticipated, Davros' earlier arrogance and instructions have finally come back to haunt him. The Daleks tell their creator flat out that in accordance to their own programming, they do not acknowledge any non-Dalek creature as their superior. Despite Davros' declarations, the Daleks' new leader assures him that contrary to what he thinks, they can maintain themselves under their own power and have the ability to think of new ways to survive without any outside help.\n\nThe conversation is interrupted briefly by one of the other Daleks, who notifies everybody present about the cave-in. The Daleks are unconcerned by this, but back at the entrance Sarah asks about the incubator room. The Doctor confirms that it was destroyed, but that unfortunately this will not stop the Daleks. In the end, all the Doctor managed to do was delay the Daleks' advance into the solar system by about a thousand years or so. Before he can say anything else, Harry directs his comrades' attention back to the monitor.\n\nInside the bunker, the Daleks have now cornered all of Davros's loyalists — i.e. the last surviving remnants of the Kaled race. With nowhere to run, these unfortunate men realise too late that Gharman was right and now get to witness for themselves exactly what they have created. As one of the subordinate Daleks trains its weapon upon the terrified group, the Dalek leader proclaims that from this point onwards, the Daleks will consider all other species to be both inferior and enemies that they will destroy. Realising what they are about to do, Davros implores his creations to show some pity, pointing out that his men can use their scientific knowledge to aid and benefit the Daleks. Unfortunately in accordance with his own instructions, 'pity' is not in the Daleks' vocabulary banks. At its leaders command, the Dalek guard opens fire without a moment's hesitation, killing the very men who created them.\n\nNow the last of his kind, Davros, the man who brought the Daleks into existence makes one last attempt to reason with his creations. Clearly terrified, he screams at the Daleks that they were created to serve him and to obey. Advancing slightly, the Dalek leader makes it clear that they will not follow him or anybody else ever again. From this point onwards, the Daleks are answerable to no-one. Upon hearing this, Davros finally appears to realise that the Doctor, Gharman, and the others were right all along. Knowing that the Daleks are beyond reasoning with, he turns around and, in a last desperate act, reaches for the destruct button that he used to taunt Gharman and the rebels. Unfortunately for Davros, due to the nature of his injuries he simply cannot press the button in time.\n\nSeeing what Davros is doing, the Dalek leader grates \"Exterminate!\" There is a flash of light and Davros' screams fade into silence. With that, the Kaleds are (apparently) no more, the first race to fall victim to the Daleks' genocidal conquest.\n\nWith Davros disposed of, the Dalek who authorised the coup, the first Emperor of the Daleks turns to its subordinates (and the audience). It proclaims that despite their entombment, this is not the end for the Daleks, merely the beginning. For now, the Daleks will simply bide their time. Using the opportunity and equipment left to them by their predecessors, they will prepare themselves and grow stronger. Then, when the time is right, the Daleks will break free from their underground prison. On that day, the universe will tremble as the Daleks fulfil their ultimate destiny and become the Universe's supreme power.\n\nHaving done all that they can, the TARDIS crew and the Thal resistance say their goodbyes. Words of thanks and handshakes are exchanged, as the Thals and Sevrin take their leave. The Doctor, Harry and Sarah finally gather around and activate the Time Ring. As they are whisked away through time and space back to the TARDIS, Sarah asks the Doctor why he does not seem disappointed by his failure. As the group depart from Skaro, the Doctor tells his companions that although the Daleks will create havoc and destruction for millions of years, he is certain that out of their evil something good will also emerge.\n\nThis story was released as Doctor Who: Genesis of the Daleks.\n\nReleased as part of Doctor Who: The Collection Season 12.\n\nReleased as part of the Time Lord Victorious: Road to the Dark Times Blu-ray on 9 November 2020.",
