  "content": "Rose was the first episode of series 1 of Doctor Who.\n\nThe first story to be produced by BBC Wales, it was both the first new episode of Doctor Who since Scream of the Shalka, the first full televised adventure since The Curse of Fatal Death and the first story to be part of a regularly airing programme since Survival in 1989. It also introduced recurring supporting cast Camille Coduri as Jackie Tyler and Noel Clarke as Mickey Smith.\n\nAn immediate success, the episode set a record 10.81 million BBC One rating that bested the previous record-holder, Robot, and remained the most watched first episode for any new incarnation of the Doctor (not outdone by The Christmas Invasion, The Eleventh Hour, or Deep Breath) until it was finally toppled in 2018 by The Woman Who Fell to Earth.[1]\n\nIt is also the third-highest rated series-opener of all time, second only to Destiny of the Daleks and The Woman Who Fell to Earth.\n\nIt was the first Doctor Who story to be produced in a 16:9 widescreen format, which would remain until The Woman Who Fell to Earth was produced in 2:1. It was also the first single-episode, 45-minute story and the first 45-minute episode since Part Two of Revelation of the Daleks in 1985. Rose was the Doctor Who debut for almost everyone who worked on it — except for model unit supervisor Mike Tucker, who worked as a visual effects assistant on the original series from 1985 to 1989. Though it was not the Doctor Who debut for visual effects company, The Mill — that had actually come on The Curse of Fatal Death — it did feature the premiere of their title sequence.[2] The sequence would survive with only minor alterations until The End of Time.\n\nNarratively, it portrayed the Nestene Consciousness and Autons for the first time on television since Terror of the Autons in 1971. It also introduced a new recurring element in the form of the Shadow Proclamation, contained the first reference to the Last Great Time War, and introduced elements about Rose's character that would be directly referenced in later episodes.\n\nUnusually, the introduction of Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor in no way explained how this incarnation had come to be nor what had caused the end of his predecessor, and failed to explain much of anything about who the Doctor was. Indeed, Rose started a mild story arc surrounding the mystery — from Rose's perspective — about the Doctor's identity. New audiences would not have known until the series' final episode that the Doctor could regenerate, and wouldn't get their first glimpse of previous Doctors until two years later, in Human Nature. As for the Ninth Doctor's origins, it was oft-alluded across the next eight years that the Ninth Doctor had simply regenerated from the Eighth Doctor during the Time War, however The Name of the Doctor would introduce a previously unknown incarnation of the Doctor, whose origins are revealed in The Night of the Doctor as a retroactive \"gap\" incarnation known as the War Doctor, with the 2013 anniversary special The Day of the Doctor showing the beginning of the War Doctor's regeneration into the Ninth Doctor.\n\nVarious stories were written to coincide with this story. PROSE: UNIT's Position on The London Incident and Operation Mannequin were two narratives published on the U.N.I.T. tie-in website in 2005 to accompany the televsion story, and in 2018, Russell T Davies wrote a novelisation of the story. Later, as the global Doctor Who: Lockdown! watch-along event created by Doctor Who Magazine's Emily Cook continued with a watch-along of this story on 26 March 2020, Davies returned to the writing stool to create new content, both releasing a previously withheld 2013 short story Doctor Who and the Time War, which depicted an alternate account to the origin of this incarnation of the Doctor than what was later revealed, and a sequel entitled Revenge of the Nestene, which Davies placed as Chapter 21 of his 2018 novelisation.\n\nThis episode through to  The End Of Time of Russell's original time as showrunner all ran with the overarching theme Consequences of the Time War; all of which his successor Steven Moffat wrapped up.\n\nRose Tyler believes she is living another day of her \"ordinary\" life, but after being threatened by Autons (living plastic) controlled by the Nestene Consciousness, she meets the Ninth Doctor.\n\nRose Tyler wakes up one morning at 7 AM, gets ready for work, and kisses her mother Jackie goodbye. She gets the bus to Henrik's, the department store in central London where she works. In the evening, as the store nears closing time, Rose is about to head home when she is stopped at the door by a security guard who is holding the lottery winnings for Wilson, the chief electrician. She takes the lift down to the basement in search of him, but Wilson is nowhere to be found. Entering a large storage room to investigate a noise, Rose soon finds herself trapped when the door closes and locks on its own, and is disturbed to see a group of moving shop-window mannequins that quickly surround her and raise their arms to kill her. All of a sudden, a man takes hold of her hand and tells her to \"run!\"\n\nShe quickly obliges, and they both run to a lift whilst being pursued by the mannequins. Before the doors can close, one of the Autons reaches for them, but the man quickly pulls its arm off before it can do them any harm. On the way up, he informs Rose that the mannequins are living plastic and that Wilson is dead. When they arrive at ground level, the man holds up a bomb and tells Rose that he plans to destroy a relay device on the roof to stop the creatures. He offers a quick introduction — he is the Doctor — and tells her to run for her life.\n\nRose heeds his advice, and runs from the vicinity, carrying the plastic arm with her. Once she's at a safe distance, she watches in shock as Henrik's explodes in a huge ball of flame. Rose then returns home, running past a strange blue box, and her boyfriend Mickey Smith comes in to check on her. He eventually leaves to watch football at the pub, and is asked to take the arm with him. He throws the piece of plastic into one of the bins outside.\n\nRose wakes up at the same time the next morning, before realising that she no longer has a job to go to. Mooching around the flat while bickering with her mother, she suddenly hears a scratching noise from the cat flap, which Jackie still hasn't nailed down, and assumes it's a stray cat. She opens it up to find the Doctor, who tells her he's been tracing a signal from the plastic arm. Demanding answers, Rose invites him inside. While she makes them both coffee in the kitchen, the Doctor explores the flat and is stunned by the size of his ears when he looks in the mirror, implying he has recently regenerated. Investigating a noise from behind the sofa, he is suddenly attacked by the plastic arm. Rose believes the Doctor's strangulation to be in jest — that is, until the arm lets go of him and flies towards her instead. Thankfully, the Doctor manages to deactivate the Auton arm with his sonic screwdriver, though not after Jackie's coffee table has been smashed in the struggle. He takes the arm off her, and hastily rushes out.\n\nRose chases after him outside, demanding to know what's going on. The Doctor tells her that the living plastic is here to start a war that would overthrow and destroy the human race so that they can claim the Earth as their own. He then departs in a mysterious blue box in the estate car park, ordering her to forget about him. Rose turns away for a second; when she looks back, both the Doctor and the box have gone.\n\nRose cannot let go, and decides to use Mickey's computer to find out more about the Doctor. She tries several different keywords on search-wise.net, (just the word \"doctor\" brings up medical results, and \"doctor living plastic\" produces art results) eventually settling on \"doctor blue box\". She follows a link to whoisdoctorwho.co.uk, a website owned by a conspiracy theorist named Clive. Mickey drives her to the man's house in the suburbs, where she is invited in by his son. Out in his shed, Clive shows her images from many points in Earth's past, including the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the sinking of the Titanic and the eruption of Krakatoa - all the pictures he shows her feature the Doctor. Clive goes through the facts: \"the Doctor is a legend woven throughout history; when disaster comes, he's there.\" He believes the Doctor is an immortal alien, tells Rose he is dangerous, and that he has only one constant companion: death.\n\nMeanwhile, Mickey is waiting in his car outside when he suddenly gets distracted by a plastic wheelie bin moving forwards on its own. He gets out of the car and opens the bin, expecting to find someone playing a practical joke, only to find it completely empty. As he tries to close the lid, he finds that the plastic is stuck to his hands, and merely stretches as he tries to pull away. After a few attempts at breaking free, the bin suddenly tosses Mickey into the air and swallows him whole. Not long after, Rose returns to the car, convinced that she's wasted her time and that Clive really is just a conspiracy nut. She and Mickey decide to go out for a pizza, but what Rose doesn't realise is that her boyfriend has been swapped; replaced by a shiny, plastic duplicate...\n\nAs the two of them dine at the restaurant, the plastic Mickey begins grilling Rose about the Doctor. She is disturbed by her boyfriend's odd speech patterns, speaking as if he is somehow malfunctioning. After being interrupted twice by the offer of champagne, Mickey finally looks up from the table, only to find the Doctor standing there holding the bottle. He fires the cork at Mickey's forehead, but it is simply absorbed into his plastic skull, and Mickey spits it out. His hands morph into paddles, and he begins attacking all those around him. The Doctor briefly struggles with the duplicate and manages to pull its head off, but this barely slow the plastic Mickey down at all. Rose hits the fire alarm, and, while the other patrons evacuate, she and the Doctor are chased out of the building by a now-headless Mickey, who flips over tables in the process.\n\nThey escape to the back courtyard, and the Doctor calmly enters his little blue box. With nowhere to go, Rose follows him inside at the last second, only to rush back out again at the sight of interior. As the headless Mickey breaks its way into the courtyard, Rose runs back into the box - which is bigger on the inside. The Doctor explains that his blue box is called the TARDIS, that it's impregnable from outside forces like the plastic duplicate, and that both it and he are alien. As he wires Mickey's head into the central console, Rose wonders if her real boyfriend is dead; something the Doctor didn't even consider. Their conversation is cut short, however, when Rose points out that the head is melting, much to the Doctor's dismay; he had hoped to use it to track down the Nestene Consciousness — the entity controlling the Autons. Activating the TARDIS controls, he still manages to follow a trace of the signal, but the head is completely melted before they can find the precise location of the Consciousness.\n\nThe box lands somewhere nearby, at the edge of the River Thames, and Rose is shocked to learn that they have moved. The Doctor explains that the Nestene plans to use Earth's polluted atmosphere as a food source after losing its own planet in a war, and will need an activation signal for its invasion plans; a transmitter of some kind, very big and round. He figures it must be \"completely invisible\", but Rose identifies it instantly: the London Eye would be the perfect transmitter for the Nestene. Hand in hand, the two of them run across Westminster Bridge together, and Rose quickly spots an entrance to an underground base beneath the Eye.\n\nEntering the Nestene lair, Rose immediately notices Mickey and runs down to him; her boyfriend has been kept alive after being duplicated to maintain the copy. The Doctor, meanwhile, tries to reason with the Nestene, but the Consciousness has two of its Auton guards capture him when it detects the presence of the TARDIS, which it identifies as terrifyingly superior technology. They discover a vial of anti-plastic in the Doctor's pocket — which he had intended to use only as a last resort. The Nestene confronts its Time Lord enemy about its lost planet, and he can only respond, \"I couldn't save your world. I couldn't save any of them!\" Terrified, it decides to start the invasion ahead of schedule, sending a signal to activate the Autons.\n\nRose calls her mother to get her to go home to safety, but Jackie can't hear her through the bad reception, and continues into the Queen's Arcade mall for some late-night shopping. Much to her surprise, the shop-window dummies come to life, breaking through the windows as the bemused shoppers stare at them. Clive, who is also shopping there with his family, remarks that everything he read about was true, before he is confronted by an Auton who detaches its hand and shoots him dead in front of his wife and son.\n\nPanic ensues as the Autons start blasting, and shoppers scatter in all directions. Jackie runs outside to behold utter chaos: Autons are everywhere, bodies litter the ground, and a double-decker bus has crashed into a post-box at the end of the street and burst into flames. She takes cover behind a car, just as three bride mannequins smash their way out of the shop window behind her and raise their arms to shoot her dead.\n\nBelow the London Eye, Rose finally decides to take some initiative. She breaks free one of the chains on the wall with an axe, and swings down to the Autons, freeing the Doctor and pushing the mannequins, along with the anti-plastic, into the vat containing the Nestene Consciousness. The vial leaks the solution onto the Nestene, and the alien dies in agony. Back outside, all the Autons return to lifeless mannequins again as the transmission from the London Eye is stopped, while underground, the Nestene base starts to collapse and explode. The Doctor, Mickey and Rose board the TARDIS and, just in time, escape the destruction. Jackie looks around at the chaos, as shell-shocked survivors struggle to come to terms with what has happened.\n\nWith the Earth saved, the Doctor thanks Rose for her help and suggests she join him on his adventures; the TARDIS can go anywhere in the whole universe. Mickey, however, is not invited. Rose, much to his disappointment, refuses, feeling responsible for her mum and her boyfriend. The Doctor bids her farewell and leaves, dematerialising the box before her eyes. But as Rose prepares to help a terrified Mickey back home, she hears the TARDIS reappear behind her. The Doctor emerges once more, and tells Rose that the TARDIS can also travel in time. Without much thought, she kisses her boyfriend goodbye and runs straight into the TARDIS, to start her adventures in time and space.\n\nNote: Paul Perrot was mis-credited as Porl Perrot on the initially broadcast version of the episode.[4]",
