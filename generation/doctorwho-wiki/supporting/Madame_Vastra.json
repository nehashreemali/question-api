  "content": "Va'stra (PROSE: The Red-Eyed League [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).') of the Eastern Lands (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).) was born 65 million years before the 19th century, (AUDIO: The Cars That Ate London! [+]Jonathan Morris, Heritage 1 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019)., The Ghosts of Greenwich [+]Paul Morris, Heritage 1 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).) in the Cretaceous period. (AUDIO: Symmetry of Death [+]Dan Starkey, Rogues Gallery (The Paternoster Gang, Big Finish Productions, 2023).) She already lived in a Silurian city that stood where the human London would later be built. (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).)\n\nAs a little girl, she saw dinosaurs and learned to identify their gender, (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) though she disapproved of her kind's practice of capturing wild ones and keeping them as pets. (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).) She also studied further subjects while living on prehistoric Earth. (WC: Who Are The Silurians? [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn the 1880s, Vastra awoke during the construction of an extension of the London Underground and sought to take revenge on the innocent tunnel workers responsible for the accidental deaths of her \"sisters\". After Vastra had slaughtered five commuters, (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) the Ninth Doctor convinced her not to give in to her rage. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) At the Doctor's insistence, she ceased her attacks on the tunnel workers and instead integrated herself into humanity's Victorian culture. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nAgainst the Doctor's advice, Vastra spent some time performing as The Sensational Scaled Siren for Henry Gordon Jago, (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) and also performed in Jago's \"Monstre Gathering\". (PROSE: Madame Vastra [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) At some point, the Doctor also told her of his species, the Time Lords, sharing many secrets about them, including the Untempered Schism, the Time Vortex, their ability to regenerate (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and the fact that he was the sole survivor of the Last Great Time War. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nAfter finding lodgings above a gin palace in Cheapside, Vastra hired a young match girl (PROSE: Madame Vastra [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) named Jenny Flint as her maid, (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) after rescuing her from being molested and dragged off by a Chinese gang. She later wrote a letter to the Doctor detailing this experience to him. (PROSE: Madame Vastra [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) However, according to another account, the Doctor was present and saved Jenny's life during this initial meeting. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Vastra's relationship with Jenny eventually became romantic. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThough the Doctor claimed he was responsible for Vastra being a member of \"polite Victorian society\", Vastra claimed it was due to her saving the Queen from a Zygon plot. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).) Vastra gained the title of \"Madame\" and took up residence at Paternoster Row. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) After spending some time as a bank robber, (PROSE: Madame Vastra [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) she eventually became a detective and consultant to Scotland Yard, solving cases that they could not. (WC: Vastra Investigates: A Christmas Prequel [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Due to her proficiency in the field, some referred to her by the title of \"the Great Detective\". (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nIn 1881, Vastra visited Egypt and was mistaken for a god. On another occasion, Vastra and Jenny battled some Neomorph Cybermen in Japan. (PROSE: Madame Vastra [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She and the Doctor also encountered fairies. (COMIC: The Lost Dimension [+]George Mann, et al., Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2017).)\n\nAt the behest of Scotland Yard, she tracked down Jack the Ripper in 1888 — and ate him. Immediately thereafter, she was summoned by the Eleventh Doctor to help rescue Amy Pond and her baby, Melody, from Demons Run. Vastra agreed to join him, intent on repaying the Doctor for changing her life when they had first met. Accompanied by Jenny, Vastra arrived at Demons Run with an army of Silurian Hunters. By this point in her life, she referred to the Doctor as an \"old friend\", and a mutual respect had developed between the two.\n\nWhen the Doctor began his assault of Demons Run, he gave Vastra and Jenny the task of hijacking the control room. After unveiling himself as a disguised Headless Monk before Colonel Manton and the soldiers of the Church, Vastra and Jenny drew swords on the guards watching the monitors. They then deactivated the lighting to enable the Doctor to slink around in the dark, prompting the Church and the Headless Monks to attack each other in the disarray. This allowed Sontaran nurse Strax, a platoon of Judoon and some of Vastra's Silurian allies to subdue the soldiers.\n\nThe pair awaited the Doctor in the control room, preventing one of the guards from escaping in the meantime. When their allies finally arrived, she witnessed the enraged Doctor confront Colonel Manton and Kovarian. Shortly after, Vastra and Dorium Maldovar hacked into Kovarian's files and discovered scans of Melody's DNA, noting that Amy's child had been born with traces of Time Lord DNA.\n\nUsing her knowledge of the Time Lord biology, Vastra and the Doctor were forced to speculate as to when Amy and her husband Rory had conceived their child. The Doctor deduced that their child had been conceived on their wedding night aboard his TARDIS whilst it was traversing the Vortex, resulting in Melody inheriting Time Lord qualities. Realising that their enemies had given up too easily, Vastra and Dorium left for the main hangar to meet up with the remainder of the Doctor's army.\n\nAt this point, Headless Monks began surreptitiously slaying the Doctor's allies as they made for the TARDIS. Thanks to Lorna Bucket, Vastra and her comrades had some warning about the trap, allowing them to prepare. After Dorium was beheaded, the monks attacked. Vastra wielded both her swords with great skill and precision, effortlessly defeating any Monk who challenged her. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nTwo days after the Battle of Demons Run, Vastra and Jenny utilised alien technology found at the base to heal Strax. The two then invited him to join them in their pursuits in Victorian London, which Strax agreed to. (WC: The Battle of Demons Run: Two Days Later [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Upon returning to 1888, Strax became Vastra's butler, (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) and she and Jenny were added to the Papal Mainframe's \"most wanted\" list. (PROSE: Madame Vastra [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt some point in the next two years, (AUDIO: Till Death Us Do Part [+]Lisa McMullin, Rogues Gallery (The Paternoster Gang, Big Finish Productions, 2023).) Vastra, Jenny and Strax investigated the sightings of automated driverless electric cars. She wondered why Fabian Solak had knowledge not of this time and later found a piece of Sontaran technology in his mind. (AUDIO: The Cars That Ate London! [+]Jonathan Morris, Heritage 1 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nVastra told Jenny and Strax to have an afternoon off. This was because she was to visit Ethel Pulman about the reappearance of her dead husband, who later claimed to be a Duchess called Euphemia. She learnt that Tom Foster was behind this because he used a Malampus crystal in his camera lens placed there by his partner Stonn and the memories of the living were mixing with the dead. (AUDIO: A Photograph to Remember [+]Roy Gill, Heritage 1 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nShe decided to investigate a siting of ghosts. She questioned Bobby Harris about it and later talked to Penny Lambeth about a second ghost. She theorised after taking information from the Royal Navy that the events were related to the Greenwich Meridian. She used her psychic powers to help Neville Plumstead to undo his actions. (AUDIO: The Ghosts of Greenwich [+]Paul Morris, Heritage 1 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nShe was asked by Inspector Cotton to investigate an explosion at a restaurant before encountering a set of alien. She then became an independent adjudicator, but became annoyed. She had to chair the sessions. (AUDIO: Dining with Death [+]Dan Starkey, Heritage 2 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nShe was employed by Anna Campbell to investigate something supernatural in her house. She had to deal with Thomas Carnacki trying to hinder her investigation and that his wasn't a ghost but something else. She learnt that the house was a living being. (AUDIO: The Screaming Ceiling [+]Guy Adams, Heritage 2 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nShe didn't believe that Spring-heeled Jack had returned to London when investigating the disappearance of Jimmy. After Jenny was kidnapped, she used Strax's scanner to track her down. She learnt that Tomanu was kidnapping the people that would have died and he cured them and took them out of time. She became worried about the ancient creature that was in the Themes. (AUDIO: Spring-Heeled Jack [+]Gemma Arrowsmith, Heritage 2 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nWoken one night by Strax's snoring, Vastra and Jenny found a set of lions intruding their cellar. She wondered if there were more Sarcosuchus in the Thames, and encountered Barty Scarrity. He captured her to become a member of Albert Scarrity's freakshow. She didn't like the concept of a freakshow and how humans treated the different. She learnt that there was a prophecy involving her people. She decided to liberate the members of the freakshow and find decent employment for them. (AUDIO: Family Matters [+]Lisa McMullin, Heritage 3 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nShe didn't like being compared to Sherlock Holmes. After learning about Dudley Skelton's disappearance she thought it might be something to do with her own people. Vastra and Jenny explored a Silurian temple, but Vastra left Jenny to explore the inner sanctum. She encountered Batraxus. She took an ancient artefact back to her home for safekeeping. (AUDIO: Whatever Remains [+]Robert Valentine, Heritage 3 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nVastra was interested in different belief systems in humans. She was asked to investigate a mummy unwrapping ceremony, but soon after learnt that Skark wanted Strax and Stonn. Skark revealed to her that there were other viable Silurian hibernations cells left on the planet. She didn't like learning that Stonn had tried to augment the pigeons and other schemes he has. She started to be affected by Anura during this adventure and used some of her power to frighten the Sontarans. (AUDIO: Truth and Bone [+]Roy Gill, Heritage 3 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nShe decided to install a telegraph which caused a lot of cases. Edith Renner asked for her help and went to see the AD club. Torquil Jonas and Coltan Lewis asked her read an ancient artefact which had old high Silurian text. She realised that the text was meaningless and was only there to bind the ink to the pages, after using the bone solution again. She became possessed by Anura. (AUDIO: The Ghost Writers [+]Roy Gill, Heritage 4 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nAnura grew stronger to the point that Vastra was subsumed. Jenny was able to bring her back to her mind. She worked out that the Tenebrae were used by the Silurian priesthood to control the people and the psychic powers they had. Jenny told her to write a story in the Tractator to bind the Tenebrae again. (AUDIO: Rulers of Earth [+]Matt Fitton, Heritage 4 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nIn 1890, (AUDIO: Till Death Us Do Part [+]Lisa McMullin, Rogues Gallery (The Paternoster Gang, Big Finish Productions, 2023).) Vastra married Jenny, (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) finally making their relationship official with a wedding, though a shapeshifter took Jenny's place. The Eighth Doctor was present at their wedding, (AUDIO: Till Death Us Do Part [+]Lisa McMullin, Rogues Gallery (The Paternoster Gang, Big Finish Productions, 2023).) as was the Tenth Doctor. (AUDIO: The Martian Invasion of Planetoid 50 [+]Jonathan Barnes, Once and Future (Big Finish Productions, 2023).) The pair were not discreet about the nature of their relationship afterwards. (WC: Vastra Investigates: A Christmas Prequel [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) During this period, Vastra was also gifted a sonic screwdriver. (COMIC: The Crystal Throne [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen the Eleventh Doctor decided to retire to Victorian London (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) to cut himself off from the universe in the wake of losing Amy and Rory, he \"looked up\" Vastra and Strax, later writing about their meeting in his diary. (PROSE: The Doctor's Diary [+]Moray Laing, The Official 50th Anniversary Annual (Penguin Group, 2013). Page 9.) Vastra, Jenny and Strax would summon him multiple times for help, hoping to reignite his passion for adventure. They frequently attempted to do so by presenting him with a variety of mysteries for him to solve, but to no avail. The Doctor refused to deal with the mysteries, solemnly claiming he had \"retired\". (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) With little else to do, Vastra and her companions returned to their own investigations, which included at least one case involving identical twins, a poison undetectable to science and an ancient Egyptian curse. (WC: Vastra Investigates: A Christmas Prequel [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt some point, Vastra tracked down Silas Ruckford, who planned to assassinate Queen Victoria and cause the downfall of the British Empire by blowing up Buckingham Palace with explosives. Vastra knocked Ruckford out of his carriage which had a bomb inside, and drove the carriage to safety before escaping the explosion. When Strax caught Ruckford, Vastra questioned him on whom he was in league with to be able to carry out this act. Ruckford committed suicide when he ingested a poison. After examining Ruckford's possessions the following day, Vastra noticed that his boots had soil from an equatorial climate. Jenny pointed Vastra to a newspaper article which announced the grand opening of the Brazilian Rainforest exhibit at the Crystal Palace, which the Queen was going to attend. Vastra suspected the involvement of Lady Cornelia Basildon-Stone, the creator of the exhibit, in Ruckford's plot.\n\nThat evening, Vastra climbed the exterior of the Crystal Palace to investigate the Palace exterior, while Jenny and Strax used disused service tunnels to find a way in. She noticed the Palace had been turned into a giant greenhouse after Lady Basildon-Stone replaced the glass with panes designed to amplify sunlight. After confronting Vastra, Lady Basildon-Stone announced that she had met one of her people the previous year, a scientist who had created the genetic splicer and shown her how to operate it before she killed him. Lady Basildon-Stone used the splicer to turn the London police gathered at the Crystal Palace into human-wasp hybrids, making them her \"drones\".\n\nWhen Vastra appeared to have wounded Lady Basildon-Stone, Basildon-Stone announced the battle was lost. She turned into a wasp form and grew wings, gaining the upper hand against Vastra. She announced that she had laid eggs inside the Palace, and that by dawn, the Palace would be filled with dense, heated air and the \"drones\" and Lady Basildon-Stone's children would conquer and forge the \"new British Empire\". Vastra shattered the glass roof with her sonic screwdriver and used her grappling hook to save herself from hitting the ground. Lady Basildon-Stone caught Vastra, and began to break her spine. Meanwhile, Strax threw a grenade into the genetic splicer. This caused Lady Basildon-Stone to become human while she was still holding Vastra in the air. Vastra got to safety, while Lady Basildon-Stone fell to her death. Eventually, without the genetic splicer's power, the wasp genes became dormant in the \"drones\", and they returned to human form. The hybrid eggs had also perished. After the genetic splicer was destroyed, Vastra lamented the loss of a part of her heritage and how a device meant for healing was made into a weapon. (COMIC: The Crystal Throne [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn December 1892, Madame Vastra was contacted by Felicity Gregson due to her expertise as the Great Detective. Felicity told her about light with trailing smoke and fire that fell from the sky behind her house. She claimed that the crash site had been cleaned overnight, but she still had physical evidence to show Vastra in person. Vastra planned to meet Felicity in Ranskill Gardens, but due to being double booked at the Greek Embassy, she sent Strax instead. Unfortunately, Felicity was murdered before Vastra had a chance to inspect her evidence.\n\nAfter returning home, Vastra met with Harry, who had discovered Felicity's body in the snowman he had built with his friend Jim. While her appearance initially caused him to run out of Paternoster Row, Vastra gained his trust by saving his life with Jenny and Strax. She also paid Mr Ranskin, the man Harry worked for, to become his new guardian to ensure his protection from the people that wanted him dead. With the help of Jenny, Strax, and Harry, she discovered that Felicity's evidence had been a wisp of fog, which was actually part of an alien force that took a fog-like form and planned to invade Earth and blot out the sun. This aliens force was defeated with snow. (PROSE: Devil in the Smoke [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nBy this point, Vastra's investigative exploits were believed by Walter Simeon to have been appropriated by Arthur Conan Doyle for fictionalisation in The Strand, in which he attributed them to his character, Sherlock Holmes. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nVastra and Jenny later confronted Walter Simeon about his Institute, with Vastra discovering that Simeon was using snow which possessed a telepathic field. This allowed the snow to build itself into the form of lethal snowmen by mirroring the thoughts of people around it. She noted that it could be utilised as a terrible weapon, with Simeon casually remarking that he had plans of his own and there was nothing she could do to stop it. As he left, Vastra called after him that even if she could not stop him she knew someone who could, and Simeon replied that he was looking forward to meeting him.\n\nVastra was later visited by Clara Oswin Oswald, whom she treated with some suspicion at first. Vastra and Jenny forced Clara to participate in their \"one-word test\", where she would only be allowed to answer their questions with a single word to prove she was not lying. In doing so, Vastra contradicted herself by explaining in great detail the Doctor's now-sullen exile in London, which Clara noted. After she offered to pass a message to the Doctor, but in one word only, Clara used the word \"Pond\" — coincidentally the surname of the Doctor's former companion Amy. Impressed that Clara had figured out how to persuade the Doctor to help and convinced of her honesty, Vastra called the Time Lord and told him that Strax knew where he should begin his investigation. She then sent Strax to see if the Doctor needed any help but the Doctor sent the Sontaran away.\n\nArriving at Captain Latimer's house, Vastra quickly informed the Doctor that Simeon was causing the alien snow to spread over Latimer's estate. Meanwhile Jenny used a force field to trap the Ice Governess, who had been created from the drowned governess who had frozen in Latimer's pond a year earlier. Vastra teased the Doctor, noting how much he had missed the thrill and excitement of such adventures during his brooding.\n\nWhile the Doctor and Clara led the Ice Governess up to the roof, Vastra, Jenny and Strax remained in Latimer's office to protect him and his children. After hearing a loud thump outside, they saw Clara lying in the snow with the shattered remains of the Ice Governess around her. The Doctor arrived in the TARDIS and took Clara's body inside where Strax managed to bring her back to life. Vastra went to the Doctor and told him that Clara's injuries were severe and that she was going to die. He and Vastra then took the TARDIS to Simeon's institute, where they met Simeon in his office. After the Doctor erased the memories of Simeon's adult life with a memory worm, the Great Intelligence took control of Simeon's body and knocked Vastra to the ground before she could strike it with her sword. Simeon then attacked the Doctor but collapsed as the snow inside the giant snow globe in the office turned to rain. Simeon died and the Great Intelligence fled, having learnt to survive without a physical body.\n\nRealising that the rain was caused by the grief of the Latimer family and by Clara's tears as she lay dying, the Doctor and Vastra rushed back to the house. Strax sorrowfully informed them that Clara only had a few moments left. At Clara's funeral, and upon learning her full name — Clara Oswin Oswald — the Doctor told Vastra and Jenny that he had met Clara before and that she had died twice, causing him to believe that there was another version of her somewhere in the universe. Leaving the confused Vastra and Jenny in the graveyard, he ran to the TARDIS intending to search for her. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nIn 1893, Mr Thursday came to Vastra so she could look at a photo of his deceased brother, Edmund. Realising Edmund's eyes showed an optogram of the Doctor, the trio headed north, where Jenny infiltrated Sweetville to find the Doctor. Vastra recognised the symptoms of Edmund and others inflicted by the \"crimson horror\" as that of the red leech's poison which'd plagued her people in prehistoric times.\n\nVastra and Strax later followed after Jenny. They rescued Jenny, the Doctor and a version of Clara from the 21st century from Mrs Gillyflower's pilgrims. Before Mrs Gillyflower could launch a rocket containing red leech poison, Vastra and Jenny prevented the venom from being put in the rocket. Angered by being unable to poison the world, Mrs Gillyflower attempted to shoot the Doctor and his friends. Strax shot at Mrs Gillyflower, causing her to fall to her death. Afterwards, Mrs Gillyflower's daughter, Ada, crushed the red leech. (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhile on death row for the murder of fourteen women, Clarence DeMarco told Vastra: \"The Doctor has a secret, you know. He has one he will take to the grave. And it is discovered.\" Vastra stopped Clarence's execution until she understood what it meant and was also given the space-time co-ordinates to the Doctor's tomb on Trenzalore. Vastra held a conference call in a dream with Jenny, Strax, Clara from 2013 and Professor River Song in the Library. The call was interrupted by Jenny's murder at the hands of the Whisper Men. River woke up Vastra and Strax, keeping the link with Clara.\n\nTo get the attention of the Doctor, the Great Intelligence used the Whisper Men to take Strax, Vastra and Jenny's bodies to Trenzalore. There, Jenny was revived and River, unheard to the Intelligence, spoke the password to enter the tomb, the Doctor's name. Inside the tomb, the Intelligence entered the Doctor's timeline, the time winds shattering him into a million pieces, each echo of the Intelligence undoing every one of the Doctor's victories.\n\nJenny died in the new timeline without the Doctor, while Strax forgot his friendship with Vastra and became aggressive, forcing her to kill him. Clara reversed these effects by entering the timeline and undoing the Intelligence's changes, saving the Doctor wherever he went. The Doctor then decided to save Clara by entering his timeline himself, telling the Paternoster gang that the TARDIS could return them home with the fast return protocol if he didn't return. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAlong with Jenny and Strax, Vastra arrived at the Thames to find that a Tyrannosaurus rex had appeared in the river without explanation. She was even more surprised, however, when the beast threw up the Doctor's TARDIS. There she met the Doctor, newly regenerated into his twelfth incarnation, along with his companion Clara. She took the Doctor back to her house and used a psychic trick in order for him to sleep off his post-regeneration trauma.\n\nWhen the dinosaur was reduced to nothing more than smoke and ash through the process of spontaneous combustion that night, Vastra and Jenny began investigating nine similar murders plaguing the city. While the Doctor investigated on his own, Clara discovered a cryptic ad in a newspaper which led them to Mancini's Family Restaurant, which was being used by a group of Clockwork Droids from the 51st century as an organ-harvesting factory. Vastra waited outside the restaurant while Clara and the Doctor investigated, and when she received a distress signal from the pair, she and Jenny cut through the clockwork decoys populating the upper floors of the restaurant. They managed to get down to the droids' crashed ship, where the Doctor and Clara were being accosted by the droids' control node.\n\nTheir intervention forced the control node to flee in his escape capsule, followed closely by the Doctor, while the others fought off the advancing robots. Over time, however, they were overwhelmed and were only saved when the control node fell to his death from the escape capsule, deactivating his clockwork subordinates. Victorious, the group travelled back to Vastra's house, where Clara was reunited with the Doctor while Vastra, Jenny and Strax returned to life as normal on Paternoster Row. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nOn 12 December 1894, Scotland Yard summoned the gang to the London Zoo to investigate a mysterious green fog which was laced with temporal radiation. During this case, Vastra was devolved by the radiation into a savage ancestor of the Silurians. Jenny was able to return Vastra to normal by reminding her of their love. (PROSE: The Evolution Episode [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nNear the end of 1894, Vastra and Strax went undercover as freaks at Holmes' Travelling Carnival and Freakshow after detecting high levels of artron energy in the area. They were recognised as non-humans by Harrison Crane, a criminal with a stolen vortex manipulator who was responsible for the artron energy leakage. During a confrontation in which Crane demanded that Strax hand over Sontaran technology which could repair the vortex manipulator, Crane murdered the owner of the carnival before he himself was killed by Strax's faulty technology. With the carnival ownerless, Vastra decided to rename it Madame Vastra's Carnival Haven for the Wyrd and Unusual and have it remain a leaderless place for \"freaks\" to be safe. (PROSE: The Case of the Dissolving Man [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen Strax failed to appear for two days, Vastra left a note asking for him at the Red Tavern. Returning to the tavern with George Litefoot and Henry Gordon Jago, it was through reading the note that Strax finally realised that the pair were not Vastra and Jenny respectively as he had believed after being disorientated by Miss Multravers whom he had ultimately defeated with their assistance. (AUDIO: The Haunting [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nJenny and Vastra got annoyed at the new set of alarms Strax, and had to compensate for them electrocuting a local set of carollers. She sent her to Smallpiece's shop for alien artefacts. She entered a bidding war with Alice Ayling for a fossil from her own era, but was worried when Strax mixed up the box it contained with Jago's present. She discovered that Alice Ayling wanted her ancient plants and warned her that uncontrolled growths of the plants would cover the planet. (AUDIO: Merry Christmas, Mr Jago [+]Paul Morris, Heritage 4 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nWhen the gang investigated the Dream Doorway of Samuel Lumber, Vastra used her sonic hat-pin to seal the door. (PROSE: The Dangerous Dilemma of the Dream Doorway [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter Jenny witnessed an explosion caused by the psychic powers of three women, she quickly returned to Paternoster Row and informed Vastra and Strax. Vastra observed the Danger Thinkers from a distance and noticed that they were going in the direction of the Houses of Parliament and that they had the power to read minds. Using these two facts, Vastra formulated a plan to defeat them. She had the gang hide in the entrance to Parliament and think thoughts that would confuse the Danger Thinkers. Vastra mentally recited Silurian poetry composed of mathematical equations and optical illusions. Combined with Jenny's regular poetry and Strax's thoughts of military training, Vastra mentally attacked the Danger Thinkers and knocked them unconscious. (PROSE: The Insidious Ideas of the Danger Thinkers [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt some point, the Twelfth Doctor's collection of vortex energy from London accidentally activated the reanimation unit of a Silurian hibernation facility under Hyde Park. The warlike Triad of the group, who were familiar with Vastra of old, reached the surface via an access point in Hyde Park and loosed a Tyrannosaurus rex in London, as well as capturing three humans to turn them into carriers for the Silurian plague. However, after she confronted them with the Doctor and failed to convince them to try for peace, Vastra took them by surprise by using her tongue to stun them. She then took them back into the facility and activated the tunnel auto sealer and hibernation circuits, ensuring they wouldn't accidentally reemerge. (GAME: Lost in Time [+]Doctor Who video games (Eastside Games, 2022).)\n\nIn 1899, Isabel de Bobadilla came to ask her to investigate a uniquely interesting artefact that was being transported through London from Cuba. Having read of Winston Churchill's exploits in Cuba she asked for his advice. She later consulted an antiques salesman and found out that the Doctor was also investigating. She asked the Paternoster Irregulars to locate the Doctor and learnt from him that he was trying to find an alien pearl. Tracing it to Luis Ortega, she had to use her Silurian powers to help them escape. (AUDIO: Young Winston [+]Paul Morris, The Churchill Years: Volume Two (The Churchill Years, Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nAfter Jenny died of old age, Vastra tried to \"ignore the pain\" and \"press on as if it were no great injury\", but continued to mourn her wife well into the 21st century, describing her pain as like \"a scar that [would] ache when it [got] cold in the dark.\" (AUDIO: Requiem [+]Àjoké Ibironke and Juno Dawson, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).)\n\nBy 2022, Vastra, under the alias of \"Requiem\", ran the Requiem Group, an online support group for people who had lost somebody. During meetings, she kept her camera turned off, as to not scare the participants. Cleo Proctor and Shawna Thompson attended one of the meetings after Cleo's brother, Jordan was redacted. (AUDIO: Requiem [+]Àjoké Ibironke and Juno Dawson, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).) Through the meeting, Vastra was able to track down Cleo and Shawana's location, and followed them when they went to the Powell Estate. There, she saved them from the ghosts by throwing a chair out of the window of the flat Cleo and Jordan grew up in. (AUDIO: Ghosts [+]Doris V Sutherland, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).)\n\nOnce the events of the Redacted were over, Vastra sent The Floater to Cleo (AUDIO: Salvation [+]Juno Dawson, Redacted (BBC Sounds, 2022).)\n\nAs one of the people that she had met during her travels with the Doctor, Vastra was included in a series of notes written by Clara when she was planning to confess to Danny Pink via phone call about her adventures with the Doctor. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nShortly before regenerating, the Twelfth Doctor dreamt of Vastra along with some of his other companions. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nWhile she shared some of the prejudices of many Silurians against humans, referring to them as \"apes\", sometimes threatening to eat them, and saying that all mammals \"look alike\", Vastra was much more tolerant and accepting of humans than many of her species. She apologised for her remarks about humans to Jenny and showed concern for the safety of the infant Melody. Vastra also showed suspicion when visited by Clara Oswald. However, she quickly warmed to Clara and was impressed when she was able to get the Doctor to return to save the world with a single word, something that Vastra, Jenny and Strax had been trying to do for a long time. When Clara was mortally wounded, Vastra showed concern and sorrow and later attended her funeral after she died. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nVastra was very honest, brutally so at times, and was determined to ensure the honesty of those in her company as well. She told Clara that the truth could be said in one word, whilst lies were just a string of words. She sometimes used the \"One word test\" to ensure that people were telling the truth. When Clara fell from a cloud, Vastra was sorrowful but bluntly stated that she was dead, despite the impact the pronouncement would have on the Latimer family, who had all been very fond of her. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) Her desire to ensure the honesty of others was also shown when she said she rather thought the Doctor meant it when he said he had retired. (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nHowever, despite her usually calm and collected nature, Vastra's resolve had one weakness - her wife's well-being. The normally composed Silurian openly wept over Jenny's lifeless body, and threatened to kill her friend and comrade Strax if he could not revive her. Later, Vastra was quick to defend Jenny from the advancing Doctor Simeon and his Whisper Men. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nShe was very loyal and protective, ordering her allies to protect Melody Pond at all costs. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Vastra was an old friend of the Doctor and seemed to know him well. However, although she supported the Time Lord, she disagreed with his decision to stay out of the affairs of the universe. Although she understood that he was heartbroken and told Jenny that such tragedy affected everyone, she also felt that he had spent too much time sulking on his cloud and was therefore delighted when the Doctor returned to save the world. (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) Vastra had a lot of faith in the Doctor, claiming to the Great Intelligence that he had been \"many things, but never blood-soaked\". Even after the Intelligence disputed this claim by listing people the Doctor had fought or killed, as well as terrible names the Time Lord would have by the end of his life, Vastra dismissed it, not believing that any of it was true. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhen Vastra got bored, she enjoyed eating comfort food in the form of local human criminals. (PROSE: The Singular Case of the Blue Men of the Minch [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Despite her taste in comfort food, Vastra could control her darker urges, and she spared two men when she and Jenny were helping the Doctor despite commenting she was hungry. She poisoned one of them with her venom, but this was only to stop him from calling for help. When her sisters died in hibernation, Vastra was enraged, but with the Doctor's help she controlled her anger and did not seek further revenge on the humans who had awakened her. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nVastra showed a considerable understanding of time and space and even the Time Lords themselves, knowing about the Untempered Schism, regeneration, and even how the Time Lords became what they were through prolonged exposure to the Time Vortex. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War) She also believed that the universe did not make bargains, but was less sure when the Doctor gleefully told her that Clara was still alive in another era after her death. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nVastra was a fierce warrior who wielded two swords in combat. She held her own against a group of Headless Monks, surviving without any apparent injury. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) As she grew older however, Vastra's reflexes may have slowed down slightly; she was quickly tossed aside by Walter Simeon when he was possessed by the Great Intelligence. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nEvidently a member of the Silurian branch found in Wales, Vastra lacked the third eye common amongst other Silurians and also had the ability to extend her tongue over a long distance. This tongue was laced with a nasty venom, but it was not necessarily fatal. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nVastra was also well known for her exceptional skills as a detective. Indeed, her skills were so renowned that the adventures of Sherlock Holmes were believed to be based on her and Jenny's exploits. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nShe had experience with telepathy, being able to trick the Doctor into \"assisting\" with \"her\" sleep problems, and bouncing the help back at him. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She also knew enough of telepathic fields to recognise potential danger when she saw it. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nVastra was able to speak with a Scottish accent. The newly regenerated Twelfth Doctor, who found himself with a Scottish accent in this incarnation, found solace in being able to understand Vastra when she did so. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nSince their appearance, Vastra and Jenny have become quite popular among fans, with many wishing for a spin-off series based on their adventures. Steven Moffat addressed this, saying he considered a spin-off when he created the two characters, but would not have the time, though he would like to revisit them.[1] Since their debut, Vastra, Jenny - and Strax - have returned for four additional episodes and three minisodes. Although no television spinoff materialised, they did receive their own short story series in the Doctor Who Adventures magazine called The Paternoster Gang Investigates and later The Paternoster Gang from Big Finish Productions.",
