  "content": "Life in the Victorian Era seemed to agree with Strax. He often went to Glasgow on his time off to pick fights; he found his opponents \"pleasant primitives\" and enjoyed their company.\n\nStrax was born to a Sontaran clone batch. According to the Eleventh Doctor, Strax was the middle child of batch of 6 million Sontaran clones. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) Strax himself claimed to come from a batch of over 10,000 identical Sontarans. (AUDIO: The Cars That Ate London! [+]Jonathan Morris, Heritage 1 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).) On another occasion, he instead claimed to be one of 600 million in his batch (AUDIO: Dining with Death [+]Dan Starkey, Heritage 2 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).) and on a third he claimed that he was \"one of ten billion\" siblings. (AUDIO: Family Matters [+]Lisa McMullin, Heritage 3 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nUpon his birth in the cloning tank, Strax was immediately sent into battle in a drop pod. En route, he was briefed by the Subliminal Education Matrix. As his pod landed on the battlefield, the newborn Sontaran finished absorbing vital information on the many enemies of the Sontarans as he received the name of Strax. (PROSE: A Soldier's Education [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) His \"real name\" was a long serial number. (AUDIO: The Cars That Ate London! [+]Jonathan Morris, Heritage 1 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019)., PROSE: A Soldier's Education [+]Dave Rudden, Twelve Angels Weeping (2018).) His eyesight was superior to those in his clone batch and he consistently outscored them in marksmanship. (PROSE: The Giant's Heart [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nStrax was put through military training on many hostile planets. (PROSE: The Insidious Ideas of the Danger Thinkers [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW. Strax once waited with his command group on an asteroid for 17 star cycles before their quarry came in the form of a Rutan ship which Strax destroyed in an \"honourable kill\", emerging as the only survivor. (AUDIO: The Haunting [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt some point prior to 1819, the Eleventh Doctor seemed to have saved Strax who was stranded on Earth. The Doctor seemingly informed him of the debt that was now owed and told Strax that he had work for him. This encounter appeared to have been fictionalised as a unique version of the nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty, which was printed in the 1819 book Mrs Molbury's Collected Rhymes Both Ancient and Modern. (Waving Through Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor did indeed call upon those indebted to him to aid him in the Battle of Demons Run. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nLater, the Eleventh Doctor met with Strax for a game of mini-golf on Bouken and apparently won all three games. He later returned with Amy Pond while searching for his sonic screwdriver as Strax stood at the door of the TARDIS, waving his golf club at the Doctor. (COMIC: Sonic Sleuth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nLater in life, Strax, rather unwillingly, became a nurse, with him claiming it was to restore the honour of his clone batch, (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) who had been disgraced in combat. (PROSE: The Case of the Dissolving Man [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn the year 4037, Strax was tending to human soldiers at the Battle of Zaruthstra when he was summoned by the Doctor to help in the mission to rescue Amy and her baby at Demons Run, which offered him a chance to once again experience the pleasure of battle. He was seriously wounded in the battle with the Headless monks when one struck him from behind with its sword. As he struggled with what he believed to be his last breaths, Strax noted how he had once longed to die in combat, but now he didn't find it as enjoyable as he had thought it would be. Rory tried to comfort him, saying he was sure he would recover, but Strax reminded Rory that he was a nurse, too. However, he admitted that he had had a good life, and was pleased to live nearly twelve years. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nFollowing his death, Strax was brought back to life (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) by Jenny Flint and Madame Vastra, However, at the precise instant he regained consciousness at Demons Run — two days after sustaining his fatal injuries — Jenny de-emphasised the severity of his wounds by telling Strax that he had just fainted. This annoyed the Sontaran who had wanted to have the glory of dying in battle. The Victorian couple then offered to take him home with them to 1888 London. At first he declined, but quickly changed his mind. (WC: The Battle of Demons Run: Two Days Later [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHe went on to assist Madame Vastra and Jenny in Victorian London as part of the Paternoster Gang of investigators. (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014)., WC: Vastra Investigates: A Christmas Prequel [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nStrax and the Doctor attended yearly intergalactic pub crawls spanning ten constellations together.\n\nThe Doctor took Strax to Amy and Rory's house for breakfast one morning before one of their pub crawls and Amy suggested Rory go with them as a bonding experience. They went to pubs on Karfel, Metebelis III, Pondula, and Argolis. (COMIC: Time Gentlemen, Please! [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nLater he attempted to host a party in Amy and Rory's house. (COMIC: Love Thy Neighbor [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAt some point, Strax had knocked out and captured Silas Ruckford after Vastra had thwarted his plan to blow up Buckingham Palace. Vastra questioned Ruckford on whom he was in league with to be able to carry out this act. Ruckford committed suicide when he ingested a poison. The following night, after Vastra believed Lady Cornelia Basildon-Stone was behind the attack, Vastra climbed the outside of the Crystal Palace, where Lady Basildon-Stone's rainforest exhibition was set to open. Meanwhile, Tommy Corrigan, one of the workers at the Palace, showed Strax and Jenny a secret way into the Palace via a disused service tunnel. The Sikh warrior Ajeeth used a form of gas from the genetic splicer to turn the police on guard at the Palace into human-wasp hybrids to serve Lady Basildon-Stone as her \"drones\". After Jenny killed Ajeeth, saving Strax' life, Jenny, Strax and Tommy followed the pipes that had released the gas into the boiler room. Upon realising the boiler was in fact holographic camouflage which hid a more advanced machine, the genetic splicer, Strax used a device to deactivate the camouflage and subsequently switched off the machine by throwing a grenade into it. Lady Basildon-Stone's plan to become queen and forge a new empire failed; she fell to the ground and died, and her hybrid eggs subsequently perished. (COMIC: The Crystal Throne [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn an undetermined year in December, Strax was sent to the Ranskill Gardens to meet with Felicity Gregson, a woman who claimed to have evidence of a strange crash behind her house a few nights earlier, whom Madame Vastra was unable to meet with due to her appearance at the Russian embassy. Instead, he ran into Harry, who claimed to have found a woman in his snowman who died. He brought Harry back to Paternoster Row to tell his account to Madame Vastra.\n\nDespite his remarks about Moonites and his belief that they were in alliance with the Rutan Host, Strax showed his tactical expertise on many occasions, such as having built a secret exit inside Vastra's internal chamber, allowing them to escape the fog-like alien creature who was after Harry. He also showed his brute physical strength on several occasions to protect Harry, Jenny, and Vastra. He was eventually put in charge of protecting Harry while Vastra and Jenny fought the fog-like alien invader and discovered that the creature could be killed with snow, which allowed him to save both Harry, Madame Vastra, and Jenny. By the end he'd taken a liking to Harry and offered to recommend him to the Sontaran Greater Military Academy. (PROSE: Devil in the Smoke [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nDuring the Doctor's retirement in Victorian London, (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) the Doctor \"looked up\" Vastra and Strax, later writing about their meeting in his diary. (PROSE: The Doctor's Diary [+]Moray Laing, The Official 50th Anniversary Annual (Penguin Group, 2013). Page 9.) Strax, along with Vastra and Jenny, would frequently seek him out with the hope to reignite his passion for adventure. They frequently attempted to do so by presenting him with a variety mysteries for him to solve, most of which were unimportant or mediocre. By this time, Strax had, much to Vastra and Jenny's annoyance, declared war on the Moon, believing it had stayed in the sky unmonitored for too long and had gained an \"enormous tactical advantage\". When the Doctor bluntly told them he had retired, Strax blamed the Moon. (TV: The Great Detective [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Children in Need Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nStrax was later accompanying the Doctor when he met Clara Oswald. After the Doctor locked Clara in his carriage, Strax tried to persuade him to examine the alien snow that was falling around London. The Doctor, still grieving for the losses of Amy Pond and Rory Williams, refused to get involved and ordered Strax to get a memory worm to erase the last hour of Clara's memory. Strax forgot to put gauntlets on twice and the amused Clara passed them to the Doctor, who retrieved the memory worm himself and put it in a jar. A snowman burst from the snow and attacked the Doctor and Clara followed by several more. They melted when Clara pictured them doing so as the Doctor realised that they were feeding off her thoughts. He then told Strax to take Clara back to the pub where the Doctor had found her, having decided not to wipe her memory because if he did she would forget how to protect herself from the snowmen.\n\nStrax later met Clara when she visited Vastra in order to find out more about the Doctor. After threatening her with obliteration he politely asked for her coat and left Clara with Vastra and Jenny. After Clara persuaded the Doctor to get involved with the word \"Pond\" Strax went to see if the Time Lord needed any help. The Doctor sent him away after insulting his intelligence but Strax teased him by calling him \"Sherlock Holmes\".\n\nStrax was later involved in protecting Latimer and his two children when Walter Simeon arrived with a group of snowmen. He displayed his combat expertise by recognising that the Snowmen were in a defence formation and choosing the most defendable area to make their stand which was Latimer's office. When Clara fell to her death from a cloud, Strax used some alien technology to revive her. After the Doctor and Vastra defeated Simeon and the Great Intelligence, Strax sorrowfully informed them that Clara only had moments left. The Doctor lost another companion that night, but on the day of her funeral he realised that another version of her was living in another part of the universe and rushed off to find her. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nIn 1893, Mr Thursday came to Vastra so she could look at a photo of his deceased brother, Edmund. Realising Edmund's eyes showed an optogram of the Doctor, the trio headed north, where Jenny infiltrated Sweetville to find the Doctor. Vastra recognised the symptoms of Edmund and others inflicted by the \"crimson horror\" as that of the repulsive red leech's poison.\n\nGetting lost, Strax asked for the help of the young boy, Thomas Thomas to find Jenny in Sweetville. Strax and Vastra rescued Jenny, the Doctor and a version of Clara from the 21st century from Mrs Gillyflower's pilgrims. Vastra told Strax to leave so he could calm down from the sherbet fancies he ate. Noticing the smokeless chimney at the match factory light up, Strax and Thomas climbed the chimney, which was actually a rocket silo. Seeing his friends threatened by Mrs Gillyflower, Strax shot at her, causing her to fall to her death. Afterwards, Mrs Gillyflower's daughter, Ada crushed the leech Mrs Gillyflower was feeding off of, Mr Sweet. (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nOn a weekend off in Glasgow trying to \"destroy\" the humans there, Strax received a letter from Vastra inviting him to a conference call in a dream along with Jenny, the Clara from 2013 and Professor River Song in the Library. He asked Archie to knock him out to get there. Vastra showed that the murderer, Clarence DeMarco had said \"The Doctor has a secret, you know. He has one he will take to the grave. And it is discovered.\" along with the space-time co-ordinates to Trenzalore, where his tomb was. The call was interrupted by Jenny's murder at the hands of the Whisper Men. River woke up Vastra and Strax, keeping the link with Clara. To get the attention of the Doctor, the Great Intelligence used the Whisper Men to take Strax, Vastra and Jenny's body to Trenzalore. Jenny was revived and River, unheard to the Intelligence, spoke the password to enter the tomb, the Doctor's name. Inside the tomb, the Intelligence entered the Doctor's timeline, the time winds shattering him into a million pieces, each echo of the Intelligence undoing every one of the Doctor's victories.\n\nJenny died in the new timeline without the Doctor, while Strax had forgotten his friendship with Vastra and became aggressive, forcing her to kill him. Clara reversed these effects by entering the timeline after the Intelligence, saving the Doctor wherever he went. Strax was revived and apologised for his attack on Vastra who forgave him, knowing it wasn't his fault. The Doctor then decided to save Clara by entering his timeline himself, telling the Paternoster gang that the TARDIS could return them home with the fast return protocol if he didn't return. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nStrax arrived at the Thames, along with Vastra and Jenny, to discover a Tyrannosaurus rex had inexplicably arrived in the river. He was surprised, moreover, when the beast threw up the Doctor's TARDIS. There he encountered the Doctor, newly regenerated into his twelfth incarnation, as well as his companion, Clara. Strax led the Doctor back to Vastra and Jenny's house, where he served as a butler, where the others attempted to get the Doctor to sleep off his post-regeneration trauma.\n\nStrax led the rest of the Paternoster Gang to the river again that night, where they discovered that the dinosaur had been reduced to nothing more than smoke and ash through the process of \"spontaneous combustion\". Vastra, along with the Doctor, took on the case and began investigating several similar deaths that had been plaguing the city. Soon enough, Clara discovered a cryptic ad in a newspaper that led them to Mancini's Family Restaurant, which served as an organ-harvesting factory for a group of Clockwork Droids from the 51st century who had crashed on Earth millions of years before.\n\nClara and the Doctor investigated the restaurant alone, with Strax, Vastra and Jenny waiting outside for Clara's distress signal. Upon receiving it, the gang cut through the clockwork decoys populating the ground floor of the restaurant and descended into the belly of the droids' crashed ship, where the Doctor and his companion were being accosted by the droids' control node. Their surprise arrival forced the control node to flee, followed closely by the Doctor, in his escape capsule. Meanwhile, Strax and the others fought off the other clockwork droids, only to eventually find themselves overwhelmed and surrounded. They defended themselves by holding their collective breaths, causing the droids to mistake them for fellow droids.\n\nFearing that he could no longer hold his breath, Strax turned his gun onto himself, willing to sacrifice his own life rather than risk that of his friends. Vastra stopped him, managing to prevent his death but placing the quartet (including herself) in danger again. However, before the group could be killed, the droids were deactivated due to the death of their control node. Victorious, Strax and the others returned home, where Clara was reunited with the Doctor and Strax, Vastra and Jenny returned to life as normal on Paternoster Row. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nHe began an independent investigation to the death of one of his friends, Rick Bellamy, whom he believed should be avenged. Strax admired him for his hard attitude towards life. Rick had been a bare-knuckle boxer, and had often fought with Strax for fun.\n\nHe along with Jenny Flint and Vastra assisted the Twelfth Doctor in stopping an arms dealer known as Orestes Milton.\n\nHe additionally believed his time with the Paternoster Gang to be temporary. (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 1893, Strax helped Vastra and Jenny corner a thief in the kitchen of the Monte Carlo Casino. When the thief opened up a portal, Strax jumped in after him and landed in 1544, in the middle of the royal court of King Henry VIII. Vastra forced him to kneel before the King against his will. He learned that the thief was Lord Volta, a time traveller employed by the King. When Vastra refused Henry VIII's proposal of marriage, Strax believed the King would seek vengeance and earnestly proposed to the King instead. Strax's offer of marriage enraged Henry VIII, but Jenny activated Lord Volta's time travel device before Henry VIII's guards could capture and behead Strax. After returning to 1893 and allowing the local police to arrest Volta, Strax sent field report #D006/B to Sontar regarding the events. (PROSE: The Tudor Engagement [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn February 1894, Strax began picking up strange noises on his internal comms unit. When the gang was called into the Royal Observatory by William Christie, Strax learned that the noises had been caused by Gremlins which had moved into the observatory. Vastra and Jenny did most of the work in dealing with the Gremlins. (PROSE: The Curious Case of the Miniature Menaces [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nStrax travelled to Scotland with Jenny and Vastra to investigate mysterious blue Minch men. (PROSE: The Singular Case of the Blue Men of the Minch [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn June 1894, Strax went undercover as a performer at the Palace of Wonder to solve the mystery of the phantom that seemed to be haunting the music house. He was pleased to don his Sontaran uniform for the audience. (PROSE: The Phantom of the Music Hall [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nDuring September 1894, Strax went to the Academy of Science with Vastra and Jenny to help guard a time machine at the request of the Prime Minister. (PROSE: The Singular Case of the Time Machine [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nVastra, Jenny and Strax investigated the sightings of automated driverless electric cars. He helped to get into Fabian Solak's factory. He started a strike. (AUDIO: The Cars That Ate London! [+]Jonathan Morris, Heritage 1 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nVastra told Jenny and Strax to have an afternoon off. During this she and Strax viewed an exhibition of spirit photographs, and detected that they weren't forgeries. He helped to fight off the Revenants with Vella when they attacked the photo studio. (AUDIO: A Photograph to Remember [+]Roy Gill, Heritage 1 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nAround this time, Strax was nearly eighteen years of age. He told Jenny and Vastra about the ghost his friend Smallpiece. He was prematurely aged by Neville Plumstead. His youth was returned to him after Vastra convinced Plumstead of the truth. (AUDIO: The Ghosts of Greenwich [+]Paul Morris, Heritage 1 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nHe was annoyed when Vastra asked him to cater and look after the guests at a peace conference. He used a set of Robot Crabs to help to do this. He became very annoyed at his guests demands. (AUDIO: Dining with Death [+]Dan Starkey, Heritage 2 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nHe wanted to kill the ghosts at Castle Kraighten despite it being impossible. He tried to master the game of billiards but destroyed the table in the process. He decided to physically attack the strange apparition and was swallowed by it. (AUDIO: The Screaming Ceiling [+]Guy Adams, Heritage 2 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nAs part of an investigation in Spring-heeled Jack he went across the roofs to find more information, and discovered more after chimney-sweeping. He learnt that the figure disappeared down river. He later talked to the fishermen if there was something strange in the river, and discovered it but was attacked by it. (AUDIO: Spring-Heeled Jack [+]Gemma Arrowsmith, Heritage 2 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2019).)\n\nHe looked after Marjorie when he discovered that she was ill. He helped Jenny discover why Miriam Scarrity came to the house and went with her to her parents' freakshow where they helped Vastra release the members of the show. (AUDIO: Family Matters [+]Lisa McMullin, Heritage 3 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nHe decided to only pack weapons for a trip to Lullwind Cove. He didn't like Sheba Slinger's being attracted to him. Strax and Jenny encountered one of the temple's guardian dinosaurs before falling down a hole. (AUDIO: Whatever Remains [+]Robert Valentine, Heritage 3 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nHe liked reading penny dreadfuls which Vastra didn't like. He discovered that Skark was after him. He wondered if they shouldn't be attacking their fellow Sontarans. He wanted to find weapons and went to find some. He was persuaded to go back to Skark. (AUDIO: Truth and Bone [+]Roy Gill, Heritage 3 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nStrax installed a set of new security systems, after a spate of small petty crimes, one of which incapacitated a set of carollers. He met Henry Gordon Jago on the way to collect more alien artefacts. He bought Jago a present but got it confused with Vastra's new artefact causing an ancient pest to reawaken and multiply. He activated the defences barricading him and Jago in the drawing room, which they had to escape in the dumb waiter. He flooded the the cellar with Acid. (AUDIO: Merry Christmas, Mr Jago [+]Paul Morris, Heritage 4 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nHe went with Jenny to investigate the sighting of mythical creatures. He was affected by a Mermaid siren calls, but exploded her. He later devised ways of capturing more creatures. He used technology stolen by Skark to identify the substance the creatures were made from. (AUDIO: The Ghost Writers [+]Roy Gill, Heritage 4 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nStrax and Jenny were captured and imprisoned by Vella who told them Vastra was no more, but she freed them to help in her plans. He was to stop the oil of Franz Albrecht Stuart from entering the country. He stunned Vella to stop the situation. He then fixed the lights of London. (AUDIO: Rulers of Earth [+]Matt Fitton, Heritage 4 (The Paternoster Gang: Heritage, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nIn November 1894, Strax secretly experimented with his fighting drone. Unbeknownst to him, the fighting drone began roaming Paternoster Row and copying residents of the street with its hologram. On 15 November the drone attacked Jenny and nearly killed her before its battery died. Strax had to repair the damage his drone caused Mrs Fenwick's house and care for her and her bunions because the drone scared her so badly. (PROSE: The Spectre of Paternoster Row [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn 12 December 1894, Scotland Yard summoned the gang to the London Zoo to investigate a fog laced with temporal radiation caused by a crashed timeship. While the fog devolved every other other animal that touched it, Strax was unaffected due to the lack of evolution in his clone heritage. He ventured into the fog and dealt with the timeship. (PROSE: The Evolution Episode [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn the summer of 1897, Strax accompanied Vastra and Jenny to the Tower of London to guard the Giant's Heart. He encountered the Doctor, who replaced the Giant's Heart with a different gem to be set into the royal crown. (PROSE: The Giant's Heart [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHe taught at Missy's boarding school in Scotland, posing as Mr Strakie with a lesson about how to weaponise each countries exports. According to Oliver Davis he was a geography teacher. Lucy Davis brought him onboard as part of his investigation. He asked Jenny and Vastra to get Mr Cosmo out of the British Museum. (AUDIO: Brimstone and Terror [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter a disorienting attack by an alien construct called \"Mrs Multravers\", Strax became confused enough to think that Henry Gordon Jago and Professor George Litefoot who found him were Vastra and Jenny. Together, Jago, Litefoot and Strax were able to stop the alien threat. (AUDIO: The Haunting [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThrough unknown circumstances, Strax came to befriend a time-travelling shark which he named the Time Shark. When Jenny's cat Mittens got stuck in a tree, Strax rode the Time Shark back to when the tree was planted and stopped the tree from ever existing. Jenny asked Strax to buy a pineapple, so he rode the Time Shark to a market and got one.\n\nOn one occasion, Strax found a mouse in Paternoster Row's kitchen and asked Vastra if he could decimate it, but she refused to let him do it.\n\nStrax rode the Time Shark to the year 2016 and encountered a boy blocking his way on the pavement. He learned that the boy was afraid of some bullies and decided to help the boy. Strax let the boy ride the shark with him and scare the bullies.\n\nStrax captured a Weeping Angel for the Sontaran Empire and sent a message to Sontar detailing that he would remove the need to blink by keeping his eyes closed.\n\nStrax met up with the Twelfth Doctor and Dorium Maldovar to play bowling on a jungle planet. While the Doctor used Dorium as a ball, Strax curled into a ball and used himself. He had the Time Shark launch him forward with its tail. Strax broke all of the pins and the game ended before the Doctor got a turn. The Doctor then took Strax and the Time Shark with him in the TARDIS to save the universe, but they got distracted in the TARDIS wardrobe.\n\nStrax and the shark attended a wrestling match and - after being summoned to the Middle Ages by a carpenter - accidentally created King Arthur's round table. (COMIC: The Adventures of Strax & the Time Shark [+]Grant Perkins, Panini UK (2016-2017).)\n\nStrax generally displayed traits that were normal for a Sontaran, such as a willingness to die in battle and a love of fighting. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) He had some prejudices against other species: he once called Vastra a \"ridiculous reptile\". (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Despite being demoted to nurse at some point in his life, Strax was still a fierce warrior who was willing to face overwhelming odds without hesitation or fear. An example of this trait was when he and several of the Doctor's allies were outnumbered by the Headless Monks yet fought valiantly against them. He also showed a willingness to kill people he had once helped; for example after healing a human boy he told him that he hoped to one day defeat him in mortal combat. However he did not do so in a malicious way, but more out of respect. Strax also had a tendency to \"compliment\" people by telling them how much he would enjoy destroying them in battle. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011)., WC: The Battle of Demons Run: Two Days Later [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHe was unable to distinguish one human from another, and had no concept of binary gender, mistaking both Jenny and Clara for boys. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., COMIC: Timeliney Wimey [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Eleventh Doctor said, of Strax, that \"two genders is a bit further than he can count\". (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) Upon meeting Henry Gordon Jago and Professor Litefoot, Strax mistook them for Madame Vastra and Jenny. (AUDIO: The Haunting [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) He believed Madame was a rank. (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nStrax's dedication to duty and warrior's honour was cast into sharp focus during battle with the Clockwork Droids, wherein he was prepared to commit suicide and prolong the lives of his companions, rather than taking a breath and risking their collective demise. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nStrax did not tolerate what he believed was incompetence from livestock, even if they weren't at fault. If Strax thought they had failed in their \"mission\", it was grounds to execute them. He killed three horses in the same week for getting lost in Yorkshire, and nearly performed a summary execution on a fourth, asking it for last words, only to get no reply, which was \"the usual story\", suggesting he could understand horse. Strax didn't seem enthused to make another horse go the way of the others, stating he wasn't \"even hungry\". However, this particular horse was spared when he got proper directions to get to Sweetville. Strax could also become hyperactive if he ate sherbet fancies. He would steal the sweets from Jenny and eat them behind her back. However, Vastra could tell when he was \"overexcited\" from eating the fancies, and Strax was bad at hiding the truth. (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) He lacked proper manners for some things; when he asked Clara if she would like the paper, he threw it through a window and it hit her in the face. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nHowever, Strax also had a softer side and appeared to like children, tending to a young boy during the battle of Zaruthstra and offering to breastfeed Melody Pond, seeming rather affronted when Rory and Amy refused his offer. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) He also befriended the urchin Thomas Thomas and worked with the boy to save his friends. (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) His softer side was also shown by the sorrow he expressed when Clara Oswin Oswald was dying. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nDespite the fact that most Sontarans considered the Doctor to be an enemy, Strax was a loyal ally to the Time Lord, and did not appear to have any grudge against him. He knew of the Doctor's previous incarnations and had various opinions on them. Before his resurrection, Strax commented that he wasn't enjoying dying in battle as much as he'd hoped. However he was grateful for having lived nearly twelve years which, for a Sontaran, was quite a long life. When Rory tried to comfort him, insisting that he was a warrior and he could survive, Strax corrected him - he was a nurse. In the end, Strax found a greater nobility in healing than in killing- ironically he had previously described being a nurse as 'the most humiliating punishment a Sontaran can endure.'(TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nStrax was not very intelligent but he was loyal and well meaning. Sometimes he would say something clever, which the Doctor said didn't suit him. The Doctor was often condescending towards the Sontaran, although Strax didn't seem to mind the insults directed at him, even finding amusement in them. Since he was still adapting to life on Earth, Strax often said things that were either threatening or insulting such as when he told Clara she would be \"obliterated\" if she tried to escape and informed Captain Latimer that he had a \"puny human mind\". However he would often follow these statements with something more appropriate such as \"May I take your coat?\" and \"Try not to worry\", showing that he really was trying to fit in as best he could. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) Strax preferred to deal with problems through force and often suggested weapons or battle tactics that could help in times of need which commonly exasperated his friends.(TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Strax occasionally showed an uncanny fondness for grenades and acid traps. In the case of grenades, he answered the Doctor's question about the next thing to look for after finding something brand new in the world as \"a grenade\", and like to \"play with\" them when he was bored. (TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012)., The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) Remembering not to destroy someone with acid, on the other hand, was an old habit he found very hard to break. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nLike most Sontarans, Strax was a mighty warrior, shooting down many headless monks during the Battle of Demons Run. His skills in battle were so great that he had survived for at least twelve years, which was an uncommonly long lifespan for a Sontaran. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) Furthermore, Strax was knowledgeable about battle strategies and formations, recognising that Simeon's Snowmen were in a defensive formation instead of an offensive one, and frequently giving battle advice to his friends, although often at inappropriate times.(TV: The Snowmen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2012 (BBC One, 2012).) Strax also showed formidable strength, being able to knock Clara Oswald straight off her feet by throwing a rolled-up newspaper at her head. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) A friend of Strax's, Rick Bellamy, despite being a tough man, could not even jostle the Sontaran when slapping his back. (PROSE: Silhouette [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Strax was apparently not good at golf, or at least not as good as the Eleventh Doctor. (COMIC: Sonic Sleuth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nStrax was also a nurse, an unusual and humiliating position for a Sontaran. After becoming a nurse, he gene-spliced himself for all nursing duties. He told Rory that he could produce \"magnificent quantities\" of lactic fluid. Strax had vast medical knowledge, so much so that he would even give advice to his enemies during confrontation; as when the Doctor's forces surrounded Colonel Manton and his unarmed Clerics, Strax told him not to slump as it was bad for his spine. (TV: A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) He was also trained in physical examination procedures, though at times his analyses were slightly inaccurate due to misinterpretations of -- or general disdain for -- the species being studied, as occurred when scanning the eye of Clara, and remarking that her lips did not move.
