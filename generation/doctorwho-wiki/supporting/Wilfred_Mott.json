  "content": "He was also a one-time travelling companion of the Tenth Doctor, and the final companion with whom the Doctor travelled in that incarnation. Unlike many of the people of Earth, Wilfred was willing to believe aliens would come in peace one day, and that humanity would eventually travel out to the stars and mingle with them.\n\nA witness to several alien invasions of Earth, he was instrumental in stopping the Time Lords' return from within the time-lock which had sealed them in the Last Great Time War. In that effort, he trapped himself in a chamber about to be flooded with lethal radiation. His rescue was the proximate cause of the Tenth Doctor's regeneration into his eleventh incarnation. Fifteen years later he would get the chance to see the Doctor again, having recently regenerated into his fourteenth incarnation and bearing the face of the Tenth Doctor once again. The Fourteenth Doctor would later decide to retire on Earth with the Noble family while the Fifteenth Doctor continued on with their adventures.\n\nWilf was born circa 1928-29. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023). Timestamp 00:24:00.)\n\nDonna Noble stated that he had enlisted to fight in World War II while underage. (AUDIO: The Nemonite Invasion) By 1948, Wilf was a private in the 6th Airborne Division of the British Army, stationed in the British Mandate of Palestine at its end. According to a mysterious Time Lady, Wilf had served in the military without once taking a life, a fact Wilf defended, feeling proud not to have killed anyone. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nAt some point, Wilf met Eileen and had a daughter named Sylvia with her. He said that his time with his wife was the most wonderful years he had and that the time with her flew by. He never shouted at Sylvia during her childhood. (PROSE: In the Blood)\n\nWhen his granddaughter, Donna Noble, was in primary school, Wilf objected to her being taught to sing \"Wild Blue Yonder\" for the choir, telling the head of the choir, Mrs Bean, that it was a military song about going to war, but Mrs Bean defended it as sounding jolly. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nIn the 2006 elections, after the death of the British Prime Minister at the hands of the Slitheen family, (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Wilfred claimed to have voted for Harriet Jones, though Sylvia disputed this. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) On Christmas Eve 2007, Wilfred was laid up with Spanish flu, unable to attend his granddaughter's wedding. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Sometime later, Eileen died. (PROSE: Beautiful Chaos)\n\nDuring another Christmas Eve, while most of London had fled to the countryside to avoid a potential third alien invasion after the previous Christmastime attacks from the Sycorax and the Racnoss, Wilf remained to man his newspaper stand. During the night, he was approached by the Tenth Doctor and Astrid Peth, and told them he was the only person in London apart from Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. After he explained to them why London was empty, they were teleported away after the Doctor told him not to worry. The next day, Wilf saw the Titanic hurtled over London, yelling for the aliens not to ruin Christmas. (TV: Voyage of the Damned [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2007 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nAn amateur astronomer and keen stargazer, Wilf pitched a tent behind his daughter's house in Chiswick and spent most of his nights on top a hill with a telescope looking for aliens among the stars. Donna waved to him from the Doctor's TARDIS while flying away. Seeing the Doctor again through his telescope, Wilf felt happy for his granddaughter for being able to travel the universe, yelling and cheering as the TARDIS took off. (TV: Partners in Crime [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nDonna visited her mother and him after she had returned to Earth. She told Wilf, but not her mother about the Doctor, for fear she would react badly. She told him about ATMOS and what they were doing. When the Doctor turned up with a UNIT soldier, Wilfred realised the Doctor was the same man he had met at Christmas. He opened the family car to investigate an ATMOS device and was trapped inside when it was triggered. He began to suffocate (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) but was freed by his daughter Sylvia Noble. The next day he told Donna he would keep her secret and not tell her mother. (TV: The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nWilfred featured on the home improvement, reality TV series Haunted Makeovers alongside Sylvia, the Doctor and Donna. The Doctor and Donna were investigating the haunting of Morley mansion. (AUDIO: No Place)\n\nAt some point, Wilfred discovered a new star, which was named after him. (PROSE: Beautiful Chaos)\n\nWhen the Earth was moved into the Medusa Cascade, he and Sylvia tried to fight the Daleks. Wilf fired a paintball at a Dalek's eyestalk, hoping to blind it, but it dissolved the paint. As it was about to exterminate him, Rose Tyler teleported to the scene and killed the Dalek. Sylvia and Wilf took her to their home. A message came from a Sub-Wave Network. They couldn't respond, as Sylvia thought webcams were \"naughty\" and didn't let her father have one. He watched as Martha Jones and her mother, Torchwood Three and Sarah Jane Smith spoke with Harriet Jones. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) After the Earth was returned to its proper place, they celebrated. When the Doctor brought Donna back to them without any memory of her adventures with him, Wilf was distraught at the thought of her returning to her previous life. He promised to look up at the sky every night and remember the Doctor on Donna's behalf. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nAs Christmas approached, Wilf, along with everyone else on Earth, began having nightmares involving the laughing face of the Saxon Master. Seeking refuge in a church, he was approached by a mysterious woman, who told him the church had been a convent in the 1300s, had been attacked by a demon from the sky and saved by a \"sainted physician\"; then she vanished. The next day, Wilf organised a \"Silver Cloak\" of old age pensioners. He quickly found the Doctor and in a café learned of his prophesied death. On Christmas morning, Wilf was watching the Queen's speech when it was interrupted by the mysterious woman, whom only he could see. She told Wilf he would have to take up arms, that the Doctor could still be saved and that Wilf must not tell the Doctor anything of what she had said. Wilf took his old service revolver, met the Doctor outside the Noble house and joined him in tracking down the Master.\n\nThey arrived too late to stop the Master turning every human on Earth into a duplicate of himself, but Wilf was protected from the effect behind a radiation shield. He escaped with the Doctor to a spaceship. During this time, Wilf and the Doctor felt they would both be proud to have been related to each other. After another encounter with the woman, he gave the Doctor his gun and urged him to kill the Master. The Doctor initially refused, but on learning the Time Lords were behind everything, he took the gun.\n\nIn the fight that followed, Earth shot missiles at the ship. Wilf manned one of the guns and had the aliens land so he could join the Doctor. He freed someone trapped in the radiation booth, but as a result was himself trapped. After he witnessed the Doctor and the Master defeat Rassilon and the Time Lords, Wilf then knocked on the booth door four times to be let out, unknowingly fulfilling the prophecy of \"He will knock four times.\"\n\nDue to the nuclear bolt still being active, the radiation would flood the booth and kill him, but not harm anyone else. To save him, the Doctor would have to sacrifice himself. Wilf was willing to die instead because he had \"had his time\", but the Doctor saved him and absorbed a fatal dose of radiation, which caused him to start to regenerate. He took Wilf home and promised to see him one more time before he changed.\n\nAt Donna's second wedding, Wilf met the Doctor again, just like he had promised. The Doctor gave Wilf and Sylvia a winning lottery ticket he had purchased with money borrowed from Geoff Noble before leaving. Wilf and Sylvia gave Donna the ticket and Wilf tearfully saluted the Doctor as he took off. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nWilf was met by River Song to talk about his history with the Tenth Doctor, alongside Jackie Tyler, Sylvia Noble and Francine Jones. (PROSE: Judge, Jury and Executioner)\n\nAt some point, Wilf was taken to the Black Archive by UNIT to have his record as a companion of the Doctor taken. His memories of the visit were subsequently erased and he was sent on his way. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWilf became a great-grandfather when Donna and Shaun had a child, (PROSE: We Are Family [+]Paul Lang, Doctor Who The Official Annual 2024 (Penguin Group, 2023). Page 35.) who eventually come out as both transgender and non-binary, choosing the name of Rose for herself. By 2023, Wilf, no longer able to use the stairs in the Nobles' new home, was living in sheltered accommodation paid for by UNIT, as Kate Lethbridge-Stewart said she would take care of him due to his days as a soldier. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Wilf would soon start needing a wheelchair. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAfter Donna regained her memories (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) during the November 2023 UFO incident, (PROSE: The Star Beast [+]Gary Russell, adapted from The Star Beast (Russell T Davies), 60th Anniversary Novels (Target Books, 2023).) she decided to go on one last trip with the Fourteenth Doctor to see Wilf, excited at the chance to show him that her memories were back and to let Wilf meet the Doctor again. However, after Donna accidentally spilled coffee on the console, the TARDIS took off, completely out of control. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Shortly after Donna's disappearance, a mass hysteria took over the world, and Wilf instructed his family to \"bunker down\" while he waited at Camden Market for the TARDIS to return, maintaining a faith that the Doctor would return to save the world. When the Doctor and Donna finally returned a few days after they had left, they were greeted by Wilf, who was overjoyed to see them. He was especially pleased to see the Doctor again with the same face, but also informed them of the ongoing crisis. Just then, the people around them started attacking each other and a plane crash-landed nearby, forcing Wilf, Donna and the Doctor to take cover behind the TARDIS. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Once UNIT arrived to collect the Doctor, Donna handed off Wilf to the soldiers, who promised to keep him safe as she went with the Doctor at Wilf's urging. Donna later noted that Wilf was immune to the Giggle, the same as her and Melanie Bush, which the Doctor guessed was because traveling in the TARDIS had put them out of sync.\n\nAfter the Doctor saved the world from the Toymaker, and was convinced to settle down and heal on Earth with Donna by the Fifteenth Doctor, (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Wilf came to the Doctor's house in the countryside (PROSE: The Giggle [+]James Goss, adapted from The Giggle (Russell T Davies), 60th Anniversary Novels (Target Books, 2023).) for a family picnic. He entertained himself by shooting at the moles in the back garden, with the Doctor having put force fields around the moles to protect them. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nWilfred Mott had his life changed for the worse on 25 June 2007, when Donna created a parallel world by turning right instead of left. He and his family were forced to relocate to Leeds following the destruction of London. Watching the night sky through his telescope, Wilf was first to inform Donna that the stars were going out, convincing her to go with Rose Tyler, who would help her negate the timeline. (TV: Turn Left [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nIn an alternative timeline created by a continuity bomb, the Doctor allowed Wilfred to die in the radiation chamber instead of saving him from death, viewing himself as the more useful of the two to the universe. This led to the Doctor becoming a tyrant that ruled the cosmos with an iron fist until his death. (COMIC: Four Doctors)\n\nWilfred had a positive attitude. Even in a crisis, he turned to good war-time spirit. He was a strong patriot, loyal to Queen Elizabeth and his beloved England. He also had a good relationship with his granddaughter Donna Noble and encouraged her companionship with the Doctor, even keeping it a secret from his daughter, Sylvia, for a time. (TV: The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nAccording to Sylvia, he always spilt either soup or tea down his cardigan. (AUDIO: Prequel to Donna Noble: Kidnapped)\n\nWilfred also proved a loyal companion to the Doctor, from searching him out when prompted to by the mysterious woman, to giving the Doctor his gun and prompting him to kill the Master, as well as serving as a gunner when the ship they were on was under attack. He convinced the Vinvocci to take him back to help the Doctor. He also showed a willingness for self-sacrifice by saving someone trapped in a radiation booth and being willing to die there so the Doctor could live, saying he was an old man who had had his time. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nWhen the Doctor brought Donna back with her memories erased, Wilfred was devastated as he felt she had grown into a better person after her travels with the Doctor and even tried to get him to talk to her, remarking that he needed her when the Doctor admitted he had done wrong whilst travelling alone. However, he didn't share his daughter's hard feelings against him for wiping her memories, and promised to look up at the sky every night on Donna's behalf. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nHe developed a paternal relationship with the Doctor, trying to comfort him when he began to cry during their conversation and wanted him to be happy and to have someone to make him laugh. He was also willing to give up his life to let the Doctor live. This relationship was picked up by others, with the Saxon Master sarcastically referring to Wilfred as the Doctor's father. Both Wilf and the Doctor admitted that they'd be proud if they actually were father and son. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) The Fourteenth Doctor expressed a desire to see Wilf again after Donna safely regained her memories, with Donna noting that it would have been hard for Wilf to keep the Doctor a secret from her for so many years and that he would love to see him one last time. When the Doctor mistakenly believed that Wilf had died, he was visibly upset at the news. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) Indeed, even fifteen years after the Tenth Doctor's regeneration Wilfred still valued his friendship and paternal relationship with the Doctor highly, at first shocked to see the Fourteenth Doctor looking identical to his tenth incarnation, but quickly becoming overjoyed and emotional upon seeing his friend once more. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).) After retiring on Earth, the Doctor started referring to Wilf as \"Grandad,\" although he put force fields on the moles that Wilf was hunting as the Doctor liked the moles. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nAccording to Sylvia, she had no higher compliment than Wilfred being impressed by the Doctor saving the day. (TV: The Star Beast [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Doctor Who and the Star Beast (Pat Mills and John Wagner), Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nDuring the Giggle crisis, Wilf kept his wits about him despite the chaos being unleashed by the Toymaker upon the world, sending the rest of his family to \"bunker down\" while he awaited the return of the Doctor and Donna who he believed would return to save the world again. Donna later noted that Wilf, like herself and Melanie Bush, was immune to the Giggle, which the Doctor guessed was a side effect of their travels in the TARDIS. (TV: Wild Blue Yonder [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023)., The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nA trained soldier, Wilfred survived World War II without killing anyone. Being proud of his service, he wore a Parachute Regiment pin on his signature red hat. He still kept his service revolver as a memento, which he later gave to the Doctor to use against the Saxon Master. He also proved to be a proficient gunner when he shot down some of the missiles that the Master had fired at the Vinvocci's spaceship. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).) He momentarily blinded a Dalek with a well-placed paintball shot to its small eye stalk, although the Dalek recovered its vision almost instantly. (TV: The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Even by 2023, Wilf could still shoot at moles out in the fields, forcing the Fourteenth Doctor to design a forcefield to protect them from Wilf's shots. (TV: The Giggle [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials (BBC One and Disney+, 2023).)\n\nUnlike so many others who had spent years searching, Wilfred and the small gang of pensioners whom he commanded found the Doctor within only a few hours of his arrival, much to the Doctor's bewilderment. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)",
