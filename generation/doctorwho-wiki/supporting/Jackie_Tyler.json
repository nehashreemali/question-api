  "content": "Jacqueline Prentice was the daughter of Rose's Grandad Prentice. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) Her birthday was 1 February 1967.[nb 1] (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) She had an uncle named Tony who told her to \"never punch a gift horse in the throat\". (AUDIO: Retail Therapy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAs a child, she loved The Magic Roundabout. (COMIC: Sin-Eaters [+]Cavan Scott, Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor (Titan Publishing Group, 2017).)\n\nJackie met Odessa Smith, Sarah Clark, Suzie and Bev and in the 1980s, they formed the \"Wednesday Girls\", who met every Wednesday night for wine and chips. She was also the karaoke champion of 'the Spinning Wheel' and the life and soul of every party she went to. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nAt some point, Jackie married Pete Tyler. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Jackie gave birth to a daughter called Rose, who was born circa 1986 (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., The Unquiet Dead [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Dalek [+]Robert Shearman, adapted from Jubilee (Robert Shearman), Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., etc.) or on 27 April 1987. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005)., TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) The day Rose was born, Odessa brought her son Mickey to see Jackie's newly born baby. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nJackie and Pete's relationship was stormy, with Jackie sometimes branding Pete a failure and often suspecting him of being unfaithful. Their fights were short-lived however and it was clear that Jackie and Pete loved each other despite their arguments. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nOn the 7th November 1987, Jackie attended Stuart Hoskins and Sarah Clark's wedding, but Pete was killed in a hit-and-run incident while on his way to the wedding. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005)., AUDIO: Ghost Machines [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) In the original timeline, Jackie received the news of her husband's death while she was at home in the Powell Estate. (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nFollowing Pete's death, Jackie raised her daughter on her own, as a single parent. She often told Rose about her father. While travelling with the Doctor, an older Rose travelled back to 1987, saved Pete from his original fate, and met a young Jackie. Jackie remembered a young woman kneeling over Pete's body. She had no idea that it was her daughter from the future. (TV: Father's Day [+]Paul Cornell, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) To make a living, Jackie worked as a hairdresser from home. (PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).)\n\nEvery Christmas after Pete was killed, Jackie served her guests dry turkey, had too much brandy and got drunk. She would then start crying about Pete and get the photo albums out. (PROSE: The Christmas Invasion [+]Jenny T Colgan, adapted from The Christmas Invasion (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).)\n\nWhen Rose was young, a cat sometimes wandered into Rose and Jackie's apartment. Despite Jackie's many attempts to get rid of it, she eventually gave in and the cat stayed, with it living for five more years. (PROSE: The Cat Came Back [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who Storybook 2007 (Doctor Who Storybook, 2006).)\n\nJackie's father died around 1997. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nWhen Rose was twelve, she begged Jackie for a red bicycle for Christmas, but Jackie said no because she couldn't afford it. (PROSE: The Red Bicycle [+]Gary Russell, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).)\n\nJackie was delighted when Rose started dating Mickey, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) although she was unimpressed when Rose dumped Mickey some time later and started a relationship with local bad boy Jimmy Stone, especially after Rose moved out to live with him in a bedsit. The relationship ended in tears five months later, and Jackie prided herself on helping Rose get over the relationship. (AUDIO: Flight Into Hull! [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018)., PROSE: Meet Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Annual 2006 (Panini UK, 2005).) Some time after, Jackie was once again delighted when Rose rekindled her relationship with Mickey. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nOn 1 January 2005, Rose voiced dismay about Jackie's dead-end relationship with a man called Jimbo. Jackie responded that she thought she would not find anyone better at her age, but Rose reassured her that she would find someone one day, which was witnessed by the Tenth Doctor just before his impending regeneration. (TV: The End of Time [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2009 and New Year Special 2010 (BBC One, 2009-2010).)\n\nJackie suggested to Rose after the destruction of Henrik's that she get compensation. Jackie first met the Ninth Doctor when Rose invited him in to talk about the Auton attack on Henrik's, and flirted with him to no avail. During the final phase of the attempted Auton invasion, Autons attacked Jackie while she was out shopping at Queen's Arcade, (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) after travelling to Oxford Street to get a compensation form for Rose after Henrik's exploded, (PROSE: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, adapted from Rose (Russell T Davies), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) but she was saved when Rose destroyed the Nestene Consciousness. (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhen Rose left with the Doctor in his TARDIS, she intended to be back within hours. When Rose returned to London, although it had only been a few days for her, a year had elapsed on Earth due to a miscalculation by the Doctor. During that time, out of her mind with worry, Jackie organised a poster campaign for her missing daughter and even accused Rose's boyfriend Mickey of murdering her. When the police failed to find any evidence against Mickey, she began a hate campaign against him, eventually resulting in him being under suspicion from everyone. When Rose returned, a furious Jackie slapped the Doctor for taking her away.\n\nShe also could not understand why Rose would not tell her where she had been but learned the truth when she saw the TARDIS. Fearful for her daughter's safety, she contacted an emergency helpline, which alerted UNIT to the Doctor's presence. They escorted the Doctor and Rose to Downing Street. Sip Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen, who was disguised as a policeman, attacked Jackie due to her association with the Doctor. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nThe Doctor, having remotely electrocuted Sip Fel-Fotch with an electrified ID card, prevented him from killing Jackie. Mickey then rescued her and escaped with her to his flat. Sip Fel-Fotch tracked down Mickey and Jackie and began breaking into Mickey's flat. With the help of the Doctor, Jackie used all of the vinegar she could find in the flat to kill the calcium-based lifeform that was weakened by his compression field.\n\nJackie began to understand how dangerous Rose's new life was when the Doctor ended the Slitheen's plans to make the Earth into a piece of cheap, radioactive starship fuel by calling down a missile strike on 10 Downing Street where he and Rose were trapped. Rose survived the attack and rushed home to let Jackie know she had made it. Making an effort to understand her daughter's new life, Jackie invited the Doctor for dinner, but he refused.\n\nWhen ready to go travelling again, Rose promised that, because the TARDIS was a time machine, she could travel to the end of the universe and back and it would have only been ten seconds. However, after the TARDIS dematerialised, Rose did not return in ten seconds and Jackie walked off. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nTwo weeks later, while going through some old possessions of her, she came across a video from the 1980s of a wedding, which she shared with Mickey having now reconciled with him. Mickey was shocked to see the Doctor and Rose in some shots, leading him to speculate about the Doctor's motives. (PROSE: Essay Competition [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nJackie nearly fell for a scheme to take humans \"on holiday\" to fight in an alien war. Darren Pye, a thug who lived in the council estate, mugged her and took the \"winning ticket\" that qualified her for the vacation. Jackie ended up in hospital, but her assailant fared worse. He took her place as a remote-controlled soldier on an alien planet and was killed. (PROSE: Winner Takes All [+]Jacqueline Rayner, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nThe time-lost Neanderthal Das flirted with Jackie at a London nightclub before Captain Jack Harkness steered him away from her. Jack and Jackie did not meet at this time. Jack scanned Jackie's DNA with his wrist device and identified her as Rose's mother. He had heard that she \"wouldn't appreciate any more Doctor-related weirdness in her life\". (PROSE: Only Human [+]Gareth Roberts, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).)\n\nRose used the \"superphone\" to call Jackie from a human colony world in the future. Jackie complained Rose had not let her know she had been in Cardiff during her recent visit to the city. (PROSE: The Stealers of Dreams [+]Steve Lyons, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2005).) Soon afterwards, Rose paid Jackie a visit. (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nJackie became a very successful entrepreneur and saleswoman on the Powell Estate from her Glubby Glubs which helped people sleep for eight or nine full hours, better than medication. However, it turned out that Jackie was unknowingly involved in a plot to steal people's energy. (AUDIO: Retail Therapy [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen the Doctor sent Rose back to her own time to escape a Dalek attack, Jackie was glad to have her daughter home. She said she loved the Doctor for sending Rose out of danger. Whilst comforting her, Jackie reacted badly to the revelation that Rose was by Pete's side when he died. However, reminded of her husband's penchant for daft ideas, she eventually helped Rose open the TARDIS console by using Rodrigo's truck, enabling her to return and help the Doctor. (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) As Rose never contacted either her or Mickey after leaving in the TARDIS, Mickey assumed the worst, that she had died, but Jackie held out that Rose would return. (PROSE: Mars [+]BBC webteam, Who is Doctor Who? (BBC, 2005).)\n\nJackie began dating a fruit vendor named Howard. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nJackie was one of the first people to encounter the Doctor after he regenerated into his tenth incarnation. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nWhile the Doctor, Rose and Mickey were on the Sycorax ship, Jackie was briefly visited by the Third Doctor, Jo Grant and Captain Mike Yates, who had been answering a distress call they had received in the TARDIS. The \"distress call\" was actually a transmission made by Prime minister Harriet Jones. Although Jackie initially assumed that the Doctor she knew had changed again and Jo and Mike were the 'regenerated' Rose and Mickey, she soon came to understand that the Third Doctor was a younger version of the Doctor she knew. She was briefly concerned about the implications of Jo travelling with the Doctor, wondering if this meant that Rose was just the latest in a long line of companions rather than someone unique and concerned about what had happened to the others who had gone before. Studying Jackie's Christmas tree, the Doctor was attacked and nearly suffocated by one of the sentient ornaments. Jackie was able to free him by feeding it Christmas pudding and brandy instead.\n\nUsing the internet, the Doctor discovered that UNIT's secret HQ was no longer a building marked with a sign reading \"UNIT Headquarters,\" and that instead it had been moved underneath the Tower of London. As the group left in the TARDIS, Jackie insisted on joining them to help take her mind off of Rose's predicament.\n\nAt the Tower, they were denied entrance by a Beefeater, who believed the Doctor to be one of the several imposters who were attempting to steal classified information by pretending to be the Doctor. Before they could convince him that they were genuine, the Tenth Doctor was able to free those being controlled by the Sycorax.\n\nReturning to Jackie's flat, the group had a brief encounter with the Master, trapped by another killer Christmas tree decoration after following the Doctor to her flat. The Master had followed the Doctor to join the Sycorax in helping enslave the human population, but he agreed to leave after being let go. Before he left, the Doctor assured Jackie and Jo that he would never make anyone leave him; and that all of his companions left him instead. Looking forward to finally meeting Jackie for the first time, the Doctor briefly flirted with her before taking off in the TARDIS once again. (PROSE: The Christmas Inversion [+]Jacqueline Rayner, Twelve Doctors of Christmas (2016).)\n\nFollowing this encounter, her relationship with the Tenth Doctor was warmer than his earlier incarnation; she allowed the Doctor to attend Christmas dinner with Rose and her. (TV: The Christmas Invasion [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Christmas special (BBC One, 2005).) At some point, Rose confided in her mother about her encounters with the Daleks, admitting that they had terrified her. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nJackie posed as the Doctor's new girlfriend and kissed him in front of Rose in order to drive out the jealousy-eating Iagnon from her. She later kissed him again just to make sure there wasn't more than one creature inside her. (COMIC: The Green-Eyed Monster [+]Nev Fountain, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2006).)\n\nJackie became stalked by Jack Harkness as a means of keeping an eye on her and Rose whilst he was stuck on Earth. However, one day Jackie found the Powell Estate completely deserted except for Jack. They joined forces to investigate and discovered it was the work of the Harvesters. (AUDIO: Wednesdays For Beginners [+]James Goss, The Lives of Captain Jack (The Lives of Captain Jack, Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nJackie comforted Rose after she returned from a parallel world where Pete was alive and Jackie had been turned into a Cyberman. Mickey had decided to stay in that world, and the Doctor had to seal off it off, so Rose could never visit. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nShe decided to visit her school friend Marge Ellmore in Norwich. When the Zaross invaded she called Rose. She told Marge that Rose was more than a cashier. She was taken by the Zaross to their mothership, where she was to be made up as a rebel with Jess Ellmore. She stole one of the weapons on the ship, but it turned out to be a prop. She then helped the Doctor in his plans. (AUDIO: Infamy of the Zaross [+]John Dorney, The Tenth Doctor Adventures (Big Finish Productions, 2017).)\n\nJack Harkness took Jackie on a luxury cruise in space. (AUDIO: Crush [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nShe went for a job at Lady Christina de Souza's house as a cleaner on River Song's advice. She started getting freaked out when she heard creepy voices. Christina showed her the value of the necklace that Jackie took from Rose's bedroom. She was convinced by Jonty to sell it. She encountered the Doctor during his degeneration crisis and chastised him. She then helped him investigate the other Doctor at the UNIT facility. The Doctor told her that she would forget this meeting due to fall out from the degeneration energy. (AUDIO: Two's Company [+]Lisa McMullin, Once and Future (Big Finish Productions, 2023).)\n\nShe befriended Elton Pope, a young man searching for the Doctor, unaware he was using her to get to the Doctor. Their relationship progressed to her forcing Elton to take off his clothes. The proceedings were interrupted by a call from Rose. Jackie discovered a photograph of Rose in Elton's coat and realised the truth. She angrily told Elton she would protect the Doctor and Rose, no matter what. She later told Rose about what Elton had done. Rose and the Doctor tracked down Elton so Rose could confront him, leading to saving his life from a monstrous alien. (TV: Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nJackie accepted the Doctor as part of her life, showering him with kisses upon one of his returns with Rose. In 2007, Jackie was one of many fooled into believing the ghosts appearing around the world were deceased relatives, in her case, her father. She was hostile to the Doctor's scepticism about this. While the Doctor investigated a ghost sighting, Jackie told her daughter how she feared this life of not settling down, and always travelling, because it had caused her to change radically from the girl who used to work in a shop. Rose had not enjoyed a fulfilling experience in her old job at Henrik's and defended that she had changed for the better.\n\nJackie supposed this was true, but seemed distressed that she had also worked in a shop and Rose's negative reaction was a jab at her own welfare. Rose insisted she didn't mean it that way, and Jackie replied she knew what Rose really meant to say. Although it upset Rose, Jackie confronted her with the belief that if she died, Rose would have no reason to come back home to Earth and stay travelling forever, changing more and more until she no longer resembled her daughter, even to the point she forgot how to be human. This caused Rose to sober up and think about having a more stable life.\n\nJackie found herself aboard the TARDIS when it dematerialised and arrived at Torchwood headquarters, warning the Doctor if they ended up on Mars, she'd kill him. When Torchwood surrounded the TARDIS in a hostile manner, the Doctor initiated a plan to observe their background operations. Rose was sent out to reconnoitre. Jackie impersonated Rose when she and the Doctor were captured by Torchwood. The Doctor's unflattering remarks about his companion ageing by fifty-seven years after looking into the Heart of the TARDIS and being delusional about her real age of forty earned him an icy stare. The humour did not last long when a major conflict spilled out inside Torchwood's compound. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nJackie found herself in the middle of the Battle of Canary Wharf. Cybermen from an alternate Earth and Daleks battled over Earth. Jackie thought she was reunited with the ghost of her dead husband, Pete, only to learn that it was a version from the alternate Earth whose own Jackie had been assimilated by the Cybermen. They almost immediately began a relationship. Soon after, Jackie and Rose had to escape to the alternate world, with no apparent way to return to their Earth. Jackie and Rose were declared dead on their Earth, victims of the battle. On the parallel Earth, however, Jackie gave birth to a son, Tony Tyler. She also had to deal with comforting Rose, who was emotionally devastated by her separation from the Doctor, with whom she had fallen in love. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nOver the next few years, Rose worked to find a way back to the Doctor to warn him about the impending collapse of reality. Rose built the Dimension cannon to travel between parallel worlds, and, on one trip, Jackie accompanied her. In this parallel world, Jackie met Mickey's mother, Odessa. (AUDIO: The Last Party on Earth [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nRose returned to her original Earth after a detour into an alternate timeline. Soon after, Jackie and Mickey also returned to their original Earth to help Rose. One of the first people Jackie encountered was Sarah Jane Smith. Jackie and Mickey arrived as Sarah Jane was about to be killed by two Daleks. Jackie killed one of the Daleks while Mickey killed the other.\n\nNow a more self-assured, less self-absorbed individual, Jackie worked alongside Sarah Jane, Mickey and Jack Harkness to rescue the Doctor and save Earth. While Mickey disagreed with Sarah Jane's plan to surrender to get to the Crucible, Jackie immediately agreed, knowing that the Doctor and Rose would be there. Jackie, Mickey and Sarah Jane were made test subjects for the reality bomb. Sarah Jane and Mickey escaped while Jackie comforted a fallen prisoner. In the nick of time, Jackie's teleport recharged and she escaped to safety. In the ensuing battle, Jackie was reunited with Rose and met Martha Jones and Donna Noble. When Earth was towed back to where it belonged, Jackie didn't pilot the TARDIS along with everyone else. The Doctor specifically told her, \"No, no Jackie, not you, just stand back\".\n\nAfterwards, Mickey said his goodbyes to her. He wasn't returning to the parallel world. There was nothing left for him there and he said that he was going to miss her the most. Jackie embraced Mickey in a final goodbye. Following the defeat of Davros, the Doctor returned Jackie to the alternate Earth to reunite her with her husband and son. Jackie couldn't resist winding up the Doctor one last time by making him believe she had named her son \"Doctor\". She watched as the Doctor's Meta-Crisis clone agreed to stay behind and begin a life with Rose and the original Doctor departed for the last time. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nJackie later joined UNIT along with the Meta-Crisis Doctor, Pete and Rose after the Preachers were combined with Torchwood by President Harriet Jones. She became head of the food department. Jackie made friends with Beryl Thompson, whose N-Space counterpart she had been friends with. She and Beryl would often have tea or a \"cheeky veno\" and Jackie would tell Beryl stories about her life. (AUDIO: The Siege of Big Ben [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018)., Flight Into Hull! [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nOne Tuesday, all UNIT personnel were called away to a reported Cybus factory, leaving just Jackie and the Doctor in the headquarters. When alarms sounded, they retreated to his lab, where Jackie was furious to discover he'd been growing a TARDIS, believing he was planning to abandon Rose. A group of aliens appeared on the monitor, claiming to have the UNIT personnel including Rose and Pete hostage and demanding the Doctor's time machine. He planned to blow up the base to deprive them of the TARDIS, however Jackie talked him out of it and got him to think properly. They discovered the aliens were illusions and Brigadier Krista Lateef revealed herself as the culprit, wanting the Doctor's TARDIS to save her daughter from cyber-conversion. Jackie talked her down, promising not to tell anyone what she'd done. However the Doctor promptly reported Krista to Pete regardless, infuriating Jackie. She later called Beryl to tell her about what had happened. (AUDIO: The Siege of Big Ben [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nPete and Rose conspired to get Jackie and the Doctor alone together on a zeppelin flight to Hull so they would talk to each other again. During the awkward flight, the zeppelin was boarded by a version of Jackie from another parallel universe, seeking to replace Jackie as the start of an invasion. Jackie tried to talk her out of it, telling her to find another way to save her Earth than take over this one, and eventually the Doctor forced her to retreat by forcing the zeppelin on a crash course. He was unable to correct the flight however, so they comforted each other in the cockpit and she came to understand that he did genuinely love Rose. The Doctor then found parachutes, enabling them to escape the zeppelin before it crashed into a river. Jackie later called Beryl to tell her about the flight, teasing her that she'd been replaced by her counterpart at one point. (AUDIO: Flight Into Hull! [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nJackie became a grandmother when Rose and the Doctor had a baby together, Mia. (COMIC: Empire of the Wolf [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who (2020) (Titan Publishing Group, 2021-2022).) Under unknown circumstances, Jackie was returned to N-Space for a time by River Song to talk about her history with the Tenth Doctor, alongside Sylvia Noble, Francine Jones and Wilfred Mott. (PROSE: Judge, Jury and Executioner [+]James Goss and Steve Tribe, The Doctor: His Lives and Times (BBC Books, 2013).)\n\nAt some point, Jackie received a call from Rose while she was watching the Earth die 5 billion years in the future. Jackie thought she had a hangover, as she asked her what day it was (a Wednesday). (TV: The End of the World [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).)\n\nAt some point, Jackie called Rose on the TARDIS, worrying again about her travelling with the Ninth Doctor. (COMIC: Mystery Date [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nRiver Song once met Jackie. River helped her wash a duvet. (AUDIO: R&J [+]James Goss, The Lives of Captain Jack: Volume Three (The Lives of Captain Jack, Big Finish Productions, 2020).)\n\nIn a timeline created by Rassilon allying with the Cybermen, Jackie was left the sole survivor of the Powell Estate after the Cybermen took it over, being rescued by Rose, Jack and the Doctor. When they reached the TARDIS however, Rose fell victim to the Cybermen's techno-virus, becoming a Cyber-Warrior, killing Jack, before the Doctor too began to be converted. As a last gambit, the Doctor, despite Jackie's protests, overrode the TARDIS' safety protocols to build up enough power to destroy Earth. Before the ship could explode however, its power siphoned away and the upgraded Rose broke into the TARDIS. The timeline was then undone when a remorseful Rassilon joined forces with the Twelfth Doctor. (COMIC: Supremacy of the Cybermen [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nIn an alternate timeline created by a paradox caused by an encounter between the Tenth and Thirteenth Doctors, Jackie lived under Sea Devil occupation. She was still married to Pete, who didn't die in 1987, and the mother of Rose. By 2020, she and Pete were held in a Sea Devil prison camp whilst Rose fought with the resistance. Jackie and Pete met the Thirteenth Doctor and her friends whilst they held there. (COMIC: Alternating Current [+]Jody Houser, Doctor Who Comic (2020) (Titan Comics, 2020-2021).)\n\nThe Jackie Tyler of Pete's World looked down on people who were lower on the social ladder. In this universe Jackie was still married to Pete, however she had no children. They instead had a dog named Rose. (TV: Rise of the Cybermen [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) This Jackie was converted into a Cyberman. (TV: The Age of Steel [+]Tom MacRae, adapted from Spare Parts (Marc Platt), Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nWhen Rose tested the Dimension cannon with Pete, she encountered other versions of Jackie from parallel worlds. In one world, Jackie was a widow but her Pete had created Artificial Intelligence powered by the spirits of the dead. (AUDIO: Ghost Machines [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn one parallel world, Jackie was brunette and had a son, Tony. Unlike her other selves, she was a scientist. When her Earth's resources were used up, Jackie was the first to travel to Pete's World to begin a full invasion. She met Jackie from N-Space there and the Meta-Crisis Doctor whilst they were aboard a zeppelin. She looked down on her counterpart as a \"chav\" and intended to replace her, but was forced to retreat when the Doctor sabotaged the zeppelin, setting it on a crash course. (AUDIO: Flight Into Hull! [+]Joseph Lidster, Short Trips (Big Finish Productions, 2018).)\n\nJackie had a very strong personality. While she cared greatly for Rose, she didn't like the Ninth Doctor very much. She had no problem speaking her mind and didn't mind hitting someone; she struck the Doctor. (TV: Aliens of London [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Over time she grew to like and respect the Doctor, especially after he stuck to his word and sent Rose back home safely from the Daleks, (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and increasingly in his tenth incarnation. (TV: Love & Monsters [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nWhile Jackie appeared flighty at times, she loved her daughter and was concerned for her safety, given the life the Doctor led. Her attitude towards the Doctor softened from hostility to grudging acceptance, but she continued to worry about Rose and awaited her daughter's return. The Doctor made an effort to return Rose home periodically, even if it seemed almost as if the whole purpose was to let Rose get some laundry done. (TV: Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nShe did not react well to terrifying situations. While running from Cybermen, she was so frightened she could barely tell the Doctor where she was. (TV: Doomsday [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) She was reluctant to help someone in need. She needed a lot of convincing to help Rose and Mickey out with their plan to save the Doctor, although she ultimately provided the solution to their problem. (TV: World War Three [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) This particular trait was less prominent later on. When she was unable to save a woman from Davros' reality bomb, she voiced deep regret.
