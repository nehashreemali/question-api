  "content": "Francine Jones (née Oshodi) was the mother of Tish, Martha and Leo Jones.\n\nFrancine married Clive Jones. Their first child was Letitia, (PROSE: The Pirate Loop) who was followed by Martha in 1986 (PROSE: Wooden Heart) and Leo. (TV:  Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) She lived and worked in London, sometimes having important workmates around and told them of her children's ambitions. (PROSE: The Pirate Loop)\n\nFrancine had a brother and through him a niece, Adeola Oshodi, who died in the Battle of Canary Wharf. (PROSE: The Torchwood Archives, TV:  Army of Ghosts [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).)\n\nThe Joneses were divorced by the 2000s after Clive had an affair with Annalise. Whilst Francine accused Annalise of stealing her husband, Annalise claimed that she had been seduced by him and was \"entirely innocent\". Francine and Clive often argued. (TV:  Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) She became a grandmother when Leo had a daughter, Keisha. (PROSE: Martha Jones' MySpace blog)\n\nBefore Leo's twenty-first birthday party in the 2000s,[nb 1] Francine complained about Annalise's presence, worried about how the family would look in front of everybody. At the party, she argued with Annalise when she accused Martha of lying about the Royal Hope Hospital being taken to the Moon, starting a heated argument in which she called the younger woman orange. Martha left during it and joined the Tenth Doctor. (TV:  Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nFrancine later met the Doctor the following day at Richard Lazarus' party. She was suspicious of him, especially after she was approached by a mysterious man who told her that the Doctor was dangerous, citing information from Harold Saxon. After Lazarus' death, she slapped him and told him to keep away from her daughter, who she later called to tell her to keep her distance. (TV:  The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nMartha called Francine from the SS Pentallian and asked for help with the quiz question doors, with Francine believing that she was at a pub quiz. Martha called her again later to tell her that she loved her, unaware that Francine was sat with Miss Dexter who had bugged the phone and was trying to get information on the Doctor. During a third phone call, Francine asked her to come round for tea. She told Dexter that she had already voted. (TV:  42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nFrancine and Clive both tried to get Martha to come home, pretending that they were thinking of getting back together. After Clive told Martha to run, he, Francine and Tish were taken away on Miss Dexter's orders and taken to the Valiant. Shocked at Dexter's betrayal, Francine realised too late that it was 'Mister Saxon', not the Doctor, who was the real enemy of her family. (TV:  The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nAboard the Valiant, Francine witnessed the Toclafane invasion. She tearfully apologised to Martha for her mistake in associating with the Master before Martha vanished, leaving her family confused and alone. (TV:  The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nDuring the The Year That Never Was, Francine, Clive and Tish were held on the Valiant as slaves and hostages whilst the Master hunted Martha down, watching the Master's atrocities such as the burning of Japan. Francine and Tish were forced to dress as maids and were restrained by chains at night. (TV:  Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) At one point Francine attempted to escape out of an airlock but failed and was warned harm would come to Tish if she tried it again. Miss Beecham subsequently took cell samples from Francine and cloned her hundreds of times, sending the clones to reported sightings of Martha. Francine was later ordered by Toclafane to clean the cell where Beecham was executed for plotting against the Master, with her noting happily that Martha's continued freedom was making the Master angry. (AUDIO: Deceived)\n\nA year into the Master's rule, the family attempted a rebellion on the Valiant with Jack Harkness and the Doctor but failed, after which Francine was tortured into apologising.\n\nOnce the Doctor was restored and the Master's plans thwarted, Francine, consumed with rage and guilt at the way the Master had used her to hurt her family and the whole world, picked up a gun and threatened to kill him, but dropped it after the Doctor appealed to her better nature. Time was undone and Francine, Clive, Tish and Martha were some of the few to remember what had happened since Arthur Coleman Winters's death. The Joneses were returned home, where Francine acknowledged the Doctor with a silent nod when Martha decided to leave him. (TV:  Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nMartha told the Doctor that her family was \"not so bad\" and recovering. (TV:  The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nLater, after Earth was moved by the Daleks to the Medusa Cascade, Martha returned to Francine using Project Indigo. Francine's laptop switched on thanks to the Sub-Wave Network being used by Harriet Jones, connecting them to the former Prime Minister and a number of the Doctor's friends. (TV:  The Stolen Earth [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) Martha left her to use the Osterhagen Key, ignoring Francine's questions as to what it was.\n\nWhen Earth was moved back into the solar system, Francine was overjoyed, going outside and enjoying the sunlight. (TV:  Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe Doctor later got Martha and Mickey a wedding gift which \"reacted badly with champagne\" and sent Francine \"to the ceiling\". (COMIC: Tesseract)\n\nFrancine was met by River Song to talk about her history with the Tenth Doctor, alongside Jackie Tyler, Sylvia Noble and Wilfred Mott. (PROSE: Judge, Jury and Executioner)\n\nFrancine was an uptight, critical and demanding woman. She was curious about what happened to Martha twelve hours before the events of Lazarus' experiment (TV:  The Lazarus Experiment [+]Stephen Greenhorn, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and was very suspicious of the Doctor and his relationship with her daughter. Before she was captured and tortured by the Master, she deeply disliked the Doctor, being antagonistic and cynical towards him, and wanted to know who he was and what he was doing with Martha. She trusted people who told her the Doctor was dangerous and went as far to agree for them to tap the phonelines whilst she was talking to Martha. (TV: 42 [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) She even let this carry on after the Master was elected. However, when she realised had Mister Saxon been lying to her the whole time, she became filled with remorse at the harm she had unwittingly caused to her family and the whole world. (TV:  The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nFrancine was irritated and embarrassed by Clive's relationship with Annalise, which she thought made the family look ridiculous. (TV:  Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) She soon got back together with her ex after being tormented and tortured by the Master who she came to hate and despise for his evil. After the events of the Year That Never Was, her feelings towards the Doctor changed significantly and she no longer disliked him as she came to respect him, realising that she had judged him unfairly. (TV:  Last of the Time Lords [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)",
