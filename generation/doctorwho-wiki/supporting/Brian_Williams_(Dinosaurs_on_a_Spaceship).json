  "content": "Brian Williams was the father of Rory Williams, the father-in-law of Amy Pond and paternal grandfather of River Song and Anthony Williams. When River married the Eleventh Doctor, he became the Doctor's grandfather-in-law.\n\nBrian attended Leadworth Primary School's nativity play one year in the 1990s when his son was cast as Joseph. He commented that Rory and Amelia Pond, who had substituted as Mary, made a \"lovely couple\", which their friend, Mels Zucker, agreed with. (COMIC: Imaginary Enemies [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nBrian was not present when the TARDIS dramatically materialised in the middle of his son's wedding reception, and was not introduced to the Doctor that evening. (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nBrian and the rest of Amy and Rory's families and friends were under the belief that the couple honeymooned in Thailand, (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) when in fact they travelled through space and time aboard the TARDIS (TV: The Big Bang [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., A Good Man Goes to War [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) and honeymooned on an interstellar cruise ship (TV: A Christmas Carol [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2010 (BBC One, 2010).) and on a planet which was on a honeymoon with an asteroid. (TV: Death of the Doctor [+]Russell T Davies, The Sarah Jane Adventures series 4 (CBBC, 2010).)\n\nBrian first met the Eleventh Doctor when the TARDIS materialised around him while he was attempting to help Rory and Amy change a ceiling light bulb at their house. The Doctor had taken Rory and Amy along with Queen Nefertiti of Egypt and John Riddell to 2367 to investigate a ship that was headed straight to Earth and would reach it in six hours. Upon entering, they immediately found it contained dinosaurs. The Doctor did not realise that the TARDIS had materialised around Brian and had taken the latter aboard until after the TARDIS landed on the spaceship.\n\nWhile looking at the main engines of the ship, the Doctor, Rory and Brian were taken to Solomon by his robots. Solomon had killed all the Silurians on this Silurian Ark and forced the Doctor to repair his legs so he could make off with the cargo. Discovering he had a few hours until the ISA launched missiles at the ship and unable to pilot the ark, Solomon took the most valuable thing on the ship identified by his IV system, Nefertiti. The Doctor magnetised the ark, trapping Solomon's ship that was inside. The Doctor released it once he put the signal of the Silurian Ark inside Solomon's ship. The ISA missiles destroyed Solomon. Rory and Brian, who possessed the same gene chain, were able to pilot the Ark to safety with the parallel pilot compartments. The Doctor returned everyone home, and gave Brian a sense of adventure when he saw the Earth from space.\n\nBrian began travelling around the world and sending homemade postcards back to his son and daughter-in-law. Among the postcards was one from the planet Siluria, to which he had travelled with the Doctor and the dinosaurs aboard the Silurian Ark. (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nBrian lived in London, in reasonably close proximity to his son and daughter-in-law's home. He watched and recorded the Shakri cubes during their slow invasion of Earth, and started \"Brian's log\", describing any changes. During Amy and Rory's anniversary, he noted their clothes were different after they ran into the Doctor and realised they had gone on a trip in the TARDIS.\n\nLater, at the time of the cubes' activation, he helped Rory at the hospital. While searching for medical supplies, two \"orderlies\" took him aboard the Shakri ship. The Doctor rescued Brian, and Rory, who had followed him on board. He restored the millions of humans whom the cubes had put into cardiac arrest, destroying the ship in doing so.\n\nOn Brian's urging, the Doctor took Amy and Rory back as full-time companions, as travelling with him was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The Doctor invited Brian to travel again in the TARDIS with his family, but Brian declined. He said that someone had to tend to Amy and Rory's plants. (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).) However, this would be the last time Brian saw them. A week after, he was tending to the Williams' home, feelingly lonely without them. Curiously, it was then he heard the doorbell, and upon opening the door, a man named Anthony gave Brian a letter, written by Rory many years before. The letter explained his and Amy's fate, that they were trapped in New York City without hope of return some fifty years before his own birth, that he thought of Brian as the best father in the world, and that Anthony was his grandson, whom Rory and Amy had adopted in 1946. Brian embraced Anthony after finishing the letter. (WC: P.S. [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who mini-episodes series 7 (2012).)\n\nAs documented in The Time Lord Letters, Brian remained philosophical but vague about Amy and Rory's fate despite, for all intents and purposes to the public, their complete disappearance, alluding to his knowledge of their fate; when asked, he claimed the pair were fine and having fun somewhere away from the hectic pace of modern life. He was noted as keeping the Williams' home preserved if they ever did return. (PROSE: The Time Lord Letters [+]Justin Richards, BBC Books (2015).)\n\nAt some point in his life Brian owned a caravan and parked it at Rory and Amy's house. Rory suggested they use it for a road trip to Barry Island, but the Doctor hooked it up to the TARDIS and took it to Florana. (COMIC: Summer Wholiday [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor included Brian when he wrote about his adventure on the ark filled with dinosaurs in his diary. (PROSE: The Doctor's Diary [+]Moray Laing, The Official 50th Anniversary Annual (Penguin Group, 2013). Page 8.)\n\nAccording to Rory, Brian disliked travelling to other places as it made him anxious; however, following his adventure aboard the Silurian Ark he began travelling quite often and shared his travels through postcards with his son and daughter-in-law.\n\nBrian loved his son, Rory, but didn't seem to have very much faith in him until their adventure with the Eleventh Doctor. He liked his daughter-in-law Amy and noted that Rory was a lucky man. During the adventure, Brian bonded with Rory and realised that Amy was as lucky to have him as Rory was to have her. Brian was more confused than frightened when the Doctor took them to a spaceship full of dinosaurs, unable to fully believe that it was really happening. Although he did not fully understand what was going on, Brian did show that he was capable of picking up small details, telling the Doctor that he and Rory could pilot the ship after hearing the Doctor mention something about a gene chain. He also displayed delight about getting the chance to pilot a spaceship, finally opening his mind to the fact that what he was experiencing was really happening and not in his imagination. (TV: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nWhen the Doctor returned to Earth, Brian seemed comfortable in his presence and devoted himself to keeping an eye on the cubes at the Doctor's request. He displayed some concern about what happened to the Doctor's companions if they stayed with him for too long, but despite this he encouraged Amy and Rory to continue their travels with the Time Lord. (TV: The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012).)\n\nIn The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., when Brian asked the Doctor what happened to the people who travelled with him, the Doctor explained that some left him, some got left behind, and admitted that some, \"not many but some,\" died. He then promised Brian, \"Never them.\" In the very next story, The Angels Take Manhattan [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., Amy and Rory would meet a bitter-sweet fate, where Rory was sent back in time by a Weeping Angel, and Amy decided to join him so he wouldn't be alone. They lived their lives together in the past and eventually died in their eighties, some time prior to 2012.\n\nIt has not been seen on-screen if or how Brian learned of their fate. This was not originally to be the case, however. P.S. was envisioned as a live action mini-episode coda to the events of the September 2012 portion of series 7, particularly The Angels Take Manhattan. However, according to its writer, Chris Chibnall, it was cancelled when Mark Williams proved unavailable to reprise his role of Brian.[1] Its storyboards were then animated, and narration was commissioned from Arthur Darvill. Ultimately the scene was made public by the BBC as a webcast that was uploaded following the broadcast of The Angels Take Manhattan.\n\nP.S. reveals that a week after Rory and Amy left with the Doctor, Brian, having been watering the plants as he said he would in The Power of Three [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2012)., answered a knock at the door to discover an American man in his sixties, who gave Brian a letter and walked in. Brian sat in the living room and read the letter, revealing it was from Rory, explaining that he and Amy are alive and well, but stuck; they can't come back. However, he assures Brian that he and Amy had a wonderful life in New York City, \"fifty years before [Rory] was born,\" and adopted a son, Anthony Brian Williams, who was the man who delivered the letter to Brian. When all was revealed, Brian went to Anthony and welcomed him with a warm embrace. Although available online, this minisode has never been released as an extra on DVD or Blu-ray.\n\nNevertheless, this unproduced minisode is evidently still viewed as part of Doctor Who continuity by authors, as Anthony Williams has had presence in many other sources, such as About the Authors, Rory's Story, and The Lonely Assassins, which are in direct continuity with P.S..",
