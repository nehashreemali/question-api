  "content": "GANYMEDES (Ganymede) was a handsome Trojan prince who was carried off to heaven by Zeus in the shape of an eagle where he was appointed as cup-bearer of the\n        gods.\n        Ganymedes was also placed amongst the stars as the constellation Aquarius, his ambrosial mixing cup as Crater, and\n        the eagle as Aquila.\n        Ganymedes was often portrayed as the god of homosexual love and as such appears as a playmate of the love-gods\n        Eros (Love) and Hymenaios (Hymenaeus) (Marital Love).\n\nGanymedes was depicted in Greek vase painting as a handsome youth. In scenes of his abduction he holds a\n        rooster (a lover's gift), hoop (a boy's toy), or lyre. When portrayed as the cup-bearer of the gods he pours\n        nectar from a jug. In sculpture and mosaic art Ganymedes usually appears with shepherd's crock and a Phrygian\n        cap.\n\nThe boy's name was derived from the Greek words ganumai \"gladdening\" and\n        mêdon or medeôn, \"prince\" or \"genitals.\" The name may have\n        been formed to contain a deliberate double-meaning.\n\n[1.1] TROS (Homer Iliad 20.232, Hesiod Catalogues of Women Frag 102, Homeric Hymn\n          5.203, Diodorus Siculus 4.75.3, Suidas)\n        [1.2] TROS & KALLIRHOE (Apollodorus\n          3.141)\n        [2.1] LAOMEDON (The Little Iliad Frag 7)\n\nGANYME′DES (Ganumêdês). According to Homer and others, he was a son of Tros by\n        Calirrhoë, and a brother of Ilus and Assaracus; being the most beautiful of all mortals, he was carried off\n        by the gods that he might fill the cup of Zeus, and live among the eternal gods. (Hom. Il. xx. 231,\n        &c.; Pind. Ol. 1. 44, xi. in fin.; Apollod. iii. 12. § 2.) The traditions about Ganymedes,\n        however, differ greatly in their detail, for some call him a son of Laomedon (Cic. Tusc. i. 22; Eurip.\n        Troad. 822), others a son of Ilus (Tzetz. ad Lycph. 34), and others, again, of Erichthonius or\n        Assaracus. (Hygin. Fab. 224, 271.) The manner in which he was carried away from the earth is likewise\n        differently described; for while Homer mentions the gods in general, later writers state that Zeus himself\n        carried him off, either in his natural shape, or in the form of an eagle, or that he sent his eagle to fetch\n        Ganymedes into heaven. (Apollod. l. c. ; Virg. Aen. v. 253; Ov. Met. x. 255; Lucian,\n        Dial. Deor. 4.) Other statements of later date seem to be no more than arbitrary interpretations\n        foisted upon the genuine legend. Thus we are told that he was not carried off by any god, but either by Tantalus\n        or Minos, that he was killed during the chase, and buried on the Mysian Olympus. (Steph. Byz. s. v.\n        Arpalia; Strab. xiii. p. 587 ; Eustath. ad Hom. pp. 986, 1205.) One tradition, which has a somewhat\n        more genuine appearance, stated that he was carried off by Eos. (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. iii. 115.)\n        There is, further, no agreement as to the place where the event occurred. (Strab., Steph. Byz. ll. cc.,\n        Horat. Carm. iii. 20, in fin.) The early legend simply states that Ganymedes was carried off that he\n        might be the cupbearer of Zeus, in which office he was conceived to have succeeded Hebe (comp. Diod. iv. 75;\n        Virg. Aen. i. 28) : but later writers describe him as the beloved and favourite of Zeus, without\n        allusion to his office. (Eurip. Orest. 1392; Plat. Phaedr. p. 255; Xenoph. Symp.\n        viii. 30; Cic. Tusc. iv. 33.) Zeus compensated the father for his loss with the present of a pair of\n        divine horses (Hom. Il. v. 266, Hymn. in Ven. 202, &c.; Apollod. ii. 5. § 9 ; Paus. v. 24.\n        § 1 ), and Hermes, who took the horses to Tros, at the same time comforted him by informing him that by the\n        will of Zeus, Ganymedes had become immortal and exempt from old age. Other writers state that the compensation\n        which Zeus gave to Tros consisted of a golden vine. (Schol. ad Eurip. Orest. 1399; Eustath. ad\n          Hom. p. 1697.) The idea of Ganymedes being the cupbearer of Zeus (urniger) subsequently gave\n        rise to his identification with the divinity who was believed to preside over the sources of the Nile (Philostr.\n        Vit. Apoll. vi. 26; Pind. Fragm. 110. ed. Böckh.), and of his being placed by astronomers\n        among the stars under the name of Aquarius. (Eratosth. Catast. 26; Virg. Georg. iii. 304;\n        Hygin. Fab. 224; Poet. Astr. ii. 29.) Ganymedes was frequently represented in works of art as\n        a beautiful youth with the Phrygian cap. He appears either as the companion of Zeus (Paus. v. 24. § 1), or\n        in the act of being carried off by an eagle, or of giving food to an eagle from a patera. The Romans called\n        Ganymnedes by a corrupt form of his name Catamitus. (Plaut. Men. i. 2. 34.) Ganymedes was an\n        appellation sometimes given to handsome slaves who officiated as cupbearers. (Petron. 91; Martial,\n        Epigr. ix. 37; Juv. v. 59.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Iliad 20. 232 ff (trans.

And we all accuse the\n        Kretans (Cretans) of concocting the story about Ganymedes (Ganymede).

So Minos stayed as a guest with Tros,\n        both giving and receiving presents, and he ordered Tros to summon his sons, so that he might see them and give\n        them presents too. But Tros said that they had gone on a hunt. [So] Minos too wanted to hunt with them. At first\n        [Tros] sent one of his attendants into the place where the boys were hunting, around the Granikos (Grenicus)\n        river; but Minos, having sent out his ships a little beforehand to the river, came later to the sons and saw\n        Ganymedes and fell in love with him. And having given out orders to the Kretans (Cretans) and snatched the boy,\n        he him in the ship and sailed away. The place was called Harpagia. Minos took the boy and went to Krete (Crete).\n        The boy to ease his pain killed himself with a sword, and Minos buried him in the temple.
