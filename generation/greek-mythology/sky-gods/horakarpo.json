  "content": "KARPO (Carpo) was the goddess of the fruits of the earth. She was numbered amongst the Horai (Seasons). Karpo\n        was worshipped in Athens alongside the goddesses Auxo (Growth) and Hegemone\n        (Leader).\n\nKarpo (Fruiting) was probably originally just a title of Demeter as the\n        goddess of the earth's fruits, just as Auxo (Growth) was a title of Persephone as the goddess of spring growth, and Hegemone (Leader) was\n        a title of Artemis or Hekate as\n        leader of the processions the Mysteries.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 9. 35. 2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Athenians from of old have worshipped two Kharites (Charites, Graces), Auxo (Growth) and Hegemone\n        (Queen). [The third] Karpo (Carpo, Fruit) is the name, not of a Kharis (Charis), but of a Hora. [N.B. All three\n        were probably Horai.] The other Hora is worshipped together with Pandrosos by the Athenians, who call the\n        goddess Thallo (New Shoots).\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 183 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The names of the Horae . . . Auxo (Growth), Eunomia (Order), Pherusa (Substance), Carpo (Fruit), Dice\n        (Justice), Euporia (Abundance), Irene (Peace), Orthosie (Prosperity), Thallo (Green-shoots).\"\n        [N.B. These appear to be three distinct sets of Horai.]\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Athenaeus 2.38.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
