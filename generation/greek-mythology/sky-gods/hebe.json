  "content": "HEBE was the goddess of youth and the cupbearer of the gods who served ambrosia at the heavenly feast. She was\n        also the patron goddess of the young bride and an attendant of the goddess Aphrodite.\n\nHerakles (Heracles) received Hebe in marriage upon his ascension to Olympos, a wedding which reconciled the\n        hero with Hebe's mother Hera.\n\nIn Greek vase painting Hebe was depicted either as the bride of Herakles, or the cupbearer of the gods,\n        pouring ambrosia from a pitcher. Sometimes she had wings like the goddesses Iris and Nike.\n\nHebe's male counterpart was the boy Ganymedes and her opposite number was Geras (Old Age). She may have been equated with Selene's daughter Pandeia. Her Roman name was Juventas.\n\nZEUS & HERA (Hesiod Theogony 921, Homer Odyssey 11. 601, Pindar Isthmian Ode 4, Apollodorus 1.13,\n          Pausanias 2.13.3, Aelian On Animals 17.46, Hyginus Preface)\n\nALEXIARES, ANIKETOS (by Herakles)\n        (Apollodorus 2.158)\n\nHEBE (Hêbê), the personification of youth, is described as a daughter of Zeus and Hera (Apollod. i.\n        3. § 1.), and is, according to the Iliad (iv. 2), the minister of the gods, who fills their cups with\n        nectar; she assists Hera in putting the horses to her chariot (v. 722); and she bathes and dresses her brother\n        Ares (v. 905). According to the Odyssey (xi. 603; comp. Hes. Theog. 950), she was married to Heracles\n        after his apotheosis. Later traditions, however, describe her as having become by Heracles the mother of two\n        sons, Alexiares and Anticetus (Apollod. ii. 7. § 7), and as a divinity who had it in her power to make\n        persons of an advanced age young again. (Ov. Met. ix. 400, &c.) She was worshipped at Athens, where\n        she had an altar in the Cynosarges, near one of Heracles. (Paus. i. 19. § 3.) Under the name of the female\n        Ganymedes (Ganymeda) or Dia, she was worshipped in a sacred grove at Sicyon and Phlius. (Paus. ii. 13. § 3;\n        Strab. viii. p. 382.)\n\nAt Rome the goddess was worshipped under the corresponding name of Juventas, and that at a very early time, for\n        her chapel on the Capitol existed before the temple of Jupiter was built there; and she, as well as Terminus, is\n        said to have opposed the consecration of the temple of Jupiter. (Liv. v. 54.) Another temple of Juventas, in the\n        Circus Maximus, was vowed by the consul M. Livius, after the defeat of Hasdrubal, in B. C. 207, and was\n        consecrated 16 years afterwards. (Liv. xxxvi. 36 ; comp. xxi. 62; Dionys. iv. 15, where a temple of Juventas is\n        mentioned as early as the reign of Servius Tullius; August. de Civ. Dei, iv. 23; Plin. H.

((lacuna)) Tritonis [Athena] brought many toys of cunning\n        workmanship shrewdly carved, and many came from the guardian of the Apian Isthmos (Isthmus) [Poseidon], toys\n        more precious than gold.

Aye, he danced also the maiden Hebe herself\n        drawing the nectar; when he looked at the Satyroi (Satyrs), with voiceless hands he acted Ganymedes, or when he\n        saw the Bakkhante (Bacchante) women, he showed them goldenshoe Hebe in a picture having sense without\n        words.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 25. 430 ff : \n        \"Ganymedes walked among the stars to pour out their [the gods'] wine, the sweet nectar of Olympos\n        (Olympus), and there he was handing the cups which were the lot of virgin Hebe.\"\n        [N.B.

Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"A second hill on which the Phliasians [of Phlios in Argolis] have their citadel and their sanctuary of\n        Hebe.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 13. 3 :\n        \"On the Phliasian citadel [at Phlios in Argolis] is a grove of cypress trees and a sanctuary which from\n        ancient times has been held to be peculiarly holy. The earliest Phliasians named the goddess to whom the\n        sanctuary belongs Ganymeda; but later authorites call her Hebe, whom Homer mentions in the duel between Menelaos\n        (Menelaus) and Alexandros (Alexander), saying that she was the cup-bearer of the gods; and again he says, in the\n        descent of Odysseus to Haides, that she was the wife of Herakles. Olen [a legendary Greek poet], in his hymn to\n        Hera, says that Hera was reared by the Horai (Horae, Seasons), and that her children were Ares and Hebe. Of the\n        honours that the Phliasians pay to this goddess the greatest is the pardoning of suppliants. All those who seek\n        sanctuary here receive full forgiveness, and prisoners, when set free, dedicate their fetters on the trees in\n        the grove. The Phliasians also celebrate a yearly festival which they call Kissotomoi (Ivy-cutters).\n        There is no image, either kept in secret of openly displayed, and the reason for this is set forth in a sacred\n        legend of theirs though on the left as you go out is a temple of Hera with an image of Parian marble.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 9. 2 :\n        \"A temple of Hera [at Mantinea in Arkadia], Praxiteles made the images; Hera is sitting, while Athene and\n        Hera's daughter Hebe are standing by her side.\"\n\nAelian, On Animals 17. 46 (trans. Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Mnaseas in his work On Europe [Greek writer C3rd B.C.] says that there is a temple to Herakles\n        (Heracles) and to his spouse [Hebe] whom poets celebrate as the daughter of Hera. Now they say that in the\n        precincts of these temples a large number of tame birds are kept, adding that these birds are cockerels and\n        hens. They feed and consort together according to their sex, are fed at the public expense, and are consecrated\n        to the aforesaid gods. The hens feed in the temple of Hebe while their mates feed in the temple of Herakles. And\n        a never-failing channel of clear water flows between them. Now on the one hand not a single hen ever appears in\n        the temple of Herakles. On the other hand at the season of mating the cockerels fly across the channel and after\n        consorting with the hens return to their own quarters at the side of the god whom they serve, cleansed by the\n        water that separates the sexes. And so to begin with, as a natural result of this union eggs are laid; later on\n        when the hens have warmed them and hatched the chicks, the cockerels carry off the male birds to rear them,\n        while the hens make it their business to rear their daughters.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 6. 65 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Hercules' [Herakles'] wife [Juventas-Hebe] stood there; life's bloom shimmered in her face. ‘If my\n        mother [Juno-Hera] told me,’ she says, ‘to leave all heaven I would not stay against my mother's\n        will. So now I will not fight her over this time's name [i.e. in a dispute over which goddess gave her name to\n        the month of June], but coax and almost play petitioner. I'd rather keep my rights of possession by pleading,\n        and perhaps my case might win your favour. Mother owns the golden Capitol [of Rome] with her joint shrine, and\n        rightly holds the summit with Jove [Zeus]. But my whole glory comes from a month's origin; I am anxious for my\n        only honour. Does it matter, Roman, that you gave Hercules' wife the month's name, and posterity remembers? This\n        land owes me something, too, on my great husband's [Herakles'] account. He drove the captured cattle here, where\n        Cacus found no defence in his father's [Hephaistos' (Hephaestus')] gift of flame and dyed Aventine dirt with\n        blood. I pass to more recent times. Romulus divided the people by years into two sections: one was readier to\n        give counsel, one to fight, one age advises war, one wages it. So he decreed and marked the months with the same\n        token: June's for JUNiors, the seniors' month precedes.’\n        She spoke. They would have hotly disputed the claim and cloaked family piety with wrath : Concordia (Harmony)\n        [Harmonia] arrived [to settle the dispute].\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
