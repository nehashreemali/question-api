  "content": "KLEIO (Clio) was one of the nine Mousai (Muses), the goddesses of music, song and dance. In the Classical era,\n        when the Mousai were assigned specific literary and artistic spheres, Kleio was named Muse of history. In this\n        guise she was represented holding an open scroll or seated beside a chest of books. Her name was derived from\n        the Greek verb kleô, \"to make famous\" or \"celebrate.\"\n\n[1] ZEUS & MNEMOSYNE (Hesiod Theogony 75,\n            Apollodorus 1.13, Diodorus Siculus 4.7.1, Orphic Hymn 76)\n\n[1] HYMENAIOS (Greek Lyric V\n            Licymnius)\n          [2] HYAKINTHOS (by Pieros) (Apollodorus 1.16)\n\nHesiod, Theogony 75 ff (trans.

Campbell, Vol. Greek\n          Lyric V) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"Moreover Kleio (Clio) the Mousa (Muse) fell in love with a man, according to Likymnios (Licymnius), and\n        some think Hymenaios (Hymenaeus) was her son.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 13 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Mnemosyne [bore to Zeus] the Mousai (Muses), the eldest of whom was Kalliope (Calliope), followed by Kleio\n        (Clio), Melpomene, Euterpe, Erato, Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), Ourania (Urania), Thaleia (Thalia), and\n        Polymnia.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 16 :\n        \"Aphrodite, furious with Kleio (Clio) (who had chided her for loving Adonis), caused her to fall in love\n        with Magnes' son Pieros (Pierus).

Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric III)\n          (Greek lyric C6th to 5th B.C.) :\n        \"For there was a shrine of the Mousai (Muses) here [south of Apollon's temple at Delphoi (Delphi)] where\n        the spring wells up, and that is why they used this water for libation and lustrations, as Simonides says :\n        ‘where the holy water of the lovely-haired Moisai (Muses) is drawn from below for lustration. Overseer of\n        the holy lustration-water, golden Kleio (Clio), who give the water-drawers from the ambosial cave the fragrant\n        lovely water sought with many prayers.’\"\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 3 (trans.

Oldfather) (Greek historian C1st\n          B.C.) :\n        \"Hesiod even gives their names [the Mousai's (Muses')] when he writes : ‘Kleio (Clio), Euterpe, and\n        Thaleia (Thalia), Melpomene, Terpsikhore (Terpsichore) and Erato, and Polymnia, Ourania (Urania), Kalliope\n        (Calliope) too, of them all the most comely.’\n        To each of the Mousai (Muses) men assign her special aptitude for one of the branches of the liberal arts, such\n        as poetry, song, pantomimic dancing, the round dance with music, the study of the stars, and the other liberal\n        arts . . . For the name of each Mousa, they say, men have found a reason appropriate to her . . . Kleio (Clio)\n        is so named because the praise which poets sing in their encomia bestows great glory (kleos) upon those\n        who are praised.\"\n        \n        Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica 3. 15 ff (trans.
