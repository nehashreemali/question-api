  "content": "HYMENAIOS (Hymenaeus) was the god of weddings or, more specifically, of the wedding hymn sung by the bride's\n        train as she was escorted to the house of the groom.\n        Hymenaios was numbered amongst the Erotes, the youthful, winged gods of love. As a god of song he was usually\n        described as a son of Apollon and one of the Mousai (Muses).\n\nHymenaios is depicted in Greek art as a winged child carrying a bridal torch in his hand.\n\n[1.1] KLEIO (Licymnius Frag 768A)\n        [1.2] MAGNES (Antoninus Liberalis 23)\n        [1.3] OURANIA (Nonnus Dionysiaca33.64)\n        [1.4] APOLLON & KALLIOPE \n        [1.5] APOLLON & TERPSIKHORE\n        [2.1] DIONYSOS (Seneca Medea 110)\n\nHYMEN or HYMENAEUS (Hymên or Hymenaios), the god of marriage, was conceived as a handsome youth, and\n        invoked in the hymeneal or bridal song. The names originally designated the bridal song itself, which was\n        subsequently personified. The first trace of this personification occurs in Euripides (Troad. 311), or\n        perhaps in Sappho ( Fragm. 73, p. 80, ed. Neue). The poetical origin of the god Hymen or Hymenaeus is\n        also implied in the fact of his being described as the son of Apollo and a Muse, either Calliope, Urania, or\n        Terpsichore. (Catull. lxi. 2; Nonn. Dionys. xxxiii. 67; Schol. Vatic. ad Eurip. Rhes. 895, ed.\n        Dindorf; Schol. ad Pind. Pyth. iv. 313; Alciphron, Epist. i. 13; Tzetz. Chil. xiii.\n        599.) Hence he is mentioned along with the sons of the Muses, Linus and Ialemus, and with Orpheus. Others\n        describe him only as the favourite of Apollo or Thamyris, and call him a son of Magnes and Calliope, or of\n        Dionysus and Aphrodite. (Suid. s. v. Thamurris; Anton. Lib. 23; Serv. ad Aen. iv. 127, ad\n          Virg. Eclog. viii. 30.) The ancient traditions, instead of regarding the god as a personification of the\n        hymeneal song, speak of him as originally a mortal, respecting whom various legends were related. According to\n        an Argive tradition, Hymenaeus was a youth of Argos, who, while sailing along the coast of Attica, delivered a\n        number of Attic maidens from the violence of some Pelasgian pirates, and was afterwards praised by them in their\n        bridal songs, which were called, after him, hymeneal songs. (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1157.) The Attic\n        legends described him as a youth of such delicate beauty, that he might be taken for a girl. He fell in love\n        with a maiden, who refused to listen to him; but in the disguise of a girl he followed her to Eleusis to the\n        festival of Demeter. He, together with the other girls, was carried off by robbers into a distant and desolate\n        country. On their landing, the robbers laid down to sleep, and were killed by Hymenaeus, who now returned to\n        Athens, requesting the citizens to give him his beloved in marriage, if he restored to them the maidens who had\n        been carried off by the robbers. His request was granted, and his marriage was extremely happy. For this reason\n        he was invoked in the hymeneal songs. (Serv. ad Aen. i. 655, ad Virg. Eclog. viii. 30.)\n        According to others he was a youth, and was killed by the breaking down of his house on his wedding-day whence\n        he was afterwards invoked in bridal songs, in order to be propitiated (Serv. l. c.); and some related\n        that at the wedding of Dionysus and Ariadne he sang the bridal hymn, but lost his voice (Serv. l. c.;\n        comp. Scriptor Rerum Mythic. pp. 26, 148, 229; Ov. Met. ii. 683, who makes him a son of Argus\n        and Perimele; Terent. Adelph. v. 7, 8.) According to the Orphic legends, the deceased Hymenaeus was\n        called to life again by Asclepius. (Apollod. iii. 10. § 3.) He is represented in works of art as a youth,\n        but taller and with a more serious expression than Eros, and carrying in his hand a bridal torch.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nSappho, Fragment 111 (trans.

The umpire in the game was Ganymedes, cupbearer of Kronides (Cronides) [Zeus], holding the garland.\n        Lots were cast for the shots of unmixed wine, with varied movements of the fingers [i.e. a finger game similar\n        to ‘rock, paper, scissors’ played to determine who goes first]: these they held out, these they\n        pressed upon the root of the hand closely joined together.

Second, crafty Eros took hold of the lovely cup in a\n        masterly way, and secretly in his heart prayed to Kyprogeneia (Cyprogenea) [Aphrodite]; then with a steady eye\n        on the mark, he shot the liquid into the distance--the dewy nectar went straight, unswerving, and curved round\n        until it fell from the air upon the forehead above the temple with a loud plop. The elegant statue rang, and the\n        basin echoed the sound of victory for the golden son of Kyprogeneia. Ganymedes laughing handed the dainty\n        garland to Eros. Quickly he picked up the beautiful necklace and lifted the globe, and kept the two prizes of\n        their cleverdrop game.
