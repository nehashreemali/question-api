  "content": "HIMEROS was the god of sexual desire and one of the Erotes, the winged gods of love. When Aphrodite was born\n        from the sea-foam's she was greeted by the twin loves Eros and Himeros. Some say\n        Aphrodite was born pregnant with the twins and birthed them as soon as she was born. The pair remained her\n        constant companions acting as agents of her divine power.\n\nHimeros was depicted as winged youth or child. He often appears alongside Eros in scenes of Aphrodite's birth,\n        fluttering around the goddess as she reclines in her conch-shell bed. At others times he appears as one of a\n        triad of love gods with Eros and Pothos (Love and Passion). When paired with Eros\n        he was perhaps identified with Anteros (Reciprocal Love).\n\n[1.1] APHRODITE (born together with the goddess?) (perhaps suggested in Hesiod Theog 176)\n        [1.2] APHRODITE (Ovid Fasti 4.1)\n\nHI′MERUS (Himeros), the personification of longing love, is first mentioned by Hesiod (Theog.\n        201), where he and Eros appear as the companions of Aphrodite. He is sometimes seen in works of art representing\n        erotic circles; and in the temple of Aphrodite at Megara, he was represented by Scopas, together with Eros and\n        Pothus.

Lamb) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[Plato invents philosophical etymologies to explain the names of the gods :]\n        Sokrates (Socrates) : Let us inquire what thought men had in giving them [the gods] their names . . . The first\n        men who gave names [to the gods] were no ordinary persons, but high thinkers and great talkers . . .\n        [Of the Loves :] The name himeros (longing) was given to the stream (rhous) which most draws\n        the soul; for because it flows with a rush (hiemenos) and with a desire for things and thus draws\n        the soul on through the impulse of its flowing, all this power gives it the name of himeros. And the\n        word pothos (yearning) signifies that it pertains not to that which is present, but to that which is\n        elsewhere (allothi pou) or absent, and therefore the same feeling which is called himeros when\n        its object is present, is called pothos when it is absent.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 43. 6 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"There is also [statues in the temple of Aphrodite at Megara] Peitho (Persuasion) and another goddess whom\n        they name Paregoron (Consoler), works of Praxiteles.

Hesiod is perhaps suggesting that Eros and Himeros were born with or from the goddess at her birth.]\n\nThe Anacreontea, Fragment 57 (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric II) (Greek lyric C5th\n          or C4th B.C.) :\n        \"[Aphrodite] roaming over the waves like sea-lettuce, moving her soft-skinned body in her voyage over the\n        white calm sea, she pulls the breakers along her path. Above her rosy breast and below her soft neck a great\n        wave divides her skin. In the midst of the furrow, like a lily wound among violets, Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite]\n        shines out from the clam sea. Over the silver on dancing dolphins ride guileful Eros (Love) and laughing Himeros\n        (Desire), and the chorus of bow-backed fish plunging in the waves sports with the Paphian where she swims.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 11. 8 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Among the reliefs decorating the throne in the temple of Zeus at Olympia :] On the pedestal supporting\n        the throne and Zeus with all his adornments are works in gold : . . .

Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Out of the sea was rising lovely-crowned Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite], foam-blossoms still upon her hair;\n        and round her hovered smiling witchingly Himeros (Desire), and danced the Kharites (Charites, Graces)\n        lovely-tressed.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
