  "content": "THE EROTES were the winged gods of love, a multiplication of the god Eros. Their number was varied--Hesiod\n        describes a pair, Eros (Love) and Himeros (Desire) who were present at the birth of Aphrodite, while later\n        writers add a third, Pothos (Passion), to create a triad of goldings. Twin Erotes, Eros (Love) and Anteros (Love\n        Reciprocated) were often portrayed gracing the scales of love. The lyric poets multiplied them into a numberless\n        host of winged putti.\n        The Erotes were purely creatures of poetic invention with no distinct mythology of their own.\n\nIn Greek vase painting the love-spirits were depicted as winged youths or children. In later art, especially\n        mosaic, they were portrayed as putti (winged infants).\n\n[1] APHRODITE (Pindar Eulogies Frag 122,\n          Aeschylus Suppliants 1039, Orphic Hymn 55, Ovid Fasti 4.1, Ovid Heroides 7.59, Seneca Phaedra 274, Valerius\n          Flaccus 7.171, Colluthus 82, Nonnus Dionysiaca 33.4)\n        [2] THE NYMPHAI (Philostratus the Elder\n          1.6)\n        [3] Assorted Parents (Other references)\n\nANTEROS The god of mutual love, or love returned. He was sometimes also the\n        avenger of unrequited love.\n\nEROS (1) The ancient god of love and the agent of natural procreation. He\n        was the eldest of the Erotes born at the creation of the universe.\n\nEROS (2) The god of love. He was the most mischievous of the Erotes, who randomly shot\n        out love-inducing darts from his golden bow.\n\nHEDYLOGOS (Hedylogus) The god of sweet-talk and flattery.\n\nHERMAPHRODITOS (Hermaphroditus) The hermaphroditic god. He was once a\n        handsome winged youth, like the other Erotes, but his form was merged with that of the Nymphe Salmakis in answer\n        to her prayers that the two should never be apart.\n\nHIMEROS The god of sexual desire who accompanied Aphrodite from the moment of\n        her birth.\n\nHYMENAIOS (Hymenaeus) The god of the wedding ceremony.\n\nPindar, Eulogies Fragment 122 (trans.

And in the train of their mother are Pothos (Desire) and she\n        to whom nothing is denied, winning Peitho (Persuasion); and to Harmonia (Harmony) has been given a share of\n        Aphrodite, and to the whispering touches of the Erotes (Loves).\"\n\nPlato, Cratylus 400d & 419e - 420b (trans. Lamb) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[Plato invents philosophical etymologies to explain the names of the gods :]\n        Sokrates (Socrates) : Let us inquire what thought men had in giving them [the gods] their names . . . The first\n        men who gave names [to the gods] were no ordinary persons, but high thinkers and great talkers . . .\n        [Of the Loves :] The name himeros (longing) was given to the stream (rhous) which most draws\n        the soul; for because it flows with a rush (hiemenos) and with a desire for things and thus draws\n        the soul on through the impulse of its flowing, all this power gives it the name of himeros. And the\n        word pothos (yearning) signifies that it pertains not to that which is present, but to that which is\n        elsewhere (allothi pou) or absent, and therefore the same feeling which is called himeros when\n        its object is present, is called pothos when it is absent. And erôs (love) is so called\n        because it flows in (esrei) from without, and this flowing is not inherent in him who has it, but\n        is introduced through the eyes; for this reason it was in ancient times called esros, from\n        esrein--for we used to employ omicron instead of omega--but now it is called erôs\n        through the change of omicron to omega.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 936 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"You certainly are not inspired by Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite] or the gentle Erotes (Loves).\"\n\nCallimachus, Fragment 116 (from Hephaestion 15. 17) (trans.

Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[In the temple of Aphrodite at Megara :] There is also [a statue of] Peitho (Persuasion) and another\n        goddess whom they name Paregoron (Consoler), works of Praxiteles.

Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Aphrodite] mother of the Erotes (Loves), whom banquetings delight.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 6 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting in Neapolis (Naples) :] See, Erotes (Loves) are\n        gathering apples; and if there are many of them, do not be surprised. For they are the children of the Nymphai\n        (Nymphs) and govern all mortal kind, and they are many because of the many things men love; and they say that it\n        is Eros Ouranios (Heavenly Love) which manages the affairs of the gods in heaven. Do you catch aught of the\n        fragrance hovering over the garden, or are your senses dull? But listen carefully; for along with my description\n        of the garden the fragrance of the apples also will come to you.\n        Here run straight rows of trees with space left free between them to walk in, and tender grass borders the\n        paths, fit to be a couch for one to lie upon. One the ends of the branches apples golden and red and yellow\n        invite the whole swarm of Erotes to harvest them. The Erotes' quivers are studded with gold, and golden also are\n        the darts in them; but bare of these and untrammelled the whole band flits about, for they have hung their\n        quivers on the apple trees; and in the grass lie their broidered mantles, and countless are the colours thereof.\n        Neither do the Erotes wear crowns on their heads, for their hair suffices. Their wings, dark blue and purple and\n        in some cases golden, all but beat the very air and make harmonious music. Ah, the baskets into which they\n        gather the apples! What abundance of sardonyx, of emeralds, adorns them, and the pearls are true pearls; but the\n        workmanship must be attributed to Hephaistos! But the Erotes need no ladders wrought by him to reach the trees,\n        for aloft they fly even to where the apples hang.\n        Not to speak of the Erotes that are dancing or running about or sleeping, or how they enjoy eating the apples,\n        let us see what is the meaning of these others. For here are four of them, the most beautiful of all, withdrawn\n        from the rest; two of them are throwing an apple back and forth, and the second pair are engaged in archery, one\n        shooting at his companion and the latter shooting back. Nor is there any trace of hostility in their faces;\n        rather they offer their breasts to each other, in order that the missiles may pierce them there, no doubt. It is\n        a beautiful riddle; come, let us see if perchance I can guess the painter's meaning. This is friendship, my boy,\n        and yearning of one for the other. For the Erotes who play ball with the apple are beginning to fall in love,\n        and so the one kisses the apple before he throws it, and the other holds out his hands to catch it, evidently\n        intending to kiss it in his turn if he catches it and then to throw it back; but the pair of archers are\n        confirming a love that is already present. In a word, the first pair in their play are intent on falling in\n        love, while the second pair are shooting arrows that they may not cease from desire.\n        As for the Erotes further away, surrounded by many spectators, they have come at each other with spirit and are\n        engaged in a sort of wrestling-match. I will describe the wrestling also, since you earnestly desire it. One has\n        caught his opponent by lighting on his back, and seizes his throat to choke him, and grips him with his legs;\n        the other does not yield, but struggles upright and tries to loosen the hand that chokes him by bending back one\n        of the fingers till the other no longer hold or keep their grip. In pain the Eros whose finger is being bent\n        back bites the ear of the opponent. The Erotes who are spectators are angry with him for this as unfair and\n        contrary to the rules of wrestling, and pelt him with apples.\n        And let not the hare yonder escape us, but let us join the Erotes in hunting it down. The creature was sitting\n        under the trees and feeding on the apples that fell to the ground but leaving many half-eaten; but the Erotes\n        hunt it from place to place and make it dash headlong, one by clapping his hands, another by screaming, another\n        by waving his cloak; some fly above it with shouts, others on foot press hard after it, and one of these makes a\n        rush in order to hurl himself upon it. The creature changes its course and another Eros schemes to catch it by\n        the leg, but it slips away from him just as it is caught. So the Erotes, laughing, have thrown themselves on the\n        ground, one on his side, one on his face, others on their backs, all in attitudes of disappointment. But there\n        is no shooting of arrows at the hare, since they are trying to catch it alive as an offering most pleasing to\n        Aphrodite. For you know, I imagine, what is said of the hare, that it possesses the gift of Aphrodite [i.e.\n        fertility] to an unusual degree. At any rate it is said of the female that while she suckles the young she has\n        borne, she bears another litter to share the same milk; forthwith she conceives again, nor is there any time at\n        all when she is not carrying young. As for the male, he not only begets offspring in the way natural to males,\n        but also himself bears young, contrary to nature. And perverted lovers have found in the hare a certain power to\n        produce love, attempting to secure the objects of their affection by a compelling magic art. [I.e. By making a\n        present of a hare they exercise a sort of constraint upon the beloved; Erotes were often depicted carrying\n        hares.]\n        But let us leave these matters to men who are wicked and do not deserve to have their love returned, and do you\n        look, please, at Aphrodite. But where is she and in what part of the orchard yonder? Do you see the overarching\n        rock from beneath which springs water of the deepest blue, fresh and good to drink, which is distributed in\n        channels to irrigate the apple trees? Be sure that Aphrodite is there, where the Nymphai (Nymphs), I doubt not,\n        have established a shrine to her, because she has made them mothers of Erotes and therefore blest in their\n        children. The silver mirror, that gilded sandal, the golden brooches, all these have been hung there not without\n        purpose. They proclaim that they belong to Aphrodite, and her name is inscribed on them, and they are said to be\n        gifts of the Nymphai. And the Erotes bring first-fruits of the apples, and gathering around they pray to her\n        that their orchard may prosper.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 9 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[From a description of an ancient Greek painting of a marsh :] No wonder that the swans are ridden by\n        Erotes (Loves); for these gods are mischievous and prone to sport with birds, so let us not pass by without\n        noticing either their riding or the waters in which this scene lies. Here indeed is the most beautiful water of\n        the marsh, issuing direct from a spring, and it forms a swimming-pool of exceeding beauty. In the midst of the\n        pool amaranth flowers are nodding this way and that, sweet clusters that pelt the water with their blossoms. It\n        is among these clusters that the Erotes are riding sacred birds with golden bridles, one giving free rein,\n        another drawing in, another turning, another driving around the goal-post. Just imagine that you hear them\n        urging on their swans, and threatening and jeering at one another--for this is all to be seen in their faces.\n        One is trying to give his neighbour a fall, another has done it, still another is glad enough to have fallen\n        from his bird that he may take a bath in the race-course. On the banks round about stand more musical swans,\n        singing the Orthian strain, I think, as befits the contestants. The winged youth you see is an indication that a\n        song is being sung, for he is the wind Zephyros (the West Wind) and he gives the swans the keynote of their\n        song.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 16 : \n        \"[From a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] Pasiphae is in love with the bull\n        and begs Daidalos (Daedalus) to devise some lure for the creature; and he is fashioning a hollow cow like a cow\n        of the herd to which the bull is accustomed . . . He sits before the framework of the cow and he [symbolically]\n        uses Erotes (Love-Gods) as his assistants in the device so as to connect with it something of Aphrodite. Of the\n        Erotes, my boy, those are visible who turn the drill, and those by Zeus that smooth with the adze portions of\n        the cow which are not yet accurately finished, and those that measure off the symmetrical proportions on which\n        craftsmanship depends. But the Erotes that work with the saw surpass all conception and all skill in drawing and\n        colour. For look! The saw has attacked the wood and is already passing through it, and these Erotes keep it\n        going, one on the ground, another on the staging, both straightening up and bending forward in turn. Let us\n        consider this movement to be alternate; one has bent low as if about to rise up, his companion has risen erect\n        as if about to bend over; the one on the ground draws his breath into his chest, and the one who is aloft fills\n        his lungs down to his belly as he presses both hands down on the saw.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 30 :\n        \"[Description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] The body of Kapaneus (Capaneus)\n        is laid out [on the pyre] . . . his wife, Euadne (Evadne), has determined to die for love of him . . . she\n        throws herself into the fire itself . . . The Erotes (Loves), making this task their own, kindle the pyre with\n        their torches and claim that they do not defile their fire, but that they will find it sweeter and more pure,\n        when they have used it in the burial of those who have dealt so well with love.\"\n\nCallistratus, Descriptions 5 (trans.
