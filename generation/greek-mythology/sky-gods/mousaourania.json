  "content": "OURANIA (Urania) was one of the nine Mousai (Muses), the goddesses of music, song and dance. In the Classical\n        era, when the Mousai were assigned specific artistic and literary spheres, Ourania was named Muse of astronomy\n        and astronomical writings. In this guise she was depicted pointing at a celestial globe with a rod.\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & MNEMOSYNE\n        (Hesiod Theogony 75, Apollodorus 1.13, Diodorus Siculus 4.7.1, Orphic Hymn 76)\n\n[1.1] LINOS (Homerica Fragments 1, Folk Songs Frag 880)\n        [1.2] LINOS (by Amphimaros) (Pausanias 9.29.5, Suidas s.v. Linos)\n        [1.3] LINOS (by Apollon) (Hyginus Fabulae\n          161)\n        [1.4] LINOS (by Hermes) (Suidas s.v.\n          Linos')\n        [2.1] HYMENAIOS (Pindar Dirges Frag 139, Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 24.77 & 34.67)\n\nURA′NIA (Ourania). One of the Muses, a daughter of Zeus by Mnemosyne. (Hes. Theog. 78 ; Ov.\n        Fast. v. 55.) The ancient bard Linus is called her son by Apollo (Hygin. Fab. 161), and\n        Hymenaeus also is said to have been a son of Urania. (Catull. lxi. 2.) She was regarded, as her name indicates,\n        as the Muse of Astronomy, and was represented with a celestial globe to which she points with a little staff.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 75 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The Mousai (Muses) sang who dwell on Olympos, nine daughters begotten by great Zeus, Kleio (Clio) and\n        Euterpe, Thaleia (Thalia), Melpomene and Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), and Erato and Polymnia (Polyhymnia) and\n        Ourania (Urania) and Kalliope (Calliope).\"\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 3 (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric IV) (C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[The poet] has his share in the violet-haired Mousai (Muses).The light of man's excellence, however, does\n        not diminish with his body; no, the Mousa (Muse) fosters it. And the sweet-voiced cock [the poet] of lyre-ruling\n        Ourania (Urania).\"\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 5 :\n        \"You if any motal now alive will rightly assess the sweet gift [poetry] of the violet-crowned Mousai\n        (Muses) sent for your adornment: rest your righteous mind in ease from its cares and come! turn your thoughts\n        this way: with the help of the slim-waisted Kharites your guest-friend, the famous servant of Ourania (Urania)\n        with her golden headband, has woven a song of praise and sends it from the sacred island [Keos (Ceos)] to your\n        distinguishing city: he wishes to pour a flood of speech from his heart in praise of Hiero.\"\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 6 :\n        \"Thanks to Nike (Victory) the hymn of song-ruling Ourania (Urania) gives praise in an ode sung before your\n        house [i.e. in honour of an athletic victor].\"\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 16 :\n        \"Since fine-throned Ourania (Urania) has sent me from Pieria [a cult centre of the Muses] a golden\n        cargo-boat laden with glorious songs.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 13 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Mnemosyne [bore to Zeus] the Mousai (Muses), the eldest of whom was Kalliope (Calliope), followed by Kleio\n        (Clio), Melpomene, Euterpe, Erato, Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), Ourania (Urania), Thaleia (Thalia), and\n        Polymnia.\"\n\nPlato, Phaedrus 259 (trans. Fowler) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"When they [the grasshoppers] die they go and inform the Mousai (Muses) in heaven who honours them on\n        earth. They win the love of Terpsikhore (Terpsichore) for the dancers by their report of them; . . . of Kalliope\n        (Calliope) the eldest Mousa (Muse) and of Ourania (Urania) who is next to her, for the philosophers, of whose\n        music the grasshoppers make report to them; for these are the Mousai who are chiefly concerned with heaven and\n        thought, divine as well as human, and they have the sweetest utterance.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 7. 1 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian C1st\n          B.C.) :\n        \"Hesiod even gives their [the Mousai's (Muses')] names when he writes : ‘Kleio (Clio), Euterpe, and\n        Thaleia (Thalia), Melpomene, Terpsikhore (Terpsichore) and Erato, and Polymnia, Ourania (Urania), Kalliope\n        (Calliope) too, of them all the most comely.’\n        To each of the Mousai (Muses) men assign her special aptitude for one of the branches of the liberal arts, such\n        as poetry, song, pantomimic dancing, the round dance with music, the study of the stars, and the other liberal\n        arts . . . For the name of each Mousa (Muse), they say, men have found a reason appropriate to her: . . .\n        Ourania (Urania), because men who have been instructed by her she raises aloft to heaven (ouranos), for\n        it is a fact that imagination and the power of thought lift men's souls to heavenly heights.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 76 to the Muses (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus . . .

Sandys) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"But in another song did three goddesses [Mousai (Muses)] lull to rest the bodies of their sons. The first\n        of these [Terpsikhore (Terpsichore)] sang a dirge over the clear-voiced Linos (Linus) [personification of the\n        lamentation song]; and the second [Ourania (Urania)] lamented with her latest strains Hymenaios (Hymenaeus)\n        [personification of the wedding song], who was seized by Moira (Fate), when first he lay with another in\n        wedlock.\"\n\nGreek Lyric V, Folk Songs Frag 880 (from Scholiast B on Homer's Iliad) (trans.\n          Campbell) (Greek lyric B.C.) : \n        \"Oh Linos (Linus), honoured by the gods--for you were the first to whom the immortals gave a song for men\n        to sing with clear voice; Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon] killed you in anger, but the Mousai (Muses) mourn for\n        you.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 9. 29. 5 (trans.

She was, they say, the nurse of the Mousai\n        (Muses). So her portrait is here, and after it is Linos (Linus) on a small rock worked into the shape of a cave.\n        To Linos every year they sacrifice as to a hero before they sacrifice to the Mousai. It is said that this Linos\n        was a son of Ourania (Urania) and Amphimaros (Amphimarus), a son of Poseidon.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 161 (trans.
