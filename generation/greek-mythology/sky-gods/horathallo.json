  "content": "THALLO was the goddess of spring buds and green shoots. She was numbered amongst the Horai (Seasons). Thallo\n        was worshipped in Athens alongside the goddess Pandrosos (All-Dew).\n\nThallo was probably identified with the Hora Eirene whom Hesiod titles\n        thallô in the Theogony.\n\nTHALLO (Thallô), one of the Attic Horae, who was believed to grant prosperity to the young shoots of\n        plants, and was also invoked in the political oath which the citizens of Athens had to take. (Paus. ix. 35.\n        § 1; Pollux, Onom. viii. 106.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 9. 35. 2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Athenians from of old have worshipped two Kharites (Charites, Graces), Auxo (Growth) and Hegemone\n        (Queen). [The third] Karpo (Carpo) is the name, not of a Kharis, but of a Hora. The other Hora is worshipped\n        together with Pandrosos (All Dewy) by the Athenians, who call the goddess Thallo (Green Shoots).\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 183 (trans.
