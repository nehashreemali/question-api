  "content": "TERPSIKHORE (Terpsichore) was one of the nine Mousai (Muses), the goddesses of music, song and dance. In the\n        classical era, when the Mousai were assigned specific literary and artistic spheres, Terpsikhore was named Muse\n        of choral song and dancing, and depicted with a lyre and plectrum.\n\nHer name means \"Delighting in Dance\" from the Greek words terpsis \"to delight\" and\n        khoros \"dance\".\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & MNEMOSYNE\n        (Hesiod Theogony 75, Apollodorus 1.13, Diodorus Siculus 4.7.1, Orphic Hymn 76)\n\n[1.1] THE SEIRENES (by Akheloios) (Apollonius Rhodius 4.892,\n          Nonnus Dionysiaca 13.313)\n        [2.1] LINOS (Pindar Dirges Frag 139)\n        [2.2] LINOS (by Apollon) (Suidas s.v.\n          Linos)\n\nHesiod, Theogony 75 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The Mousai (Muses) sang who dwell on Olympos, nine daughters begotten by great Zeus, Kleio (Clio) and\n        Euterpe, Thaleia (Thalia), Melpomene and Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), and Erato and Polymnia (Polyhymnia) and\n        Ourania (Urania) and Kalliope (Calliope).\"\n\nPindar, Isthmian Ode 2. 6 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"Then the Mousa (Muse) [i.e. the poet] had not yet bowed to love of gain, or made herself a hireling\n        journeyman; nor in the market clad in masks of silver did honey-tongues Terpsikhore (Terpsichore) barter her\n        gentle-voiced and sweetly sun refrains. But now she bids us pander to that word the Argive spoke, to sadly near\n        to truth : ‘Money, money makes man.’\"\n\nPindar, Dirges Fragment 139 (trans. Sandys) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"But in another song did three goddesses [Mousai (Muses)] lull to rest the bodies of their sons. The first\n        of these [Terpsikhore (Terpsichore)] sang a dirge over the clear-voiced Linos (Linus) [personification of the\n        lamentation song].\"\n\nCorinna, Fragment 655 (trans.

Fowler) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"When they [the grasshoppers] die they go and inform the Mousai (Muses) in heaven who honours them on\n        earth. They win the love of Terpsikhore (Terpsichore) for the dancers by their report of them.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 13 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Mnemosyne [bore to Zeus] the Mousai (Muses), the eldest of whom was Kalliope (Calliope), followed by Kleio\n        (Clio), Melpomene, Euterpe, Erato, Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), Ourania (Urania), Thaleia (Thalia), and\n        Polymnia.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 892 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The clear-voiced Seirenes (Sirens), Akheloos' (Achelous') daughters, used to bewitch with their seductive\n        melodies whatever sailors anchored there. Lovely Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), one of the Mousai (Muses), has borne\n        them to Akheloos, and at one time they had been handmaids to Demeter's gallant Daughter [Persephone], before she\n        was married, and sung to her in chorus.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 7. 1 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian C1st\n          B.C.) :\n        \"Hesiod even gives their names [the Mousai's (Muses')] when he writes : ‘Kleio (Clio), Euterpe, and\n        Thaleia (Thalia), Melpomene, Terpsikhore (Terpsichore) and Erato, and Polymnia, Ourania (Urania), Kalliope\n        (Calliope) too, of them all the most comely.’\n        To each of the Mousai (Muses) men assign her special aptitude for one of the branches of the liberal arts, such\n        as poetry, song, pantomimic dancing, the round dance with music, the study of the stars, and the other liberal\n        arts . . . For the name of each Mousa (Muse), they say, men have found a reason appropriate to her . . .\n        Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), because she delights (terpein) her disciples with the good things which come\n        from education.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 76 to the Muses (trans.
