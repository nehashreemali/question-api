  "content": "EUTERPE was one of the nine Mousai (Muses), the goddesses of music, song and dance. In the Classical era, when\n        the Mousai were assigned specific literary and artistic spheres, Euterpe was named Muse of lyric poetry. Her\n        attribute was the double-flute. Euterpe's name was derived from the Greek words eu- and\n        terpô, meaning \"giver of much delight.\"\n\nZEUS & MNEMOSYNE (Hesiod Theogony 75, Apollodorus 1.13, Diodorus Siculus 4.7.1, Orphic Hymn 76)\n\nHesiod, Theogony 75 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The Mousai (Muses) sang who dwell on Olympos, nine daughters begotten by great Zeus, Kleio (Clio) and\n        Euterpe, Thaleia (Thalia), Melpomene and Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), and Erato and Polymnia (Polyhymnia) and\n        Ourania (Urania) and Kalliope (Calliope).\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 76 to the Muses (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus . . . Kleio (Clio), and Erato who charms the sight, with thee, Euterpe,\n        ministering delight : Thalia flourishing, Polymnia famed, Melpomene from skill in music named : Terpsikhore\n        (Terpsichore), Ourania (Urania) heavenly bright.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 13 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Mnemosyne [bore to Zeus] the Mousai (Muses), the eldest of whom was Kalliope (Calliope), followed by Kleio\n        (Clio), Melpomene, Euterpe, Erato, Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), Ourania (Urania), Thaleia (Thalia), and\n        Polymnia.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 18 :\n        \"Euterpe--or Kalliope (Calliope), according to some--bore to the river Strymon Rhesos (Rhesus), whom\n        Diomedes murdered at Troy.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 7. 1 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian C1st\n          B.C.) :\n        \"Hesiod even gives their names [the Muses'] when he writes : ‘Kleio, Euterpe, and Thaleia, Melpomene,\n        Terpsikhore and Erato, and Polymnia, Ourania, Kalliope too, of them all the most comely.’\n        To each of the Mousai (Muses) men assign her special aptitude for one of the branches of the liberal arts, such\n        as poetry, song, pantomimic dancing, the round dance with music, the study of the stars, and the other liberal\n        arts . . . For the name of each Mousa (Muse), they say, men have found a reason appropriate to her . . .\n        Euterpe, because she gives to those who hear her sing delight (terpein) in the blessings which\n        education bestows.\"\n\nCicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 18 (trans. Rackham) (Roman rhetorician C1st B.C.)\n          :\n        \"What about the sons of goddesses? . . . [such as] Rhesus, whose mother [i.e. Euterpe] was a Musa\n        (Muse).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
