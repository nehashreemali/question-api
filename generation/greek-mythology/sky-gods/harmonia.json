  "content": "HARMONIA was the goddess of harmony and concord. She was a daughter of Ares and Aphrodite and as such presided\n        over both marital harmony, soothing strife and discord, and harmonious action of soldiers in war. Late Greek and\n        Roman writers sometimes portrayed her as harmony in a more abstract sense--a deity who presided over cosmic\n        balance.\n\nHarmonia was born of Aphrodite's adulterous affair with the god Ares. She was awarded to Kadmos (Cadmus), hero\n        and founder of Thebes, in a wedding attended by the gods. Hephaistos\n          (Hephaestus), however, was still angry over his wife's betrayal and presented Harmonia with a cursed\n        necklace, dooming her descendants to endless tragedy.\n\nFollowing a string of family catastrophes the couple emmigrated to Illyria where they battled various local\n        tribes to found a new kingdom. Later the pair were transformed into serpents by the gods and carried off the\n        Islands of the Blessed to live in peace.\n\nIn ancient Greek vase painting Harmonia appears in two scenes--firstly as the bride of Kadmos and secondly as\n        a goddess in the retinue of the bridal Aphrodite.\n        Harmonia's opposite number was Eris (Strife).\n\n[1.1] ARES & APHRODITE (Hesiod Theogony 933, Apollodorus 3.25, Pausanias 9.5.2, Diodorus Siculus 4.2.1 &\n          5.48.2, Hyginus Preface, Statius Thebaid 2.265, Nonnus Dionysiaca 3.373)\n        [1.2] APHRODITE (Aeschylus Suppliants\n          1035)\n        [2.1] ZEUS & ELEKTRA\n        (Diodorus Siculus 5.48.2)\n\n[1.1] INO, SEMELE, AGAUE,\n        AUTONOE, POLYDOROS (by Kadmos) (Hesiod Theogony 975, Apollodorus 3.25, Diodorus\n          Siculus 4.2.1, Hyginus Fabulae 179, Nonnus Dionysiaca 5.88)\n        [1.2] INO, SEMELE (by Kadmos)\n        (Pausanias 9.5.2)\n\nHARMO′NIA (Harmonia), a daughter of Ares and Aphrodite, or, according to others, of Zeus and Electra, the\n        daughter of Atlas, in Samothrace. When Athena assigned to Cadmus the government of Thebes, Zeus gave him\n        Harmonia for his wife, and all the gods of Olympus were present at the marriage. Cadmus on that day made her a\n        present of a peplus and a necklace, which he had received either from Hephaestus or from Europa. (Apollod. iii.\n        4. § 2.) Other traditions stated that Harmonia received this necklace (hormor) from some of the gods,\n        either from Aphrodite or Athena. (Diod. iv. 48, v. 49; Pind. Pyth. iii. 167; Stat. Theb. ii.\n        266; comp. Hes. Theog. 934; Hom. Hymn. in Apoll. 195.) Those who described Harmonia as a\n        Samothracian related that Cadmus, on Iris voyage to Samothrace, after being initiated in the mysteries,\n        perceived Harmonia, and carried her off with the assistance of Athena. When Cadmus was obliged to quit Thebes,\n        Harmonia accompanied him. When they came to the Encheleans, they assisted them in their war against the\n        Illyrians, and conquered the enemy. Cadmus then became king of the Illyrians, but afterwards he and Harmonia\n        were metamorphosed into dragons and transferred to Elysium; or, according to others, they were carried thither\n        in a chariot drawn by dragons. (Apollod. iii. 5. § 4; Eurip. Bacch. 1233; Ov. Met. iv.\n        562, &c.) Harmonia is renowned in ancient story chiefly on account of the fatal necklace she received on her\n        wedding day. Polyneices, who inherited it, gave it to Eriphyle, that she might persuade her husband, Amphiaraus,\n        to undertake the expedition against Thebes. (Apollod. iii. 6. § 2 ; Schol. ad Pind. Pyth. iii.\n        167.) Through Alcmaeon, the son of Eriphyle, the necklace came into the hands of Arsinoë, next into those\n        of the sons of Phegeus, Pronous and Agenor, and lastly into those of the sons of Alcomaeon, Amphoterus and\n        Acarnan, who dedicated it in the temple of Athena Pronoea at Delphi. (Apollod. iii. 7. §§ 5-7.) The\n        necklace had wrought mischief to all who had been in possession of it, and it continued to do so even after it\n        was dedicated at Delphi. Phayllus, the tyrant, stole it from the temple to gratify his mistress, the wife of\n        Ariston. She wore it for a time, but at last her youngest son was seized with madness, and set fire to the\n        house, in which she perished with all her treasures. (Athen. vi. p. 232; Parthen. Erot. 25.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 933 (trans.

Peitho covered Kadmos with\n        a dark mist from heels to head, and led him through the unseeing city in search of the king's hospitable hall,\n        guiding his way by the Paphian's [Aphrodite's] command. There some bird, perched under the delicate shadow of a\n        gray olive-tree,--it was a crow, she opened her loud beak inspired, and reproached the young man for a laggard,\n        that the bridegroom walked to his bride Harmonia with dawdling foot. She flapt her wings and rallied him soundly\n        : ‘So Kadmos is a baby, or only a novice in love! Eros (Love) is a quick one, and knows nothing of slow\n        bride-grooms! Forgive me, Peitho (Persuasion)--your Kadmos dallies, Aphrodite is in haste! Hot Eros (Love) calls\n        you, bridegroom--you plod along like a laggard, and why? . . . Peitho is your guide, not Artemis, Peitho the\n        friend of marriage, the nurse of the baby Erotes (Loves). Cease your toiling and moiling, enjoy Harmonia and\n        leave Europa to her bull! Make hast, and Elektra (Electra) will welcome you; from her hands sure enough you will\n        be laden with a cargo of wedded love, if you leave the business part of the delights to Aphrodite. She is the\n        Kyprian's (Cyprian's) daughter, guarded for your bride-chamber, another Kypris (Cypris) for you to receive. You\n        will thank the crow, and you will call me the bird of marriage, the prophet of the Erotes! No, I am wrong,\n        Kypris inspired me; the Paphian made me foretell your nuptials . . .’\n        Kadmos walked along the winding highroad; and when the king's allhospitable court came into view, far-seen upon\n        its lofty pillars, Peitho pointed a finger to indicate the corresponding words in her mind, and by this\n        voiceless herald showed the house of shining artistry: then the divinity in another shape rose into the sky,\n        shooting through it with winged shoe.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 3. 373 - 4. 292 : \n        \"Father Zeus sent his quick messenger Maia's son [Hermes] on outspread wings to Elektra's (Electra's)\n        house, that he might offer Harmonia to Kadmos (Cadmus) for the harmony of wedlock--that maiden immigrant from\n        heaven, whom Ares the wife-thief begat in secret love with Aphrodite. The mother did not nurse it--she was\n        ashamed of the baby which told its own tale of the furtive bed; but away from the bosom of the sky she carried\n        the suckling, lying in her arm, to the fostering house of Elektra [the Queen of Samothrake], when the childbed\n        Horai (Horae, Seasons) had just delivered her baby still wet, when her breasts were tight and swollen with the\n        gushing white sap. Elektra received the bastard daughter with equal rights, and joined the newborn girl on one\n        breast with her newborn Emathion, held with equal love and care her two different nurslings in her arm. So\n        Elektra then with loving breast foster-mothered her brace of newborn babes, the boy and the girl, and cherished\n        them with equal care. Often she pressed to her with open hand and loving arm her baby son and his age-mate girl,\n        on this side and that taking turns of the sap from her rich breast; and she set on her knees the manly boy with\n        the womanly girl, letting out the gold of her lowered gown so as to join thigh parted wide from neighbour thigh;\n        or singing songs for a sleep-charm, lulled both her babies to slumber with foster-mother's art, while she\n        stretched her arm enclosing the children's necks, made her own knee their bed, fluttered the flap of her garment\n        fanning the two faces, to keep the little ones cool, and quenched the waves of heat as the hand-made wind poured\n        outs its breath against it.\n        While Kadmos sat near the prudent queen, into the house came Hermes in the shape of a young man, unforeseen,\n        uncaught, eluding the doorkeeper with his robber's foot . . . Into a corner of the house he led her in surprise\n        to tell his secrets and spoke in the language of men :\n        ‘. . . From heaven I have been sent by your bedfellow [Zeus], the guests' protector ruling in the heights,\n        on behalf of your own god-fearing guest. Then do you also obey your Kronion, and let your daughter Harmonia go\n        along with her yearsmate Kadmos as his bride, without asking for bridal gifts, Grant this grant to Zeus and the\n        Blessed ones; for when the immortals were in distress, this stranger saved them all by his music [bewitching the\n        monster Typhoeus]. This man has helped your bedfellow in trouble, this man opened the day of freedom for\n        Olympos! Let not your girl bewitch you with mother-loving groans, but give her in marriage to Kadmos our\n        Saviour, in obedience to Kronion (Cronion) [Zeus] and Ares and Kythereia [Aphrodite].’\n        With these words, finerod Hermes departed, fanning his light wings, and the flat of his extended shoes oared him\n        as quick as the winds of heaven in their course. Nor did the Thrakian (Thracian) lady [Elektra (Electra)], the\n        pilot of the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), disobey his bidding; but she had respect to Zeus, and curving her extended\n        fingers with a significant movement towards Ares' unwedded daughter, she beckoned Harmonia by this clever\n        imitation of speech. The other strained the answering gleam from her eyelids, and saw the round of Elektra's\n        face unsmiling, as her cheeks like silent heralds boded the heavy load of a new unspoken distress.\n        The maiden leapt up and followed her mother into her high-built chamber. Her mother rolled back the bolt of a\n        sevennookshotten chamber sealed with many seals, and crossed the doorstone: her knees trembled restlessly in\n        loving anxiety and fear. She caught and lifted the girl's hand and rosy arm with her own snow-white hand--you\n        might almost say that you saw white-armed Hera holding Hebe's (Youth's) hand.\n        But when treading the floor with her crimson shoes she reached the farthest curve of the resplendent room,\n        Atlas' daughter seated the sorrowful maiden upon a handsome chair; then she in her turn sank upon a\n        silver-shining stool, and declared Kronion's [Zeus'] message to the incredulous girl, and explained everything\n        which she had heard from the Olympian herald disguised in human form. When the maiden heard of this marriage of\n        much wandering and this unstable husband, this homeless man under their roof, she declared she would have no\n        stranger, and refused all that Kadmos' patron proposed on Zeus his father's behalf, that cattle-drover Hermes!\n        She would rather have one of her own city as husband, and away with a carryhouse mate and a wedding without\n        wedding-gifts! Then clasping her foster-mother's hand with her won sorrowing palm, bathed in tears she burst\n        into reproachful speech : ‘Mother mine, what has possessed you to cast off your own girl? Do you join your\n        own daughter to some upstart fellow like this? What gift will this sailor man put into my hand? Will he give me\n        the ship's hawser for bride-price? I did not know you were for marriage with a vagrant--you, my kind nurse! I\n        have others to woo me, and better ones, of our own city: why must I have a bedfellow with empty hands, naked and\n        bare, a foreign vagrant, a runaway from his father? But you will say he helped your husband Kronion. Why did not\n        the man get from Zeus an Olympian gift of honour, if indeed he was defender of Olympos, as you say? Why did not\n        Hera the consort of Zeus, betroth virgin Hebe to the champion of Zeus? Your husband Zeus who rules in the\n        heights needs no Kadmos. Kronides (Cronides) forgive me--divine Hermes lied in what he said about Father Zeus. I\n        don't know how I can believe that he neglected furious Ares the pilot of warfare, and called in a mortal man to\n        be partner in the game--he the master of world and sky! Here is a great marvel--he locked up all those Titanes\n        (Titans) in the pit, and then wanted Kadmos, to destroy only one! You know how my fathers wedded--two had their\n        sisters. Zeus my father's father possessed the bed of his sister Hera, by the family rule of marriage; both the\n        parents of Harmonia, Ares and Kythereia (Cytherea) [Aphrodite], who mounted one bed, were of one father, another\n        pair of blood-kindred. What miserable necessity! Sisters may have a brother for bedfellow, I must have a\n        banished man!’\n        As she spoke, her mother in distress wiped the raindrops from that mourning face: torn between two, she pitied\n        Harmonia and shrank from the threats of Zeus.\n        But now tricky-minded Aphrodite girt her body in the heart-bewitching cestus-belt, and clothing herself in the\n        love-robe of Peitho (Persuasion) she entered Harmonia's fragrant chamber. She had doffed her heavenly\n        countenance, and put on a form like Peisinoe, a girl of the neighbourhood. As though in love with Kadmos and\n        suffering from some hidden sickness, with but little brightness in her pale face, she chased away the maids; and\n        when Harmonia was alone she sat by her side and said as in shame with deceitful tongue :\n        ‘Happy girl! What a handsome stranger you have in the house! What a man to court you, most blessed of\n        women! What a lovely bedfellow you will see, that no other maiden has won! Surely his blood comes from Assyria!\n        That must be his home, beside the river of that enchanting Adonis, for that lovely young man came from Libanos\n        (Lebanon) where Kythereia dances. No, I was wrong! I don't suppose any mortal womb bred Kadmos; no, he is sprung\n        from Zeus and he has concealed his stock! I know where this young Olympian comes from. If Titan Atlas ever begat\n        Elektra as Maia's sister, here's cousin Hermes without wings come as husband for Harmonia. Then that's why we\n        sing hymns to Kadmilos [Cadmilus, i.e. Hermes]! He has only changed his heavenly shape and still he is called\n        Kadmos. Or if he is some other god in human shape, perhaps Apollon is Emathion's guest in this house.\n        World-famed maiden, you are more blessed than your mother for Olympian desire and Olympian marriage! Here is a\n        great marvel! Zeus Allwise wedded Elektra in secret--Apollon himself woes Harmonia in the light! Happy girl,\n        whom Far-shooter desired! I only wish Apollon would be as eager for marriage with Peisinoe too! I don't say no\n        to Apollon, like Daphne, I can tell you! I will not feel like Harmonia! No, I will leave my inheritance and\n        house and the parents whom I love--I will go on my travels to marriage with Apollon! I remember once a carving\n        like him. For I once went with our father into the house of oracle, and there I saw the Pythian image; and when\n        I saw your vagrant, I thought I saw the statue of Phoibos again in this place. But you will say, Phoibos has a\n        goldgleaming diadem. Kadmos is gold in all his body! If you like, take all my serfs innumerable--for him, I will\n        put in your hands all my gold and silver, I will give royal robes of the Tyrian Sea, and the house of my\n        fathers, if you like; accept, if I dare to say it, my father and mother too, accept all my waiting-women, and\n        give me only this man for my bedfellow! Maiden, why do you tremble? You will sail the seas in the spring-time\n        across the narrow water--but with lovely Kadmos I will traverse the infinite Okeanos (Oceanus) stream in winter!\n        Tremble not at the heavy-rumbling briny swell, because love's cargo will be kept safe on the brine by Aphrodite\n        daughter of the brine. Maiden, you have Kadmos, seek not the throne of Olympos! I desire not the shining\n        Erythraian stone of the Indies [rubies], nor the all-golden tree of the Hesperides, I delight not in the amber\n        of the Heliades, so much as one shadowy night in which this vagrant shall hold Peisinoe in his arms. If you\n        fetch your lineage from Ares, from Aphrodite, your provident mother has found you a marriage well worthy of\n        theirs. I have never beheld such a flower; spring itself blooms in Kadmos by nature's gift. I have seen his\n        rosefinger hand, I have seen his glance distilling sweet honey; the cheeks of his lovebegetting face are red as\n        roses; his feet go twinkling, ruddy brown in the middle, and changing colour at the ends into shining snow; his\n        arms are lilywhite. I will pass the hair, or I may provoke Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon] by blaming the hue of his\n        Therapnaian iris. Whenever he moved his full eyes with their heart-gladdening glance, there was the full moon\n        shining with sparkling light; when he shook his hair and bared his neck, there appeared the morning star! I\n        would not speak of his lips; but Peitho (Persuasion) dwells in his mouth, the ferry of the Erotes (Loves), and\n        pours out honey-sweet speech. Aye, the Kharites (Charites, Graces) manage his whole body: hands and fingers I\n        shrink to judge, or I may find fault with the whiteness of milk.\n        ‘Accept me for your companion, unhappy me! But if I touch the boy's right hand and stoke his tunic I may\n        find comfortable physic for my secret sickness. I may see his neck bare, or press a finger as if unconsciously\n        while he sits; I could gladly die, if he would only slip a willing hand into the orb of my bosom and press my\n        two breasts, and hold his closed lips upon my lips to delight me with brushing kisses. But if I could still hold\n        the boy in my arms, I will pass even to Akheron (Acheron) the River of Pain of my own free will, and with\n        rapture even amid the many lamentations of all-forgetting Lethe, I will tell the dead of my fate, to awaken pity\n        and envy alike in merciless Persephoneia (Persephone); I will teach those grace-breathing kisses to women\n        unhappy in love who died of that lovely fire, I will make the dead jealous, if women still grudge at the Paphian\n        [Aphrodite] in Lethe after their doom.\n        ‘I will go with you if you wish, even as your companion, I tremble not before unfamiliar wanderings.\n        Hard-hearted girl, become the lawful wife to Kadmos; I would be chambermaid to you both, Harmonia and\n        husband.--But again I tremble before you, lest some time I awaken anger and jealousy for your bed tho' you fain\n        would hide it . . . If you are not jealous to find me a physic for my desire, give me this bedfellow for one\n        dawn, yes I beseech you, for the course of one night too; if you grudge it, kill me with your own hand, that I\n        may know rest from carrying this always night and day, fed on the secret places of my heart, this mighty\n        implacable fire!’\n        She said her say, and with her girdle drove bedshy Harmonia to her voyage, stung as with a gladfly and now\n        obedient to desire. She changed her mind, and with divided purpose wished both to have the stranger and to live\n        in her own land. So smitten to the heart with the sting, she spoke : ‘Ah me, who has changed my heart?\n        Save you, my country! Farewell, Emathion and all my house! Farewell grottoes of the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) and\n        Korybantian (Corybantian) cliffs; never again shall I see the revelling companies of my mother's Hekate with\n        their torches in the night. Farewell, maidenhood, I wed my sweet Kadmos! Artemis, be not shocked, I am to cross\n        the swell of the blue brine. But you will say, the deep is pitiless; I care nothing for the maddened surges--let\n        Harmonia and Kadmos drown together, and my mother's sea receive us both. I follow my boy, calling upon the\n        goddesses who have wedded theirs! If my bedfellow carried me to the sunrise this voyage, I will proclaim how\n        Orion loved Erigeneia [Eos the Dawn], and I will recall the match of Kephalos (Cephalus); if I go to the misty\n        sunset, my comfort is Selene (the Moon) herself who felt the same for Endymion upon Latmos.’\n        Such words the girl uttered in mindwandering plaints, and could not be restrained, her mind ravaged with the\n        sting of desire. With drops of grief her face was wet as she kissed Elektra's hand and eyes, her feet and head\n        and breast, and Emathion's eyes, with shamefast lips although he was her brother. She embraced all her\n        handmaids, and caressed lamenting the rows of the lifeless carven doors all round, her bed and the walls of her\n        maiden chamber. Last the girl took up and kissed the dust of her country's soil.\n        And then Elektra took Harmonia by the hand, under the witnessing escort of the gods, and took her undowered to\n        Kadmos as his due, wiping the streaming shower from her face. Early in the morning the traveller received the\n        Kyprian's (Cyprian's) [Aphrodite's] daughter with an old waiting-woman, and left the house, having as the\n        queen's gift a servant to guide him through the city to the sea.\n        When Mene [Selene the Moon] saw the girl following a stranger along the shore above the sea, and boiling under\n        fiery constraint, she reproached Kypris [Aphrodite] in mocking words : ‘So you make war even upon your\n        children, Kypris! Not even the fruit of your womb is spared by the goad of love! Don't you pity the girl you\n        bore, hardheart? What other girl can you pity then, when you drag your own child into passion?--Then you must go\n        wandering too, my darling. Say to your mother, Paphian's child, \"Phaethon [Helios the Sun] mocks you, and\n        Selene (the Moon) puts me to shame.\" Harmonia, love-tormented exile, leave to Mene (the Moon) her\n        bridegroom Endymion, and care for your vagrant Kadmos. Be ready to endure as much trouble as I have, and when\n        you are weary with lovebegetting anxiety, remember lovewounded Selene.’\n        While she was speaking, Kadmos hastened his companions over the shore. He released the back-running hawsers of\n        the forthfaring ship, and shook out the sail to the mild spring breeze, and guided the timbered sea-car across\n        the sea-swell . . . He remained by the steering-oar, but he kept the girl Harmonia untouched sitting on the\n        poop, his companion . . .\n        So Kadmos finished his voyage to Hellas (Greece) . . . Quickly he set out for the Akhaian (Achaean) cities, and\n        left his seafaring. With Harmonia, he conveyed a swarm of seawandering companions turned travellers by land, in\n        horsecarriages and laden wagons, on the way to the oracular sanctuaries [of Delphoi (Delphi)].\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 5. 88 ff : \n        \"The daughters of the Aionians [i.e. of the people of the city of Thebes] struck up Harmonia's\n        marriage-hymn with dances: the dancing girls sand the name of the Thrakian bride, in that palace and its fine\n        bridal chamber. The Paphian [Aphrodite] also, her lovely mother, decorated her daughter's newbuilt bower for\n        Kadmos (Cadmus), while she sang of the god-ordained marriage; her father [Ares] danced with joy for his girl,\n        bare and stript of his armour, a tame Ares! And laid his right arm unweaponed about Aphrodite, while he sounded\n        the spirit of the Erotes (Loves) on his wedding-trumpet answering the panspipes: he had shaken off from his\n        helmet head the plumes of horsehair so familiar in the battlefield, and wreathed bloodless garlands about his\n        hair, weaving a merry song for Eros (Love). Dancing with the immortals came Ismenian Apollon to Harmonia's\n        wedding, while he twangled a hymn of love on his sevenstring harp. The nine Mousai (Muses) too struck up a\n        lifestirring melody: Polymnia nursingmother of the dance waved her arms, and sketched in the air an image of a\n        soundless voice, speaking with hands and moving eyes in a graphic picture of silence full of meaning. Nike\n        (Victory) turned a tripling foot for the pleasure of Zeus, and stood as bridesmaid crying triumph for Kadmos the\n        god's champion; about the bridebed she wove the wedding song with her virgin voice, and moved her gliding steps\n        in the pretty circles of the dance, while she fluttered her wings, shamesfast beside the wings of the Erotes\n        (Loves).\n        A light arose, like a misnamed dawn in the evening, from the splendour no less brilliant of those gleaming\n        torches scattered everywhere. All night long, the merry rout of untiring dancers were singing with clear voices\n        beside the bridal chamber in happy romps; since . . . [text-missing, but probably referring to Hypnos the god of\n        sleep] anxious for a sleepless wedding night had left his familiar wand behind, because that was the rationer of\n        sleep. So Thebes was the Olympian dancing place; and one might see Kadmos and Zeus touching the same table!\n        And now rose the Serpent [the constellation Draco], companion of the northern Waggon, bringing the\n        bride-adorning season to the marriage halls, a messenger with news of things to come: for Harmonia's bridegroom\n        along with his agemate bride was destined to change his human shape for a serpent's.\n        The Blessed, one after another, brought their gifts of honour to Kadmos as he hastened to the chamber. Zeus gave\n        success in all things. Horsemaster Seabluehair [Poseidon] proffered the gifts of the sea, in honour to his\n        sister Hera the renowned, for she was Ares mother. Hermes gave a sceptre, Ares a spear, Apollon a bow.\n        Hephaistos lifted upon Harmonia's head a crown plumed with precious stones of many colours, a golden circlet\n        hung over her temples. Goldenthrone Hera provided a jewel-set throne. Aphrodite wishing to delight Ares in the\n        deep shrewdness of her mind, clasped a golden necklace showing place about the girl's blushing neck, a clever\n        work of Hephaistos (Hephaestus) set with sparkling gems in masterly refinement [and unbeknowest to the goddess\n        cursed by Hephaistos as punishment for her affair with Ares] . . .\n        Soon Harmonia yoked by the cestus-girdle that guides wedded desire, carried in her womb the seed of many\n        children whom she brought forth soon one by one: turn by turn she was delivered of her teeming burden by the\n        birth of daughters, after four times nine circuits had been fulfilled. First Autonoe leapt from her mother's\n        fruitful womb, her first birthpangs after nine months' course with child. Then came Ino to be her sister, the\n        beautiful consort of Athamas who bore him two children. Third appeared Agaue (Agave), who afterwards married\n        with the giant stock and bore a son like to her fangform husband [Ekhion (Echion)]. Then Semele fourth of the\n        daughters grew up, the image of the Kharites (Charites, Graces) in her lovestriking looks, preserved for Zeus;\n        although youngest of the sisters, she alone was given by nature the prerogative of unconquerable beauty. Last of\n        all Harmonia added a little son to the brood of sisters, and made Kadmos happy--Polydoros (Polydorus), the\n        morning star of the Aionian [Theban] nation, younger than rosycheek Semele.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 8. 231 ff : \n        \"Kadmos (Cadmus) will know that heavenly harp [of Apollon] at sight, for he saw it, and heard the melodious\n        tones, when it made music at his festal board for the wedding of Harmonia with a mortal.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 13. 333 ff : \n        \"Libyans . . . whose home was in the western clime, the cities of wandering Kadmos (Cadmus) near the\n        clouds. For there on a time dwelt Kadmoscarried by contrary winds, on the voyage with his Sithonian bride\n        Harmonia still a maiden. The rumour of her beauty bred war and armed hostile neighbours. The Libyan army named\n        her Kharis (Charis, Grace), for the Bistonian girl bloomed like another Kharis of this world and even more\n        dainty, and the Kharites' (Charites') Hill of Libya had its name from her. So the Maurusian people of the desert\n        because of her beauty were stung with mad lust of robber warfare, and took arms, a horrible barbarian Ares wild\n        with passion. But Harmonia's mate held his shield before her, grasping in hand the spear of Libyan Athena to\n        defend his beloved wife, and put to flight the whole nation of western Aithiopians (Ethiopians), with armed Zeus\n        as ally, with Ares and Kythereia (Cytherea) [Aphrodite].\n        And there as they say, by the Tritonian Lake, Kadmos the wanderer lay with rosycheek Harmonia, and the Nymphai\n        (Nymphs) Hesperides made a song for them, and Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite] together with the Erotes (Loves)\n        decked out a fine bed for the wedding, hanging in the bridal chamber golden fruit from the Nymphai's garden, a\n        worthy lovegift for the bride; rich clusters of their leaves Harmonia and Kadmos twined through their hair, amid\n        the abundance of their bridechamber, in place of the wedding-roses. Still more dainty the bride appeared wearing\n        these golden gifts, the boon of golden Aphrodite. Her mother's [actually her foster mother Elektra's\n        (Electra's)] father the stooping Libyan Atlas awoke a tune of the heavenly harp to join the revels, and with\n        tripping foot he twirled the heavens round like a ball, while he sang a stave of harmony himself not far away.\n        Kadmos too, in memory of the love of his wedded bride, paid his footing in the Libyan land by building a hundred\n        cities, and he gave to each lofty walls inaccessible, with towers of stone.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 13. 407 ff : \n        \"For there [on the island of Samothrake (Samothrace)] Ares, Zeus and Kythereia (Cytherea) [Aphrodite] gave\n        to Kadmos (Cadmus), the god's ally, Harmonia heaven's kin and sea's blood, to be his lawful wife without\n        brideprice.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 44. 106 ff : \n        \"[As Kadmos (Cadmus) was sacrificing to Zeus :] A serpent crept with its coils, surrounding the throat of\n        Kadmos like a garland, twining and trailing a crooked swollen collar about it in a lacing circle but doing no\n        harm--the gentle creature crept round his head like a trailing chaplet, and his tongue licked his chin all over\n        dribbling the friendly poison from open mouth, quite harmless; a female snake girdled the temples of Harmonia\n        like a wreath of clusters in her yellow hair.

Far back the story runs, but I will pursue the well-known tale\n        of woes, whence came it that a new gift had such terrible power.\n        The Lemnian [Vulcan-Hephaistos], so they of old believed, long time distressed at Mars' [Ares'] deceit and\n        seeing that no punishment gave hindrance to the disclosed armour, and the avenging chains removed not the\n        offence [of his affair with Hephaistos' then wife Aphrodite], wrought this for Harmonia on her bridal day to be\n        the glory of her dower. Thereat, though taught mightier tasks, the Cyclopes labour, and the Telchines famed for\n        their handiwork helped in friendly rivalry of their skill; but for himself the sweat of toil was heaviest. There\n        forms he a circlet of emeralds glowing with a hidden fire, and adamant stamped with figures of ill omen, and\n        Gorgon eyes, and embers left on the Sicilian anvil from the last shaping of a thunderbolt, and the crests that\n        shine on the heads of green serpents; then the dolorous fruit of the Hesperides and the dread gold of Phrixus'\n        fleece; then divers plagues doth he intertwine, and the king adder snatched from Tisiphone's grisly locks, and\n        the wicked power that commends the girdle [of Aphrodite]; all these he cunningly anoints about with lunar foam,\n        and pours over them the poison of delight. Not Pasithea, eldest of the gracious sisters, nor Decor (Charm) nor\n        the Idalian youth did mould it, but Luctus (Grief) [Penthos], and all the Irae (Passions), and Dolor (Anguish)\n        and Discordia (Discord) [Eris], with all the craft of her right hand. The work first proved its worth, when\n        Harmonia's complaints turned to dreadful hissing, and she bore company to grovelling Cadmus, and with long\n        trailing breast drew furrows in the Illyrian fields [the pair were turned into serpents in Illyria]. Next,\n        scarce had shameless Semele put the hurtful gift about her neck, when lying Juno [Hera] crossed her threshold.\n        Thou too, unhappy Jocasta, didst, as they say, possess the beauteous, baleful thing, and didst deck thy\n        countenance with its praise--on what a couch, alas! to find favour; and many more beside. Last Argia shines in\n        the splendour of the gift, and in pride of ornament and accursed gold surpassed her sister's mean attiring. The\n        wife of the doomed prophet [Eriphyle wife of Amphiaraus] beheld it, and at every shrine and banquet in secret\n        cherished fierce jealousy, if only it might be granted her to possess the terrible jewel, nought profited,\n        alas!\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 5. 135 ff : \n        \"[At the wedding of Kadmos (Cadmus) and Harmonia :] Aphrodite wishing to delight Ares in the deep\n        shrewdness of her mind, clasped a golden necklace showing place about the girl's [Harmonia] blushing neck, a\n        clever work of Hephaistos (Hephaestus) set with sparkling gems in masterly refinement. This he had made for his\n        Kyprian (Cyprian) bride, a gift for his first glimpse of Archer Eros (Love) [i.e. born to Aphrodite the wife of\n        Hephaistos but fathered by her lover Ares]. For the heavyknee bridegroom always expected that Kythereia\n        (Cytherea) [Aphrodite] would bear him a hobbling son, having the image of his father in his feet. But his though\n        was mistaken; and when he beheld a whole-footed son [Eros, Love] brilliant with wings like Maia's son Hermes, he\n        made this magnificent necklace.\n        It was like a serpent with starspangled back and coiling shape. For as the twoheaded amphisbaina (amphisbaena)\n        in very sooth winds the coils between and spits her poison from either mouth, rolling along and along with\n        double-gliding motion, and head crawling joins with head while she jumps about with twirling waves of her back\n        sideways: so that magnificent necklace twisted shaking its crooked back, with its pair of curving necks, which\n        came to meet at the midnipple, a flexible twoheaded sperent thick with scales; and by the curving joints of the\n        work the golden circle of the moving spine bent round, until the head slid about with undulating movement and\n        belched a mimic hissing through jaws.\n        With the two mouths on each side, where is the beginning and the end, was a golden eagle that seemed to be\n        cutting the open air, upright between the serpent's heads, high-shining with fourfold nozzle of the four wings.\n        One wing was covered with yellow jasper, one had the allwhite stone of Selene [i.e. moonstone], which fades as\n        the horned goddess wanes, and waxes when Mene [Selene the Moon] newkindled distils her horn's liquid light and\n        milks out the self-gotten fire of Father Helios (the Sun). A third had the gleaming pearl, which by its gleam\n        makes the gray swell of the Erythraian Sea [the Red Sea] sparkle shining. Right in the middle of the other, the\n        Indian agate spat out its liquid light, gently shining in bright beauty.\n        Where the two heads of the serpent came together from both sides, the mouths gaped wide and enclosed the eagle\n        with both their jaws, enfolding it from this side and that. Over the shining front, rubies in the eyes shot\n        their native brilliancy, which sent forth a sharp gleam, like a fiery lamp being kindled. Proud with the\n        manifold shapes of stones was a sea, and an emerald stone grass-green welcomed the crystal adjoining like the\n        foam, and showed the image of the white-crested brine becoming dark; here all clever work was fashioned, here\n        all the brinebred herds of the deep sparkled in shining gold as though leaping about, and many a supple\n        traveller danced halfseen, the dolphin skimming the brine which waggled its mimic tail self-moved; flocks of\n        many-coloured birds--you might almost think you heard the windy beat of their flapping wings, when Kythereia\n        [Aphrodite] gave the glorious necklace to her girl, golden, bejewelled, to hang by the bride's neck.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 2 to Pythian Apollo 186 ff (trans.

Four portals\n        were about that stronghold standing proof against he four Aetai (Winds) [Anemoi]. Handmaids protected this\n        dwelling on all sides, a round image of the universe: the doors were allotted--Anatolia (Rising) was the maid\n        who attended the East Wind's (Euros') gate; at the West Wind's (Zephyros') was Dysis (Setting) the nurse of\n        Selene; Mesembrias (Midday) held the bold of the fiery South (Notos); Arktos the Bear was the servant who opened\n        the gate of the North (Boreas), thick with clouds and sprinkled with hail.\n        To that place went Kharis (Charis, Grace), fellow-voyager with the Foamborn [Aphrodite], and running ahead she\n        knocked at the eastern gate of Euros. As the rap came on the saffron portal of sunrise, Astynomeia an attendant\n        ran up from within; and when she saw Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite] standing in front of the gatehouse of the\n        dwelling, she went with returning feet to inform her mistress [Harmonia] beforehand. She was then busy at\n        Athena's loom weaving a patterned cloth with her shuttle. In the robe she was weaving, she worked first Earth as\n        the navel in the midst; round it she balled the sky dotted with the shape of stars, and fitted the sea closely\n        to the embracing earth; she embroidered also the Rivers in a green picture, shaped each with a human face and\n        bull's horn; and at the outer fringe of the wellspun robe she made Okeanos (Oceanus) run all round the world in\n        a loop. The maid came up to the woman's loom, and announced that Aphrodite stood before the gatehouse. When the\n        goddess heard, she dropt the threads of the robe and threw down the divine shuttle from her hands busy at the\n        loom. Quickly she wrapped a snow-white robe about her body, and brighter that the gold took her place on her\n        usual seat to await Kythereia (Cytherea). As soon Aphrodite appeared in the distance, she leapt from her throne\n        to show due respect. Eurynome in her long robe led the Paphian to a seat near her mistress; Harmonia the Nurse\n        of the world saw the looks and dejected bearing of Kypris (Cypris) that showed her distress, and comforted her\n        in friendly tones : ‘Kythereia, root of life, seedsowing of being, midwife of nature, hope of the whole\n        universe, at the bidding of your will the unbending Moirai (Moirae, Fates) do spin their complicated threads! .\n        . .’\n        [Aphrodite replied] : ‘Reveal to your questioner, and tell me, as nourisher of life, nurse of immortals,\n        as coeval with the universe your agemate; which of the cities has the organ of sovereign voice? Which has\n        reserved for it the unshaken reins of troublesolving Law? I joined Zeus in wedlock with Hera his sister, after\n        he had felt the pangs of longlasting desire and desired her for three hundred years: in gratitude he bowed his\n        wise head, and promised a worthy reward for the marriage that he would commit the precepts of Justice (Dike) to\n        one of the cities allotted to me. I wish to learn whether the gift is reserved for land of Kypros (Cyprus) or\n        Paphos or Korinthos (Corinth) or Sparta . . . or the noblemen's country of my own daughter Beroe. Have a care\n        then for Justice (Dike), and grant harmony to the world, you who are Harmonia, the saviour of life! For I was\n        sent here in haste by the Virgin of the Stars [Astraia] herself, the nurse of law-abiding men; and what is more,\n        law-loving Hermes has passed on this honour to me, that I alone be enforcing the laws of marriage may preserve\n        the men whom I have sown.’\n        To these words of hers the goddess replied with an encouraging speech :\n        ‘Be of good cheer, fear not, mother of the Erotes (Loves)! For I have oracles of history on seven tablets,\n        and the tablets bear the names of the seven planets. The first has the name of revolving Selene [the Moon]; the\n        second is called of Hermes [planet Mercury], a shining tabled of gold, upon which are wrought all the secrets of\n        law; the third has your name [Aphrodite the planet Venus], a rosy tablet, for it has the shape of your star in\n        the East; the fourth is Helios [the Sun], cental navel of the seven travelling planets; the fifth is called Ares\n        [the planet Mars], red and fiery; the sixth is called Phaethon [the planet Jupiter], the planet of Kronides\n        [Zeus]; the seventh shows the name of highmoving Kronos (Cronus) [the planet Saturn]. Upon these, ancient Ophion\n        has engraved in red letters all the divers oracles of fate for the universe. But since you ask me about the\n        directing laws, this prerogative I keep for the eldest of cities. Whether then Arkadia (Arcadia) is first or\n        Hera's city [Argos], whether Sardis be the oldest, or even Tarsos celebrated in song be the first city, or some\n        other, I have not been told. The tablet of Kronos (Cronus) will teach you all this, which first arose, which was\n        coeval with Dawn.’\n        She spoke; and led the way to the glorious oracles of the wall, until she saw the place where Ophion's art had\n        engraved in ruddy vermilion on the tablet of Kronos (Cronus) the oracle to be fulfilled in time about Beroe's\n        country. ‘Beroe came the first, coeval with the universe her agemate, bearing the name of the Nymphe later\n        born, which the colonizing sons of the Ausonians, the consular lights of Rome, shall call Berytos (Beruit),\n        since here fell a neighbour of Lebanon . . .’\n        Such was the word of prophecy that she learnt. But when the deity had scanned the prophetic beginning of the\n        seventh tabled, she looked at the second, where on the neighbouring wall many strange signs were engraved with\n        varied art in oracular speech: how first Shepherd Pan will invent the syrinx, Helikonian Hermes the harp, tender\n        Hyagnis the music of the double pipes with their clever holes, Orpheus the streams of mystic song with divine\n        voice, Apollon's Linos eloquent speech; how Arkas (Arcas) the traveller will find out the measures of the twelve\n        months, and the sun's circuit which is the mother of the years brought forth by his fourhorse team; how wise\n        Endymion with changing bends of his fingers will calculate the three varying phases of Selene (the Moon); how\n        Kadmos (Cadmus) will combine consonant with vowel and teach the secrets of correct speech; how Solon will invent\n        inviolable laws, and Kekrops (Cecrops) the union of two yoked together under the sacred yoke of marriage made\n        lawful with Attic torch.\n        Now the Phaphian [Aphrodite], after all these manifold wonders of the Mousa (Muse), scanned the various deeds of\n        the scattered cities; and on the written tabled which lay in the midst on the circuit of the universe, she found\n        the words of wisdom inscribed in many lines of Grecian verse : ‘When Augustus [i.e. historical the Roman\n        Emperor] shall hold the sceptre of the world, Ausonian Zeus will give to divine Rome the lordship, and to Beroe\n        he will grant the reins of law, when armed in her fleet of shielded ships she shall pacify the strife of\n        battlestirring Kleopatra (Cleopatra).’\"\n\nPlato, Phaedo 95a (trans.
