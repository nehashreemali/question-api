  "content": "ANIKETOS (Anicetus) and ALEXIARES were two Olympian demigods who presided over the defence and fortification of\n        towns and citadels. Their names mean \"the unconquerable one\" from the Greek anikêtos\n        and \"he who wards off war\" from alexis and arês. They were sons of Herakles\n        (Heracles) and Hebe who were born after the hero's ascension to Olympos. The pair were probably the gatekeepers\n        of Olympos, a role which was also assigned to their immortal father.\n\nAniketos and Alexiares were probably the same as the \"Princes\"--two boy-god sons of Herakles\n        worshipped in Thebes. In Aiskhylos' (Aeschylus') play the Seven Against Thebes, Zeus is invoked as\n        Alexeterios by the defending Thebans.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 158 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Herakles] achieved immortality, and when Hera's enmity changed to friendship, he married her daughter\n        Hebe (Youth), who bore him sons Alexiares and Aniketos (Anicetus).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
