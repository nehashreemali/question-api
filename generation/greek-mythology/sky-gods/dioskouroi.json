  "content": "THE DIOSKOUROI (Dioscuri) were the star-crowned, twin gods of St. Elmo's fire--an electrical discharge which\n        appears on the rigging of ships portending deliverance from a storm. They were also gods of horsemanship and\n        protectors of guests and travellers.\n\nThe twins were born as mortal princes, sons of the Spartan queen Leda by Zeus and her husband Tyndareus.\n        Because of their kindness and generosity they were apotheosised at death. Polydeukes (Polydeuces), being a son\n        of Zeus, was at first the only one offered this gift but he insisted it be shared with his twin Kastor (Castor).\n        Zeus agreed, but in order to appease the Fates, the twins had to spend alternate days in heaven and the\n        underworld.\n\nThe Dioskouroi were also placed amongst the stars as the constellation Gemini (the Twins). The division of their time\n        between heaven and the underworld might be a reference to the heavenly cycles--for their constellation is\n        visible in the sky for only six months of the year.\n\nThe Dioskouroi were depicted as youthful horsemen with wide-brimmed traveller's hats.\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & LEDA (both Kastor & Polydeukes) (Hesiod Catalogues of Women Frag 66, Homeric Hymn 32, Alcaeus Frag 34, Terpander Frag 5,\n          Hyginus Fabulae 14, and other sources)\n        [1.2] ZEUS & LEDA (for Polydeukes), TYNDAREUS & LEDA (for Kastor)\n        (Pindar Nemean Ode 10, Hyginus Fabulae 77 & 80, and other sources)\n\n[1.1] MNESILEOS (by Phoibe) (Apollodorus\n          3.134)\n        [1.2] MNASINOUS (by Phoibe) (Pausanais\n          2.22.5)\n\n[1.1] ANOGON (by Hilaeira) (Apollodorus\n          3.134)\n        [1.2] ANAXIS (by Hilaeira) (Pausanais\n          2.22.5)\n\nHesiod, Catalogues of Women Fragment 66 (from Scholiast on Pindar Nem. x. 150)\n          (trans.

Castor and Pollux [Polydeukes] by Leda, daughter of Thestius.\"\n\nThe mortal lives of the Dioskouroi are not detailed here. Their many adventures included taking part in the\n        Voyage of the Argonauts and the Calydonian Boar Hunt. They also laid siege to Athens when their sister Helene\n        was kidnapped by Theseus. The twins died and were granted immortality shortly after Helene absconded to Troy\n        with Paris and so they did not participate in the Trojan War.\n\nStasinus of Cyprus or Hegesias of Aegina, Cypria Fragment 1 (from Proclus,\n          Chrestomathy i) (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th or 6th B.C.) :\n        \"Kastor (Castor) and Polydeukous (Polydeuces), while stealing the cattle of Idas and Lynkeus (Lynceus),\n        were caught in the act, and Kastor was killed by Idas, and Lynkeus and Idas by Polydeukes. Zeus gave them\n        immortality every other day.\"\n\nStasinus of Cyprus or Hegesias of Aegina, Cypria Fragment 7 (from Clement of\n          Alexandria, Protrept 2.30.5) :\n        \"Kastor (Castor) was mortal, and the fate of death was destined for him; but Polydeukes (Polydeuces), scion\n        of Ares was immortal.\"\n\nPindar, Pythian Ode 11 ep4 (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"The might of Kastor (Castor), and your fame O royal Polydeukes (Polydeuces); you twin sons divine, who\n        live today within Therapnai's (Therapnae's) dwellings [the burial place of the brothers], tomorrow in the halls\n        of high Olympos.\"\n\nPindar, Nemean Ode 10 ep3 - ep5 :\n        \"The two brothers [the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri)], at the games of Sparta's wide-built city, joint patrons with\n        Hermes and with Herakles the presidency share. And due regard have they for men of justice. Truly the gods are\n        faithful friends. Now, each alternate day they change their dwelling, one day beside Zeus, their beloved father;\n        then in the valley of Therapnai (Therapnae) within the earth's deep folds, these brothers share their common\n        destiny [i.e. a grave at Therapnai]; for so, rather than be for ever a god and dwell in heaven, Polydeukes\n        (Polydeuces) chose for both this twofold life, when Kastor (Castor) fell, laid low in combat. For Idas, in hot\n        anger for the cattle stolen from him with his bronze-pointed spear dealt him a grievous wound . . . and Zeus\n        upon Idas launched his fire-wrought consuming bolt, and the two burned together, friendless, upon one pyre. Hard\n        is it for men to strive against a mightier power.\n        Then swiftly ran the son of Tyndareus back to his warrior brother, and he found him still living, but within his\n        throat death's rattle sounded. Then with hot tears streaming and bitter groans, he cried aloud : ‘O\n        Father, son of Kronos (Cronus) [Zeus], what release shall there be from sorrows? Grant that I too with my\n        brother may die, great king, I beg thee. For glory is departed from a man robbed of his friends, and under\n        stress of toils few mortals will abide faithful companions to share in the labour.’\n        He ended, and Zeus came and stood before him and spoke these words : ‘Thou are my son; but after in thy\n        mother's womb was set the mortal seed of this thy brother, sprung from her hero husband. But see then, none the\n        less this choice I will give thee: if freed from death and the harsh years of age, it is thy will to dwell\n        beside my throne upon Olympos, companion to Athene and to Ares, god of the shadowing spear, this choice is thine\n        to take. But if, in thy heart's travail for thy brother, thou art in mind to share all things alike with him,\n        then half thy days shalt thou beneath the earth draw breath, and half within the golden citadels of\n        heaven.’\n        He spoke, and Polydeukes had no thought but for the single choice; and Zeus made fee the eye, and then the voice\n        of Kastor of the brazen circlet.\"\n\nAlcman, Fragment 2 (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric II) (C7th B.C.) :\n        \"Most worthy of reverence from all gods and men, they dwell in a god-built home beneath the earth always\n        alive, Kastor (Castor)--tamer of swift steeds, skilled horsemen--and glorious Polydeukes (Polydeuces).\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 136 - 137 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer\n          C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"They [the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri)] prepared to waylay Idas and Lynkeus (Lynceus), but Lynkeus saw Kastor\n        (Castor) and pointed him out to Ias, who killed him. Polydeukes (Polydeuces) set out after them and killed\n        Lynkeus with his spear, but as he was chasing Idas, a rock thrown by the other hit him and he fell down dazed.\n        Zeus struck Idas with a thunderbolt, and took Polydeukes up to the sky. But because Polydeukes would not accept\n        immortality while Kastor was a corpse, Zeus granted them alternating days among the gods and among\n        mortals.\"\n\nLycophron, Alexandra 564 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"An the one pair [the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri)] Hades shall receive : the others the meadows of Olympos shall\n        welcome as guests on every alternate day, brothers of mutual love, undying and dead.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 2. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"In those days [the age of heroes] men were changed to gods, who down to the present day have honours paid\n        to them--Aristaios (Aristaeus), Britomartis of Krete (Crete), Herakles the son of Alkmene (Alcmena), Amphiaraus\n        the son of Oikles (Oecles), and besides these Polydeukes (Polydeuces) and Kastor (Castor).\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 48. 6 (trans.

And,\n        speaking generally, their manly spirits and skill as generals, and their justice and piety as well, have won\n        them fame among practically all men, since they make their appearance as helpers of those who fall into\n        unexpected perils [that is, they appear to mariners in storms]. Moreover, because of their exceptional valour\n        they have been judged to be sons of Zeus, and when they departed from among mankind they attained to immortal\n        honours.\"\n\nAelian, Historical Miscellany 13. 38 (trans.

Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Castor killed Lynceus in battle; Idas, at his brother's death, forgot both strife and bride, and started\n        to bury his brother. When he was placing the bones in a funeral monument, Castor intervened, and tired to\n        prevent his raising the monument, because he had won over him as if he were a woman. In anger, Idas pierced the\n        thigh of Castor with the sword he wore. Others say that as he was building the monument he pushed it on Castor\n        and thus killed him. When they reported this to Pollux [Polydeukes (Polydeuces)], he rushed up and overcame Idas\n        in a single fight, recovered the body of his brother, and buried it. Since, however, he himself had received a\n        star from Jove [Zeus], and one was not given to his brother, because Jove said that Castor and Clytemnestra were\n        of the seed of Tyndareus, while he and Helen were children of Jove, Pollux begged that he be allowed to share\n        his honor with his brother. This was granted him.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 224 :\n        \"Mortals who were made immortal . . .

Neptunus [Poseidon], with like intention, has rewarded them for he\n        gave them horses to ride, and power to aid shipwrecked men . . . Those who speak of Castor and Pollux add this\n        information, that Castor was slain in the town of Aphidnae, at the time when the Lacedaemonians were fighting\n        the Athenians. Others say that when Lynceus and Idas were attacking Sparta, he perished there.
