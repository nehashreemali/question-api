  "content": "HYGEIA was the goddess of good health. She was a daughter and attendant of the medicine-god Asklepios (Asclepius), and a companion of the goddess Aphrodite. Her sisters included Panakeia (Panacea) (Cure-All) and Iaso\n        (Remedy).\n\nHygeia's opposite number were the Nosoi (Spirits of Disease). Her Roman name\n        was Salus.\n\nIn classical sculpture she was represented as a woman holding a large serpent in her arms.\n\n[1.1] ASKLEPIOS & EPIONE (Greek Lyric V Anonymous Frag 939 Erythrae Inscription, Suidas s.v. Epione)\n        [1.2] ASKLEPIOS (Pausanias 1.23.5 &\n          5.20.2)\n        [2.1] EROS & PEITHO (Orphic Rhapsodies Frag)\n\nHYGIEIA (Hugieia), also called Hygea or Hygia, the goddess of health, and a daughter of Asclepius. (Paus. i.\n        23. § 5, 31. § 5.) In one of the Orphic hymns (66. 7) she is called the wife of Asclepius; and Proclus\n        (ad Plat. Tim.) makes her a daughter of Eros and Peitho. She was usually worshipped in the same temples\n        with her father, as at Argos, where the two divinities had a celebrated sanctuary (Paus. ii. 23. § 4, iii.\n        22.§ 9), at Athens (i. 23. § 5, 31, § 5), at Corinth (ii. 4. § 6), at Gortys (viii. 28.\n        § 1), at Sicyon (ii. 11. § 6), at Oropus (i. 34. § 2). At Rome there was a statue of her in the\n        temple of Concordia (Plin. H. N. xxxiv. 19). In works of art, of which a considerable number has come\n        down to our time, she was represented as a virgin dressed in a long robe, with the expression of mildness and\n        kindness, and either alone or grouped with her father and sisters, and either sitting or standing, and leaning\n        on her father. Her ordinary attribute is a serpent, which she is feeding from a cup. Although she is originally\n        the goddess of physical health, she is sometimes conceived as the giver or protectress of mental health, that\n        is, she appears as mens sana, or huliea phrenôn (Aeschyl. Eum. 522), and was\n        thus identified with Athena, surnamed Hygieia. (Paus. i. 23. § 5; comp. Lucian, pro Laps. 5.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHippocrates, The Hippocratic Oath (Greek physician C5th to C4th B.C.) :\n        \"I swear by Apollon (Apollo) the physician, and Asklepios (Asclepius), and Hygeia, and Panakeia (Panacea),\n        and all the gods and goddesses, that, according to my ability and judgment, I will keep this Oath and this\n        stipulation . . .\"\n\nGreek Lyric V Anonymous, Fragment 939 (Inscription from Erythrai) (trans.

Campbell, Vol.\n          Greek Lyric V) : \n        \"Hygeia (Health), most revered of the blessed ones among mortals, may I dwell with you for what is left of\n        my life, and may you graciously keep company with me : for any joy in wealth or in children or in a king's\n        godlike rule over men or in the desires which we hunt with the hidden nets of Aphrodite, any other delight or\n        respite from toils that has been revealed by the gods to men, with you, blessed Hygeia, it flourishes and shines\n        in the converse of the Kharites (Charites, Graces); and without you no man is happy.\"\n\nEuenus, Fragment 6 (trans. Gerber, Vol. Greek Elegiac) (Greek elegy C5th B.C.) :\n        \n        \"Drinking [moderately] is beneficial for body, mind and property. It is well suited to the deeds of\n        Aphrodite and to sleep, a haven from toils, and to Hygeia (Health), most pleasing of the gods to mortals.\"\n\nAeschylus, Agamemnon 1001 ff (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Truly blooming health (hygeia) does not rest content within its due bounds; for disease\n        (nosos) ever presses close against it, its neighbor with a common wall. So human fortune, when holding\n        onward in straight course strikes upon a hidden reef.\"\n        [N.B. Health and Disease are constrasted in this passage, although not strongly personified.]\n\nOrphic Hymn 68 to Hygeia (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"To Hygeia (Health), Fumigation from Manna. O much desired, prolific, general queen. Hear me, life-bearing\n        Hygeia, of beauteous mien, mother of all; by thee diseases dire, of bliss destructive, from our life retire; and\n        every house is flourishing and fair, if with rejoicing aspect thou art there. Each daidal art they vigorous\n        force inspires, and all the world thy helping hand desires. Aides (Haides), life's bane, alone resists thy will,\n        and ever hates thy all-preserving skill. O fertile queen, from thee for ever flows to mortal life from agony\n        repose; and men without thy all-sustaining ease find nothing useful, nothing formed to please. Without thy aid,\n        not Aides' self can thrive, nor man to much afflicted age arrive; for thou alone, of countenance serene, dost\n        govern all things, universal queen. Assist thy mystics with propitious mind, and far avert disease of every\n        kind.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 67 to Asclepius : \n        \"[Asklepios (Asclepius)] husband of blameless Hygeia (Health).\"\n\nApuleius, The Golden Ass 10. 25 ff (trans. Walsh) (Roman novel C2nd A.D.) :\n        \n        \"He [the corrupt physician] made a pretence of dispending the celebrated potion called by more learned\n        people ‘The Health Offering’ (Salus Sacra), a drug necessary for easing gastric pains and\n        dissolving bile; but in its place he substituted another draught, ‘The Death Offering’\n        (Proserpina Sacra) [i.e. poison].\"\n        [N.B. Salus is the Roman name for Hygeia. Prosperina is Persephone, the goddess of death.]\n\nSuidas s.v. Epione (trans.

With\n        whichever of these a votary here is willing to propitiate heaven, the same instructions have been given to him,\n        to worship this image which they are pleased to call Hygeia.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 23. 4 :\n        \"The most famous sanctuary of Asklepios (Asclepius) at Argos contains at the present day a white-marble\n        image of the god seated, and by his side stands Hygeia.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 27. 6 :\n        \"[In the sanctuary of Asklepios (Asclepius) at Epidauros, Argolis there is] a temple to Hygeia, Asklepios,\n        and Apollon, the last two surnamed Aigyptios (Egyptian).\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 20. 2 - 3 :\n        \"[Depicted on table made by Kolotes (Colotes) at Olympia, Elis :] On one side are Asklepios (Asclepius) and\n        Hygeia (Health), one of his daughters.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 26. 2- 3 :\n        \"Along the left side of the great temple [at Olympia, Elis] Mikythos (Micythus) dedicated other offerings :\n        [statues of] . . . deities, Asklepios (Asclepius) and Hygeia.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 7. 23. 7 :\n        \"[There is at Aigion (Aegion), Akhaia] precinct of Asklepios (Asclepius), with images of him and\n        Hygeia.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 31. 1 :\n        \"[At Megalopolis, Arkadia] is an enclosure sacred to the Great Goddesses (Megalai Theai) [Demeter\n        and Persephone] . . .
