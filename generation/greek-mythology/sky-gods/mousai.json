  "content": "THE MOUSAI (Muses) were the goddesses of music, song and dance, and the source of inspiration to poets. They\n        were also goddesses of knowledge, who remembered all things that had come to pass. Later the Mousai were\n        assigned specific artistic spheres: Kalliope (Calliope), epic poetry; Kleio (Clio), history; Ourania (Urania),\n        astronomy; Thaleia (Thalia), comedy; Melpomene, tragedy; Polymnia (Polyhymnia), religious hymns; Erato, erotic\n        poetry; Euterpe, lyric poetry; and Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), choral song and dance.\n\nIn ancient Greek vase painting the Mousai were depicted as beautiful young women with a variety of musical\n        intruments. In later art each of the nine was assigned her own distinctive attribute.\n\nThere were two alternative sets of Mousai--the three or four Mousai\n          Titanides and the three Mousai Apollonides.\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & MNEMOSYNE\n        (Hesiod Theogony 1 & 915, Mimnermus Frag, Alcman Frag 8, Solon Frag 13,\n          Apollodorus 1.13, Pausanias 1.2.5, Diodorus Siculus 4.7.1, Orphic Hymns 76 & 77, Antoninus Liberalis 9,\n          Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.21, Arnobius 3.37)\n        [1.2] ZEUS (Homer Odyssey 8.457, Homeric\n          Hymns 32, et al)\n        [1.3] MNEMOSYNE (Pindar Paean 7,\n          Terpander Frag 4, Aristotle Frag 842, Plato Theaetetus 191c)\n        [2.1] OURANOS & GAIA (Alcman Frag 67, Mnaseas Frag, Diodorus Siculus 4.7.1, Scholiast on Pindar, Aronobius\n          3.37)\n        [2.2] OURANOS (Mimnermos Frag, Pausanias\n          9.29.1, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.21)\n        [2.3] ZEUS & PLOUSIA (Tzetzes on Hesiod\n          35)\n        [3.1] APOLLON (Eumelus Frag 35, Tzetzes on\n          Hesiod 35)\n        [4.1] PIEROS & ANTIOPE (Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.21, Tzetzes on Hesiod\n          35)\n\n[1.1] KLEIO, EUTERPE, THALEIA, MELPOMENE, TERPSIKHORE, ERATO, POLYHYMNIA, OURANIA, KALLIOPE (Hesiod Theogony 75, Apollodorus 1.13,\n          Diodorus Siculus 4.7.1, Orphic Hymn 76)\n        [1.2] TERPSIKHORE, ERATO, KALLIOPE, OURANIA (Plato Phaedrus 259)\n        [1.3] POLYMATHEIA (Plutarch Symposium 9.14)\n        [2.1] MELETE, AOEDE, MNEME (Pausanias 9.39.3)\n        [2.2] MELETE, AODE, ARKHE, THELXINOE (Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.21, Tzetzes on Hes.\n          23)\n        [3.1] NETE, MESE, HYPATE (Plutarch Symposium 9.14)\n        [3.2] KEPHISO, APOLLONIS, BORYSTHENIS (Eumelus Frag 35, Tzetzes)\n        [4.1] NEILO, TRITONE, ASOPO, HEPTAPORA, AKHELOIS, TIPOPLO, RHODIA (Epicharmis, Tzetzes\n          on Hes. 23)\n\nMUSAE (Mousai). The Muses, according to the earliest writers, were the inspiring goddesses of song, and,\n        according to later noticus, divinities presiding over the different kinds of poetry, and over the arts and\n        sciences. They were originally regarded as the nymphs of inspiring wells, near which they were worshipped, and\n        bore different names in different places, until the Thraco-Boeotian worship of the nine Muses spread\n        from Boeotia over other parts of Greece, and ultimately became generally established. (Respecting the Muses\n        conceived as nymphs see Schol. ad Theocrit. vii. 92; Hesych. s. v. Numphê; Steph. Byz.\n        s. v. Torrêbos ; Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. vii. 21.)\n\nThe genealogy of the Muses is not the same in all writers. The most common notion was, that they were the\n        daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, and born in Pieria, at the foot of Mount Olympus (Hes. Theog. 52,\n        &c., 915; Hom. Il. ii. 491, Od. i. 10; Apollod. i. 3. § 1); but some call them the\n        daughters of Uranus and Gaea (Schol. ad Pind. Nem. iii. 16; Paus. ix. 29. § 2; Diod. iv. 7; Arnob.\n        adv. Gent. iii. 37), and others daughters of Pierus and a Pimpleian nymph, whom Cicero (De\n          Nat. Deor. iii. 21) calls Antiope (Tzetz. ad Hes. Op. et D. p. 6; Paus. l. c.), or of\n        Apollo, or of Zeus and Plusia, or of Zeus and Moneta, probably a mere translation of Mnemosyne or Mneme, whence\n        they are called Mnemonides (Ov. Met. v. 268), or of Zeus and Minerva (Isid. Orig. iii. 14), or\n        lastly of Aether and Gaea. (Hygin. Fab. Praef.) Eupheme is called the nurse of the Muses, and at the\n        foot of Mount Helicon her statue stood beside that of Linus. (Paus. ix. 29. § 3.)\n\nWith regard to the number of the Muses, we are informed that originally three were worshipped on Mount Helicon\n        in Boeotia, namely, Melete (meditation), Mneme (memory), and Aoede (song); and their worship and names are said\n        to have been first introduced by Ephialtes and Otus. (Paus. ix. 29. § 1, &c.) Three were also\n        recognised at Sicyon, where one of them bore the name of Polymatheia (Plut. Sympos. ix. 14), and at\n        Delphi, where their names were identical with those of the lowest, middle, and highest chord of the lyre, viz.\n        Nete, Mese, and Hypate (Plut. l. c.), or Cephisso, Apollonis, and Borysthenis, which names characterise\n        them as the daughters of Apollo. (Tzetz. l. c. ; Arnob. iii. 37; Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. vii.\n        21; Diod. iv. 7.) As daughters of Zeus and Plusia we find mention of four Muses, viz. Thelxinoe (the heart\n        delighting), Aoede (song), Arche (beginning), and Melete. (Cic., Arnob., Tzetz. ll. cc. ; Serv. ad\n          Aen. i. 12.) Some accounts, again, in which they are called daughters of Pierus, mention seven Muses,\n        viz. Neilo, Tritone, Asopo, Heptapora, Achelois, Tipoplo, and Rhodia (Tzetz. Arnob. ll. cc.), and\n        others, lastly, mention eight, which is also said to have been the number recognised at Athens. (Arnob. l.\n          c.; Serv. ad Aen. i. 12; Plat. De Re Publ. p. 116.) At length, however, the number nine\n        appears to have become established in all Greece. Homer sometimes mentions Musa only in the singular, and\n        sometimes Musae in the plural, and once only (Od. xxiv. 60) he speaks of nine Muses, though without\n        mentioning any of their names. Hesiod (Theog. 77. &c.) is the first that states the names of all\n        the nine, and these nine names henceforth became established. They are Cleio, Euterpe, Thaleia, Melpomene,\n        Terpsichore, Erato, Polymnia, Urania, and Calliope. Plutarch (l. c.) states that in some places all\n        nine were designated by the common name Mneiae, i. e. Remembrances.\n\nIf we now inquire into the notions entertained about the nature and character of the Muses, we find that, in\n        the Homeric poems, they are the goddesses of song and poetry, and live in Olympus. (Il. ii. 484.) There\n        they sing the festive songs at the repasts of the immortals (Il. i. 604, Hymn. in Apoll. Pyth.\n        11), and at the funeral of Patroclus they sing lamentations. (Od. xxiv. 60; comp. Pind. Isthm.\n        viii. 126.) The power which we find most frequently assigned to them, is that of bringing before the mind of the\n        mortal poet the events which he has to relate; and that of conferring upon him the gift of song, and of giving\n        gracefulness to what he utters. (Il. ii. 484, 491, 761, Od. i. 1, viii. 63, &c., 481, 488;\n        Eustath. ad Hom. p. 259.) There seems to be no reason for doubting that the earliest poets in their\n        invocation of the Muse or Muses were perfectly sincere, and that they actually believed in their being inspired\n        by the goddesses; but in later times among the Greeks and the Romans, as well as in our own days, the invocation\n        of the Muses is a mere formal imitation of the early poets. Thamyris, who presumed to excel the Muses, was\n        deprived by them of the gift they had bestowed on him, and punished with blindness. (Hom. Il. ii. 594,\n        &c.; Apollod. i. 3. § 3.) The Seirens, who likewise ventured upon a contest with them, were deprived of\n        the feathers of their wings, and the Muses themselves put them on as an ornament (Eustath. ad Hom. P.\n        85); and the nine daughters of Pierus, who presumed to rival the Muses, were metamorphosed into birds. (Anton.\n        Lib. 9; Ov. Met. v. 300, &c.) As poets and bards derived their power from them, they are frequently\n        called either their disciples or sons. (Hom. Od. viii. 481, Hymn. in Lun. 20 ; Hes.\n        Theog. 22; Pind. Nem. iii.; Serv. ad Virg. Georg. ii. 476.) Thus Linus is called a\n        son of Amphimarus and Urania (Paus. ix. 29. § 3), or of Apollo and Calliope, or Terpsichore (Apollod. i. 3.\n        § 2); Hyacinthus a son of Pierus and Cleio (Apollod. i. 3. § 3); Orpheus a son of Calliope or Cleio,\n        and Thamyris a son of Erato. These and a few others are the cases in which the Muses are described as mothers;\n        but the more general idea was, that, like other nymphs, they were virgin divinities. Being goddesses of song,\n        they are naturally connected with Apollo, the god of the lyre, who like them instructs the bards, and is\n        mentioned along with them even by Homer. (Il. i. 603, Od. viii. 488.) In later times Apollo is\n        placed in very close connection with the Muses, for he is described as the leader of the choir of the Muses by\n        the surname Mousagetês. (Diod. i. 18.) A further feature in the character of the Muses is their prophetic\n        power, which belongs to them, partly because they were regarded as inspiring nymphs, and partly because of their\n        connection with the prophetic god of Delphi. Hence, they instructed, for example, Aristaeus in the art of\n        prophecy. (Apollon. Rhod. ii. 512.) That dancing, too, was one of the occupations of the Muses, may be inferred\n        from the close connection existing among the Greeks between music, poetry, and dancing. As the inspiring nymphs\n        loved to dwell on Mount Helicon, they were naturally associated with Dionysus and dramatic poetry, and hence\n        they are described as the companions, playmates, or nurses of Dionysus.\n\nThe worship of the Muses points originally to Thrace and Pieria about mount Olympus, from whence it was\n        introduced into Boeotia, in such a manner that the names of mountains, grottoes, and wells, connected with their\n        worship, were likewise transferred from the north to the south. Near mount Helicon, Ephialtes and Otus are said\n        to have offered the first sacrifices to them; and in the same place there was a sanctuary with their statues,\n        the sacred wells Aganippe and Hippocrene, and on mount Leibethrion, which is connected with Helicon, there was a\n        sacred grotto of the Muses. (Paus. ix. 29. § 1, &c., 30. § 1, 31. § 3; Strab. pp. 410, 471;\n        Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. x. 11.) Pierus, a Macedonian, is said to have been the first who introduced the\n        worship of the nine Muses, from Thrace to Thespiae, at the foot of mount Helicon. (Paus. ix. 29. §\n        2.) There they had a temple and statues, and the Thespians celebrated a solemn festival of the Muses on mount\n        Helicon, called Mouseia (Paus. ix. 27. § 4, 31. § 3; Pind. Fragm. p. 656, ed. Boeckh; Diod.\n        xvii. 16.) Mount Parnassus was likewise sacred to them, with the Castalian spring, near which they had a temple.\n        (Plut. De Pyth. Orac. 17.) From Boeotia, which thus became the focus of the worship of the nine Muses,\n        it afterwards spread into the adjacent and more distant parts of Greece. Thus we find at Athens a temple of the\n        Muses in the Academy (Paus. i. 30. § 2); at Sparta sacrifices were offered to them before fighting a battle\n        (iii. 17. § 5); at Troezene, where their worship had been introduced by Ardalus, sacrifices were offered to\n        them conjointly with Hypnos, the god of sleep (Paus. iii. 31. §4 , &c.); at Corinth, Peirene, the\n        spring of Pegasus, was sacred to them (Pers. Sat. Prol. 4; Stat. Silv. ii. 7. 1); at Rome they\n        had an altar in common with Hercules, who was also regarded as Musagetes, and they possessed a temple at\n        Ambracia adorned with their statues. (Plut. Quaest. Rom. 59; Plin. H. N. xxxv. 36.) The\n        sacrifices offered to them consisted of libations of water or milk, and of honey. (Schol. ad Soph. Oed.\n          Col. 100; Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. vii. 21.) The various surnames by which they are designated by\n        the poets are for the most part derived from the places which were sacred to them or in which they were\n        worshipped, while some are descriptive of the sweetness of their songs.\n\nIn the most ancient works of art we find only three Muses, and their attributes are musical instruments, such\n        as the flute, the lyre, or the barbiton. Later artists gave to each of the nine sisters different attributes as\n        well as different attitudes, of which we here add a brief account. 1. Calliope, the Muse of epic poetry, appears\n        with a tablet and stylus, and sometimes with a roll of paper; 2. Cleio, the Muse of history, appears in a\n        sitting attitude, with an open roll of paper, or an open chest of books; 3. Euterpe, the Muse of lyric poetry,\n        with a flute; 4. Melpomene, the Muse of tragedy, with a tragic mask, the club of Heracles, or a sword, her head\n        is surrounded with vine leaves, and she wears the cothurnus; 5. Terpsichore, the Muse of choral dance and song,\n        appears with the lyre and the plectrum; 6. Erato, the Muse of erotic poetry and mimic imitation, sometimes,\n        also, has the lyre; 7. Polymnia, or Polyhymnia, the Muse of the sublime hymn, usually appears without any\n        attribute, in a pensive or meditating attitude; 8. Urania, the Muse of astronomy, with a staff pointing to a\n        globe; 9. Thaleia, the Muse of comedy and of merry or idyllic poetry, appears with the comic mask, a shepherd's\n        staff, or a wreath of ivy. In some representations the Muses are seen with feathers on their heads, alluding to\n        their contest with the Seirens.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nKalliope's name was derived from the Greek words kalleis \"beautiful\" and ops\n        \"voice\", Kleio's from kleô \"to make famous\", Erato from eratos\n        \"lovely\"\n        , Euterpe\n        from eu- \"well\" and terpô \"to delight\", Melpomene from\n        melpô \"to celebrate with song\", Ourania from ouranos \"heaven\",\n        Polymnia from poly- \"many\" and hymnos \"hymn\", Terpsikhore from\n        terpsis \"to delight\" and khoros \"dance\", and Thaleia from thaleia\n        \"rich feast\" or \"blooming\".\n\nHomer, Iliad 2. 597 ff (trans.

For nine\n        nights did wise Zeus lie with her, entering her holy bed remote from the immortals. And when a year was passed\n        and the seasons came round as the months waned, and many days were accomplished, she bare nine daughters, all of\n        one mind, whose hearts are set upon song and their spirit free from care, a little way from the topmost peak of\n        snowy Olympos (Olympus). There are their bright dancing-places and beautiful homes, and beside them the Kharites\n        (Charites, Graces) and Himeros (Desire) live in delight. And they, uttering through their lips a lovely voice,\n        sing the laws of all and the goodly ways of the immortals, uttering their lovely voice. Then went they to\n        Olympos, delighting in their sweet voice, with heavenly song, and the dark earth resounded about them as they\n        chanted, and a lovely sound rose up beneath their feet as they went to their father [Zeus].

Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The Mousai (Muses) tell a story to the goddess Athena :] Blest indeed our fortune here [on Mount Helikon\n        (Helicon)], were we but safe. Crime is so unchecked that everything frightens our virgin hearts. Brutal Pyreneus\n        haunts me; in truth I've not recovered yet. He brought his savage Thracian soldiery and captured Daulis and the\n        countryside of Phocea [i.e. in the region of Helicon] and retained his ill-gained realm. One morning we were\n        travelling towards the temple on Parnasia [i.e. Apollon's shrine of Delphoi], on the road he saw us and,\n        pretending reverence for our divinity, ‘Wait here a while,’ he said, ‘blest Mnemonides\n        [Muses]’ (knowing who we were) ‘Beneath my roof and shelter from the rain’ (For rain was\n        falling) ‘and the angry sky. You must not scruple: often gods of heaven have entered humbler\n        homes.’\n        Swayed by his words and by the weather we agreed and went inside the entrance hall. The rain now ceased, the\n        south wind yielding to the northern breeze; the dark clouds fled, the sky was clean and clear; we meant to go.\n        Pyreneus locked the door to do us violence, which we escaped by taking wing. As if he meant to follow he climbed\n        a battlement. ‘Whichever way you take,’ he said, ‘I'll take the same’ and leapt, the\n        madman, from the highest pinnacle, and pitched head foremost, shattering his skull upon the ground, red with his\n        wicked blood.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 27 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Constellation] Archer . . . Some say that he is Crotus, son of Eupheme, nurse of the Musae (Muses). As\n        Sositheus, writer of tragedies [Greek C3rd B.C.], says, he had his home on Mount Helicon and took his pleasure\n        in the company of the Musae, sometimes even following the pursuit of hunting. He attained great fame for his\n        diligence, for he was very swift in the woods, and clever in the arts. As a reward for his zeal the Musae asked\n        Jove [Zeus] to represent him in some star group, and Jove did so. Since he wished to display all his skills in\n        one body, he gave him horse flanks because he rode a great deal. He added arrows, since these would show both\n        his keenness and his swiftness, and he gave him a Satyrus' (Satyr's) tail because the Musae took no less\n        pleasure in Crotus than Liber [Dionysos] did in the Satyri. Before his feet are a few stars arranged in a\n        circle, which some said were a wreath, thrown off as by one at play.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 5 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The Sphinx] had learned a riddle from the Mousai (Muses), and now sat on Mount Phikiom (Phicium) where\n        she kept challenging the Thebans with it.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Scholiast on Pindar's Nemean Odes 3.16, Plutarch Table-Talk\n          9.14, Plutarch Roman Questions 59, Diodorus Siculus 1.18, Arnobius Adversus Nationes 3.37, Plato Republic 116,\n          Martial 7.11, Scholiast on Theocritus 7.92, Servius on Virgil's Eclogues 7.21, Servius on Aeneid 1.12.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
