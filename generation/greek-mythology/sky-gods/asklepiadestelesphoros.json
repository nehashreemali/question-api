  "content": "TELESPHOROS (Telesphorus) was the god of convalescence who \"brought to fulfillment\" recuperation from\n        illness and injury. He was depicted on ancient coins and reliefs as a boy wearing a wide cloak and low hood or\n        Phrygian cap, and sometimes holding a scroll or tablet in his hands.\n\nTelesphoros had his own temple, the Telesphorion (Telesphorium), in the precinct of Asklepios (Asclepius) at\n        Pergamon in Anatolia. He was also recognised as one of the healing gods at the Asklepian sanctuary of Epidauros.\n\nTelesphoros was also named Akesis and as such his female counterpart was the minor goddess Akeso.\n\nPresumably a son of ASKLEPIOS, though nowhere stated\n\nTELE′SPHORUS (Telesphoros), that is, \"the completing,\" is the name of a medical divinity who is mentioned\n        now and then in connection with Asclepius. Pausanias (ii. 11. § 7) says : \"In the sanctuary of Asclepius at\n        Titane sacrifices are offered to Euamerion, to whom a statue is there erected; and, if I am not mistaken, this\n        Euamerion is called at Pergamus Telesphorus, and at Epidaurus Acesis.\"\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 11. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Alexanor, the son of Makhaon (Machaon), the son of Asklepios (Asclepius), came to Sikyonia and built the\n        sanctuary of Asklepios at Titane . . . There are images [within the shrine] also of Alexanor and of Euamerion;\n        to the former they give offerings as to a hero after the setting of the sun; to Euamerion, as being a god, they\n        give burnt sacrifices. If I conjecture aright, the Pergamenes, in accordance with an oracle, call this Euamerion\n        Telesphoros (Accomplisher) while the Epidaurians call him Akesis (Cure).\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Inscriptiones Graecae 22.4533.27, Corpus Scriptionum Graecum\n          6753.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
