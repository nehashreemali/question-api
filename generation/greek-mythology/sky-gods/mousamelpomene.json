  "content": "MELPOMENE was one of the nine Mousai (Muses), the goddesses of music, song and dance. In the Classical era,\n        when the Mousai were assigned specific artistic and literary spheres, Melpomene was named Muse of tragedy. In\n        this guise she was portrayed holding a tragic mask or sword, and sometimes wearing a wreath of ivy and cothurnus\n        boots. Her name was derived from the Greek verb melpô or melpomai meaning \"to\n        celebrate with dance and song.\"\n\nZEUS & MNEMOSYNE (Hesiod Theogony 75, Apollodorus 1.13, Diodorus Siculus 4.7.1, Orphic Hymn 76)\n\nTHE SEIRENES (by Akheloios) (Apollodorus 1.18 & 1.63,\n          Lycophron 712, Hyginus Fabulae 141)\n\nMELPO′MENE (Melpomenos), i. e. the singing (goddess), one of the nine Muses, became afterwards the Muse\n        of Tragedy.

Oldfather) (Greek historian C1st\n          B.C.) :\n        \"Hesiod even gives their [the Mousai (Muses)] names when he writes: ‘Kleio (Clio), Euterpe, and\n        Thaleia (Thalia), Melpomene, Terpsikhore (Terpsichore) and Erato, and Polymnia, Ourania (Urania), Kalliope\n        (Calliope) too, of them all the most comely.’\n        To each of the Mousai (Muses) men assign her special aptitude for one of the branches of the liberal arts, such\n        as poetry, song, pantomimic dancing, the round dance with music, the study of the stars, and the other liberal\n        arts . . . For the name of each Mousa (Muse), they say, men have found a reason appropriate to her: . . .\n        Melpomene, from the chanting (melodia) by which she charms the souls of her listeners.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 76 to the Muses (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus . . .

Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting :] Why do you delay, O divine Sophokles (Sophocles)\n        [the tragedian], to accept the gifts of Melpomene? Whey do you fix your eyes upon the ground? Since I for one do\n        not know whether it is because you are now collecting your thoughts, or because you are awe-stricken at the\n        presence of the goddess. But be of good heart, good sir, and accept her gifts; for the gifts of the gods are not\n        to be rejected . . . Indeed you see how the bees fly above you, and how they buzz with a pleasant and divine\n        sound as they anoint you with mystic drops of their own dew, since this more than anything else is to be infused\n        into your poesy. Surely someone will before long cry out, naming you the ‘honeycomb of kindly Mousai\n        (Muses),’ and will exhort everyone to beware lest a bee fly unnoticed from your lips and insert its sting\n        unawares. You can doubtless see the goddess herself imparting to you now sublimity of speech and loftiness of\n        thought, and measuring out the gift with gracious smile.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 141 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Sirenes (Sirens), daughter of the River Achelous and the Muse Melpomene.\"\n\nPropertius, Elegies 3. 3 (trans.
