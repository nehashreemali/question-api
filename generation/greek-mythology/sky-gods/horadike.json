  "content": "DIKE (Dicé) was the goddess of justice, fair judgements and the rights established by custom and law.\n        She was one of the three Horai (Horae), goddesses of the seasons, and keepers of the gates of heaven. Her\n        sisters were Eunomia (Good Order) and Eirene\n        (Peace). Like her siblings, she probably also represented an aspect of springtime growth.\n\nDike was identified with Dikaiosyne (RIghteousness) and Astraia (Astraea) (the Contellation Virgo). Her opposite number was Adikia (Adicia) (Injustice).\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & THEMIS (Hesiod Theog. 901, Orphic Hymn 43, Apollodorus 1.13, Hyginus Fab. 183)\n        [1.2] ZEUS (Aeschylus Libation Bearers 939,\n          Aeschylus Seven 667)\n        [1.3] THEMIS (Pindar Olympian Ode\n          13)\n        [2.1] NOMOS & EUSEBIA (Orphica Frag 159)\n\nDICE (Dikê), the personification of justice, was, according to Hesiod (Theog. 901), a daughter\n        of Zeus and Themis, and the sister of Eunomia and Eirene. She was considered as one of the Horae ; she watched\n        the deeds of man, and approached the throne of Zeus with lamentations whenever a judge violated justice.\n        (Hesiod. Op. 239, &c.) She was the enemy of all falsehood, and the protectress of a wise\n        administration of justice (Orph. Hymn. 42, 61); and Hesychia, that is, tranquillity of mind, was her\n        daughter. (Pind. Pyth. viii. 1; comp. Apollod. i. 3. § 1; Hygin. Fab. 183; Diod. v. 72.)\n        She is frequently called the attendant or councillor (paredros or xunnedros) of Zeus. (Soph. Oed. Col.\n        1377; Plut. Alex. 52; Arrian, Anab. iv. 9; Orph. Hymn. 61. 2.) In the tragedians,\n        Dice appears as a divinity who severely punishes all wrong, watches over the maintenance of justice, and pierces\n        the hearts of the unjust with the sword made for her by Aesa. (Aeschyl. Choeph. 639, &c.) In this\n        capacity she is closely connected with the Erinnyes (Aeschyl. Eum. 510), though her business is not\n        only to punish injustice, but also to reward virtue. (Aeschyl. Agam. 773.) The idea of Dice as justice\n        personified is most perfectly developed in the dramas of Sophocles and Euripides. She was represented on the\n        chest of Cypselus as a handsome goddess, dragging Adicia (Injustice) with one hand, while in the other she held\n        a staff with which she beat her. (Paus. v. 18 ; comp. Eurip. Hippolyt. 1172.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 901 ff (trans.

Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Listen to right and do not foster violence; for violence is bad for a poor man. Even the prosperous cannot\n        easily bear its burden, but is weighed down under it when he has fallen into delusion. The better path is to go\n        by on the other side towards justice; for Dike (Justice) beats Hybris (Outrage) when she comes at length to the\n        end of the race. But only when he has suffered does the fool learn this. For Horkos (Horcus, Oath) keeps pace\n        with wrong judgements. There is a noise when Dike (Justice) is being dragged in the way where those who devour\n        bribes and give sentence with crooked judgements, take her. And she, wrapped in mist, follows to the city and\n        haunts of the people, weeping, and bringing mischief to men, even to such as have driven her forth in that they\n        did not deal straightly with her. But they who give straight judgements to strangers and to the men of the land,\n        and go not aside from what is just, their city flourishes, and the people prosper in it: Eirene (Irene, Peace),\n        the nurse of children, is abroad in their land, and all-seeing Zeus never decrees cruel war against them.\n        Neither famine nor disaster ever haunt men who do true justice; but light-heartedly they tend the fields which\n        are all their care. The earth bears them victual in plenty, and on the mountains the oak bears acorns upon the\n        top and bees in the midst. Their woolly sheep are laden with fleeces; their women bear children like their\n        parents. They flourish continually with good things, and do not travel on ships, for the grain-giving earth\n        bears them fruit.\"\n\nHesiod, Works and Days 248 ff : \n        \"There is Virgin Dike (Justice), the daughter of Zeus, who is honoured and reverenced among the gods who\n        dwell on Olympos, and whenever anyone hurts her with lying slander, she sits beside her father, Zeus the son of\n        Kronos (Cronus), and tells him of men's wicked heart, until the people pay for the mad folly of their princes\n        who, evilly minded, pervert judgement and give sentence crookedly.\"\n\nHesiod, Works and Days 274 ff : \n        \"For whoever knows the right and is ready to speak it, far-seeing Zeus gives him prosperity; but whoever\n        deliberately lies in his witness and forswears himself, and so hurts Dike (Justice) and sins beyond repair, that\n        man's generation is left obscure thereafter. But the generation of the man who swears truly is better\n        thenceforward.\"\n\nPindar, Olympian Ode 13. str1 - ant1 (trans.

Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        \"The penalty for reckless crime is ruin when men breathe a spirit of pride above just measure, because\n        their mansions teem with more abundance than is good for them.

But Dike (Righteousness) shines in smoke-begrimed\n        dwellings and esteems the virtuous man. From gilded mansions, where men's hands are foul, she departs with\n        averted eyes and makes her way to pure homes; she does not worship the power of wealth stamped counterfeit by\n        the praise of men, and she guides all things to their proper end.\"\n\nAeschylus, Agamemnon 1143 ff : \n        \"Klytaimestra (Clytemnestra) [after slaying her husband Agamemnon] : ‘Listen then to this too, this\n        the righteous sanction on my oath: by Dike (Justice), exacted for my child [Iphigenia who was sacrificed by\n        Agamemnon], by Ate (Ruin), by the Erinys (Avenging Spirit), to whom I sacrificed that man.’\"\n\nAeschylus, Eumenides 217 ff : \n        \"For marriage ordained by fate for a man and a woman is greater than an oath and guarded by Dike\n        (Justice).\"\n\nAeschylus, Eumenides 538 ff : \n        \"I say to you : respect the altar of Dike (Justice) and do not, looking to profit, dishonor it by spurning\n        with godless foot; for punishment will come upon you.\"\n\nAeschylus, Libation Bearers 55 ff : \n        \"The awe of majesty [of kings] once unconquered, unvanquished, irresistible in war, that penetrated the\n        ears and heart of the people, is now cast off [with death]. But there is still fear. And Eutykhia (Eutychia,\n        Prosperity)--this, among mortals, is a god and more than a god.

Her men called Dike (Justice); but she assembling the elders, it might be in\n        the market-place or in the wide-wayed streets, uttered her voice, ever urging on them judgements kinder to the\n        people. Not yet in that age had men knowledge of hateful strife, or carping contention, or din of battle, but a\n        simple life they lived. Far from them was the cruel sea and not yet from afar did ships bring their livelihood,\n        but the oxen and the plough and Dike herself, queen of the peoples, giver of things just, abundantly supplied\n        their every need. Even so long as the earth still nurtured the Golden Race, she had her dwelling on earth. But\n        with the Silver Race only a little and no longer with utter readiness did she mingle, for that she yearned for\n        the ways of the men of old. Yet in that Silver Age was she still upon the earth; but from the echoing hills at\n        eventide she came along, nor spake to any man in gentle words. But when she had filled the great heights with\n        gathering crowds, then would she with threats rebuke their evil ways, and declare that never more at their\n        prayer would she reveal her face to man. ‘Behold what manner of race the fathers of the Golden Age left\n        behind them! Far meaner than themselves! But ye will breed a viler progeny! Verily wars and cruel bloodshed\n        shall be unto men and grievous woe shall be laid upon them.’ Even so she spake and sought the hills and\n        left the people all gazing towards her still. But when they, too, were dead, and when, more ruinous than they\n        which went before, the Race of Bronze was born, who were the first to forge the sword of the highwayman, and the\n        first to eat of the flesh of the ploughing-ox, then verily did Dike loathe that race of men and fly heavenward\n        and took up that abode, where even now in the night time the Maiden is seen of men.\"\n\nEuphorion of Chalcis, Fragments (trans. Page, Vol. Select Papyri III, No. 121 (2b))\n          (Greek Epic C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"Send Eirene (Irene, Peace) with her prosperity to men! And in the market let him set Themis up, requiter\n        of good deeds : and, beside her, Dike (Justice), who leaps up like a tiger at once in anger at the deeds of men\n        upon whom she looks--even them who provoke the gods and turn their commandments aside, and such as treat their\n        feeble parents with arrogance, scorning the counsel of the living and the dead; or sin against the hospitable\n        feast and the table of Zeus. The lightest of winds that blow unceasing could not easily escape the swift knees\n        of Dike (Justice) when up she leaps.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 72. 5 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The Horai (Horae), as they are called, to each of them, according as her name indicates, was given\n        [assigned by Zeus and Hera] the ordering and adornment of life, so as to serve to the greatest advantage of\n        mankind; for there is nothing which is better to build a life of felicity than obedience to law\n        (eunomia) and justice (dike) and peace (eirene).\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 18. 2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Among the images decorating the chest of Kypselos (Cypselus) dedicated at Olympia :] A beautiful woman is\n        punishing an ugly one, choking her with one hand and with the other striking her with a staff.

Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"To Dike (Justice), Fumigation from Frankincense. The piercing eye of Dike (Justice) bright I sing, placed\n        by the sacred throne of Zeus the king, perceiving thence, with vision unconfined, the life and conduct of the\n        human kind. To thee revenge the punishment belong, chastising every deed unjust and wrong. Whose power alone\n        dissimilars can join, and from the equality of truth combine: for all the ill persuasion can inspire, when\n        urging bad designs with counsel dire, 'tis thine alone to punish; with the race of lawless passions, and\n        incentives base; for thou art ever to the good inclined, and hostile to the men of evil mind. Come,\n        all-propitious, and thy suppliant hear, till fates' predestined fatal hour draws near.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 5. 46 ff (trans.
