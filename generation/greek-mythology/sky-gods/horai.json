  "content": "THE HORAI (Horae) were the goddesses of the seasons and the natural portions of time. They presided over the\n        revolutions of the heavenly constellations by which the year was measured, while their three sisters, the Moirae\n        (Moirae) spinned out the web of fate. The Horai also guarded the gates of Olympos and rallied the stars and\n        constellations of heaven.\n\nThe Horai were particularly honoured by farmers who planted and tended their crops in time with the rising and\n        setting of the stars--measures of the passing seasons. The three were usually named Eunomia (Good Order, Good\n        Pasture), Eirene (Peace, Spring), and Dike (Justice) goddesses who individually represented the conditions\n        required for farming prosperity. The association of agriculture with law and order can also be found in the\n        divinities of Zeus, Demeter and the Daimones Khryseoi.\n\nAnother set of Horai personified the twelve hours of the day.\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & THEMIS (Hesiod Theogony 901, Pindar Frag 30, Apollodorus 1.13, Pausanias 5.17.1, Orphic Hymn 43,\n          Hyginus Fabulae 183)\n        [2.1] HELIOS & SELENE (Quintus Smyrnaeus 10.334)\n        [2.2] HELIOS (Nonnus Dionysiaca 12.1)\n\n[1.1] EUNOMIA, DIKE, EIRENE (Hesiod Theogony 901, Pindar Olympian Ode 13,\n          Greek Lyric V Anon Frag 1018, Apollodorus 1.13, Orphic Hymn 43, Diodorus Siculus 5.72.5, Hyginus Fabulae\n          183)\n        [2.1] THALLO, KARPO, AUXO (Pausanias 9.35.1, Hyginus Fabulae 183)\n        [3.1] AUXESIA, DAMIA (Pausanias 9.35.1, Hyginus Fabulae 183)\n        [4.1] EUPORIA, ORTHOSIE, PHEROUSA (Hyginus Fabulae 183)\n        [5.1] EIAR, THEROS, KHEIMON, PHTHINOPORON (Nonnus Dionysiaca 38.268)\n\nHORAE (Hôrai), originally the personifications or goddesses of the order of nature and of the seasons,\n        but in later times they were regarded as the goddesses of order in general and of justice. In Homer, who neither\n        mentions their parents nor their number, they are the Olympian divinities of the weather and the ministers of\n        Zeus; and in this capacity they guard the doors of Olympus, and promote the fertility of the earth, by the\n        various kinds of weather they send down. (Od. xxiv. 343; comp. x. 469, xix. 132, Il. v. 749,\n        viii. 393 ) As the weather, generally speaking, is regulated according to the seasons, they are further\n        described as the goddesses of the seasons, i. e. the regular phases under which Nature manifests herself.\n        (Od. ii. 107, x. 469, xi. 294, xix. 152, xxiv. 141.) They are kind and benevolent, bringing to gods and\n        men many things that are good and desirable. (Il. xxi. 450; comp. Hymn. in Apoll. Pyth. 16;\n        Theocrit. xv. 105; Ov. Fast. i. 125.) As, however, Zeus has the power of gathering and dispersing the\n        clouds, they are in reality only his ministers, and sometimes also those of Hera. (Il. viii. 433; comp.\n        Moschus, Idyll. ii. 160; Paus. v. 11. § 2.) Men in different circumstances regard the course of\n        time (or the seasons) either as rapid or as slow, and both epithets are accordingly applied to the Horae.\n        (Theocr. xv. 104; Pind. Nem. iv. 34; Horat. (Carm. iv. 7. 8; Ov. Met. ii. 118.) The\n        course of the seasons (or hours) is symbolically described by the dance of the Horae; and, in conjunction with\n        the Charites, Hebe, Harmonia, and Aphrodite, they accompany the songs of the Muses, and Apollo's play on the\n        lyre, with their dancing. (Hom. Hymn. in Apoll. Pyth. 16, &c.; Pind. Ol. iv. 2; Xen.\n        Sympos. 7.) The Homeric notions continued to be entertained for a long time afterwards, the Horae being\n        considered as the givers of the various seasons of the year, especially of spring and autumn, i. e. of Nature in\n        her bloom and maturity. At Athens two Horae, Thallo (the Hora of spring) and Carpo (the Hora of autumn), were\n        worshipped from very early times. (Paus. ix. 35. § 1; comp. Athen. xiv. p. 636; Ov. Met. ii. 1118,\n        &c.; Val. Flacc. iv. 92; Lucian, Dial. Deor. x. 1.) The Hora of spring accompanies Persephone every\n        year on her ascent from the lower world; and the expression of \"The chamber of the Horae opens\" is\n        equivalent to \"The spring is coming.\" (Orph. Hymn. xlii. 7; Pind. Fragm. xlv. 13, p. 576, ed.\n        Bocckh.) The attributes of spring-flowers, fragrance, and graceful freshness are accordingly transferred to the\n        Horae; thus they adorned Aphrodite as she rose from the sea, made a garland of flowers for Pandora, and even\n        inanimate things are described as deriving peculiar charms from the Horae. (Hom. Hymn. viii. 5,\n        &c.; Hes. Op. 65; Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 5; Theocr. i. 150; Athen. ii. p. 60.) Hence they\n        bear a resemblance to and are mentioned along with the Charites, and both are frequently confounded or\n        identified. (Paus. ii. 17. § 4; Müller, Orchom. p. 176, &c. 2nd edit.) As they were\n        conceived to promote the prosperity of every thing that grows, they appear also as the protectresses of youth\n        and newly-born gods (Paus. ii. 13. § 3; Pind. Pyth. ix. 62; Philostr. Imag. i. 26;\n        Nonnus, Dionys. xi. 50); and the Athenian youths, on being admitted along the ephebi, mentioned Thallo,\n        among other gods, in the oath they took in the temple of Agraulos. (Pollux, viii. 106.)\n\nIn this, as in many other cases of Greek mythology, a gradual transition is visible, from purely physical to\n        ethical notions, and the influence which the Horae originally had on nature was subsequently transferred to\n        human life in particular. The first trace of it occurs even in Hesiod, for he describes them as giving to a\n        state good laws, justice, and peace; he calls them the daughters of Zeus and Themis, and gives them the\n        significant names of Eunomia, Dice, and Eirene. (Theog. 901, &c.; Apollod. i. 3. § 1; Diod. v.\n        72.) But the ethical and physical ideas are not always kept apart, and both are often mixed up with each other,\n        as in Pindar. (Ol. iv. 2, xiii. 6, Nem. iv. 34; Orph. Hymn. 42.) The number of the\n        Horae is different in the different writers, though the most ancient number seems to have been two, as at Athens\n        (Paus. iii. 18. § 7, ix. 35. § 1); but afterwards their common number is three, like that of the\n        Moerae and Charites. Hyginus (Fab. 183) is in great confusion respecting the number and names of the\n        Horae, as he mixes up the original names with surnames, and the designations of separate seasons or hours. In\n        this manner he first makes out a list of ten Horae, viz. Titanis, Auxo, Eunomia, Pherusa, Carpo, Dice, Euporia,\n        Eirene, Orthosia, and Thallo, and a second of eleven, Auge, Anatole, Musia, Gymnasia, Nymphes, Mesembria,\n        Sponde, Telete, Acme, Cypridos, Dysis. The Horae (Thallo and Carpo) were worshipped at Athens, and their temple\n        there also contained an altar of Dionysus Orthus (Athen. i. p. 38; comp. xiv. p. 656; Hesych. s.v.\n        hôraia); they were likewise worshipped at Argos (Paus. ii. 20. § 4), Corinth, and Olympia(v. 15.\n        § 3). In works of art the Horae were represented as blooming maidens, carrying the different products of\n        the seasons.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 183 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The names of the Horae, daughters of Jove [Zeus], son of Saturn [Kronos (Cronus)], and Themis, daughter\n        Titanidis (Titaness), are these : Auxo (Growth), Eunomia (Order), Pherusa (Substance), Carpo (Fruit), Dice\n        (Justice), Euporia (Abundance), Irene (Peace), Orthosie (Prosperity), Thallo (Green-shoots).\"\n        [N.B. These appear to be three distinct groupings of three Horai :--(1) Eunome, Dike and Eirene (Irene); (2)\n        Auxo, Karpo (Carpo), Thallo; (3) Pherousa (Pherusa), Euporia, Orthosie (Orthosia).]\n\nHesiod, Theogony 901 ff (trans.

For the Horai (Seasons), coming to\n        earth in their own proper forms, with clasped hands are dancing the year through its course, I think, and Ge\n        (Gaea, the Earth) in her wisdom brings forth for them all the fruits of the year.\n        ‘Tread not on the hyacinth or the rose’ I shall not say to the Horai of the spring-time; for when\n        trodden on they seem sweeter and exhale a sweeter fragrance than the Horai themselves.\n        ‘Walk not on the ploughed fields when soft’ I shall not say to the Horae of the winter-time; for if\n        they are trodden on by the Horai they will produce ear of grain.

One [Winter] wore a snowy veil shadowing her face, and sent forth\n        a gleam of subtle light through the black clouds; her feet were fitted with chilly hailstone shoes. She had\n        bound her braids about her watery head, and fastened across her brow a rain-producing veil, with an evergreen\n        garland on her head and a white circlet of snow covering her frost-rimed breast.\n        Another [Spring] puffed out from her lips the swallow-wind's breath which gives joy to mortal men, having banded\n        the spring-time tresses of her zephyrloving head with a fresh dewy coronet, while she laughed like a flower, and\n        fanned through her robe far abroad the fragrance of the opening rose at dawn. So she wove the merry dance for\n        Adonis [whose festival was in spring] and Kythereia (Cytherea) [Aphrodite] together.\n        Another [Summer], the harvest-home Season (Hora), came with her Sisters. In her right hand she held a head of\n        corn with grains clustering on the top, and a sickle with sharpcutting blade, forecrier of harvest; her maiden\n        form was wrapt in linen shining white, and as she wheeled the dance the fine texture showed the secrets of her\n        thighs, while in a hotter sun the cheeks of her drooping face were damp with dewy sweat.\n        Another [Autumn] leading the dance for an easy plowing, had bound about her hairless temple shoots of olive\n        drenches with the waters of sevenstream Nile. Scanty and withering was the hair by her temples, dry was her\n        body; for she is fruitpining Autumn who shears off the foliage from the trees with scatter-leaf winds. For there\n        were no vinebranches yet, trailing about the Nymphe's neck with tangled clusters and golden curls; not yet was\n        she drunken with purple Maronian juice beside the neatswilling winepress; not yet had the ivy run up with wild\n        intertwining tendrils. But then the fated time had come, which had brought the Horai (Horae, Seasons) running\n        together to the house of Helios (the Sun).\n        So these by the brows of western Okeanos (Oceanus) took ship for the mansion of Helios their father. As they\n        approached, Hesperos (Hesperus) the Evening Star leapt up and went out of the hall to meet them. Selene (the\n        Moon) herself also darted out newrisen, showing her light as she drove her cattle.\n        The Sisters at the sight of the lifegiving Charioteer stayed their fruitful step. He had just finished his\n        course and come down from the sky. Bright Phosphoros [the Morning Star] was ready for the fire-eyed driver, near\n        his chariot and four. He put away the hot yokestraps and starry whip, and washed in the neighbouring Okeanos\n        (Oceanus) stream the bodies of the firefed horses wet with sweat. The colts shook the dripping manes on their\n        necks, and stamped with sparkling hooves the shining mangertrough. The four were greeted by the twelve circling\n        Horai (Horae, Hours), daughters of Khronos (Chronos, Time), tripling round the fiery throne of the untiring\n        Charioteer in a ring, servants of Helios that attend on his shining car, priestesses of the lichtgang each in\n        her turn: for they bend the servile neck to the ancient manager o the universe.\n        Then up and spoke the grapetending Hora (Season) [i.e. Autumn], holding out her hook of the fruitpining autumn\n        as witness to her prayer: ‘Helios, giver of feason, plantdresser, lord of fruits! When will the soil make\n        winemother grapes to grow? Which of the blessed will have this honour betrothed him by Aion (Aeon) [Khronos,\n        Time]? Hide it not, I adjure you, because of all the Sisters I alone have no privilege of honour! I provide no\n        fruit, no corn, no meadowhay, no rain from Zeus.’\n        She spoke, and Helios cheered the nurse of the fruitage to come. He raised a finger, and pointed out to his\n        circling daughter close to a wall opposite the separated tablets of Harmonia. In these are recorded in one group\n        all the oracles which the prophetic hand of Phanes [Khronos, Time] first born engraved as ordained for the\n        world, and drew with his pencil the house proper for each [the astronomical house or zodiac sign]. And Hyperion\n        [Helios the Sun], dispenser of fire, added these words: ‘In the third tablet, you shall know whence the\n        fruitage of wine shall come--where is the Lion and the Virgin: in the fourth, who is the Prince of grapes--that\n        is where Ganymedes draws the delicious nectar, and lifts cup in hand in the picture.’\n        When the god had spoken, the wineloving maiden turned her eyes about, and ran to the place. Beside the oracular\n        wall she saw the first tablet, old as the infinite past, containing all things in one: upon it was all that\n        Ophion lord paramount had done, all that ancient Kronos accomplished . . .\n        But when the stormfoot Hora, Phaethon's [Helios the Sun's] handmaid, had seen the fiery shining victory of Zeus\n        at war and the hailstorm snowstorm conflict of Kronos (Cronus), she looked at the next tablet in its turn. There\n        was shown how the pine was in labour of the human race . . . how Raincloud Zeus brought the waters up in\n        mountainous seas on high and flooded all cities . . .\n        When the priestess of lichtgang passed with nimble foot to the third tabled, the circling maiden stood gazing at\n        the manifold oracles of the world's fate, in letters of flowing colour engraved with the artist's vermilion, all\n        that elaborate story which the primeval mind had inscribed; and this was the prophecy that she read in the\n        tablets : ‘[Various prophecies from the nymphe Io to Atalanta] . . .’\n        The Hora passed restless over all these on one tablet, until she came to the place where fiery Helios had\n        indicated the signs of prophecy to the wind-swept maiden. There was drawn the shining Lion, there the starry\n        Virgin was depicted in mimic shape, holding a bunch of grapes, the summergrown flower of fruitage: there the\n        daughter of Khronos (Chronos, Time) stayed her feet, and this is what she read : ‘Kissos (Cissus, Ivy),\n        the lovely youth, shall creep into a plant, and he shall by the highflying ivy that entwines about the branches.\n        From young Kalamos (Calamus) will spring a reed rising straight and bending to the breeze, a delicate sprout of\n        the fruitful soil, to support the tame vine. Ampelos (Ampelus, Vine) shall change form into a plant and give his\n        name to the fruit of the vine.’\n        But when the harvest-home maiden had seen all these prophecies, she sought the place where hard by on the\n        neighbouring wall was engraved the figure of Ganymedes pouring the nectar-juice into a golden cup. There was an\n        oracle engraved in four lines of verse. There the grape-loving goddess revelled, for she found this prophecy,\n        kept for Lyaios (Lyaeus) Ivybearer [Dionysos], ‘Zeus gave to Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon] the prophetic\n        laurel, red roses to the rosy Aphrodite, the grayleaf olive to Athena Greyeyes, corn to Demeter, vine to\n        Dionysos.’\n        That is what the Euian maiden saw on the tablets. She departed joyful, and with her Sisters was away to the\n        stream of the eastern Okeanos (Oceanus), moving along with Phaethon's [Helios the Sun's] team.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 38. 235 ff :\n        \"I [Helios the Sun] carry the measures of time (khronos), surrounded by the four Horai (Horae,\n        Seasons), about the same centre, until I have passed through a whole house [of the Zodiac] and fulfilled one\n        complete month as usual . . .
