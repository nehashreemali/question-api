She was also\n        the goddess of eloquence, who bestowed her gift on kings and princes. In the Classical era, when the Muses were\n        assigned specific artistic spheres, Kalliope was named Muse of epic poetry. In this guise she was portrayed\n        holding a tablet and stylus or a scroll. In older art she holds a lyre.\n\nKalliope was the mother of the bard Orpheus. When her son was dismembered by the Bakkhantes (Bacchantes), she\n        recovered his head and enshrined on the island of Lesbos.\n\nHer name means \"beautiful-voiced\" from the Greek words kallos and ops.\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & MNEMOSYNE\n        (Hesiod Theogony 75, Apollodorus 1.13, Diodorus Siculus 4.7.1, Orphic Hymn 76)\n        [1.2] ZEUS (Alcman Frag, Hyginus\n          Astronomica 2.7)\n\n[1.1] ORPHEUS, LINOS (by Apollon) (Apollodorus\n          1.15)\n        [1.2] ) ORPHEUS (by Oiagros) (Pindar Dirges Frag 139, Bacchylides Frag 28, Apollodorus\n          1.15, Apollonius Rhodius 1.24, Hyginus Fabulae 14, Nonnus Dionysiaca 13.430)\n        [1.3] ORPHEUS (Terpander Frag 15, Timotheus Frag 791, Pausanias 9.30.1, Philostratus\n          Younger 11, Callistratus 7)\n        [1.3] IALMENOS (Pindar Dirges Frag 139)\n        [1.4] LINOS (Suidas s.v.

Pangaios\n        (Pangaeus), and waited there that he might see the rising of the sun; and that Dionysos, in his wrath, sent\n        against him the Bassarides (as Aeschylus tells the story), who tore him to pieces and scattered his members,\n        which were collected and buried by the Mousai (Muses) in Leibethra.\" Presumably Kalliope appeared towards\n        the end of the play lamenting her son.\n\nPlato, The Republic 364d (trans.

Lo,\n        even sons of Zeus, the Thunder-king, have perished, overborne by evil fate. Immortal though I be, mine own son\n        Orpheus died, whose magic song drew all the forest-trees to follow him, and every craggy rock and river-stream,\n        and blasts of winds shrill-piping stormy-breathed, and birds that dart through air on rushing wings. yet I\n        endured mine heavy sorrow : Gods ought not with anguished grief to vex their souls. Therefore make end of\n        sorrow-stricken wail for thy brave child; for to the sons of earth minstrels shall chant his glory and his\n        might, by mine and by my sisters' inspiration, unto the end of time. Let not thy soul be crushed by dark grief,\n        nor do thou lament like those frail mortal women. Know'st thou not that round all men which dwell upon the earth\n        hovereth irresistible deadly Aisa (Aesa, Fate), who recks not even of the Gods? Such power she only hath for\n        heritage. Yea, she soon shall destroy gold-wealthy Priamos' (Priam's) town, and Trojans many and Argives doom to\n        death, whomso she will.

When Orpheus was taking delight\n        in song, seated, as many say, on Mount Olympus . . . Liber [Dionysos] is said to have roused the Bacchanals\n        against him. They slew him and dismembered his body. But others say that this happened because he had looked on\n        the rites of Liber. The Musae gathered the scattered limbs and gave them burial, and as the greatest favour they\n        could confer, they put as a memorial his lyre, pictures with stars, among the constellations. Apollo and Jove\n        [Zeus] consented, for Orpheus had praised Apollo highly, and Jupiter [Zeus] granted this favour to his\n        daughter.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 7 :\n        \"Some also have said that Venus [Aphrodite] and Proserpina [Persephone] came to Jove [Zeus] for his\n        decision, asking him to which of them he would grant Adonis.

But Venus [Aphrodite], angry because she had not been granted what she\n        thought was her right, stirred the women in Thrace by love, each to seek Orpheus for herself, so that they tore\n        him limb from limb. His head, carried down from the mountain into the sea, was cast by the waves upon the island\n        of Lesbos. It was taken up and buried by the people of Lesbos, and in return for this kindness, they have the\n        reputation of being exceedingly skilled in the art of music.
