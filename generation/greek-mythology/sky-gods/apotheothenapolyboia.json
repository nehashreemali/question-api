  "content": "POLYBOIA (Polyboea) was a maiden of Amyklai (Amyclae) near Sparta who was granted immortality as a demi-goddess\n        in the train of Artemis.\n        Her name means \"Many-Cows\" which is an archaic reference to her beauty and worth--for suitors once\n        paid a bride-price in cattle.\n\nPolyboia was perhaps identified with Phylonoe, a similar Spartan\n        demi-goddess. According to Hesychius she was also identified with Artemis and Persephone.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 19. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Amongst the scenes depicted on the altar of Apollon at Amyklai (Amyclae) near Sparta :] On the altar are\n        wrought in relief . . . the Moirai (Fates) and Horai (Seasons), and with them Aphrodite, Athena and Artemis.\n        They are carrying to heaven Hyakinthos (Hyacinthus) and Polyboia (Polyboea), the sister, they say, of\n        Hyakinthos, who died a maid.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Hesychius s.v. Polyboia.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
