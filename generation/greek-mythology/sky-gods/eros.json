  "content": "EROS was the mischievous god of love, a minion and constant companion of the goddess Aphrodite.\n\nThe poet Hesiod first represents him as a primordial deity who emerges self-born at the beginning of time to\n        spur procreation. (See the Protogenos Eros and Phanes for more information.)\n        The same poet later describes two love-gods, Eros and Himeros (Desire),\n        accompanying Aphrodite at the time of her birth from the sea-foam. Some classical writers interpreted this to\n        mean the pair were born of the goddess immediately following her birth or else alongside her from the sea-foam.\n        The scene was particular popular in ancient art where the godlings flutter about the goddess as she reclines\n        inside a conch-shell.\n\nEventually Eros was multiplied by ancient poets and artists into a host of Erotes\n        (Roman Cupides).\n        The singular Eros, however, remained distinct in myth. It was he who lit the flame of love in the hearts of the\n        gods and men, armed with either a bow and arrows or a flaming torch. Eros was often portrayed as the disobedient\n        but fiercely loyal child of Aphrodite.\n\nIn ancient vase painting Eros is depicted as either a handsome youth or child. His attributes were varied--from\n        the usual bow and arrows, to the gifts of a lover such as a hare, sash, or flower. Sculptors preferred the image\n        of the bow-armed boy, whereas mosaic artists favoured the figure of a winged putto (plump baby).\n\n[1.1] APHRODITE (Ibycus Frag 284,\n          Anacreontea Frag 44, Apollonius Rhodius 3.82, Pausanias 9.27.1, Plato Phaedrus, Philostratus Younger 8, Oppian\n          Halieutica 4.10, Hyginus Astronomica 2.30, Ovid Metamorphoses 1.452 & 5.363, Seneca Phaedra 274, Statius\n          Silvae 1.2.51, Apuleius 11.218, Nonnus Dionysiaca 4.238 & 33.4)\n        [1.2] ARES & APHRODITE (Ibycus Frag 575, Nonnus Dionysiaca 5.88)\n        [1.3] OURANOS & APHRODITE\n        (she was born pregnant with Eros from the genitals of Ouranos) (possibly Hesiod\n          Theogony 176, Sappho Frag 198, Nonnus Dionysiaca 33.4 & 41.128)\n        [2.1] OURANOS & GAIA (Sappho Frag 198)\n        [3.1] ZEPHRYOS & IRIS (Alcaeus Frag 327)\n        [4.1] EILEITHYIA (Pausanias 9.27.1)\n        [5.1] POROS & PENIA (Plato Symposium 178)\n\nEROS (Erôs), in Latin, AMOR or CUPI′DO, the god of love. In the sense in which he is usually\n        conceived, Eros is the creature of the later Greek poets; and in order to understand the ancients properly we\n        must distinguish three Erotes: viz. the Eros of the ancient cosmogonies, the Eros of the philosophers and\n        mysteries, who bears great resemblance to the first, and the Eros whom we meet with in the epigrammatic and\n        erotic poets, whose witty and playful descriptions of the god, however, can scarcely be considered as a part of\n        the ancient religious belief of the Greeks. Homer does not mention Eros, and Hesiod, the earliest author that\n        mentions him, describes him as the cosmogonic Eros. First, says Hesiod (Theog. 120, &c.), there was\n        Chaos, then came Ge, Tartarus, and Eros, the fairest among the gods, who rules over the minds and the council of\n        gods and men. In this account we already perceive a combination of the most ancient with later notions.\n\nAccording to the former, Eros was one of the fundamental causes in the formation of the world, inasmuch as he\n        was the uniting power of love, which brought order and harmony among the conflicting elements of which Chaos\n        consisted. In the same metaphysical sense he is conceived by Aristotle (Metaph. i. 4); and similarly in\n        the Orphic poetry (Orph. Hymn. 5; comp. Aristoph. Av. 695) he is described as the first of the\n        gods, who sprang from the world's egg. In Plato's Symposium (p. 178,b) he is likewise called the oldest of the\n        gods. It is quite in accordance with the notion of the cosmogonic Eros, that he is described as a son of Cronos\n        and Ge, of Eileithyia, or as a god who had no parentage, and came into existence by himself. (Paus. ix. c. 27.)\n        The Eros of later poets, on the other hand, who gave rise to that notion of the god which is most familiar to\n        us, is one of the youngest of all the gods. (Paus. l. c. ; Cic. de Nat. Deor. iii. 23.) The\n        parentage of the second Eros is very differently described, for he is called a son of Aphrodite (either\n        Aphrodite Urania or Aphrodite Pandemos), or Polymnia, or a son of Porus and Penia, who was begotten on\n        Aphrodite's birthday. (Plat. l. c. ; Sext. Emp. adv. Math. i. 540.) According to other\n        genealogies, again, Eros was a son of Hermes by Artemis or Aphrodite, or of Ares by Aphrodite (Cic. de Nat.\n          Deor. iii. 23), or of Zephyrus and Iris (Plut. Amal. 20; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 555), or,\n        lastly, a son of Zeus by his own daughter Aphrodite, so that Zeus was at once his father and grandfather. (Virg.\n        Cir. 134.) Eros in this stage is always conceived and was always represented as a handsome youth, and\n        it is not till about after the time of Alexander the Great that Eros is represented by the epigrammatists and\n        the erotic poets as a wanton boy, of whom a thousand tricks and cruel sports are related, and from whom neither\n        gods nor men were safe. He is generally described as a son of Aphrodite; but as love finds its way into the\n        hearts of men in a manner which no one knows, the poets sometimes describe him as of unknown origin (Theocrit.\n        xiii. 2), or they say that he had indeed a mother, but not a father. (Meleagr. Epigr. 50.) In this\n        stage Eros has nothing to do with uniting the discordant elements of the universe, or the higher sympathy or\n        love which binds human kind together; but he is purely the god of sensual love, who bears sway over the\n        inhabitants of Olympus as well as over men and all living creatures: he tames lions and tigers, breaks the\n        thunderbolts of Zeus, deprives Heracles of his arms, and carries on his sport with the monsters of the sea.\n        (Orph. Hymn. 57 ; Virg. Eclog. x. 29; Mosch. Idyll. vi. 10; Theocrit. iii. 15.) His\n        arms, consisting of arrows, which he carries in a golden quiver, and of torches, no one can touch with impunity.\n        (Mosch. Idyll. vi.; Theocrit. xxiii. 4; Ov. Trist. v. 1, 22.) His arrows are of different\n        power: some are golden, and kindle love in the heart they wound; others are blunt and heavy with lead, and\n        produce aversion to a lover. (Ov. Met. i. 468; Eurip. Iphig. Aul. 548.) Eros is further\n        represented with golden wings, and as fluttering about like a bird. (Comp. Eustath. ad Hom. p. 987.)\n        His eyes are sometimes covered, so that he acts blindly. (Theocrit. x. 20.) He is the usual companion of his\n        mother Aphrodite, and poets and artists represent him, moreover, as accompanied by such allegorical beings as\n        Pothos, Himeros, Dionysus, Tyche, Peitho, the Charites or Muses. (Pind. Ol. i. 41; Anacr. xxxiii. 8;\n        Hesiod, Theog. 201; Paus. vi. 24. § 5, vii. 26. § 3, i. 43. §6.) His statue and that of\n        Hermes usually stood in the Greek gymnasia. (Athen. xiii. p. 551; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1596.)\n\nWe must especially notice the connexion of Eros with Anteros, with which persons usually connect the notion of\n        \"Love returned.\" But originally Anteros was a being opposed to Eros, and fighting against him. (Paus. i. 30.\n        § 1, vi. 23. § 4.) This conflict, however, was also conceived as the rivalry existing between two\n        lovers, and Anteros accordingly punished those who did not return the love of others; so that he is the avenging\n        Eros, or a deus ultor. (Paus. i. 30. § 1; Ov. Met. xiii. 750, &c.; Plat.\n        Phaedr. p. 255, d.) The number of Erotes (Amores and Cupidines) is playfully extended ad libitum by\n        later poets, and these Erotes are described either as sons of Aphrodite or of nymphs. Among the places\n        distinguished for their worship of Eros, Thespiae in Boeotia stands foremost: there his worship was very\n        ancient, and the old representation of the god was a rude stone (Paus. ix. 27. § 1), to which in later\n        times, however, the most exquisite works of art were added. (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 266.) At Thespiae a\n        quinquennial festival, the Erotidia or Erotia, were celebrated in honour of the god. (Paus. l. c.;\n        Athen. xiii. p. 561.) Besides Sparta, Samos, and Parion on the Hellespont, he was also worshipped at Athens,\n        where he had an altar at the entrance of the Academy. (Paus. i. 30. § 1.) At Megara his statue, together\n        with those of Himeros and Pothos, stood in the temple of Aphrodite. (Paus. i. 43. § 6, comp. iii. 26.\n        § 3, vi. 24. § 5, vii. 26. § 3.) Among the things sacred to Eros, and which frequently appear\n        with him in works of art, we may mention the rose, wild beasts which are tamed by him, the hare, the cock, and\n        the ram. Eros was a favourite subject with the ancient statuaries, but his representation seems to have been\n        brought to perfection by Praxiteles, who conceived him as a full-grown youth of the most perfect beauty.\n        (Lucian, Am. ii. 17; Plin. H. N. xxxvi. 4, 5.) In later times artists followed the example of\n        poets, and represented him as a little boy.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nScholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes (trans.

Later than Olen, both Pamphos and Orpheus [legendary Greek poets] wrote hexameter verse, and\n        composed poems on Eros, in order that they might be among those sung by the Lykomidai (Lycomidae) to accompany\n        the ritual. I read them after conversation with a Torchbearer. Of these things I will make no further mention.\n        Hesiod, or he who wrote the Theogony fathered on Hesiod, writes, I know, that Khaos (Chaos) was born first, and\n        after Khaos, Ge (Gaea, Earth), Tartaros (Tartarus) and Eros.

Thus quickly Eros\n        leapt into his mother's gleaming arms, and pounced at once upon her firm breasts spreading himself over that\n        nursing bosom. Untaught he yearned for his food; he bit with his gums the end of the teat never milked before,\n        and greedily drank all the milk of those breasts swollen with the pressure of life-giving drops.\"\n\nFor additional references see Eros God of Love (General) (next\n        page)\n\nSappho, Fragment 198 (from Scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes) (trans.

I lead to you Aura, the maiden too fond of maidenhood, and she\n        bows her neck. Now you dancers of lovestricken Orkhomenos (Orchomenus) [the Kharites (Charites)], crown this\n        cestus, the strap that waists on marriage, because it has conquered the stubborn will of this invincible\n        lioness!’\n        Such was the prophetic oracle which Aura the mountain maiden saw.

Beside him stood Hymenaios (Hymenaeus), his fair-haired playfellow\n        in the dainty game . . . [See Eros & his Playmate Hymenaeus on the following page for this section.]\n        Now Aglaia (Aglaea) stood by him [Eros], and she received the prizes from the hands of the prince of heart's\n        delight. She beckoned the boy aside, and with silence their only witness, she whispered into his ear the artful\n        message of her intriguing mistress : ‘Allvanquisher unvanquished, preserver of life coeval with the\n        universe, make haste! Kythereia (Cytherea) is in distress. None of her attendants has remained with her; Kharis\n        (Charis, Grace) has gone, Peitho (Seduction) has vanished, Pothos (Sexual Longing) the inconstant has left her;\n        she had none to send but me. She needs your invincible quiver!’\n        No sooner had she spoken, than Eros wanted to know all about it; for all young people, when they hear only the\n        beginning of a story, are eager to hear the end. So he rattled out with that unbridled tongue of his--‘Who\n        has hurt my dear Paphian? Let me take arms in hand and fight all the world! If my mother is in distress, let me\n        stretch my allvanquishing bowstring against even Kronion (Cronion) [Zeus], to make him once more a mad ravishing\n        love-bird, and eagle, or a bull swimming in the sea! Or if Pallas [Athene] has provoked her, if Crookshank\n        [Hephaistos (Hephaestus)] has hurt her by lighting the bright torch of the Kekropian (Cecropian) light, I will\n        fight them both, Hephaistos and Athene! Or if Archeress [Artemis] hareslayer moves her to anger, I will draw the\n        fiery Olympian sword of Orion to prick Artemis and drive her out of the sky! Or if it is Hermes I will carry off\n        with me Maia's son on my wings, and let him call useless Peitho [his wife] in vain to his help. Or I will leave\n        my arrows and the fiery belt of my quiver, I will lash Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon] a willing victim with cords\n        of laurel leaves, holding him bound in a belt of speaking iris. Indeed I fear not the strength of Enyalios\n        [Ares], it will not weary me to flog Ares when he is shackled by the delightful cestus. The two luminaries I\n        will drag down from heaven to be drudges in Paphos, and give my mother for a servant Phaethon [Helios the Sun]\n        with Klymene (Clymene) [his wife], Selene [the Moon] with Endymion [her husband], that all may know that I\n        vanquish all things!’\n        He spoke, and straight through the air he plied his feet, and reached the dwelling of eager Aphrodite long\n        before Aglaia with his pair of whirring wings. His mother with serene countenance took him into her embrace, and\n        threw one happy arm round her boy, lifting him on her knees, a welcome burden. He sat there while she kissed the\n        boy's lips and eyes; then she touched his mindcharming bow, and handled the quiver, and pretending to breathe\n        anger, spoke these delusive words : ‘My dear child, you have forgotten Phaethon [Helios the Sun] and\n        Kythereia (Cytherea) [Aphrodite]! Pasiphae no longer wants the Bull's love. Helios mocks at me, and arms the\n        offspring of Astris, the warrior Deriades his own daughter's son, to destroy the Bassarides of womanmad Dionysos\n        and to rout the love-stricken Satyroi (Satyrs) of Bromios. But it has provoked me more than all, that\n        battlestirring Ares in mortal shape, with Enyo by his side, without regard for his old love of Aphrodite, ahs\n        armed himself against Dionysos at Hera's bidding and supports the Indian king. Now then, on this field Ares if\n        for Deriades--then you fight for Lyaios (Lyaeus) [Dionysos]. He has a spear, you have a stronger bow, before\n        which bend the knee Zeus the Highest and furious Ares and Hermes the lawgiver; even that Archer Apollon fears\n        your bow. If you will give a boon to your Foamborn, fight for the Bassarides and Dionysos. Go I pray, to the\n        Eastern clime and let no one catch you--go to the Indian plain, where there is a handmaid of Lyaios amongst the\n        Bakkhantes (Bacchantes), more excellent than her yearsmates, named Khalkomede (Chalcomede), who loves the maiden\n        state--but if you should see Khalkomede and Kypris (Cypris) both together in Libanos (Lebanon), you cannot tell\n        which was Aphrodite, my dear boy! Go to that place and help Dionysos ranging the wilds, by shooting Morrheus for\n        the beauty of Khalkomedeia. I will give you a Worthing prize for your shooting, a wellmade Lemnian chaplet, like\n        the rays of fiery Helios (the Sun). Shoot a sweet arrow, and you will do a grace both to Kypris and to dionysos;\n        honour my bridesmaid bird of love [the dove] and yours, the herald of lifelong wedding and happy\n        hearts!’\n        So spoke the goddess; and Eros wildly leapt from his mother's lap and took up his bow, slung the allvanquishing\n        quiver about his little shoulder, and sailed away on his wings through the air; round Kerne (Cerne) he turned\n        his flight opposite the rays of morning, smiling that he had set afire that great charioteer of the heavenly car\n        with his little darts, and the light of the loves had conquered the light of Helios (the Sun). Soon he was\n        moving in the midst of the Indian host, and laid his bow against the neck of Khalkomedeia, aiming the shaft\n        round her rosy cheek, and sent it into the heart of Morrheus. Then paddling his way with the double beat of his\n        floating wings he mounted to the starry barriers of his father [i.e. Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) father of Aphrodite\n        who emerged fully grown and pregnant with Eros from bloody foam of Ouranos' castration], leaving the Indian\n        transfixed with the fiery shaft.\n        Now Morrheus moved lovesick this way and that way, struck by the arrow of desire, wherever the maiden went; the\n        sword he lifted was tame, his spear hung idle, his bold spirit was lashed by the cestus of love, he turned his\n        enamoured gaze all about and moved his eyes at the bidding of Kypri (Cypris)s, uncomforted.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 33. 238 ff :\n        \"He [Morrheus] softened his voice to womanish love-prattle, as the arrow of nightly love quivered beneath\n        his heart :\n        ‘Bow and arrows of Ares, I have done with you; for another shaft and a better constrains me, the arrow of\n        desire! I have done with you, quiver! The cestus-strap has conquered my shieldsling. No more I equip a fighting\n        hand against Bassarides. The gods of my nation, Water and Earth, I will leave, and set up altars both to Kypris\n        (Cypris) [Aphrodite] and Dionysos; I will throw away the brazen spear of Enyalios [Ares] and\n        Athene.’\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 34. 34 ff :\n        \"[Morrheus in love :] Perhaps that allvanquishing braggart Himeros (Desire) has been aiming at you bridal\n        sparks from his unresting quiver.\"\n\nAfter the arrival of the Argonauts in Kolkhis (Colchis), the goddess Hera conspires to have Medea fall in love\n        with Jason to assist the hero in his quest for the Golden Fleece. To this end she petitions Aphrodite have her\n        son Eros strike the princess with his darts.\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 25 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[Hera addresses Athene (Athena) :] ‘We must have a word with Aphrodite. Let us go together and ask\n        her to persuade her boy, if that is possible, to loose an arrow at Aeetes' daughter, Medea of the many spells,\n        and make her fall in love with Iason (Jason) . . .’\n        The solution to their problem pleased Athene, who smilingly replied : ‘Sprung as I am from Zeus, I have\n        never felt the arrows of the Boy, and of love-charms I know nothing.’\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 82 ff :\n        \"[Hera addresses Aphrodite :] ‘All we require of you is quietly to tell your boy to use his wizardry\n        and make Aeetes' daughter fall in love with Iason (Jason) . . .’\n        ‘But ladies,’ said Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite], speaking now to both of them [i.e. Hera and Athene],\n        ‘he is far more likely to obey you than me. There is no reverence in him, but faced by you he might\n        display some spark of decent feeling. He certainly pays no attention to me: he defies me and always does the\n        opposite of what I say. In fact I am so worn out by his naughtiness that I have half a mind to break his bow and\n        wicked arrows in his very sight, remembering how he threatened me with them in one of his moods. He said,\n        \"If you don't keep your hands off me while I can still control my temper, you can blame yourself for the\n        consequences.\"’\n        Hera and Athene smiled at this and exchanged glances. But Aphrodite was hurt. She said : ‘Other people\n        find my troubles amusing. I really should not speak of them to all and sundry; it is enough for me to know them.\n        However, as you have both set your hearts on it, I will try and coax my boy. He will not refuse.’\n        Hera took Aphrodite's slender hand in hers and with a sweet smile replied : ‘Very well, Kytherea\n        (Cytherea). Play your part, just as you say; but quickly, please. And do not scold or argue with your child when\n        he annoys you. He will improve by and by.’\n        With that she rose to go. Athene followed her, and the pair left for home. Kypris (Cypris) too set out, and\n        after searching up and down Olympos for her boy, found him far away in the fruit-laden orchard of Zeus. With him\n        was Ganymede, whose beauty had so captivated Zeus that he took him up to heaven to live with the immortals. The\n        two lads, who had much in common, were playing with golden knuckle-bones. Eros, the greedy boy, was standing\n        there with a whole handful of them clutched to his breast and a happy flush of mantling his cheeks. Near by sat\n        Ganymede, hunched up, silent and disconsolate with only two left. He threw these for what they were worth in\n        quick succession and was furious when Eros laughed. Of course he lost them both immediately--they joined the\n        rest. So he went off in despair with empty hands and did not notice the goddess's approach.\n        Aphrodite came up to her boy, took his chin in her hand and said : ‘Why this triumphant smile, you rascal?\n        I do believe you won the game unfairly be cheating a beginner. But listen now. Will you be good and do me a\n        favour I am going to ask of you? Then I will give you one of Zeus's lovely toys, the one that his fond nurse\n        Adresteia (Adrastia) made for him in the Idaian cave when he was still a child and liked to play. It is a\n        perfect ball; Hephaistos (Hephaestus) himself could not make you a better toy. It is made of golden hoops laced\n        together all the way round with double stitching; but the seams are hidden by a winding blue band. When you\n        throw it up, it will leave a fiery trail behind it like a meteor in the sky. That is what I'll give you, if you\n        let fly an arrow at Aeetes' girl [Medea] and make her fall in love with Iason (Jason). But you must act at once,\n        or I may not be so generous.’\n        When he heard this, Eros was delighted. He threw down all his toys, flung his arms round his mother and hung on\n        to her skirt with both hands, imploring her to let him have the ball at once. But she gently refused, and\n        drawing him towards her, held him close and kissed his cheeks. Then with a smile she said, ‘By your own\n        dear head and mine, I swear I will not disappoint you. You shall have the gift when you have shot an arrow into\n        Medea's heart.’\n        Eros gathered up his knuckle-bones, counted them all carefully, and put them in the fold of his mother's shining\n        robe. Fetching his quiver from where it leant against a tree, he slung it on his shoulder with a golden strap,\n        picked up his crooked bow, and made his way through the luxuriant orchard of Zeus' palace. Then he passed\n        through the celestial gates of Olympos, where a pathway for the gods leads down, and twin poles, earth's highest\n        points, soar in lofty pinnacles that catch the first rays of the risen sun. And as he swept on through the\n        boundless air he saw ever-changing scene beneath him, here the life-supporting land with its peopled cities and\n        its sacred rivers, here mountain peaks, and hear the all-encircling sea . . . \n        Eros, passing through the clear air, had arrived unseen and bent on mischief, like a gladfly setting out to\n        plague the grazing heifers, the fly that cowherds call the breese. In the porch, under the lintel of the door,\n        the quickly strung his vow and from his quiver took a new arrow, fraught with pain. Still unobserved, he ran\n        across the threshold glancing around him sharply. Then he crouched low at Iason's feet, fitted the notch to the\n        middle of the string, and drawing the bow as far as his hands would stretch, shot at Medea. And her heart stood\n        still.\n        With a happy laugh Eros sped out of the high-roofed hall on his way back, leaving his shaft deep in the girl's\n        breast, hot as fire. Time and again she darted a bright glance at Iason (Jason). All else was forgotten. Her\n        heart, brimful of this new agony, throbbed within her and overflowed with the sweetness of the pain.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 449 ff :\n        \"Medea retired, a prey to all the inquietude that Eros awakens.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 7762 ff :\n        \"Her [Medea's] whole body was possessed by agony, a searing pain which shot along her nerves and deep into\n        the nape of her neck, that vulnerable spot where the relentless archer of Eros causes the keenest pangs.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 55 ff :\n        \"[Selene the Moon addresses Medea :] ‘The little god of mischief has given you Iason, and many a\n        heartache with him.
