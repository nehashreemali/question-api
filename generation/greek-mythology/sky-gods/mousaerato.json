  "content": "ERATO was one of the nine Mousai (Muses), the goddesses of music, song and dance. In the Classical era, when\n        the Mousai were assigned specific literary and artistic spheres, Erato was named Muse of erotic poetry and mime,\n        and represented with a lyre. Her name means \"lovely\" or \"beloved\" from the Greek word\n        eratos.\n\nZEUS & MNEMOSYNE (Hesiod Theogony 75, Apollodorus 1.13, Diodorus Siculus 4.7.1, Orphic Hymn 76)\n\nHesiod, Theogony 75 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The Mousai (Muses) sang who dwell on Olympos, nine daughters begotten by great Zeus, Kleio (Clio) and\n        Euterpe, Thaleia (Thalia), Melpomene and Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), and Erato and Polymnia (Polyhymnia) and\n        Ourania (Urania) and Kalliope (Calliope).\"\n\nIsyllus, Hymn to Asclepius (trans. Frazer, Vol. Apollodorus) (Greek poet C4th or 3rd\n          B.C.) :\n        \"Father Zeus bestowed the hand of the Mousa (Muse) Erato on Malos [eponymous lord of Malea] in holy\n        matrimony (hosioisi gamois.) The pair had a daughter Kleophema (Cleophema), who married Phlegyas, a\n        native of Epidauros (Epidaurus); and Phlegyas had by her a daughter Aigle (Aegle), otherwise known as Koronis\n        (Coronis), whom Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon] of the golden bow beheld in the house of her grandfather Malos, and\n        falling in love he got by her a child, Asklepios (Asclepius).\"\n        [N.B. This hymn was engraved on a limestone tablet unearthed at the shrine of Asklepios in Epidauros. According\n        to the inscription the poet consulted the Delphic Oracle for approval before publishing this genealogy of the\n        god Asklepios.]\n\nPlato, Phaedrus 259 (trans. Fowler) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"When they [the grasshoppers] die they go and inform the Mousai (Muses) in heaven who honours them on\n        earth. They win the love of Terpsikhore (Terpsichore) for the dancers by their report of them; of Erato for the\n        lovers.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 13 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Mnemosyne [bore to Zeus] the Mousai (Muses), the eldest of whom was Kalliope (Calliope), followed by Kleio\n        (Clio), Melpomene, Euterpe, Erato, Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), Ourania (Urania), Thaleia (Thalia), and\n        Polymnia.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 1 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[The poet invokes the Muse Erato as he begins the tale of the love of Jason and Medea :] Come, Erato, come\n        lovely Mousa (Muse), stand by me and take up the tale. How did Medea's passion help Iason (Jason) to bring back\n        the fleece to Iolkos (Iolcus).\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 8. 30. 20 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"And further, the poem entitled Rhadine--of which Stesikhoros (Stesichorus) [poet C7th-6th B.C.]\n        is reputed to be the author--, which begins, ‘Come, thou clear-voiced Mousa (Muse), Erato, begin thy song,\n        voicing to the tune of thy lovely lyre the strain of the children of Samos.’\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 7. 1 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian C1st\n          B.C.) :\n        \"Hesiod even gives their [the Mousai's (Muses')] names when he writes : ‘Kleio, Euterpe, and Thaleia,\n        Melpomene, Terpsikhore and Erato, and Polymnia, Ourania, Kalliope too, of them all the most comely.’\n        To each of the Mousai (Muses) men assign her special aptitude for one of the branches of the liberal arts, such\n        as poetry, song, pantomimic dancing, the round dance with music, the study of the stars, and the other liberal\n        arts . . . For the name of each Mousa (Muse), they say, men have found a reason appropriate to her: . . . Erato,\n        because she makes those who are instructed by her men who are desired and worthy to be loved.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 76 to the Muses (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Daughters of Mnemosyne and Zeus . . . Kleio (Clio), and Erato who charms the sight, with thee, Euterpe,\n        ministering delight : Thalia flourishing, Polymnia famed, Melpomene from skill in music named : Terpsikhore\n        (Terpsichore), Ourania (Urania) heavenly bright.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 4. 190 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"I [the poet] have much to ask [of Rhea] ‘Give me, goddess, someone to interview.’ Cybele saw\n        her erudite granddaughters [the Mousai (Muses)] and made them help . . . So Erato--Cytherea's [Aphrodite's]\n        month [April] fell to her, since she is named from tender love.\"\n\nPropertius, Elegies 3. 3 (trans. Goold) (Roman elegy C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The nine Maidens, each allotted her own realm, busy their tender hands on their separate gifts : . . .\n        another [Erato] with both hands plaits wreaths of roses [i.e. the flower of love].\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
