  "content": "EIRENE (Irene) was the goddess of peace and the season of spring. She was one of the three Horai (Horae),\n        deities of the seasons and keepers of the gates of heaven. Her sisters were Eunomia (Good Order) and Dike (Justice).\n\nEirene's name is the Greek word for peace (eirênê) but it is also closely connected with\n        the word for spring (eiar, eiarinos). In ancient Greece late spring was the traditional campaign\n        season, the time when peace was most at risk.\n\nEirene was probably identified with the Hora Thallo (Green Shoots), whose name\n        Hesiod uses as an epithet for Eirene in the Theogony. Her opposite number was Polemos (War).\n\nIn classical art the goddess usually appears in the company of her two sister Horai bearing the fruits of the\n        seasons. Statues of the goddess often depict her as a maiden holding the infant Ploutos (Plutus) (Wealth) in her arms. In this guise she was identified\n        with the Demeter and Tykhe (Tyche),\n        the goddesses of agricultural bounty.\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & THEMIS (Hesiod Theogony 901, Apollodorus 1.13, Orphic Hymn 43, Hyginus Fab. 183)\n        [1.2] THEMIS (Pindar Olympian Ode 13)\n\nEIRE′NE (Eirênê). The goddess of peace. After the victory of Timotheus over the\n        Lacedaemonians, altars were erected to her at Athens at the public expense. (Corn. Nep. Timoth. 2;\n        Plut. Cim. 13.) Her statue at Athens stood by the side of that of Amphiaraus, carrying in its arms\n        Plutus, the god of wealth (Paus. i. 8. § 3), and another stood near that of Hestia in the Prytaneion. (i.\n        18, § 3.) . At Rome too, where peace (Pax) was worshipped, she had a magnificent temple, which was built by\n        the emperor Vespasian. (Suet. Vespas. 9 ; Paus. vi. 9. § 1.) The figure of Eirene or Pax occurs\n        only on coins, and she is there represented as a youthful female, holding in her left arm a cornucopia and in\n        her right hand an olive branch or the staff of Hermes. Sometimes also she appears in the act of burning a pile\n        of arms, or carrying corn-ears in her hand or upon her head.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 901 ff (trans.

So that I don't know whether you will ever see Eirene (Irene, Peace) again.\n        Trygaios : Why, where has she gone to then?\n        Hermes : Polemos (War) has cast her into a deep pit.\n        Trygaios : Where?\n        Hermes : Down there, at the very bottom.

Now, oh Greeks! is the moment when freed of quarrels and\n        fighting, we should rescue sweet Eirene (Peace) and draw her out of this pit, before some other pestle prevents\n        us.

Let the husbandmen take their farming tools and return to their fields as quickly\n        as possible, but without either sword, spear or javelin.

Come, let everyone go and till the earth, singing the Paian (Paean).\n        Leader of the Chorus (to Eirene) : Oh, thou, whom men of standing desired and who art good to husbandmen, I have\n        gazed upon thee with delight; and now I go to greet my vines, to caress after so long an absence the fig trees I\n        planted in my youth.\n        Trygaios : See, how their iron spades glitter and how beautifully their three-pronged mattocks glisten in the\n        sun! How regularly they align the plants! I also burn to go into the country and to turn over the earth I have\n        so long neglected.--Friends, do you remember the happy life that Eirene (Peace) afforded us formerly; can you\n        recall the splendid baskets of figs, both fresh and dried, the myrtles, the sweet wine, the violets blooming\n        near the spring, and the olives, for which we have wept so much? Worship, adore the goddess for restoring you so\n        many blessings.\n        Chorus (singing) : Hail! hail! thou beloved divinity! thy return overwhelms us with joy. When far from thee, my\n        ardent wish to see my fields again made me pine with regret. From thee came all blessings. Oh! much desired\n        Eirene (Peace)! thou art the sole support of those who spend their lives tilling the earth. Under thy rule we\n        had a thousand delicious enjoyments at our beck; thou wert the husbandman's wheaten cake and his safeguard. So\n        that our vineyards, our young fig-tree woods and all our plantations hail thee with delight and smile at thy\n        coming . . . [it was through the actions of man that peace was driven away and war gained supremacy]\n        Trygaios : . . . (To Eirene) Oh! venerated Goddess! why art thou silent?\n        Hermes : And how could she speak to the spectators? She is too angry at all that they have made her suffer.\n        Trygaios : At least let her speak a little to you, Hermes.\n        Hermes : Tell me, my dear, what are your feelings with regard to them? Come, you relentless foe of all bucklers,\n        speak; I am listening to you. (Eirene whispers into Hermes' ear.) Is that your grievance against them? Yes, yes,\n        I understand. Hearken, you folk, this is her complaint. She says, that after the affair of Pylos she came to you\n        unbidden to bring you a basket full of truces and that you thrice repulsed her by your votes in the\n        assembly.\"\n\nAristophanes, Peace 965 ff : \n        \"[After the release of Eirene (Peace) from the pit, sacrifices are prepared in her honour :] Trygaios (to\n        the Servant who has returned with a sheep and a vase of water): Come, seize the basket and take the lustral\n        water and hurry to circle round the altar [of Eirene] to the right.\n        Servant : There! that's done. What is your next bidding?\n        Trygaio s: Wait. I take this fire-brand first and plunge it into the water. Now quick, quick, you sprinkle the\n        altar. Give me some barley-seed, purify yourself and hand me the basin; then scatter the rest of the barley\n        among the audience.\n        Servant : Done.\n        Trygaios : You have thrown it?\n        Servant : Yes, by Hermes! and all the spectators have had their share.\n        Trygaios : At least the women got none.\n        Servant : Oh! their husbands will give them some this evening.\n        Trygaios : Let us pray! Who is here? Are there any good men?\n        Servant : Come, give me the water, so that I may sprinkle these people. Faith! they are indeed good, brave men.\n        (He throws the lustral water on hem.)\n        Trygaios : You believe so?\n        Servant : I am sure, and the proof of it is that we have flooded them with lustral water and they have not\n        budged an inch.\n        Trygaios : Let us pray, then, as soon as we can.\n        Servant : Yes, let us pray.\n        Trygaio s: Oh! Eirene (Peace), mighty queen, venerated goddess, thou, who presidest over Choruses and at\n        nuptials, deign to accept the sacrifices we offer thee.\n        Servant : Receive it, greatly honoured mistress, and behave not like the courtesans, who half open the door to\n        entice the gallants, draw back when they are stared at, to return once more if a man passes on. But do not thou\n        act like this to us.\n        Trygaios : No, but like an honest woman, show thyself to thy worshippers, who are worn with regretting thee all\n        these thirteen years. Hush the noise of battle, be a true Lysimakha (Lysimache) to us. Put an end to this\n        tittle-tattle, to this idle babble, that set us defying one another. Cause the Greeks once more to taste the\n        pleasant beverage of friendship and temper all hearts with the gentle feeling of forgiveness. Make excellent\n        commodities flow to our markets, fine heads of garlic, early cucumbers, apples, pomegranates and nice little\n        cloaks for the slaves; make them bring geese, ducks, pigeons and larks from Boiotia (Boeotia) and baskets of\n        eels from Lake Kopais (Copais); we shall all rush to buy them, disputing their possession with Morykhos\n        (Morychus), Teleas, Glauketes (Glaucetes) and every other glutton. Melanthios (Melanthius) will arrive on the\n        market last of all; they'll say, ‘no more eels, all sold!’ and then he'll start groaning and\n        exclaiming as in his monologue of Medea, ‘I am dying, I am dying! Alas! I have let those hidden in the\n        beet escape me!’ And won't we laugh? These are the wishes, mighty goddess, which we pray thee to grant.\n        (To the Servant) Take the knife and slaughter the sheep like a finished cook.\n        Servant : No, the goddess does not wish it.\n        Trygaio s: And why not?\n        Servant : Blood cannot please Eirene (Peace), so let us spill none upon her altar.\n        Trygaios : Then go and sacrifice the sheep in the house, cut off the legs and bring them here; thus the carcase\n        will be saved for the Khoregos (Choregus).\n        (The Servant goes into the house with the sheep.)\n        Chorus (singing) : You, who remain here, get chopped wood and everything needed for the sacrifice ready.\n        Trygaios : Don't I look like a diviner preparing his mystic fire?\n        Chorus (singing) : Undoubtedly. Will anything that a wise man ought to know escape you? Don't you know all that\n        a man should know, who is distinguished for his wisdom and inventive daring?\n        Trygaios : There! the wood catches. Its smoke blinds poor Stilbides. I am now going to bring the table and thus\n        be my own slave. (He goes into the house.)\n        Chorus (singing) : You have braved a thousand dangers to save your sacred town. All honour to you I your glory\n        Trygaios (returning with a table) : Wait. Here are the legs, place them upon the altar. For myself, I mean to go\n        back to the entrails and the cakes. (He is about to go into the house.)\n        Servant (going in ahead of him) : I'll take care of them.\n        Trygaios : But I want you here.\n        Servant (returning) : Well then, here I am. Do you think I have taken long?\n        Trygaios : Just get this roasted. And who is this man, crowned with laurel, who is coming to me?\n        Hierokles (Hierocles) (approaching): What sacrifice is this? to what god are you offering it?\n        Trygaios (to the Servant) : Keep quiet.--(Aloud) Look after the roasting and keep your hands of the meat.\n        Hierokles : To whom are you sacrificing? Answer me.\n        Trygaios : Ah! the tail is showing favourable omens.\n        Servant : Aye, very favourable, oh, loved and mighty Eirene (Peace)!\n        Hierokles : Come, cut off the first offering and make the oblation.\n        Trygaios : It's not roasted enough.\n        Hierokles : Yea, truly, it's done to a turn.\n        Trygaios : Mind your own business, friend! (To the Servant) Cut away.\n        Hierokles : Where is the table?\n        Trygaios : Bring the libations. (The Servant departs.)\n        Hierokles : The tongue is cut separately.\n        Trygaios : We know all that. But just listen to one piece of advice.\n        Hierokles : And that is?\n        Trygaios : Don't talk, for it is divine Eirene (Peace) to whom we are sacrificing.\n        Hierokles (in an oracular tone) : Oh! wretched mortals, oh, you idiots!\n        Trygaios : Keep such ugly terms for yourself.\n        Hierokles (as before) : What! you are so ignorant you don't understand the will of the gods and you make a\n        treaty, you, who are men, with apes, who are full of malice? . . . \n        Hierokles : What oracle ordered you to burn these joints of mutton in honour of the gods?\n        Trygaios : This grand oracle of Homer's: ‘Thus vanished the dark war-clouds and we offered a sacrifice to\n        new-born Eirene (Peace). When the flame had consumed the thighs of the victim and its inwards had appeased our\n        hunger, we poured out the libations of wine.’ 'Twas I who arranged the sacred rites, but none offered the\n        shining cup to the diviner.\n        Hierokles : I care little for that. 'Tis not the Sibyl who spoke it.\n        Trygaios : Wise Homer has also said: ‘He who delights in the horrors of civil war has neither country nor\n        laws nor home.’ What noble words! . . . \n        Trygaios (to the Servant Who has returned with the libations) : Look out, slave!
