  "content": "ASKLEPIOS (Asclepius) was the god of medicine. He was also the patron god, and reputed ancestor, of the\n        Asklepiades (Asclepiades), the ancient guild of doctors.\n\nAsklepios was the son of Apollon and the Trikkaian (Triccaean) princess Koronis (Coronis). His mother died in\n        labour and when she was laid out on the pyre, Apollon cut the unborn child from her womb. From this Asklepios\n        received his name which means \"to cut open.\" Asklepios was raised by the centaur Kheiron (Chiron) who instructed him in the art of medicine. He\n        grew so skilled in the craft that he was able to restore the dead to life. This was a crime against the natural\n        order and so Zeus destroyed him with a thunderbolt.\n\nAfter his death Asklepios was placed amongst the stars as the constellation Ophiochus (\"the Serpent Holder\"). Some\n        say his mother was also set in the heavens as Corvus, the crow (korônê in Greek).\n        Asklepios' apotheosis into godhood occurred at the same\n        time. He was sometimes identified with Homer's Paion (Paeon), the physician of the\n        gods.\n\nAsklepios was depicted as a kindly, bearded man holding a serpent-entwined staff. Although he is largely absent\n        from ancient Greek vase painting, statues of the god are quite common.\n\n[1.1] APOLLON (Hesiod Catalogues Frag 90,\n          Plato Republic 408b, Orphic Hymn 67)\n        [1.2] APOLLON & KORONIS (Homeric Hymn 16, Pindar Pythian Ode 3.5, Isyllus Hymn, Apollonius Rhodius 4.616,\n          Apollodorus 3.118, Diodorus Siculus 4.71.1 & 5.64.6, Pausanias 2.26.1, Hyginus Fabulae 202 &\n          Astronomica 2.40, Ovid Metamorphoses 2.596, Ovid Fasti 1.292)\n        [1.3] APOLLON & ARSINOE (Apollodorus 3.118,\n          Pausanias 2.26.1 & 3.26.4)\n        [1.4] APOLLON or ARSIPPOS & ARSINOE (Cicero\n          De Natura Deorum 3.21)\n\n[1.1] MAKHAON, PODALEIRIOS (Homer Iliad 2.730, Quintus Smyrnaeus 9.462, Pausanias\n          2.26.1 & 3.24.10 & 3.24.10, Diodorus Siculus 4.71.3)\n        [1.2] MAKHAON (Hyginus Fabulae 97)\n        [2.1] IASO, PANAKEIA (Aristophanes Plutus 620)\n        [2.2] HYGEIA (Pausanias 5.20.2)\n        [2.3] MAKHAON, PODALEIRIOS, IASO, AIGLE, HYGEIA, PANAKEIA (by Epione) (Erythrai Enscription)\n        [2.4] IASO, AIGLE, HYGEIA, PANAKEIA, AKESO (by Epione) (Suidas s.v. Epione)\n        [3.1] ARATOS (by Aristodama) (Pausanias 2.10.2)\n\nAESCULA′PIUS (Asklêpios), the god of the medical art. In the Homeric poems Aesculapius does not\n        appear to be considered as a divinity, but merely as a human being, which is indicated by the adjective\n        amumôn, which is never given to a god. No allusion is made to his descent, and he is merely mentioned as\n        the iêtêr amumôn, and the father of Machaon and Podaleirius. (Il. ii. 731, iv. 194,\n        xi. 518.) From the fact that Homer (Od. iv. 232) calls all those who practise the healing art\n        descendants of Paeëon, and that Podaleirius and Machaon are called the sons of Aesculapius, it has been\n        inferred, that Aesculapius and Paeëon are the same being, and consequently a divinity. But wherever Homer\n        mentions the healing god, it is always Paeëon, and never Aesculapius; and as in the poet's opinion all\n        physicians were descended from Paeëon, he probably considered Aesculapius in the same light. This\n        supposition is corroborated by the fact, that in later times Paeëon was identified with Apollo, and that\n        Aesculapius is universally described as a descendant of Apollo. The two sons of Aesculapius in the Iliad, were\n        the physicians in the Greek army, and are described as ruling over Tricca, Ithome, and Oechalia. (Il.\n        ii. 729.) According to Eustathius (ad Hom. p. 330), Lapithes was a son of Apollo and Stilbe, and\n        Aesculapius was a descendant of Lapithes. This tradition seems to be based on the same groundwork as the more\n        common one, that Aesculapius was a son of Apollo and Coronis, the daughter of Phlegyas, who is a descendant of\n        Lapithes. (Apollod. iii. 10. § 3; Pind. Pyth. iii. 14, with the Schol.)\n\nThe common story then goes on as follows. When Coronis was with child by Apollo, she became enamoured with\n        Ischys, an Arcadian, and Apollo informed of this by a raven, which he had set to watch her, or, according to\n        Pindar, by his own prophetic powers, sent his sister Artemis to kill Coronis. Artemis accordingly destroyed\n        Coronis in her own house at Lacereia in Thessaly, on the shore of lake Baebia. (Comp. Hom. Hymn. 27.\n        3.) According to Ovid (Met. ii. 605, &c.) and Hyginus (Poet. Astr. ii. 40), it was Apollo\n        himself who killed Coronis and Ischys. When the body of Coronis was to be burnt, Apollo, or, according to others\n        (Paus. ii. 26. § 5), Hermes, saved the child (Aesculapius) from the flames, and carried it to Cheiron, who\n        instructed the boy in the art of healing and in hunting. (Pind. Pyth. iii. 1, &c.; Apollod. iii.\n        10. § 3; Paus. l. c.) According to other traditions Aesculapius was born at Tricca in Thessaly\n        (Strab. xiv. p. 647), and others again related that Coronis gave birth to him during an expedition of her father\n        Phlegyas into Peloponnesus, in the territory of Epidaurus, and that she exposed him on mount Tittheion, which\n        was before called Myrtion. Here he was fed by a goat and watched by a dog, until at last he was found by\n        Aresthanas, a shepherd, who saw the boy surrounded by a lustre like that of lightning. (See a different account\n        in Paus. viii. 25. § 6.) From this dazzling splendour, or from his having been rescued from the flames, he\n        was called by the Dorians aiglaêr. The truth of the tradition that Aesculapius was born in the territory\n        of Epidaurus, and was not the son of Arsinoë, daughter of Leucippus and born in Messenia, was attested by\n        an oracle which was consulted to decide the question. (Paus. ii. 26. § 6, iv. 3. § 2; Cic. De Nat.\n          Deor. iii. 22, where three different Aesculapiuses are made out of the different local traditions about\n        him.) After Aesculapius had grown up, reports spread over all countries, that he not only cured all the sick,\n        but called the dead to life again. About the manner in which he acquired this latter power, there were two\n        traditions in ancient times. According to the one (Apollod. l. c.), he had received from Athena the\n        blood which had flowed from the veins of Gorgo, and the blood which had flowed from the veins of the right side\n        of her body possessed the power of restoring the dead to life. According to the other tradition, Aesculapius on\n        one occasion was shut up in the house of Glaucus, whom he was to cure, and while he was standing absorbed in\n        thought, there came a serpent which twined round the staff, and which he killed. Another serpent then came\n        carrying in its mouth a herb with which it recalled to life the one that had been killed, and Aesculapius\n        henceforth made use of the same herb with the same effect upon men. (Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 14.)\n        Several persons, whom Aesculapius was believed to have restored to life, are mentioned by the Scholiast on\n        Pindar (Pyth. iii. 96) and by Apollodorus. (l. c.) When he was exercising this art upon\n        Glaucus, Zeus killed Aesculapius with a flash of lightning, as he feared lest men might gradually contrive to\n        escape death altogether (Apollod. iii. 10. § 4), or, according to others, because Pluto had complained of\n        Aesculapius diminishing the number of the dead too much. (Diod. iv. 71; comp. Schol. ad Pind. Pyth.\n        iii. 102.) But, on the request of Apollo, Zeus placed Aesculapius among the stars. (Hygin. Poet. Astr.\n        ii. 14.) Aesculapius is also said to have taken part in the expedition of the Argonauts and in the Calydonian\n        hunt. He was married to Epione, and besides the two sons spoken of by Homer, we also find mention of the\n        following children of his : Janiscus, Alexenor, Aratus, Hygieia, Aegle, Iaso, and Panaceia (Schol. ad Pind.\n          Pyth. iii. 14; Paus. ii. 10. § 3, i. 34. § 2), most of whom are only personifications of the\n        powers ascribed to their father.\n\nThese are the legends about one of the most interesting and important divinities of antiquity. Various\n        hypotheses have been brought forward to explain the origin of his worship in Greece; and, while some consider\n        Aesculapius to have been originally a real personage, whom tradition had connected with various marvellous\n        stories, others have explained all the legends about him as mere personifications of certain ideas. The serpent,\n        the perpetual symbol of Aesculapius, has given rise to the opinion, that the worship was derived from Egypt, and\n        that Aesculapius was identical with the serpent Cnuph worshipped in Egypt, or with the Phoenician Esmun. (Euseb.\n        Praep. Evang. i. 10; comp. Paus. vii. 23. § 6.) But it does not seem necessary to have recourse to\n        foreign countries in order to explain the worship of this god. His story is undoubtedly a combination of real\n        events with the results of thoughts or ideas, which, as in so many instances in Greek mythology, are, like the\n        former, considered as facts. The kernel, out of which the whole myth has grown, is perhaps the account we read\n        in Homer; but gradually the sphere in which Aesculapius acted was so extended, that he became the representative\n        or the personification of the healing powers of nature, which are naturally enough described as the son (the\n        effects) of Helios,--Apollo, or the Sun.\n\nAesculapius was worshipped all over Greece, and many towns, as we have seen, claimed the honour of his birth.\n        His temples were usually built in healthy places, on hills outside the town, and near wells which were believed\n        to have healing powers. These temples were not only places of worship, but were frequented by great numbers of\n        sick persons, and may therefore be compared to modern hospitals. (Plut. Quaest. Rom. p. 286, D.) The\n        principal seat of his worship in Greece was Epidaurus, where he had a temple surrounded with an extensive grove,\n        within which no one was allowed to die, and no woman to give birth to a child. His sanctuary contained a\n        magnificent statue of ivory and gold, the work of Thrasymedes, in which he was represented as a handsome and\n        manly figure, resembling that of Zeus. (Paus. ii. 26 and 27.) He was seated on a throne, holding in one hand a\n        staff, and with the other resting upon the head of a dragon (serpent), and by his side lay a dog. (Paus. ii. 27.\n        § 2.) Serpents were everywhere connected with the worship of Aesculapius, probably because they were a\n        symbol of prudence and renovation, and were believed to have the power of discovering herbs of wondrous powers,\n        as is indicated in the story about Aesculapius and the serpents in the house of Glaucus. Serpents were further\n        believed to be guardians of wells with salutary powers. For these reasons a peculiar kind of tame serpents, in\n        which Epidaurus abounded, were not only kept in his temple (Paus. ii. 28. § 1), but the god himself\n        frequently appeared in the form of a serpent. (Paus. iii. 23. § 4; Val. Max. i. 8. § 2; Liv.\n        Epit. 11; compare the account of Alexander Pseudomantis in Lucian.) Besides the temple of Epidaurus,\n        whence the worship of the god was transplanted to various other parts of the ancient world, we may mention those\n        of Tricca (Strab. ix. p. 437), Celaenae (xiii. p. 603), between Dyme and Patrae (viii. p. 386), near Cyllene\n        (viii. p. 337), in the island of Cos (xiii. p. 657; Paus. iii. 23. § 4), at Gerenia (Strab. viii. p. 360),\n        near Caus in Arcadia (Steph. Byz. s. v.), at Sicyon (Paus. ii. 10. § 2), at Athens (i. 21. §\n        7), near Patrae (vii. 21. § 6), at Titane in the territory of Sicyon (vii. 23. § 6), at Thelpusa\n        (viii. 25. § 3), in Messene (iv. 31. § 8), at Phlius (ii. 13. § 3), Argos (ii. 23. § 4),\n        Aegium (ii. 23. § 5), Pellene (vii. 27. § 5), Asopus (iii. 22. § 7), Pergamum (iii. 26. §\n        7), Lebene in Crete, Smyrna, Balagrae (ii. 26. § 7), Ambracia (Liv. xxxviii. 5), at Rome and other places.\n        At Rome the worship of Aesculapius was introduced from Epidaurus at the command of the Delphic oracle or of the\n        Sibylline books, in B. C. 293, for the purpose of averting a pestilence. Respecting the miraculous manner in\n        which this was effected see Valerius Maximus (i. 8. § 2), and Ovid. Met. xv. 620, &c.; comp.\n        Niebuhr, Hist. of Rome, iii. p. 408, &c.; Liv. x. 47, xxix. 11; Suet. Claud. 25.)\n\nThe sick, who visited the temples of Aesculapius, had usually to spend one or more nights in his sanctuary\n        (katheudein, ineubare, Paus. ii. 27 § 2), during which they observed certain rules\n        prescribed by the priests. The god then usually revealed the remedies for the disease in a dream. (Aristoph.\n        Plut. 662, &c.; Cic. De Div. ii. 59 ; Philostr. Vita Apollon. i. 7; Jambl. De\n          Myst. iii. 2.) It was in allusion to this incubatio that many temples of Aesculapius contained\n        statues representing Sleep and Dream. (Paus. ii. 10. § 2.) Those whom the god cured of their disease\n        offered a sacrifice to him, generally a cock (Plat. Phacd. p. 118) or a goat (Paus. x. 32. § 8;\n        Serv. ad Virg. Georg. ii. 380), and hung up in his temple a tablet recording the name of the sick, the\n        disease, and the manner in which the cure had been effected. The temples of Epidaurus, Tricca, and Cos, were\n        full of such votive tablets, and several of them are still extant. (Paus. ii. 27. § 3; Strab. viii. p. 374;\n        comp. Dict. of Ant. p. 673.) Respecting the festivals celebrated in honour of Aesculapius see Dict.\n          of Ant. p. 103. &c. The various surnames given to the god partly describe him as the healing or\n        saving god, and are partly derived from the places in which he was worshipped. Some of his statues are described\n        by Pausanias. (ii. 10. § 3, x. 32. § 8.) Besides the attributes mentioned in the description of his\n        statue at Epidaurus, he is sometimes represented holding in one hand a phial, and in the other a stalf;\n        sometimes also a boy is represented standing by his side, who is the genius of recovery, and is called\n        Telesphorus, Euamerion, or Acesius. (Paus. ii. 11. § 7.) We still possess a considerable number of marble\n        statues and busts of Aesculapius, as well as many representations on coins and gems. There were in antiquity two\n        works which went under the name of Aesculapius, which, however, were no more genuine than the works ascribed to\n        Orpheus. (Fabricius, Bibl. Graec. i. p. 55, &c.)\n\nThe descendants of Aesculapius were called by the patronymic name Asclepiadae. (Asklêpiadai.)\n        Those writers, who consider Aesculapius as a real personage, must regard the Asclepiadae as his real\n        descendants, to whom he transmitted his medical knowledge, and whose principal seats were Cos and Cnidus. (Plat.\n        de Re Publ. iii. p. 405, &c.) But the Asclepiadae were also regarded as an order or caste of\n        priests, and for a long period the practice of medicine was intimately connected with religion. The knowledge of\n        medicine was regarded as a sacred secret, which was transmitted from father to son in the families of the\n        Asclepiadae, and we still possess the oath which every one was obliged to take when he was put in possession of\n        the medical secrets. (Galen, Anat. ii. p. 128 Aristid. Orat. i. p. 80.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 118 - 122 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer\n          C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Leukippos (Leucippus) also was the father of Arsinoe. Apollon (Apollo) had sex with her, and she bore him\n        Asklepios (Asclepius). Some say, however, that Asklepios was not born of Leukippos' daughter Arsinoe, but rather\n        of Phlegyas' daughter Koronis (Coronis) in Thessalia (Thessaly). Apollon fell in love with her and immediately\n        had intercourse with her, but she, despite her father' advice, preferred Kaineus' (Caeneus') son Iskhys (Ischys)\n        and lived with him. When a raven told Apollon this, he cursed it and turned it black in place of the white it\n        had been before, and he killed Koronis. As she was being consumed on her funeral pyre, he snatched her baby fire\n        and took him to the Kentauros Kheiron (Centaur Chiron), who reared him and taught him medicine and hunting. As a\n        surgeon Asklepios became so skilled in his profession that he not only saved lived but even revived the dead;\n        for he had received from Athena the blood that had coursed though the Gorgon's veins, the left-side portion of\n        which he used to destroy people, but that on the right he used for their preservation, which is how he could\n        revive those who had died. Zeus was afraid that men might learn the art of medicine from Asklepios and help each\n        other out, so he hit him with a thunderbolt. This angered Apollon, who slew the Kyklopes (Cyclopes), for they\n        designed the thunderbolt for Zeus.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 4. 217 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"When he [the healer Makhaon (Machaon)] saw the wound where the bitter arrow was driven, he sucked the\n        blood and in skill laid healing medicines on it that Kheiron (Chiron) in friendship long ago had given his\n        father [Asklepios (Asclepius)].\"\n\nPindar, Pythian Ode 3. 5 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"Long ago he [Kheiron (Chiron)] nursed gentle Asklepios (Asclepius), that craftsman of new health for weary\n        limbs and banisher of pain, the godlike healer of mortal sickness.\n        His mother, daughter of Phlegyas the horseman, ere with the help of Eleithyia, the nurse of childbirth, she\n        could bring her babe to the light of day, was in her chamber stricken by the golden shafts of Artemis, and to\n        the hall of death went down. For she in the madness of her heart had spurned the god, and unknown to her\n        father took another lover, even though her maiden bed she had already shared\n        with Apollon of the flowing hair, and bore within her the god's holy seed. . .\n        But when upon the high wood pure her kinsmen had set the maid, and the flames of Hephaistos shot their bright\n        tongues around her, then cried out Apollon : ‘No longer shall my soul endure that my own son here with his\n        mother in her death most pitiable should perish thus, in sorry grief.’\n        So spoke he and in one stride was there, and seized the babe from the dead maid; and round him the blazing\n        flames opened a pathway.\n        Then he took the child to the Magnetian Kentauros (Centaur) [i.e. Kheiron (Chiron)], that he teach him to be a\n        healer for mankind of all their maladies and ills.\n        All then who came to him, some plagues with sores of festering growths, some wounded by the stokes of weapons of\n        bright bronze, of by the slinger's shot of stone, others with limbs ravaged by summer's fiery heat or by the\n        winter's cold, to each for every various ill he made the remedy, and gave deliverance from pain, some with the\n        gently songs of incantation others he cured with soothing draughts of medicines, or wrapped their limbs around\n        with doctored salves, and some he made whole with the surgeon's knife.\n        And yet to profit even the skills of wisdom yield themselves captive. For a lordly bribe, gold flashing in the\n        hand, even this man was tempted to bring back to life one whom the jaws of death had seized already. With fierce\n        hands swiftly the son of Kronos (Cronus) [Zeus] loosed his anger on these two; his blazing bolt stripped from\n        them both their breath of life, and hurled them to their fate. A man must seek from heaven only that which is\n        fitting for mortal minds, perceiving well the path before his feet, the lot that is our portion . . .\n        Now if Kheiron (Chiron) the wise dwelt still within his cave, and if some spell to charm his soul lay in the\n        honeyed sweetness of my songs, then might I surely persuade him for men of noble mind to grant them a physician\n        of feverish ills, some son born of Apollon.\"\n\nPindar, Nemean Ode 3. 51 ff :\n        \"Wise-hearted Kheiron (Chiron) nursed the great Iason under his roof, and to Asklepios (Asclepius) taught\n        the soft-fingered skills of medicine's lore.\"\n\nSophocles, Fragment (trans.

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Leukippos (Leucippus) also was the father of Arsinoe. Apollon had sex with her, and she bore him Asklepios\n        (Asclepius). Some say, however, that Asklepios was not born of Leukippos' daughter Arsinoe, but rather of\n        Phlegyas' daughter Koronis (Coronis) in Thessalia (Thessaly). Apollon fell in love with her and immediately had\n        intercourse with her, but she, despite her father's advice, preferred Kaineus' (Caeneus') son Iskhys (Ischys)\n        and lived with him. When a raven told Apollon this, he cursed it and turned it black in place of the white it\n        had been before, and he killed Koronis. As she was being consumed on her funeral pyre, he snatched her baby fire\n        and took him to the kentauros Kheiron (centaur Chiron), who reared him and taught him medicine and\n        hunting.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 26. 1 - 7 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The land [of Epidauros (Epidaurus)] is especially sacred to Asklepios (Asclepius) is due to the following\n        reason. The Epidaurians say that Phlegyas came to the Peloponnesos (Peloponnese), ostensibly to see the land,\n        but really to spy out the number of the inhabitants, and whether the greater part of them was warlike. For\n        Phlegyas was the greatest soldier of his time, and making forays in all directions he carried off the crops and\n        lifted the cattle. When he went to the Peloponnesos, he was accompanied by his daughter [Koronis (Coronis)], who\n        all along had kept hidden from her father that she was with child by Apollon. In the country of the Epidaurians\n        she bore a son [Asklepios (Asclepius)], and exposed him on the mountain called Titthion (Nipple) at he present\n        day, but then named Myrtion. As they child lay exposed he was given milk by one of the goats that pastured about\n        the mountain, and was guarded by the watch-dog of the herd. And when Aresthanas, for this was the herdsman's\n        name, discovered that the tale of the goats was not full, and that the watch-dog also was absent from the herd,\n        he left, they say, no stone unturned, and on finding the child desired to take him up. As he drew near, he saw\n        lightning that flashed from the child, and, thinking that it was something divine, as in fact it was, he turned\n        away.\n        Presently it was reported over every land and sea that Asklepios was discovering everything he wished to heal\n        the sick, and the he was raising dead men to life.\n        There is also another tradition concerning him. Koronis, they say, when with child with Asklepios, had\n        intercourse with Iskhys (Ischys), son of Elatos (Elatus). She was killed by Artemis to punish her for the insult\n        done to Apollon, but when the pure was already lighted Hermes is said to have snatched the child from the\n        flames.\n        The third account is, in my opinion, the farthest from the truth; it makes Asklepios to be the son of Arsinoe,\n        the daughter of Leukippos (Leucippus). For when Apollophanes, the Arkadian (Arcadian), came to Delphoi and asked\n        the god if Asklepios was the son of Arsinoe and therefore a Messenian, the Pythian priestess gave this\n        response:--‘O Asklepios, born to bestow great joy upon mortals, pledge of the mutual love I enjoyed with\n        Phlegyas' daughter, lovely Koronis, who bare thee in rugged land, Epidauros.’\n        The oracle makes it quite certain the Asklepios was not a son of Arsinoe, and that the story was a fiction\n        invented by Hesiod, or by one of Hesiod's interpolators, just to please the Messenians.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 4. 3. 2 :\n        \"For they say that the sons of Asklepios (Asclepius) who went to Troy were Messenians, Asklepios being the\n        son of Arsinoe, daughter of Leukippos (Leucippus), not the son of Koronis (Coronis), and they call a desolate\n        spot in Messenia by the name of Trikka (Tricca).\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 202 (trans.

To Asklepios, we are told further, sons were born, Makhaon\n        (Machaon) and Podaleirios (Podalirus), who also developed the healing art and accompanied Agamemnon in the\n        expedition against Troy.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 26. 1 (trans.

The Arikians (Aricians) tell a tale that agrees with the\n        inscription on this slab, that when Hippolytos was killed, owing to the curses of Theseus, Asklepios (Asclepius)\n        raised him from the dead. On coming to life again he refused to forgive his father; rejecting his prayers, he\n        want to the Arikians in Italy.That Asklepios was considered a god from the first, and did not receive the title\n        only in the course of time.

Many astronomers have imagined that he is Aesculapius\n        [Asclepius], whom Jupiter [Zeus], for the sake of Apollo, put among the stars. For when Aesculapius was among\n        men, he so fare excelled the rest in the art of medicine that it wasn't enough for him to have healed men's\n        diseases unless he could also bring back the dead to life. He is said most recently, according to Eratosthenes\n        [Greek writer C3rd B.C.] to have restored to life Hippolytus who had been killed by the injustice of his\n        stepmother and the ignorance of his father. Some have said that by his skill Glaucus, son of Minos, lived again.\n        Because of this, as for a sin, Jove struck and burned his house with a thunderbolt, but because of his skill,\n        and since Apollo was his father, put him among the constellations holding a snake.\n        Certain people have said that he holds the snake for the following reason. [N.B. The following myth is usually\n        told of the seer Polyidos rather than Asclepius.] When he was commanded to restore Glaucus, and was confined in\n        a secret prison, while meditating what he should do, staff in hand, a snake is said to have crept on to his\n        staff. Distracted in mind, Aesculapius killed it, striking it again and again with his staff as it tried to\n        flee. Later, it is said, another snake came there, bringing an herb in its mouth, and placed it on its head.\n        When it had done this, both fled from the place. Where upon Aesculapius, using the same herb, brought Glaucus,\n        too, back to life. \n        And so the snake is put in the guardianship of Aesculapius and among the stars as well.

Apollo had buried this arrow in\n        the Hyperborean mountain, but when Jupiter [Zeus] pardoned his on, it was borne by the wind and brought to\n        Apollo along with the grain which at that time was growing.
