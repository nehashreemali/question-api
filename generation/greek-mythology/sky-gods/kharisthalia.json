  "content": "THALIA was one of the three Kharites (Charites) and the goddess of festivity and banquets. She was usually\n        depicted dancing in a circle with her two sisters.\n\nHer name was derived from the Greek adjective thalia which, when applied to banquets, means rich,\n        plentiful and luxuriant. She was probably the same as Pandaisia (Banquet), a Kharis companion of Aphrodite in\n        Athenian vase painting. Thalia's name also means \"the blooming\"--in the sense of springtime greenery\n        and blossoms (cf. the Hora Thallo).\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & EURYNOME (Hesiod Theogony 907, Apollodorus 1.13, Pausanias 9.35.1)\n        [1.2] ZEUS & EUNOMIA (Orphic Hymn 60)\n\nHesiod, Theogony 907 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And Eurynome, the daughter of Okeanos (Oceanus), beautiful in form, bare him [Zeus] three fair-cheeked\n        Kharites (Charites. Graces), Aglaia (Aglaea), and Euphrosyne, and lovely Thalie (Thalia), from whose eyes as\n        they glanced flowed love that unnerves the limbs: and beautiful is their glance beneath their brows.\"\n\nPindar, Olympian Ode 14. 1 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"Whose haunts are by Kephissos' (Cephisus') river, you queens [the Kharites] beloved of poets' song, ruling\n        Orkhomenos (Orchomenus), that sunlit city and land of lovely steeds, watch and ward of the ancient Minyan race,\n        hear now my prayer, you Kharites (Charites, Graces) three. For in your gift are all our mortal joys, and every\n        sweet thing, be it wisdom, beauty, or glory, that makes rich the soul of man. Nor even can the immortal gods\n        order at their behest the dance and festals, lacking the Kharites' aid; who are the steward of all rites of\n        heaven, whose thrones are set at Pytho beside Apollon of the golden bow, and who with everlasting honour worship\n        the Father, lord of great Olympos.\n        Euphrosyne, lover of song, and Aglaia revered, daughters of Zeus the all-highest, hearken, and with Thalia,\n        darling of harmony, look on our songs of revel, on light feet stepping to grace this happy hour . . . I come to\n        praise Asopikhos (Asopichus), whose Minyan house, Thalia, now of your favour wears the pride of the Olympian\n        victor.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 13 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"By Okeanos' (Oceanus') daughter Eurynome he [Zeus] had the Kharites (Charites, Graces), named Aglaia\n        (Aglaea), Eurphrosyne, and Thaleia.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 9. 35. 1 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Hesiod in the Theogony says that the Kharites (Charites, Graces)) are daughters of Zeus and\n        Eurynome, giving them the names of Euphrosyne, Aglaia (Aglaea) and Thalia.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 60 to the Charites (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Illustrious Kharites (Charites, Graces), mighty named, from Zeus descended, and Eunomia famed [here\n        identified with the Okeanis Eurynome], Thalia and Aglaia (Aglaea) fair and bright, and blest Euphrosyne, whom\n        joys delight.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
