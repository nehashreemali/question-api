  "content": "THE MOUSAI APOLLONIDES were three younger Muses, daughters of the god Apollon. They were honoured at the shrine\n        of Delphoi where one, Kephiso (Cephiso), was named after a local river. The three were sometimes called Nete,\n        Mese, and Hypate after the lowest, middle and highest strings of the lyre.\n\nThe Apollonides were one of three sets of Muses--the others being the Olympian Nine\n        and the Titanid Three.\n\nAPOLLON (Eumelus Frag\n            35, Tzetzes on Hesiod 23)\n\n[1.1] KEPHISO, APOLLONIS, BORYSTHENIS (Eumelus Frag 35, Tzetzes on Hesiod 23) \n        [2.1] NETE, MESE, HYPATE (Plutarch Symposium 9.14)\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
