  "content": "HESTIA was the virgin goddess of the hearth (both private and municipal) and the home. As the goddess of the\n        family hearth she also presided over the cooking of bread and the preparation of the family meal. Hestia was\n        also the goddess of the sacrificial flame and received a share of every sacrifice to the gods. The cooking of\n        the communal feast of sacrificial meat was naturally a part of her domain.\n\nIn myth Hestia was the first born child of Kronos (Cronus) and Rhea\n        who was swallowed by her father at birth. Zeus later forced the old Titan to\n        disgorge Hestia and her siblings. As the first to be swallowed she was also the last to be disgorged, and so was\n        named as both the eldest and youngest of the six Kronides.\n        When the gods Apollon and Poseidon sought for her hand in marriage, Hestia refused and asked Zeus\n        to let her remain an eternal virgin. He agreed and she took her place at his royal hearth.\n\nHestia was depicted in Athenian vase painting as a modestly veiled woman sometimes holding a flowered branch\n        (perhaps a chaste-tree). In classical sculpture she was also veiled, with a kettle as her attribute.\n\n[1.1] KRONOS & RHEA (Hesiod Theogony 453, Apollodorus 1.4, Diodorus Sicululs 1.4. Hyginus Preface, Ovid Fasti\n          6.285)\n        [1.2] KRONOS (Homeric Hymns 18 & 24)\n        [1.3] RHEA (Pindar Nemean Ode 11)\n\nHE′STIA (Hestia, Ion. Histiê), the goddess of the hearth, or rather the fire burning on the hearth,\n        was regarded as one of the twelve great gods, and accordingly as a daughter of Cronus and Rhea. According to the\n        common tradition, she was the first-born daughter of Rhea, and was therefore the first of the children that was\n        swallowed by Cronus. (Hes. Theog. 453, &c.; Hom. Hymn. in Ven. 22; Apollod. i. 1. §\n        5.) She was, like Artemis and Athena, a maiden divinity, and when Apollo and Poseidon sued for her hand, she\n        swore by the head of Zeus to remain a virgin for ever (Hom. Hymn. in Ven. 24, &c.), and in this\n        character it was that her sacrifices consisted of cows which were only one year old. The connection between\n        Hestia and Apollo and Poseidon, which is thus alluded to in the legend, appears also in the temple of Delphi,\n        where the three divinities were worshipped in common, and Hestia and Poseidon appeared together also at Olympia.\n        (Paus. v. 26. § 26, x. 5. § 3; Hom. Hymn. xxxi. 2.) As the hearth was looked upon as the\n        sacred centre of domestic life, so Hestia was the goddess of domestic life and the giver of all domestic\n        happiness and blessings, and as such she was believed to dwell in the inner part of every house (Hom. Hymn.\n          in Ven. 30; Callim. Hymn. in Del. 325, in Cer. 129), and to have invented the art of\n        building houses. (Diod. v. 68; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 735.) In this respect she appears often together\n        with Hermes, who was likewise a deus penetralis, as protecting the works of man. (Hom. Hymn.\n        xxxii. 10: Paus. x. 11. § 3.) As the hearth of a house is at the same time the altar on which sacrifices\n        are offered to the domestic gods (hestiouchoi or ephestioi), Hestia was looked upon as presiding at all\n        sacrifices, and, as the goddess of the sacred fire of the altar, she had a share in the sacrifices in all the\n        temples of the gods. (Hom. Hymn. in Ven. 31.) Hence when sacrifices were offered, she was invoked\n        first, and the first part of the sacrifice was offered to her. (Hom. Hymn. xxxii. 5; Pind.\n        Nem. xi. 5; Plat. Cratyl. p. 401, d. ; Paus. v. 14. § 5; Schol. ad Aristoph.\n          Vesp. 842 ; Hesych. s. v. aph hestias archomenos.) Solemn oaths were sworn by the goddess of the\n        hearth, and the hearth itself was the sacred asylum where suppliants implored the protection of the inhabitants\n        of the house. (Hom. Od. xiv. 159; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1579.) A town or city is only an\n        extended family, and therefore had likewise its sacred hearth, the symbol of an harmonious community of citizens\n        and of a common worship. This public hearth usually existed in the prytaneium of a town, where the goddess had\n        her especial sanctuary (thalamos), under the name of Prutanitis, with a statue and the sacred hearth. There the\n        prytanes offered sacrifices to her, on entering upon their office, and there, as at a private hearth, Hestia\n        protected the suppliants. As this public hearth was the sacred asylum in every town, the state usually received\n        its guests and foreign ambassadors there, and the prytanes had to act the part of hosts. When a colony was sent\n        out, the emigrants took the fire which was to burn on the hearth of their new home from that of the mother town.\n        (Pind. Nem. xi. 1, &c., with the Scholiast; Parthen. Erot. 18; Dion. Hal. ii. 65.) If ever\n        the fire of her hearth became extinct, it was not allowed to be lighted again with ordinary fire, but either by\n        fire produced by friction, or by burning glasses drawing fire from the sun. The mystical speculations of later\n        times proceeded from tile simple ideas of the ancients, and assumed a sacred hearth not only in the centre of\n        the earth, but even in that of the universe, and confounded Hestia in various ways with other divinities, such\n        as Cybele, Gaea, Demeter, Persephone, and Artemis. (Orph. Hymn. 83; Plut. de Plac. Philos. 3, 11,\n          Numa, 11.) There were but few special temples of Hestia in Greece, as in reality every prytaneum was a\n        sanctuary of the goddess, and as a portion of the sacrifices, to whatever divinity they were offered, belonged\n        to her. There was, however, a separate temple of Hestia at Hermione, though it contained no image of her, but\n        only an altar. (Paus. ii. 35. § 2.) Her sacrifices consisted of the primitiae of fruit, water, oil, wine,\n        and cows of one year old. (Hesych. l. c. ; Hom. Hymn. xxxi. 3, xxxii. 6; Pind. Nem.\n        xi. 6.) The Romans worshipped the same goddess, or rather the same ideas embodied in her, under the name of\n        Vesta, which is in reality identical with Hestia; but as the Roman worship of Vesta differed in several points\n        from that of Hestia in Greece.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 453 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"But Rhea was subject in love to Kronos (Cronus) and bare splendid children, Hestia, Demeter, and gold-shod\n        Hera and strong Haides . . . and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker [Poseidon], and wise Zeus . . . These great\n        Kronos swallowed as each came forth from the womb to his mother's knees . . . Therefore he kept no blind\n        outlook, but watched and swallowed down his children . . . As the years rolled on, great Kronos the wily was\n        beguiled by the deep suggestions of Gaia (Gaea, the Earth), and brought up again his offspring, vanquished by\n        the arts and might of his own son, and he vomited up first the stone which he had swallowed last.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 5 to Aphrodite 18 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Nor yet does the pure maiden Histia (Hestia) love Aphrodite's works. She was the first-born child of wily\n        Kronos (Cronus) and youngest too, by will of Zeus who holds the aigis,--a queenly maid whom both Poseidon and\n        Apollon sought to wed. But she was wholly unwilling, nay, stubbornly refused; and touching the head of father\n        Zeus who holds the aigis, she, that fair goddess, sware a great oath which has in truth been fulfilled, that she\n        would be a maiden all her days. So Zeus the Father gave her a high honour instead of marriage, and she has her\n        place in the midst of the house and has the richest portion. In all the temples of the gods she has a share of\n        honour, and among all mortal men she is chief of the goddesses. Of these three Aphrodite cannot bend or ensnare\n        the hearts.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 4 - 7 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"He [Kronos (Cronus)] then married his sister Rhea. Because both Ge (Gaea, Earth) and Ouranos (Uranus,\n        Heaven) had given him prophetic warning that his rule would be overthrown by a son of his own, he took to\n        swallowing his children at birth. He swallowed his first-born daughter Hestia, then Demeter and Hera, and\n        Poseidon and Haides . . .\n        When Zeus was grown, he engaged Okeanos' (Oceanus') daughter Metis as a colleague. She gave Kronos a drug, by\n        which he was forced to vomit forth first the stone and then the children he had swallowed. With them Zeus fought\n        a war against Kronos and the Titanes (Titans).\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 68. 1 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"To Kronos (Cronus) and Rhea, we are told, were born Hestia, Demeter, and Hera, and Zeus, Poseidon, and\n        Haides.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 70. 1 : \n        \"There was delivered to Kronos (Cronus) an oracle regarding the birth of Zeus which stated that the son who\n        would be born to him would wrest the kingship from him by force. Consequently Kronos time and again did away\n        with the children whom he begot; but Rhea, grieved as she was, and yet lacking the power to change her husband's\n        purpose, when she had given birth to Zeus, concealed him in Ide (Ida).\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"From Saturnus [Kronos (Cronus)] and Ops [Rhea]: Vesta [Hestia], Ceres [Demeter], Juno [Hera], Juppiter\n        [Zeus], Pluto [Haides], Neptunus [Poseidon].\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 6. 285 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Juno [Hera] and Ceres [Demeter], they recount, were born from Ops [Rhea] by Saturnus' [Kronos' (Cronus')]\n        seed. Vesta [Hestia] was the third. The first two married, both gave birth, it's reported; one of the three\n        stayed ignorant of men.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 6. 319 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Should I omit or recount your shame, red Priapus? It is a very playful, tiny tale. Coroneted Cybele\n        [Rhea], with her crow of turrets, invites the eternal gods to her feast. She invites, too, Satyri (Satyrs) and\n        Nymphae (Nymphs), Rural-Spirits (Rustica Numina); Silenus is present, uninvited. It's not allowed and\n        too long to narrate the gods' banquet: night was consumed with much wine. Some blindly stroll shadowy Ida's\n        dells, or lie down and rest their bodies in the soft grass. Others play or are clasped by sleep; or link their\n        arms and thump the green earth in triple quick step. Vesta [Hestia] lies down and takes a quiet, carefree nap,\n        just as she was, her head pillowed by turf. But the red saviour of gardens [Priapos] prowls for Nymphai and\n        goddesses, and wanders back and forth. He spots Vesta. It's unclear if he thought she was a Nympha or knew it\n        was Vesta. He claims ignorance. He conceives a vile hope and tires to steal upon her, walking on tiptoe, as his\n        heart flutters. By chance old Silenus had left the donkey he came on by a gently burbling stream. The long\n        Hellespont's god was getting started, when it bellowed an untimely bray. The goddess stars up, frightened by the\n        noise. The whole crowd fly to her; the god flees through hostile hands.\"\n\nN.B. An almost identical story is told by Ovid of Priapos and the Nymphe Lotis.\n\nHomeric Hymn 24 to Hestia (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Hestia, in the high dwellings of all, both deathless gods and men who walk on earth, you ahve gained an\n        everlasting abode and highest honour: glorious is your portion and your right. For without you mortals hold no\n        banquet,--where one does not duly pour sweet wine in offering to Hestia both first and last. And you,\n        Argeiphontes [Hermes], son of Zeus and Maia, . . . be favourable and help us, you and Hestia, the worshipful and\n        dear.

Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"To Hestia, Fumigation from Aromatics.

Eternal, much formed,\n        ever florid queen, laughing and blessed, and of lovely mien; accept these rites, accord each just desire, and\n        gentle health and needful good inspire.\"\n\nHestia was the goddess of hearth and home. As the goddess of the hearth-fire, Hestia also presided over the\n        altar flame and the sacrificial feast. The central hearth of a state also belonged to her--the fire kept alight\n        in the civic hall.\n\nHomeric Hymn 5 to Aphrodite 18 ff (trans.

The first\n        men who gave names [to the gods] were no ordinary persons, but high thinkers and great talkers . . . Shall we,\n        then, begin with Hestia, according to custom? . . . Then what would you say the man had in mind who gave Hestia\n        her name? . . . Take that which we call ousia (reality, essence); some people call it essia,\n        and still others ôsia. First, then, in connection with the second of these forms, it is\n        reasonable that the essence of things be called Hestia; and moreover, because we ourselves say of that which\n        partakes of reality ‘it is’ (estin), the name Hestia would be correct in this connection\n        also; for apparently we also called ousia (reality) essia in ancient times. And besides, if you\n        consider it in connection with sacrifices, you would come to the conclusion that those who established them\n        understood the name in that way; for those who called the essence of things essia would naturally\n        sacrifice to Hestia first of all the gods. Those on the other hand, who say ôsia would agree,\n        well enough with Herakleitos that all things move and nothing remains still. So they would say the cause and\n        ruler of things was the pushing power (ôthoun), wherefore it had been rightly named\n        ôsia.\"\n\nPlato, Laws 745b (trans.
