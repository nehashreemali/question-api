  "content": "EILEITHYIA (Ilithyia) was the goddess of childbirth and labour pains. According to some there were two\n        Eileithyiai (Eileithyiae)--one who furthered birth and one who protracted the labour. Her name means \"she\n        who comes to aid\" or \"relieve\" from the Greek word elêluthyia. Her Roman\n        counterpart was Lucina (\"Light bringer\") or Natio (\"Birth\").\n\nWhen Alkmene (Alcmena) was in labour with Herakles (Heracles), Hera sent Eileithyia to stay the birth and so\n        kill mother and child. However, Alkmene's handmaiden Galinthias spied the goddess seated before the door with\n        her arms and legs crossed, and cried \"a son is born.\" The goddess leapt up in surprise, releasing her\n        magical grip on the womb, allowing the child to be born. Eileithyia was furious at being tricked by the woman\n        and transformed Galinthias into a polecat.\n\nEileithyia was depicted as a woman wielding a torch, representing the burning pains of childbirth, or with her\n        arms raised in the air to bring the child to the light. She was closely identified with the goddesses Hera and Artemis, both of whom bore\n        epithets of her name.\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & HERA (Hesiod Theogony 921, Apollodorus 1.13)\n        [1.2] HERA (Homer Iliad 11.270, Pindar Nemean Ode\n          7, Pausanias 1.18.5, Diodorus Siculus 4.9.4, Aelian On Animals 7.15, Nonnus Dionysiaca 48.794)\n\n[1.1] SOSIPOLIS (Pausanias 6.20.2)\n        [2.1] EROS (Pausanias 9.27.2)\n\nEILEITHYIA (Eileithuia), also called Eleithyia, Eilethyia, or Eleutho. The ancients derive her name from the\n        verb eleuthein, according to which it would signify the coming or helping goddess. She was the goddess\n        of birth, who came to the assistance of women in labour; and when she was kindly disposed, she furthered the\n        birth, but when she was angry, she protracted the labour and delayed the birth. These two functions were\n        originally assigned to different Eileithuiai. (Hom. Il. xi. 270 xvi. 187, xix. 103; comp. Paus. i. 44.\n        § 3; Hesych. s. v. Eileithuiai.) Subsequently, however, both functions were attributed to one\n        divinity, and even in the later Homeric poems the Cretan Eileithyia alone is mentioned. (Hom. Hymn. in\n          Apoll. Del. 98, &c., Od. xix. 188.) According to the Iliad the Eileithyiae were daughters of\n        Hera, the goddess of marriage, whom they obeyed. (Hom. Il. xix. 119; comp. Pind. Nem. vii.\n        init.; Ov. Met. ix. 285, &c.; Anton. Lib. 29.) According to Hesiod (Theog. 922) Zeus was\n        the father of Eileithyia, and she was the sister of Hebe and Ares. (Apollod. i. 3. § 1.) Artemis and\n        Eileithyia were originally very different divinities, but there were still some features in their characters\n        which afterwards made them nearly identical. Artemis was believed to avert evil, and to protect what was young\n        and tender, and sometimes she even assisted women in labour. Artemis, moreover, was, like Eileithyia, a maiden\n        divinity; and although the latter was the daughter of the goddess of marriage and the divine midwife, neither\n        husband, nor lover, nor children of her are mentioned. She punished want of chastity by increasing the pains at\n        the birth of a child, and was therefore feared by maidens. (Theocrit. xxvii. 28.) Frequent births, too, were\n        displeasing to her. In an ancient hymn attributed to Olen, which was sung in Delos, Eileithyia was called the\n        mother of Eros. (Paus. i. 18. § 5. ix. 27. § 2.) Her worship appears to have been first established\n        among the Dorians in Crete, where she was believed to have been born in a cave in the territory of Cnossus. From\n        thence her worship spread over Delos and Attica. According to a Delian tradition, Eileithyia was not born in\n        Crete, but had come to Delos from the Hyperboreans, for the purpose of assisting Leto. (Herod. iv. 35.) She had\n        a sanctuary at Athens, containing three carved images of the goddess, which were covered all over down to the\n        toes. Two were believed to have been presented by Phaedra, and the third to have been brought by Erysichthon\n        from Delos. (Paus. i. 8. § 15.) Her statues, however, were not thus covered everywhere, as Pausanias\n        asserts, for at Aegion there was one in which the head, hands, and feet were uncovered. (Paus. vii. 23. §\n        5.) She had sanctuaries in various places, such as Sparta (Paus. iii. 17. § 1, 14. § 6), Cleitor\n        (viii. 21. § 2), Messene (iv. 31. § 7), Tegea (viii. 48. § 5), Megara (i. 44. § 3), Hermione\n        (ii. 35. § 8), and other places. The Elionia, who was worshipped at Argos as the goddess of birth (Plut.\n        Quaest. Rom. 49), was probably the same as Eileithyia.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nThe name Eileithyia had a number of distinctive forms in the various Greek dialects.\n\nHomer, Iliad 11. 270 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"The hard Eileithyiai (Eileithyiae, Spirits of Childbirth) . . .

Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th\n          B.C.) :\n        \"[The goddess Leto, pregnant with Apollon, went into labour on the island of Delos :]\n        Leto was racked nine days and nine nights with pangs beyond wont. And there were with her all the chiefest of\n        the goddesses, Dione and Rheia and Ikhnaia (Ichnaea) and Themis and loud-moaning Amphitrite and the other\n        deathless goddesses save white-armed Hera, who sat in the halls of cloud-gathering Zeus. Only Eileithyia,\n        goddess of sore travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on the top of Olympos (Olympus) beneath\n        golden clouds by white-armed Hera's contriving, who kept her close through envy, because Leto with the lovely\n        tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and strong.\n        But the goddesses sent out Iris from the well-set isle to bring Eileithyia, promising her a great necklace\n        strung with golden threads, nine cubits long. And they bade Iris call her aside from white-armed Hera, lest she\n        might afterwards turn her from coming with her words. When swift Iris, fleet of foot as the wind, had heard all\n        this, she set to run; and quickly finishing all the distance she came to the home of the gods, sheer Olympos,\n        and forthwith called Eileithyia out from the hall to the door and spoke winged words to her, telling her all as\n        the goddesses who dwell on Olympos had bidden her. So she moved the heart of Eileithyia in her dear breast; and\n        they went their way, like why wild-doves in their going. And as soon as Eileithyia the goddess of sore travail\n        (mogostokos) set foot on Delos, the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she\n        cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth [of Delos] laughed for joy\n        beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 18. 5 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Eileithyia they say came from the Hyperboreans to Delos and helped Leto in her labour; and from Delos the\n        name spread to other peoples.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 19. 103 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"Zeus spoke forth and made a vow before all the immortals : ‘Hear me, all you gods and all you\n        goddesses: hear me while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges. This day Eiliethyia of women's\n        child-pains shall bring forth a man to the light who, among the men sprung of the generation of my blood, shall\n        be lord over all those dwelling about him.’ . . . But Hera in a flash of speed left the horn of Olympos .\n        . . and she brought him [Eurystheus] sooner into the light, and made him premature, and stayed the childbirth of\n        Alkmene (Alcmena) [who was pregnant with Herakles (Heracles)], and held back the birth pangs.\"\n        [N.B. Presumably Hera's daughter Eileithyia stayed the birth as in later versions of the story.]\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 53 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"For when Herakles (Heracles) was about to be born, Zeus told the gods that the coming descendant of\n        Perseus would be king of Mykenai (Mycenae), so Hera in jealous spite persuaded Eileithyia to hold back Alkmene's\n        (Alcmena's) labor, and then arranged to have Sthenelos' (Sthenelus') son Eurystheus born in seven months.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 9. 4 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian C1st\n          B.C.) :\n        \"Zeus, whose mind was fixed upon the birth of Herakles (Heracles), announced in advance in the presence of\n        all the gods that it was his intention to make the child who should be born that day king over the descendants\n        of Perseus; whereupon Hera, who was filled with jealousy, using as her helper Eileithyia her daughter, checked\n        the birth-pains of Alkmene (Alcmena) and brought Eurystheus forth to the light before his full time.\"\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 29 (trans. Celoria) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"At Thebes Proitos (Proetus) had a daughter Galinthias. This maiden was playmate and companion of Alkmene\n        (Alcmena), daughter of Elektryon (Electryon). As the birth throes for Herakles (Heracles) were pressing on\n        Alkmene, the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) and Eileithyia (Birth-Goddess), as a favour to Hera, kept Alkmene in\n        continuous birth pangs.\n        They remained seated, each keeping their arms crossed. Galinthias, fearing that the pains of her labour would\n        drive Alkmene mad, ran to the Moirai and Eleithyia and announced that by desire of Zeus a boy had been born to\n        Alkmene and that their prerogatives had been abolished. At all this, consternation of course overcame the Moirai\n        and they immediately let go their arms. Alkmene's pangs ceased at once and Herakles was born. The Moirai were\n        aggrieved at this and took away the womanly parts of Galinthias since, being but a mortal, she had deceived the\n        gods. They turned her into a deceitful weasel, making her live in crannies and gave her a grotesque way of\n        mating. She is mounted through the ears and gives birth by bringing forth her young through the throat. Hekate\n        felt sorry for this transformation of her appearance and appointed her a sacred servant of herself.\"\n\nAelian, On Animals 10. 47 (trans. Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Ichneumons [or mongooses] are said to be sacred to Leto and the Eileithyiai (Goddesses of Birth), and the\n        people of Heraklepolis (Heracleapolis) worship them, so they say.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 9. 281 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Alkmena (Alcmena), the mother of Herakles (Heracles), tells the story of her son's birth :] May the gods\n        favour you when your time comes, with no long painful waiting when you call on Ilithyia, who attends the pangs\n        and fears of labour. To myself she was by Juno's [Hera's] influence the most difficult. For when the natal day\n        of Hercules [Herakles], my greatly-toiling son, drew close and now the sun had reached the tenth of heaven's\n        signs, my burden strained my womb, and what I bore was huge: you could be sure that hidden weight was Jove's\n        [Zeus'] begetting. Then my pains grew worse, more than I could endure. Why, even now I feel cold shudders as I\n        speak, and pain recalled is pain renewed.\n        For seven nights, for seven days in torture, overwhelmed in agony, I stretched my arms to heaven and called\n        Lucina [Eileithyia] and the Nixi (Gods of Birth). I called and called. She came, indeed, but bribed beforehand,\n        ready to donate my life to spiteful Juno [Hera]. On that altar there, before the door, she sat and heard my\n        groans. Legs crossed, right over left, and fingers locked, she barred the birth, and chanted silent spells,\n        spells that held back the birth as it began. I strained and struggled; mad with pain I screamed abuse in vain at\n        Jove's [Zeus'] ingratitude. I longed to die; my protests would have moved a block of granite. Theban matrons\n        came to add their prayers and comfort my distress.\n        One of my maids was there, a low-born girl, my golden-haired Galanthis, always active to do my bidding and a\n        favourite for her good services. She realized that spiteful Juno [Hera] had some plot in hand, and on her\n        frequent errands in and out she saw the goddess [Eileithyia] sitting by the altar, arms round her knees and\n        fingers linked, and said ‘Whoever you may be, congratulate our mistress; Lady Alcmena Argolis is\n        delivered, her prayers are answered and her babe is born.’\n        Up sprang the great Birth-goddess in dismay, and loosed her linking hands, and as the bonds were loosed I was\n        delivered of my child. Galanthis laughed at the goddess she's deceived, so is the story told, and, as she\n        laughed, the cruel goddess seized her by the hair and dragged her to the ground and when she tried to rise\n        prevented her and changed her arms to forelegs. Though her shape is different, she's active now as ever, and her\n        back still keeps her golden colour, and because out of her mouth came lies that aided birth, out of her mouth\n        her young are born. My door she's in and out of as she was before.\"\n        [N.B. Galanthis was transformed into a weasel or polecat, an animal which had a role similar to a housecat in\n        ancient Greece].\n\nHomer, Iliad 11. 270 ff (trans.

Yet the tree, in labour, stooped with groan on\n        groan and wet with falling tears. Then, pitying Lucina stood beside the branches in their pain and laid her\n        hands upon them and pronounced the words of birth. The tree split open and the sundered bark yielded its living\n        load; a baby boy squalled, and the Naides laid him on soft grass and bathed him in his mother's flowing tears\n        [myrrh].\"\n\nOvid, Heroides 6. 121 ff (trans.
