  "content": "LEUKIPPIDES (Leucippides) were two Messenian princesses who were granted immortality alongside their Dioskouroi (Dioscuri) husbands.\n\nThe Dioskouroi abducted the girls from their home in Messenia but they were already betrothed to the brothers\n        Idas and Lynkeus (Lynceus) who gave chase. In the fight which ensued one of the Dioskouroi and both of the\n        Aphareides were killed. Zeus then transformed the twins and their brides into immortal demigods.\n\nThe name Leukippides means both \"Daughters of Leukippos\" and \"Of the White-Horses\" from the\n        Greek words leukos and hippos. Individually they were named Phoibe (Lunar-Bright) and Hilaeira\n        (Softly-Shining), fitting names for the wives of the star-spangled twins of the constellation Gemini. The words\n        \"hilaeira\" and \"phoibe\" were also epithets of the moon-goddess Selene who drove a two-horse biga through the sky.\n\n[1.1] LEUKIPPOS (Apollodorus 3.11, Theocritus Idyll 22.137, Hyginus Fabulae 80, Ovid\n          Fasti 5.709, Propertius 1.2)\n        [2.1] APOLLON (Stasinus Cypria Frag, Pausanias\n          3.16.1)\n\n[1.1] HILAEIRA, PHOIBE (Apollodorus 3.117, Pausanias 3.16.1, Hyginus Fabulae\n          80)\n\n[1.1] MNESILEOS (by Polydeukes) (Apollodorus\n          3.134)\n        [1.2] MNASINOUS (by Polydeukes) (Pausanias\n          2.22.5)\n\n[1.1] ANOGON (by Kastor) (Apollodorus 3.134)\n        [1.2] ANAXIS (by Kastor) (Pausanais 2.22.5)\n\nLEUCI′PPIDES (Leukippides), i. e. the daughters of the Messenian prince Leucippus. (Eurip.\n        Helen. 1467.) Their names were Phoebe and Hilaeira, and they were priestesses of Athena and Artemis,\n        and betrothed to Idas and Lynceus, the sons.of Aphareus; but Castor and Polydeuces being charmed with their\n        beauty, carried them off and married them. (Apollod. iii. 12. § 8, 10. § 3; Paus. i. 18. § 1.)\n        When the sons of Aphareus attempted to rescue their beloved brides, they were both slain by the Dioscuri.\n        (Hygin.

But they, since their\n        brides-to-be were lost, took arms to see if they could recover them. Castor killed Lynceus in battle; Idas\n        [killed Castor and Polydeuces Idas.

The author of the poem\n        Kypria calls them daughters of Apollon. Their priestesses are young maidens, called, as are also the\n        goddesses, Leukippides (Leucippides). One of the images was adorned by a Leukippis (Leucippis) who had served\n        the goddesses as a priestess. She gave it a face of modern workmanship instead of the old one; she was forbidden\n        by a dream to adorn the other one as well. Here there has been hung from the roof an egg tied to ribands, and\n        they say that it was the famous egg that legend says Leda brought forth.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Lactanius 1.10.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
