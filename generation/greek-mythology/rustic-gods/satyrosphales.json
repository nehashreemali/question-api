  "content": "PHALES was the rustic spirit (daimon) or satyr demi-god of the processional phallus and the phallic\n        song (phallikon) of the festivals of Dionysos. Aristiphanes, surely in jest, calls him the god of\n        adultery and pederasty.\n\nPhales was connected with the phallic Dionysos, the phallic Hermes, and the daimones Tykhon, Konisalos\n          and Orthanes. He also resembled the god Priapos.\n\nPerhaps HERMES or DIONYSOS though\n        nowhere stated\n\nAristophanes, Acharnanians 263 ff (trans. O'Neill) (Greek comedy C5th to 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"I will follow, singing the Phallic hymn; thou, wife, look on from the top of the terrace. Forward!\n        (He sings) Oh, Phales, companion of the orgies of Bakkhos (Bacchus), night reveller, god of adultery and of\n        pederasty . . . How much sweeter, oh Phales, Phales, is it to surprise Thrakian (Trhacian) slave-girl of\n        Strymodorus, stealing wood from\n        Mount Phelleus, to catch her under the arms, to throw her, on the ground and lay her, Oh, Phales, Phales!\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
