He was a consort of the goddess Demeter and the father of Euboulos (Eubulus), demi-god of ploughing,\n        Khrysothemis (Chrysothemis), demi-goddess of the harvest-festival, and Akakallis (Acacallis) \"the\n        Daffodil.\" His grand-daughter Karme (Carme) shared his name and function.\n\nKarmanor's name means \"the Shearer\" from the Greek words karma \"cropped\" and\n        keirô, \"to crop or shear\".\n\nKarmanor was perhaps identified with Iasion, the Samothrakian consort of Demeter who\n        was sometimes also located in Krete.\n\nEUBOULOS, KHRYSOTHEMIS (Pausanias 2.30.3 , 10.7.2 & 10.16.5)\n\nCARMA′NOR (Karmanôr), a Cretan of Tarrha, father of Eubulus and Chrysothemis. He was said to have\n        received and purified Apollo and Artemis, after they had slain the monster Python, and it was in the house of\n        Carmanor that Apollo formed his connexion with the nymph Acacallis.
