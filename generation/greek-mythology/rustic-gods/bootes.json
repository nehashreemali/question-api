  "content": "BOOTES was the demi-god inventor of the wagon and the plough. He was set amongst the stars by his mother, the\n        goddess Demeter, as the constellations Bootes and the Wain\n        (Ursa Major).\n\nBootes means \"Ploughman\" from the Greek word boôtês. He was also named\n        Philomelos \"Friend of Ease\" from the words philos and mêlos.\n\nBootes may have been identified with Demeter's Kretan son Eubouleus.\n\nPHILOME′LUS (Philomêlos), a son of Iasion and Demeter, and brother of Plutos, is said to have\n        invented the chariot when Boötes was placed among the stars by his mother.

Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Constellation Waggoner.] Hermippus, who wrote about the stars, says that Ceres [Demeter] lay with Iasion,\n        son of Thuscus. Many agree with Homer that for his he was struck with a thunderbolt. From them, as Petellides,\n        Cretan writer of histories, shows, two sons were born, Philomelus and Plutus, who were never on good terms, for\n        Plutus, who was richer, gave nothing of his wealth to his brother. Philomelus, however, compelled by necessity,\n        bought two oxen with what he had, and became the inventor of the wagon. So, by plowing and cultivating the\n        fields, he supported himself. His mother, admiring his invention, represented him plowing among the stars, and\n        called him Bootes. From him they say Parias was born who called the people Parians and the town Parion from his\n        own name [a town in Mysia on the Hellespont].\"\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 7. 199 (trans.
