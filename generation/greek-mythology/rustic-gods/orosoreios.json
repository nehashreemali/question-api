  "content": "OREIOS (Oreus) was a mountain-god of central Greece--probably Mount Othrys or Oita in Malis or else the Pindus\n        mountain range. He was the father of Oxylos \"Mountain-Forests\" and Hamadryas\n        \"Joined-with-Tree\" who, in turn, were the parents of a bevy of tree-specific Hamadryad Nymphs.\n\nAthenaeus, Deipnosophistae 1. 78b (trans. Gullick) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The Epic poet Pherenikos (Pherenicus), a Herakleto by birth, declares that the fig (Sykon) was named from\n        Syke (Fig-Tree), the daughter of Oxylos (Beech-Tree); for Oxylos, son of Oreios (Mountain), married his sister\n        Hamadryas (With-Oak) and begot among others, Karya (Walnut-Tree), Balanos (Oak-Nut Tree), Kraneia (Cornel-Tree),\n        Morea (Mulberry-Bush), Aigeiros (Poplar-Tree), Ptelea (Elm-Tree), Ampelos (Grape-Vine), and Syke (Fig-Tree); and\n        these are called Nymphai Hamadryades (Hamadryad Nymphs), and from them many trees derive their names.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
