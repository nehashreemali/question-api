  "content": "ZAGREUS, \"the first-born Dionysos,\" was a god of the Orphic Mysteries. He was a son of Zeus and\n        Persephone who had been seduced by the god in the guise of a serpent. Zeus placed Zagreus upon the throne of\n        heaven and armed him with his lightning bolts. The Titanes, incited by the jealous goddess Hera, sneaked into Olympos and offered the boy a collection of toys, tricking\n        him into setting aside the lightning. They then seized and dismembered him with their knives. Zeus recovered\n        Zagreus' heart and made it into a potion for Semele to inbibe who then conceived and gave birth to the second Dionysos as a reincarnation of the first.\n\nThe genitals of Zagreus were later recovered by the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), two\n        demigods of the island of Samothrake. They deposited these in a sacred cave on the isle and instituted the\n        Samothrakian Mysteries in honour of the dead god.\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & PERSEPHONE\n        (Orphic Hymns 29 & 30, Hyginus Fabulae 155, Diodorus Siculus 4.4.1, Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 6.155, Suidas s.v.

For according to them there was born of Zeus and Persephone a Dionysos\n        who is called by some Sabazios (Sabazius) and whose birth and sacrifices and honours are celebrated at night and\n        in secret, because of the disgraceful conduct which is a consequence of the gatherings. They state also that he\n        excelled in sagacity and was the first to attempt the yoking of oxen and by their aid to effect the sowing of\n        the seed, this being the reason why they also represent him as wearing a horn.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 4. 5 : \n        \"He [Dionysos] was also called Dimetor (Of Two Mothers), they relate, because the two Dionysoi were born of\n        one father, but of two mothers.

But Isis [Demeter or Io] tracked down the murder of her husband [or son in the Greek version], and after\n        slaying the Titanes and fashioning the several pieces of his body into the shape of a human figure, she gave\n        them to the priests with orders that they pay Osiris the honours of a god, but since the only member she was\n        unable to recover was the organ of sex she commanded them to pay to it the honours of a god and set it up in\n        their temples in an erect position. Now this is the myth about the birth of Priapos and the honours paid to him,\n        as it is given by the ancient Aigyptians.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 75. 4 : \n        \"This god [Zagreus] was born in Krete (Crete), men say, of Zeus and Persephone, and Orpheus has handed down\n        the tradition in the initiatory rites that he was torn in pieces by the Titanes (Titans).

He was\n        yet a child, and the Kouretes (Curetes) were dancing around him with warlike movement, when the Titanes (Titans)\n        stealthily drew near. First they beguiled him with childish toys, and then,--these very Titanes--tore him to\n        pieces, though he was but an infant. Orpheus of Thrake (Thrace), the poet of the Initiation, speaks of\n        the ‘top, wheel and jointed dolls, with beauteous fruit of gold from the clear-voiced\n        Hesperides.’\n        And it is worth while to quote the worthless symbols of this rite of yours in order to excite condemnation : the\n        knuckle-bone, the ball, the spinning-top, apples, wheel, mirror, fleece! Now Athena made off with the heart of\n        Dionysos, and received the name Pallas from its palpitating (pallein).\n        But the Titanes, they who tore him to pieces, placed a cauldron upon a tripod, and casting the limbs of Dionysos\n        into it first boiled them down; then, piercing them with spits, they ‘held them over Hephaistos [i.e\n        fire].’\n        Later on Zeus appeared; perhaps, since he was a god, because he smelt the steam of flesh that was cooking, which\n        your gods admit they ‘receive as their portion.’ He plagues the Titanes with thunder, and entrusts\n        the limbs of Dionysos to his son Apollon for burial. In obedience to Zeus, Apollon carries the mutilated corpse\n        to Parnassos and lays it to rest . . . \n        The women who celebrate the Thesmophoria are careful not to eat any pomegranate seeds which fall to the ground,\n        being of opinion that pomegranates spring from the drops of Dionysos' blood . . .\n        If you would like a vision of the Orgia Korybanton [i.e. the Mysteries of Samothrake] also, this is the\n        story . . . [the two Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)] got possession of the chest in which the virilia of Dionysos [i.e. of\n        Zagreus after his dismemberment] were deposited, and brought it to Tyrrhenia [i.e. the island of Lemnos],\n        traders in glorious wares! There they sojourned, being exiles, and communicated their precious teaching of\n        peity, the virilia and the chest, to Tyrrhenoi for purposes of worship. For this reason, not unnaturally some\n        wish to call Dionysos Attis, because he was mutilated.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 150 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"After Juno [Hera] saw that Epaphus [or Zagreus for both were identified with the Egyptian Osiris], born of\n        a concubine, ruled such a great kingdom, she saw to it that he should be killed while hunting, and encouraged\n        the Titanes (Titans) to drive Jove [Zeus] from the kingdom and restore it to Saturn [Kronos (Cronus)]. When they\n        tried to mount to heaven, Jove with the help of Minerva [Athene], Apollo, and Diana [Artemis], cast them\n        headlong into Tartarus. On Atlas, who had been their leader, he put the vault of the sky; even now he is said to\n        hold up the sky on his shoulders.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 155 :\n        \"Sons of Jove [Zeus].

Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"He [Kadmos (Cadmus) the future king of Thebes,] showed forth the Euian secrets of Osiridos (Osiris) the\n        wanderer, the Aigyptian (Egyptian) Dionysos [i.e. Zagreus]. He learned the nightly celebration of their mystic\n        art, and declaimed the magic hymn in the wild secret language, intoning a shrill alleluia. While a boy in the\n        temple full of stone images, he had come to know the inscriptions carved by artists deep into the wall.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 5. 562 ff : \n        \"Semele was kept for a more brilliant union, for already Zeus ruling on high intended to make a new\n        Dionysos grow up, a bullshaped copy of the older Dionysos; since he thought with regret of the illfated Zagreus.\n        This was a son born to Zeus in dragonbed by Persephoneia (Persephone), the consort of the blackrobed king of the\n        underworld [Haides]; when Zeus put on a deceiving shape of many coils, as a gentle drakon twining around her in\n        lovely curves, and ravished the maidenhood of unwedded Persephoneia; though she was hidden when all that dwelt\n        in Olympos were bewitched by this one girl, rivals in love for the marriageable maid, and offered their dowers\n        for an unsmirched bridal.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 6. 155 ff : \n        \"[Demeter hid her daughter Persephone away in a cave in Sicily to avoid the many suitors :] Ah, maiden\n        Persephoneia! You could not find how to escape your mating! No, a Drakon (Dragon-Serpent) was your mate, when\n        Zeus changed his face and came, rolling in many a loving coil through the dark to the corner of the maiden's\n        chamber, and shaking his hairy chaps he lulled to sleep as he crept the eyes of those creatures of his own shape\n        who guarded the door. He licked the girl's form gently with wooing lips. By this marriage with the heavenly\n        Drakon, the womb of Persephone swelled with living fruit, and she bore Zagreus the horned baby, who by himself\n        climbed upon the heavenly throne of Zeus and brandished lightning in his little hand, and newly born, lifted and\n        carried thunderbolts in his tender fingers [i.e. Zeus marked him as his heir].\n        But he did not hold the throne of Zeus for long. By the fierce resentment of implacable Hera, the Titanes\n        (Titans) cunningly smeared their round faces with disguising chalk, and while he contemplated his changeling\n        countenance reflected in a mirror they destroyed him with an infernal knife. There where his limbs had been cut\n        piecemeal by the Titan steel, the end of his life was the beginning of a new life as Dionysos. He appeared in\n        another shape, and changed into many forms : now young like crafty Kronides (Cronides) [Zeus] shaking the\n        aegis-cape, now as ancient Kronos (Cronus) heavy-kneed, pouring rain. Sometimes he was a curiously formed baby,\n        sometimes like a mad youth with the flower of the first down marking his rounded chin with black. Again, a mimic\n        lion he uttered a horrible roar in furious rage from a wild snarling throat, as he lifted a neck shadowed by a\n        thick mane, marking his body on both sides with the self-striking whip of a tail which flickered about over his\n        hairy back. Next, he left the shape of a lion's looks and let out a ringing neigh, now like an unbroken horse\n        that lifts his neck on high to shake out the imperious tooth of the bit, and rubbing, whitened his cheek with\n        hoary foam. Sometimes he poured out a whistling hiss from his mouth, a curling horned serpent covered with\n        scales, darting out his tongue from his gaping throat, and leaping upon the grim head of some Titan encircled\n        his neck in snaky spiral coils. Then he left the shape of the restless crawler and became a tiger with gay\n        stripes on his body; or again like a bull emitting a counterfeit roar from his mouth he butted the Titanes with\n        sharp horn. So he fought for his life, until Hera with jealous throat bellowed harshly through the air--that\n        heavy-resentful step-mother! And the gates of Olympos rattled in echo to her jealous throat from high heaven.\n        Then the bold bull collapsed: the murderers each eager for his turn with the knife chopt piecemeal the\n        bull-shaped Dionysos [Zagreus].\n        After the first Dionysos had been slaughtered, Father Zeus learnt the trick of the mirror with its reflected\n        image. He attacked the mother [Gaia the Earth] of the Titanes with avenging brand, and shut up the murderers of\n        horned Dionysos within the gate of Tartaros [after a long war]: the trees blazed, the hair of suffering Gaia\n        (Earth) was scorched with heat. He kindled the East: the dawnlands of Baktria (Bactria) blazed under blazing\n        bolts, the Assyrian waves est afirethe neighbouring Kaspion (Caspian) Sea and the Indian mountains, the Red Sea\n        rolled billows of flame and warmed Arabian Nereus. The opposite West also fiery Zeus blasted with the\n        thunderbolt in love for his child; and under the foot of Zephyros (the West Wind) the western brine half-burn\n        spat out a shining stream; the Northern ridges--even the surface of the frozen Northern Sea bubbled and burned:\n        under the clime of snowy Aigokeros (Aegocerus) the Southern corner boiled with hotter sparks.\n        Now Okeanos (Oceanus) poured rivers of tears from his watery eyes, a libation of suppliant prayer. Then Zeus\n        clamed his wrath at the sight of the scorched earth; he pitied her, and wished to wash with water the ashes of\n        ruin and the fiery wounds of the land.\n        Then Rainy Zeus covered the whole sky with clouds and flooded all the earth [i.e. in the Great Deluge].\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 10. 290 ff : \n        \"[Dionysos] cried out to Kronides (Cronides) [Zeus] his father : ‘. . . When I was a little one,\n        Rheia who is still my nurse told me that you gave lightning to Zagreus, the first Dionysos, before he could\n        speak plain--gave him your fiery lance and rattling thunder and showers of rain out of the sky, and he was\n        another Rainy Zeus while yet a babbling baby.’\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 24. 43 ff : \n        \"[The Indian river Hydaspes cries out for mercy after being set ablaze by Dionysos :] ‘The stream you\n        have crossed is no stranger to your name for I have washed another Dionysos in my bath, with the same name as\n        the younger Bromios, when Kronion (Cronion) [Zeus] entrusted Zagreus to the care of my nursing Nymphai (Nymphs);\n        why, you have the whole shape of Zagreus. Grant this favour then, although so long after, to him from whom you\n        are sprung; for you came from the heart of that first born Dionysos, so celebrated [i.e. Zeus swallowed Zagreus'\n        heart before having intercourse with Semele].’\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 31. 28 ff : \n        \"[Hera asks Persephone to send an Erinys to drive Dionysos mad :] Away she went to the gloomy all-welcoming\n        court of Haides; there she found Persephone, and told her a crafty tale : ‘Most happy I call you, that you\n        dwell so far from the gods! You have not seen Semele at home in Olympos. I fear I may yet see Dionysos, one born\n        of a mortal womb, master of the lightning after Zagreus [Persephone's son], or lifting the thunderbolt in\n        earth-born hands . . .

Heaven is reserved for Apollon, Hermes lives in\n        heaven--and you have this abode full of gloom! What good was it that he put on the deceiving shape of a serpent,\n        and ravished the girdle of your inviolate maidenhood, if after bed he was to destroy your babe?

But Mnaseas of Patrai says that Sabazios is the son of\n        Dionysos.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
