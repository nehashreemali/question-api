  "content": "SEMELE THYONE was the mother of Dionysos and the goddess of the Bacchic frenzy which seized female devotees of\n        the god during the Orgies.\n\nThyone's mortal name was Semele. She was a Theban princess loved by the god Zeus. When his wife Hera learned of their affair, she tricked the girl into having Zeus swear an\n        oath to appear before her in his full glory. Bound by his pledge the god did so and Semele was consumed by the\n        fire of his lightning-bolts. Zeus recovered their son Dionysos from her womb and upon reaching adulthood he\n        fetched her from the underworld to join the gods on Olympos.\n\nKADMOS & HARMONIA (Hesiod Theogony 940,\n          Pindar Dithyrambs, Pindar Pythian 3, Apollodorus 3.25, Pausanias 9.5.2, Diodorus Siculus 4.2.1, Hyginus\n          Fabulae 179, Nonnus Dionysiaca, et al)\n\nDIONYSOS (by Zeus) (Hesiod Theogony 940, Homeric Hymns 1 & 7 & 26, Pindar Pythian 3, Bacchylides Frag\n          19, Apollodorus 3.26, Pausanias 3.24.4, Diodorus Siculus 4.2.1, Hyginus Fabulae 179, Nonnus Dionysiaca, et\n          al)\n\nTHYO′NE (Thuônê), the name of Semele, under which Dionysus fetched her from Hades, and\n        introduced her among the immortals. (Hom. Hymn. v. 21; Apollod. iii. 5. § 3; Cic. de Nat.\n          Deor. iii. 23; Pind. Pyth. iii. 99; Diod. Sic. iv. 25; Apollon. Rhod. i. 636.)\n\nSE′MELE (Semelê), a daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia, at Thebes, and accordingly a sister of Ino,\n        Agave, Autonoë, and Polydorus. She was beloved by Zeus (Hom. Il. xiv. 323, Hymn. in Bacch. 6,\n          57 ; Schol. ad Pind. Ol. ii. 40), and Hera, stimulated by jealousy, appeared to her in the form\n        of her aged nurse Beroë, and induced her to pray Zeus to visit her in the same splendour and majesty with\n        which he appeared to Hera. Zeus, who had promised that he would grant her every request, did as she desired. He\n        appeared to her as the god of thunder, and Semele was consumed by the fire of lightning; but Zeus saved her\n        child Dionysus, with whom she was pregnant (Apollod, iii. 4. § 3; Ov. Met. iii. 260, &c.;\n        Hygin. Fab. 179). Pausanias (ix. 2. § 3) relates that Actaeon was in love with her, and that\n        Artemis caused him to be torn to pieces by his dogs, to prevent his marrying her. The inhabitants of Brasiae, in\n        Laconia, related that Semele, after having given birth to Dionysus, was thrown by her father Cadmus in a boat\n        upon the sea, and that her body was driven to the coast of Brasiae, where it was buried ; whereas Dionysus,\n        whose life was saved, was brought up at Brasiae (Paus. iii. 24. § 3). After her death, the common account\n        continues, she was led by her son out of the lower world, and carried up to Olympus as Thyone (Pind.\n        Ol. ii. 44, Pyth. xi 1; Paus. ii. 31. § 2, 37. § 5; A pollod. iii. 5. § 3). A\n        statue of her and her tomb were shown at Thebes.

So Zeus, unable to refuse her, arrived in her bridal chamber in a chariot with lightning flashes and\n        thunder, and sent a thunderbolt at her. Semele died of fright, and Zeus grabbed from the fire her sixth-month\n        aborted baby, which he sewed into his thigh.

Accordingly, Zeus visited her in a way befitting a\n        god, accompanied by thundering and lightning, revealing himself to her as he embraced her; but Semele, who was\n        pregnant and unable to endure the majesty of the divine presence, brought forth the babe untimely and was\n        herself slain by the fire.

A cloud of fire encompassing Thebes breaks into\n        the dwelling of Kadmos (Cadmus) as Zeus comes wooing Semele; and Semele apparently is destroyed, but Dionysos is\n        born, by Zeus, so I believe, in the presence of the fire. And the form of Semele is dimly seen as she goes to\n        the heavens, where the Mousai (Muses) will hymn her praises : but Dionysos leaps forth as his mother's womb is\n        rent apart and he makes the flame look dim, so brilliantly does he shine like a radiant star.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 155 (trans.

When she was made pregnant by\n        this, Juno [Hera], changing herself to look like Semele's nurse, Beroe, said to her : ‘Daughter, ask Jove\n        [Zeus] to come to you as he comes to Juno, so you may know what pleasure it is to sleep with a god.’ At\n        her suggestion Semele made this request of Jove, and was smitten by a thunderbolt. He took Liber [Dionysos] from\n        her womb, and gave him to Nysus to be cared for. For this reason he is called Dionysus, and also ‘the one\n        with two mothers.’\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 179 :\n        \"Jove [Zeus] desired to lie with Semele, and when Juno [Hera] found out, she changed her form to that of\n        the nurse Beroe, came to Semele, and suggested that she ask Jove to come to her as he came to Juno, ‘that\n        you may know,’ she said, ‘what pleasure it is to lie with a god.’ And so Semele asked Jove\n        [Zeus] to come to her in this way. Her request was granted, and Jove, coming with lightning and thunder, burned\n        Semele to death. From her womb Liber [Dionysos] was born.

Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Now a new offence [to Juno-Hera] followed the last, the grievous news that Semele was pregnant by great\n        Jove [Zeus]. Harsh words rose to her lips, ‘But what have words ever achieved?’ she said. That girl\n        herself must now be dealt with. Her, if I'm well named almighty Juno [Hera], if I'm fit to wield my jeweled\n        scepter, if I'm queen of heaven, Jove's [Zeus'] wife and sister--sister certainly--her I'll destroy. Yet secret\n        stolen love may well be all she wants. My marriage bonds suffer brief harm. No! she's conceived--that crowns it!\n        Her budding womb carries her glaring guilt. She means to be a mother by great Jove [Zeus]--luck hardly ever\n        mine! Such confidence in her good looks! I'll see it let her down. I'm never Saturnus' [Kronos'] child if she's\n        not swallowed in Styx's waves, sunk by her Jove himself!\n        Then rising from her throne she wrapped herself in a bright golden cloud and visited the home of Semele, and\n        kept the cloud till she'd disguised herself as an old woman, with white hair on her forehead, wrinkled skin,\n        bowed back and shaky steps, and speaking too like an old woman. She was Beroe, the Epidaurian nurse of Semele.\n        They talked of many things and then the name of Jove [Zeus] came up. ‘I pray it may be Jove,’ she\n        sighed, ‘All these things frighten me. So often men, claiming to be gods, have gained the beds of simple\n        girls. But even to be Jove is not enough; he ought to prove his love, if he is Jove. In all the power and glory\n        that's his when heavenly Juno [Hera] welcomes him, beg him to don his godhead and take you in the same power and\n        glory in his arms.’\n        So Juno moulded Cadmus' daughter's mind. The girl, unwittingly, asked of Jove a boon unnamed. ‘Choose what\n        you wil,l’ the god replied, ‘There's nothing I'll refuse; and should you doubt, the Power of rushing\n        Styx shall be my witness, the deity whom all gods hold in awe.’\n        She, too successful, happy in her ruin, doomed by her lover's generosity, answered ‘Give me yourself in\n        the same grace as when your Juno [Hera] holds you to her breast in love's embrace.’\n        He would have locked her lips; too late: her words had hastened on their way. He groaned : her wish could never\n        be unwished, his oath never unsworn. In bitterest grief he soared ascending to the ethereal sky, and by his nod\n        called up the trailing clouds and massed a storm, with lightnings in the squalls, and thunder and the bolts that\n        never miss. Even so he tried, as far as he had power, to curb his might, and would not wield the fire with which\n        he's felled the hundred-handed giant [Typhoeus]. That was too fierce. There is another bolt, a lighter one, in\n        which the Cyclops forged a flame less savage and a lesser wrath, called by the gods his second armament. With\n        this in hand he went to Semele in Cadmus' palace. Then her mortal frame could not endure the tumult of the\n        heavens; that gift of love consumed her.\n        From her womb her baby, still not fully formed, was snatched, and sewn (could one believe the tale) inside his\n        father's thigh, and so completed there his mother's time. Ino, his mother's sister, in secret from the cradle\n        nursed the child and brought him up, and then the Nymphae of Nysa were given his charge and kept him hidden away\n        within their caves, and nourished him on milk.\n        Down on earth as destiny ordained these things took place, and Bacchus [Dionysos], baby twice born, was cradled\n        safe and sound.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 940 ff (trans.

No fatherless Hephaistos (Hephaestus)\n        could rival Semele's child, none unbegotten of a father whom Hera brought forth by her own begetting--and now he\n        limps about on an illmatched pair of feeble legs to hide his mother's bungling skill in childbirth!. .\n        .’\n        She spoke exulting even in the sky; but the angry consort [Hera] of Zeus fell heavily in surprise upon the house\n        of Athamas [the foster-father of Dionysos] and scared Ino [his foster-mother] into flight.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 10. 67 ff :\n        \"Kronides (Cronides) [Zeus] pointed her [Ino immortalised in the sea] out to the mother of Lyaios (Lyaeus)\n        [i.e. Semele mother of Dionysos], because she owed it to Bromios that she was a goddess. Semele in her joy\n        addressed her seafaring sister in mockery : ‘Ino, you have the sea, Semele has gained the round heavens!\n        Give me place! I had an immortal husband in Kronides [Zeus] the plower of my field, who brought forth the fruit\n        of my birth instead of me; but you were wedded to a mortal mate Athamas, the murderer of your family. Your son's\n        lot is the sea, but my son will come to the house of Zeus to dwell in the sky. I will not compare heavenly\n        Dionysos with Melikertes down in the water!’\n        That is how Semele the heavenly bride yelled out in mockery of her sister Ino's life who dwelt in the sea.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 25. 115 ff :\n        \"Semele did mount into heaven to touch one table with Zeus and the Blessed, to site beside her son Dionysos\n        of the vine.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 44. 123 ff :\n        \"Already Pheme (Rumous) was flying about the seven-gated city [of Thebes upon the return of Dionysos]\n        proclaiming the rites of Dionysos . . . The chamber of Semele, still breathing sparks of the marriage thunders,\n        was shaded by selfgrowing bunches of green leaves which intoxicated the place with sweet odours.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 45. 31 ff :\n        \"So crying she [Agaue the aunt of Dionysos] flew away, a new skipping Mimallon, practising the Euian leap\n        of the winepress, calling Euoi to Bakkhos (Bacchus) and lauding Thyone--aye, and she called to Semele, wife of\n        Zeus the highest, and loudly sang the brightness of those bridal lightnings.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 47. 665 ff :\n        \"The Moirai's (Fates') threads obey not persuasion . . . Your [Dionysos'] mother [Semele] perished too,\n        while she still carried you in her womb; Semele entered not the gates of Olympos before death, but after she had\n        received her fate.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 44 to Semele (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"To Semele, Fumigation from Storax. Kadmeis (Daughter of Kadmos) Goddess, universal queen, thee, Semele, I\n        call, of beauteous mien; deep-bosomed, lovely flowing locks are thine, mother of Dionysos, joyful and divine,\n        the mighty offspring, whom Zeus' thunder bright forced immature, and frightened into light. Born from the\n        deathless counsels, secret, high, of Kronion (Cronion) Zeus, regent of the sky; whom Persephone permits to view\n        the light, and visit mortals from the realms of night. Constant attending on the sacred rites, and feast\n        triennial [the Orgia], which thy soul delights; when thy son's wondrous birth mankind relate, and secrets pure\n        and holy celebrate. Now I invoke thee, great queen Kadmeis, to bless thy mystics, lenient and serene.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 1 to Dionysus (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th to 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And many will lay up for her [Semele] many offerings in her shrines . . . Dionysos, Insewn, with your\n        mother Semele who men call Thyone.\"\n\nPindar, Pythian Ode 11 str1 - ant1 (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Daughter of Kadmos (Cadmus), Semele from your high place amidst the queens of heaven, and Ino Leukothea\n        (Leucothea), you who dwell by the immortal sea-nymphai (nymphs), Nereus' daughters, come with [Alkmene] the\n        noble mother of Herakles to the shrine of Melia [in Thebes], to the treasure-house of golden tripods, the temple\n        that above all others Apollon held in honour, and he named it the Ismenion, the seat of prophecy that known no\n        lie. Daughters of Harmonia, the god now summons to assemble here that band of heroine women who dwelt within\n        this land, that you may sing in praise of holy Themis and Pytho, and the centre-stone of earth, whose word is\n        justice--here as evening's shadows fall.\"\n\nPindar, Dithyrambs Fragment 75 (trans. Sandys) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"Clearly seen are the bright symbols of sacred rites, whensoever, at the opening of the chamber of the\n        purple-robed Horai (Seasons) [in Thebes], the fragrant spring bringeth the nectar-breathing plants. Then, oh\n        then, are flung on the immortal earth the lovely tresses of violets, and roses are entwined in the hair; then\n        ring the voices of songs to the sound of flutes; then ring the dances in honour of diadem-wreathed Semele.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 19. 3-5 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Amongst the scenes depicted on the altar of Apollon at Amyklai (Amyclae) in Lakedaimonia :] On the altar\n        are wrought in relief . . . Zeus and Hermes are conversing; near stand Dionysos and [the apotheosized] Semele,\n        with [her apotheosized sister] Ino by her side.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: story of Semele from Nonnus' Dionysiaca.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
