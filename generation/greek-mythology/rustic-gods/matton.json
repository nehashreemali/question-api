  "content": "MATTON and KERAON (Ceraon) were Spartan demi-gods of the preparation of meals. Matton was the breadmaker,\n        literally \"kneader of dough\", and Keraon the mixer of wine.\n\nDEIPNEUS was a related Akhaian (Achaean) demi-god of meal-preparation or perhaps more specifically of\n        breadmaking.\n\nAthenaeus, Deipnosophistae 1. 39c - 39d (trans. Gullick) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to\n          C3rd A.D.) :\n        \"Polemos says that in Mounykhia (Munychia) honours are paid to a hero Akratopotes (Drinker of Unmixed\n        Wine), and that among the Spartans statues of heroes named Matton (Kneader) and Keraon (Ceraon, Mixer) have been\n        set up by certain cooks in the public mess. In Akhaia (Achaea), also, Deipneus, who got his name from\n        deipna (Dinners), is held in honour.\"\n\nAelian, Historical Miscellany 14. 7 (trans. Wilson) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to 3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Spartan cooks were expected to know about meat only; anyone with other skills was banished from\n        Sparta.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 274 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Inventors and their Inventions . . . A certain man named Cerasus mixed wine with the river Achelous\n        in Aetolia, and from this ‘to mix’ is called kerasai.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here:  Polemo Historicus 40\n          (Keraon).\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
