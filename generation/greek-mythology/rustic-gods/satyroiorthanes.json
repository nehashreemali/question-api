  "content": "TYKHON (Tychon), KONISALOS (Conisalus) and ORTHANES were three, rustic fertility-spirits\n        (daimones)--phallic deities, similar to satyrs, depicted with erect members.\n\nThey were probably associated with the phallic processions of the god Dionysos or else the phallic statues (hermai) of Hermes. The daimon Phales and Phrygian god\n        Priapos were closely related.\n\nProbably HERMES or DIONYSOS,\n        though nowhere stated\n\nCONISALUS (Konidalos), a daemon, who together with Orthanes and Tychon appeared in the train of Priapus.\n        (Aristoph. Lys. 983; Athen. x. p. 441 Strab. xiii. p. 588; Hesych. s. v.)\n\nTYCHON (Tuchôn). 1. A god of chance or accident. was, according to Strabo (ix. D. 408), worshipped at\n        Athens. (Comp. Anthol. Palat. ix. 334.) 2. An obscene daemon, is mentioned as a companion of Aphrodite\n        and Priapus, and seems to signify \"the producer,\" or \"the fructifier.\" (Etym. Magn. and Hesych. s. v.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nAristophanes, Lysistrata 983 ff (trans.
