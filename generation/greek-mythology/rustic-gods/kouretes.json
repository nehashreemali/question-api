  "content": "THE KOURETES DAKTYLOI (Curetes, Dactyls) were three, five, or nine rustic daimones (spirits) appointed by Rhea\n        to guard the infant god Zeus in a cave on Mount Ida in Krete (Crete). To keep the boy hidden from his\n        cannibalistic father Kronos (Cronus), they drowned out his cries with a\n        frenzied dance of clashing spear and shield. The Kouretes were gods of the wild mountainside, inventors of the\n        rustic arts of metalworking, shepherding, hunting and beekeeping. They were also the first armoured warriors and\n        gods of the orgiastic war-dance performed by the youths of Krete (Crete) and Euboia (Euboea).\n\nThe five Daktyloi (Dactyls) (\"fingers\") were usually regarded as identical to the Kouretes. These\n        also had an equal number of sisters named Hekaterides (Hecaterides), who together appeared to have represented\n        all ten fingers of the human hand--daktyloi being the Greek word for \"fingers\". The male and\n        female Daktyloi were also joined in marriage, perhaps imagined as a harmonious \"finger to finger\"\n        folding of the hands, and from this union were born the rustic Satyroi (Satyrs), Oreiades (Oreads) and tribes of\n        Kouretes (Curetes) (the first Kretan men). These younger Kouretes were hundred in number, they married their\n        sister Meliai (Meliae) (Ash-Tree Nymphs) and from their branches fashioned the first spears.\n\nThe Kouretes were closely identified with, if not the same as, a number of other rustic daimones--namely, the\n        Korybantes Euboioi (Euboean Corybantes), the Korybantes Samothrakioi (Samothracian Corybantes), the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), as well as Hoplodamos and\n        his Gigantes, and the Kourete Anytos (Curete Anytus).\n        One of the Kouretes, Pyrrhikhos (Pyrrhichus), was sometimes identified with\n        Seilenos (Silenus), the elderly satyr companion of Dionysos. Another, Melisseus, appears to be have been connected with Aristaios (Aristaeus), discoverer of honey.\n        The Daktyloi (Dactyls) were occassionally identified with the Telkhines\n        (Telchines) of Rhodes. Nonnus in his Dionysiaca lists two of the Telkhines Damnameneus and Skelmis,\n        which are names applied to Daktyloi by Hesiod.\n\n[1.1] GAIA (Dionysiaca 14.23)\n        [2.1] HEKATEROS (Homerica Fragments, Strabo\n          10.3.7)\n        [2.2] ANKHIALE (Argonautica\n          1.1122)\n        [2.3] HEKATEROS & ANKHIALE ?\n\n[1.1] Blood of OURANOS & GAIA ?

The names used to\n        describe fathers and sons were frequently interchanged, some accounts say the Kourete-Daimones fathered the\n        Daktyl-Men, others that the Daktylos-Daimones fathered the Kourete-Men.\n        However the general understanding was that the Daimones (called Daktyloi and Kouretes), fathered an early race\n        of men (also called Daktyloi and Kouretes). These might have been the Silver Race of Men described by Hesiod.\n\nCURE′TES (Kouretês). Rhea, concealed from Cronos, gave birth to Zeus in a cave of mount Dicte, and\n        whom she entrusted to the Curetes and the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida, the daughters of Melisseus. They fed him\n        with milk of the goat Amaltheia, and the bees of the mountain provided him with honey. (Apollod. i. 1. § 6;\n        Callim. l. c. ; Diod. v. 70; comp. Athen. xi. 70; Ov. Fast. v. 115.)\n\nDA′CTYLI (Daktuloi), the Dactyls of mount Ida in Phrygia, fabulous beings to whom the discovery of iron\n        and the art of working it by means of fire was ascribed. Their name Dactyls, that is, Fingers, is accounted for\n        in various ways; by their number being five or ten, or by the fact of their serving Rhea just as the fingers\n        serve the hand, or by the story of their having lived at the foot (en daktulois) of mount Ida. (Pollux, ii. 4;\n        Strab. x. p. 473; Diod. v. 64.) Most of our authorities describe Phrygia as the original seat of the Dactyls.\n        (Diod. xvii. 7; Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. i. 1126; Strab. l. c.) There they were connected with\n        the worship of Rhea. They are sometimes confounded or identified with the Curetes, Corybantes, Cabeiri, and\n        Telchines; or they are described as the fathers of the Cabeiri and Corybantes. (Strab. x. p. 466; Schol. ad\n          Arat. 33; Serv. ad Virg. Georg. iv. 153.) This confusion with the Cabeiri also accounts for\n        Samothrace being in some accounts described as their residence (Diod. v. 64; comp. Arnob. adv. Gent.\n        iii. 41); and Diodorus states, on the authority of Cretan historians, that the Dactyls had been occupied in\n        incantations and other magic pursuits; that thereby they excited great wonder in Samothrace, and that Orpheus\n        was their disciple in these things. Their connexion or identification with the Curetes even led to their being\n        regarded as the same as the Roman Penates. (Arnob. iii. 40.) According to a tradition in Clemens Alexandrinus\n        (Strom. i. p. 362) the Dactyls did not discover the iron in the Phrygian Ida, but in the island of\n        Cyprus; and others again transfer them to mount Ida in Crete, although the ancient traditions of the latter\n        island scarcely contain any traces of early working in metal there. (Apollon. Rhod. i. 1129; Plin. H.\n          N. vii. 57.) Their number appears to have originally been three: Celmis (the smelter), Damnameneus (the\n        hammer), and Acmon (the anvil). (Schol. ad Apollon. l. c.). To these others were subsequently added,\n        such as Scythes, the Phrygian, who invented the smelting of iron (Clem. Alex. Strom. i. p. 362),\n        Heracles (Strab. l. c.), and Delas. (Euseb. Praep. Evang. x. p. 475.) Apollonius Rhodius\n        mentions the hero Titias and Cyllenus as the principal Dactyls, and a local tradition of Elis mentioned, besides\n        Heracles, Paconius, Epimedes, Jasius, and Idas or Acesidas as Dactyls; but these seem to have been beings\n        altogether different from the Idaean Dactyls, for to judge from their names, they must have been healing\n        divinities. (Paus. v. 7. § 4, 14. § 5, 8. § 1, vi. 21. § 5; Strab. viii. p. 355.) Their\n        number is also stated to have been five, ten (five male and five female ones), fifty-two, or even one hundred.\n        The tradition which assigns to them the Cretan Ida as their habitation, describes them as the earliest\n        inhabitants of Crete, and as having gone thither with Mygdon (or Minos) from Phrygia, and as having discovered\n        the iron in mount Berecynthus. (Diod. v. 64; Cic. de Nat. Deor. iii. 16.) With regard to the real\n        nature of the Dactyls, they seem to be no more than the mythical representatives of the discoverers of iron and\n        of the art of smelting metals with the aid of fire, for the importance of this art is sufficiently great for the\n        ancients to ascribe its invention to supernatural beings. The original notion of the Dactyls was afterwards\n        extended, and they are said to have discovered various other things which are useful or pleasing to man ; thus\n        they are reported to have introduced music from Phrygia into Greece, to have invented rhythm, especially the\n        dactylic rhythm. (Plut. de Mus. 5 ; Diomedes, p. 474, ed. Putsch; Clem. Alex. Strom. i. p.\n        360.) They were in general looked upon as mysterious sorcerers, and are therefore also described as the\n        inventors of the Ephesian incantation formulae; and persons when suddenly frightened used to pronounce the names\n        of the Dactyls as words of magic power. (Plut. de Fac. in Orb. Lun. 30.)\n\nTI′TIAS (Titias), one of the Idaean Dactyls, or according to others, a Mariandynian hero, is called a\n        son of Zeus and Mariandynus. (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. i. 1126.) On his expedition against the Amazons,\n        Heracles assisted the Mariandyni against the Bebryces, and during the struggle, Priolaus, the leader of the\n        Mariandyni, fell. During the funeral games Heracles conquered Titias, who is called the father of Barynus, while\n        others call Priolaus and Mariandynus sons of Titias. (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. ii. 780, ad Aeschyl.\n          Pers. 933 ; Eustath. ad Dionys. Perieg. 987.)\n\nEPIME′DIES (Epimêdês), one of the Curetes. (Paus. v. 7. § 4, 14. § 5).\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nThe Kouretes (Curetes) and Daktyloi (Dactyls) were described as earth-born (gigantes) warriors sprung\n        fully grown from the ground, arrayed in armour and armed with weapons.\n        The name Gigantes was also used to describe a certain tribe of giants which waged war on the gods. Hesiod in his\n        Theogoony may be referring to either in the passage quoted below, though in the structure of his saga,\n        the appearance of the Kouretes here makes more sense.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 176 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Then the son [Kronos (Cronus)] from his ambush stretched forth his left hand and in his right took the\n        great long sickle with jagged teeth, and swiftly lopped off his own father's [Ouranos (Uranus), the Heaven's]\n        members and cast them away to fall behind him. And not vainly did they fall from his hand; for all the bloody\n        drops that gushed forth Gaia (Gaea, the Earth) received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong\n        Erinyes and the great Gigantes (Giants) with gleaming armour [probably the Kouretes (Curetes)] and the Nymphai\n        whom they call Meliai (Meliae) [probably the nymphs who nursed Zeus] all over the boundless earth.\"\n        [N.B. It is quite fitting that the nurses and protectors of the infant Zeus were born from the blood of the\n        castration of Ouranos, for the god was destined to avenge their father by deposing and imprisoning Kronos.]\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 52 (from Tzetzes on Theogony) (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek\n          Lyric IV) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"From the blood that flowed from the genitals [of Ouranos (Uranus) the Sky] three Erinyes (Furies) were\n        born first in the earth, Teisephone (Tisiphone), Megaira (Megaera) and Alekto (Alecto) with them; and along with\n        them the four famous Telkhines (Telchines).\"\n        [N.B. the Telkhines were often identified with the Kouretes (Curetes), protectors of the infant Zeus.]\n\nGreek Lyric V Anonymous, Fragment 985 (from Hippolytus, Refutation of all the\n          Heresies) (Greek lyric B.C.) : \n        \"Ge (Gaea, the Earth), say the Greeks, was the first to produce man, having won that fine privilege,\n        wishing to be mother not of senseless plants nor of unreasoning beasts but of a civilised, god-loving creature.\n        But it is hard to discover, he says, whether Boiotian Alalkomeneus on the shore of the Kephissian (Cephisian)\n        lake was the first of men to appear, or if it was the Kouretes Idaio (Idaean Curetes)i, divine race, or the\n        Phrygian Korybantes (Corybantes) that the sun first saw shooting up tree-like.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 65. 1 (trans.

Some\n        commentaries however believe she is Rhea, who in her labour with Zeus, clutches hold of Gaia the earth and prays\n        for assistance. In sympathy Gaia (Gaea) births a clutch of fully-grown armed warriors, the Kouretes-Daktyloi\n        (Curetes-Dactyls), to protect her and her infant.\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1. 1122 ff (trans.

These, according to one tradition,\n        were one hundred in number, but others say that there were only ten to receive this name, corresponding in\n        number to the fingers (daktyloi) of the hands.\n        But some historians, and Ephoros is one of them, record that the Daktyloi Idaioi were in fact born on the Mt Ide\n        (Ida) which is in Phrygia and passed over to Europe together with Mygdon; and since they were wizards\n        (gonta), they practised charms and initiatory rites and mysteries, and in the course of a sojourn in\n        Samothrake they amazed the natives of that island not a little by their skill in such matters. And it was at\n        this time, we are further told, that Orpheus, who was endowed with an exceptional gift of poesy and song, also\n        became a pupil of theirs, and he was subsequently the first to introduce initiatory rites and Mysteries to the\n        Greeks.\n        However this may be, the Daktyloi Idaioi of Krete, so tradition tells us, discovered both the use of fire and\n        what the metals copper and iron are, as well as the means of working them, this being done in the territory of\n        the city of Aptera at Berekynthos (Berecynthus) [in Eastern Mysia], as it is called; and since they were looked\n        upon as the originators of great blessings for the race of men, they were accorded immortal honours. [cont.]\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 64. 6 :\n        \"And writers tell us that one of them [the Daktyloi (Dactyls)] was named Herakles (Heracles), and excelling\n        as he did in fame, he established the Olympic Games, and that the men of a later period thought, because the\n        name was the same, that it was the son of Alkmene (Alcmena) [i.e. the Herakles of the Twelve Labours] who had\n        founded the institution of the Olympic Games. And evidences of this, they tell us, are found in the fact that\n        many women even to this day take their incantations from this god and make amulets in his name, on the ground\n        that he was a wizard and practised the arts of initiatory rites; but they add that these things were indeed very\n        far removed from the habits of the Herakles who was born of Alkmene. [cont]\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 65. 1 - 66. 1 :\n        \"After the Daktyloi Idaioi (Idaean Dactyls), according to accounts we have, there were nine Kouretes\n        (Curetes). Some writers of myths relate that these gods were born of Gaia (the Earth), but according to others,\n        they were descended from the Daktyloi Idaioi. Their home they made in mountainous places which were thickly\n        wooded and full of ravines, and which, in a word, provided a natural shelter and coverage, since it had not yet\n        been discovered how to build houses. And since these Kouretes excelled in wisdom they discovered many things\n        which are of use to men generally; so, for instance, they were the first to gather sheep into flocks, to\n        domesticate the several other kinds of animals which men fatten, and to discover the making of honey. In the\n        same manner they introduced the art of shooting with the bow and the ways of hunting animals, and they showed\n        mankind how to live and associate together in a common life, and they were the originators of concord and, so to\n        speak, of orderly behaviour. The Kouretes also invented swords and helmets and the war-dance, by means of which\n        they raised a great alarum and deceived Kronos (Cronus). And we are told that, when Rhea, the mother of Zeus,\n        entrusted him to them unbeknown to Kronos his father, they took him under their care and saw to his nurture . .\n        . \n        The myth the Kretans (Cretans) relate runs like this: when the Kouretes were young men, the Titanes (Titans), as\n        they are called, were still living. These Titanes had their dwelling in the land about Knosos (Cnossus).\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 70. 1 : \n        \"When she [Rhea] had given birth to Zeus, concealed him in Ide (Ida), as it is called, and, without the\n        knowledge of Kronos (Cronus), entrusted the rearing of him to the Kouretes (Curetes) of Mount Ide (Ida). The\n        Kouretes bore him off to a certain cave where they gave him over to the Nymphai (Nymphs), with the command that\n        they should minister to his every need And the Nymphai nurtured the child on a mixture of honey and milk and\n        gave him upbringing at the udder of the goat which was named Amaltheia. And many evidences of the birth and\n        upbringing of this god remain to this day on the island. For instance, when he was being carried away, while\n        still an infant, by the Kouretes, they say that the umbilical cord (omphalos) fell from him near the\n        river known as Triton [in Krete (Crete)], and that this spot has been made sacred and has been called Omphalos\n        after that incident, while in like manner the plain about it is known as Omphaleion.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 60. 2 : \n        \"Not long after Kherronessos (Cherronnesus) had ruled [the Chersonnese opposite Rhodes], five Kouretes\n        (Curetes) passed over to it from Krete (Crete), and these were descendants of [or perhaps the same as] those who\n        had received Zeus from his mother Rhea and had nurtured him in the mountains of Ide in Krete, And sailing to the\n        Kherronesos with a notable expedition they expelled the Karians who dwelt there, and settling down in the land\n        divided it into five parts, each of them founding a city which he named after himself . . . \n        Triopas, one of the sons of Helios (the Sun) and Rhodos (Rhode), who was a fugitive because of the murder of his\n        brother Tenages, came to the Kherronesos.

Thereupon Kybele, joining herself to the first Olympos [Mountain\n        in Phrygia], begat Alke (Alce) and called the goddess Kybele after herself; and Korybas gave the name of\n        Korybantes (Corybantes) to all who, in celebrating the rites of his mother, acted like men possessed, and\n        married Thebe, the daughter of Kilix (Cilix). In like manner he also transferred the flute from Samothrake to\n        Phrygia and to Lyrnessos the lyre which Hermes gave and which at a later time Akhilleus (Achilles) took for\n        himself when he sacked that city.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 7 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[7] The accounts [of the Daimones called Kouretes (Curetes)] which are more remotely related, however, to\n        the present subject [the Kouretes tribe of Aitolia (Aetolia)], but are wrongly, on account of the identity of\n        the names, brought into the same connection by the historians--I mean those accounts which, although they are\n        called Curetan History and History of the Curetes, just as if they were the history of those\n        Kouretes [the tribe] who lived in Aitolia and Akarnania (Acarnania), not only are different from that history,\n        but are more like the accounts of the Satyroi (Satyrs), Silenoi (Silens), Bakkhai (Bacchae), and Tityroi\n        (Tityri); for the Kouretes, like these, are called Daimones or ministers of gods by those who have handed down\n        to us the Kretan (Cretan) and the Phrygian traditions, which are interwoven with certain sacred rites, some\n        mystical, the others connected in part with the rearing of the child Zeus in Krete and in part with the Orgia in\n        honor of the Mother of the Gods [Rhea-Kybele (Cybele)] which are celebrated in Phrygia and in the region of the\n        Trojan Ida. But the variation in these accounts is so small that, whereas some represent the Korybantes\n        (Corybantes), the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), the Daktyloi Idaioi (Idaean Dactyls), and the Telkhines (Telchines) as\n        identical with the Kouretes, others represent them as all kinsmen of one another and differentiate only certain\n        small matters in which they differ in respect to one another; but, roughly speaking and in general, they\n        represent them, one and all, as a kind of inspired people and as subject to Bacchic frenzy, and, in the guise of\n        ministers, as inspiring terror at the celebration of the sacred rites by means of war-dances, accompanied by\n        uproar and noise and cymbals and drums and arms, and also by flute and outcry; and consequently these rites are\n        in a way regarded as having a common relationship, I mean these and those of the Samothrakians and those in\n        Lemnos and in several other places, because the divine ministers are called the same. However, every\n        investigation of this kind pertains to theology, and is not foreign to the speculation of the philosopher.\n        [cont.]\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 8 :\n        \"[8] But since also the historians, because of the identity of name of the Kouretes (Curetes), have classed\n        together things that are unlike, neither should I myself shrink from discussing them at greater length, by way\n        of digression, adding such account of their physical habits as is appropriate to history. And yet some\n        historians even wish to assimilate their physical habits with those others, and perhaps there is something\n        plausible in their undertaking. For instance, they say that the Kouretes (Curetes) [tribe] of Aitolia (Aetolia)\n        got this name because, like ‘girls’ (kourai), they wore women's clothes, for, they add,\n        there was a fashion of this kind among the Greeks, and the Ionians were called ‘tunic-trailing,’ and\n        the soldiers of Leonidas were ‘dressing their hair’ when they were to go forth to battle, so that\n        the Persians, it is said, conceived a contempt for them, though in the battle they marvelled at them. Speaking\n        generally, the art of caring for the hair consists both in its nurture and in the way it is cut, and both are\n        given special attention by ‘girls’ and ‘youths’; so that there are several ways in which\n        it is easy to derive an etymology of the word kouretes. It is reasonable to suppose, also, that the\n        war-dance was first introduced by persons who were trained in this particular way in the matter of hair and\n        dress, these being called Kouretes, and that this dance afforded a pretext to those also who were more warlike\n        than the rest and spent their life under arms, so that they too came to be called by the same name,\n        Kouretes--I mean the Kouretes [tribes] in Euboia, Aitolia, and Akarnania. And indeed Homer applied this\n        name to young soldiers . . . \n        So much for the etymology of the word kouretes. The war-dance was a soldiers' dance; and this is\n        plainly indicated both by the ‘Pyrrhic dance,’ and by Pyrrikhos (Pyrrhichus), who is said to be the\n        founder of this kind of training for young men, as also by the treatises on military affairs. [cont.]\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 9 - 10 :\n        \"[9] But I must now investigate how it comes about that so many names have been used of one and the same\n        thing, and the theological element contained in their history. Now this is common both to the Greeks and to the\n        barbarians, to perform their sacred rites in connection with the relaxation of a festival, these rites being\n        performed sometimes with religious frenzy, sometimes without it; sometimes with music, sometimes not; and\n        sometimes in secret, sometimes openly. And it is in accordance with the dictates of nature that this should be\n        so, for, in the first place, the relaxation draws the mind away from human occupations and turns the real mind\n        towards that which is divine; and, secondly, the religious frenzy seems to afford a kind of divine inspiration\n        and to be very like that of the soothsayer; and, thirdly, the secrecy with which the sacred rites are concealed\n        induces reverence for the divine, since it imitates the nature of the divine, which is to avoid being perceived\n        by our human senses; and, fourthly, music, which includes dancing as well as rhythm and melody, at the same\n        time, by the delight it affords and by its artistic beauty, brings us in touch with the divine, and this for the\n        following reason; for although it has been well said that human beings then act most like the gods when they are\n        doing good to others, yet one might better say, when they are happy; and such happiness consists of rejoicing,\n        celebrating festivals, pursuing philosophy, and engaging in music; for, if music is perverted when musicians\n        turn their art to sensual delights at symposiums and in orchestric and scenic performances and the like, we\n        should not lay the blame upon music itself, but should rather examine the nature of our system of education,\n        since this is based on music.\n        [10] And on this account Plato, and even before his time the Pythagoreians, called philosophy music; and they\n        say that the universe is constituted in accordance with harmony, assuming that every form of music is the work\n        of the gods. And in this sense, also, the Mousai (Muses) are goddesses, and Apollon is leader of the Mousai, and\n        poetry as a whole is laudatory of the gods. And by the same course of reasoning they also attribute to music the\n        upbuilding of morals, believing that everything which tends to correct the mind is close to the gods. Now most\n        of the Greeks assigned to Dionysos, Apollon, Hekate (Hecate), the Mousai, and above all to Demeter, everything\n        of an orgiastic or Bacchic or choral nature, as well as the mystic element in initiations; and they give the\n        name ‘Iakkhos’ (Iacchus) not only to Dionysos but also to the leader-in-chief of the mysteries, who\n        is the Daimon of Demeter. And branch-bearing, choral dancing, and initiations are common elements in the worship\n        of these gods. As for the Mousai and Apollon, the Mousai preside over the choruses, whereas Apollon presides\n        both over these and the rites of divination. But all educated men, and especially the musicians, are ministers\n        of the Mousai; and both these and those who have to do with divination are ministers of Apollon; and the\n        initiated and torch-bearers and hierophants, of Demeter; and the Silenoi and Satyroi (Satyrs) and Bakkhai\n        (Bacchae), and also the Lenai (Lenae) and Thyiai (Thyiades) and Mimallones and Naïdes (Naiads) and Nymphai\n        (Nymphs) and the beings called Tityroi, of Dionysos. [cont.]\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 11 :\n        \"[11] In Krete (Crete), not only these rites, but in particular those sacred to Zeus, were performed along\n        with orgiastic worship and with the kind of ministers who were in the service of Dionysos, I mean the Satyroi\n        (Satyrs). These ministers they called Kouretes (Curetes), young men who executed movements in armour,\n        accompanied by dancing, as they set forth the mythical story of the birth of Zeus; in this they introduced\n        Kronos (Cronus) as accustomed to swallow his children immediately after their birth, and Rhea as trying to keep\n        her travail secret and, when the child was born, to get it out of the way and save its life by every means in\n        her power; and to accomplish this it is said that she took as helpers the Kouretes, who, by surrounding the\n        goddess with tambourines and similar noisy instruments and with war-dance and uproar, were supposed to strike\n        terror into Kronos and without his knowledge to steal his child away; and that, according to tradition, Zeus was\n        actually reared by them with the same diligence; consequently the Kouretes, either because, being young, that is\n        ‘youths,’ they performed this service, or because they ‘reared’ Zeus ‘in his\n        youth’ (kouros) (for both explanations are given), were accorded this appellation, as if they\n        were Satyroi, so to speak, in the service of Zeus. Such, then, were the Greeks in the matter of orgiastic\n        worship. [cont.]\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 12 :\n        \"[12] But as for the Berekyntes (Berecynthians), a tribe of Phrygians, and the Phrygians in general, and\n        those of the Trojans who live round Ida, they too hold Rhea in honor and worship her with orgies, calling her\n        Mother of the gods and Agdistis and Phrygia the Great Goddess, and also, from the places where she is\n        worshipped, Idaia and Dindymene and Sipylene and Pessinuntis and Kybele (Cybele) and Kybebe (Cybebe). The Greeks\n        use the same name Kouretes (Curetes) for the ministers of the goddess, not taking the name, however, from the\n        same mythical story, but regarding them as a different set of Kouretes, helpers as it were, analogous to the\n        Satyroi (Satyrs); and the same they also call Korybantes (Corybantes). [cont.]\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 13 :\n        \"[13] The poets bear witness to such views as I have suggested. For instance, when Pindar [Greek C5th\n        B.C.], in the dithyramb which begins with these words, ‘In earlier times there marched the lay of the\n        dithyrambs long drawn out,’ mentions the hymns sung in honor of Dionysos, both the ancient and the later\n        ones, and then, passing on from these, says, ‘To perform the prelude in thy honor, great Mother, the\n        whirling of cymbals is at hand, and among them, also, the clanging of castanets, and the torch that blazeth\n        beneath the tawny pine-trees,’ he bears witness to the common relationship between the rites exhibited in\n        the worship of Dionysos among the Greeks and those in the worship of the Mother of the gods among the Phrygians,\n        for he makes these rites closely akin to one another.\n        And Euripides [Greek C5th B.C.] does likewise, in his Bakkhai (Bacchae), citing the Lydian\n        usages at the same time with those of Phrygia, because of their similarity : ‘But ye who left Mount\n        Tmolos, fortress of Lydia, revel-band of mine, women whom I brought from the land of barbarians as my assistants\n        and travelling companions, uplift the tambourines native to Phrygian cities, inventions of mine and mother\n        Rhea.’\n        And again, ‘happy he who, blest man, initiated in the mystic rites, is pure in his life, . . . who,\n        preserving the righteous orgies of the great mother Kybele (Cybele), and brandishing the thyrsos on high, and\n        wreathed with ivy, doth worship Dionysos. Come, ye Bakkhai (Bacchae), come, ye Bakkhai, bringing down Bromios,\n        god the child of god, out of the Phrygian mountains into the broad highways of Greece.’\n        And again, in the following verses he connects the Kretan usages also with the Phrygian : ‘O thou\n        hiding-bower of the Kouretes (Curetes), and sacred haunts of Krete (Crete) that gave birth to Zeus, where for me\n        the triple-crested Korybantes in their caverns invented this hide-stretched circlet, and blent its Bacchic\n        revelry with the high-pitched, sweet-sounding breath of Phrygian flutes, and in Rhea's hands placed its\n        resounding noise, to accompany the shouts of the Bakkhai (Bacchae), and from Mother Rhea frenzied Satyroi\n        (Satyrs) obtained it and joined it to the choral dances of the Trieterides, in whom Dionysus takes\n        delight.’\n        And in the Palamedes the Chorus says, ‘Thysa, daughter of Dionysos, who on Ida rejoices with his\n        dear mother in the Iacchic revels of tambourines.’ [cont.]\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 14 - 15 :\n        \"[14] And when they bring Seilenos (Silenus) and Marsyas and Olympos (Olympus) into one and the same\n        connection, and make them the historical inventors of flutes, they again, a second time, connect the Dionysiac\n        and the Phrygian rites; and they often in a confused manner drum on Ida and Olympos as the same mountain. Now\n        there are four peaks of Ida called Olympos, near Antandria; and there is also the Mysian Olympos, which indeed\n        borders on Ida, but is not the same. At any rate, Sophokles (Sophocles) [C5th B.C.], in his Polyxena,\n        representing Menelaus as in haste to set sail from Troy, but Agamemnon as wishing to remain behind for a short\n        time for the sake of propitiating Athena, introduces Menelaüs as saying, ‘But do thou, here\n        remaining, somewhere in the Idaean land collect flocks of Olympos and offer them in sacrifice.’\n        [15] They invented names appropriate to the flute, and to the noises made by castanets, cymbals, and drums, and\n        to their acclamations and shouts of ‘eu-ah,’ and stampings of the feet; and they also invented some\n        of the names by which to designate the ministers, choral dancers, and attendants upon the sacred rites, I mean\n        Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) and Korybantes (Corybantes) and Panes and Satyroi (Satyrs) and Tityroi, and they called the\n        god Bakkhos (Bacchus), and Rhea Kybele (Cybele) or Kybebe or Dindymene according to the places where she was\n        worshipped. Sabazios also belongs to the Phrygian group and in a way is the child of the Mother, since he too\n        transmitted the rites of Dionysos. [cont.]\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 16 - 18 :\n        \"[16] Also resembling these rites are the Kotytian (Cottytian) and the Bendideian rites practiced among the\n        Thracians, among whom the Orphic rites had their beginning. Now the Kotys (Cotys) who is worshipped among the\n        Edonians, and also the instruments used in her rites, are mentioned by Aiskhylos (Aeschylus) [tragedian C5th\n        B.C.]; for he says, ‘O adorable Kotys among the Edonians, and ye who hold mountain-ranging\n        instruments;’ and he mentions immediately afterwards the attendants of Dionysos: ‘one, holding in\n        his hands the bombyces, toilsome work of the turner's chisel, fills full the fingered melody, the call that\n        brings on frenzy, while another causes to resound the bronze-bound cotylae’ and again, ‘stringed\n        instruments raise their shrill cry, and frightful mimickers from some place unseen bellow like bulls, and the\n        semblance of drums, as of subterranean thunder, rolls along, a terrifying sound’; for these rites resemble\n        the Phrygian rites, and it is at least not unlikely that, just as the Phrygians themselves were colonists from\n        Thrake (Thrace), so also their sacred rites were borrowed from there. Also when they identify Dionysos and the\n        Edonian Lykourgos (Lycurgus), they hint at the homogeneity of their sacred rites.\n        [17] From its melody and rhythm and instruments, all Thrakian music has been considered to be Asiatic. And this\n        is clear, first, from the places where the Mousai (Muses) have been worshipped, for Pieria and Olympos and\n        Pimpla and Leibethron were in ancient times Thrakian (Thracian) places and mountains, though they are now held\n        by the Makedonians; and again, Helikon (Helicon) was consecrated to the Mousai by the Thrakians who settled in\n        Boiotia, the same who consecrated the cave of the nymphs called Leibethrides. And again, those who devoted their\n        attention to the music of early times are called Thrakians, I mean Orpheus, Musaios (Musaeus), and Thamyris; and\n        Eumolpos (Eumolpus), too, got his name from there. And those writers who have consecrated the whole of Asia, as\n        far as India, to Dionysos, derive the greater part of music from there. And one writer says, ‘striking the\n        Asiatic cithara’; another calls flutes ‘Berekyntian’ and ‘Phrygian’; and some of\n        the instruments have been called by barbarian names, nablas, sambyce, barbitos,\n        magadis, and several others.\n        [18] Just as in all other respects the Athenians continue to be hospitable to things foreign, so also in their\n        worship of the gods; for they welcomed so many of the foreign rites that they were ridiculed therefore by comic\n        writers; and among these were the Thrakian and Phrygian rites. For instance, the Bendideian rites are mentioned\n        by Plato [philosopher C4th B.C.], and the Phrygian by Demosthenes [statesman C4th B.C.], when he casts the\n        reproach upon Aeskhines' (Aeschines') mother and Aeskhines himself that he was with her when she conducted\n        initiations, that he joined her in leading the Dionysiac march, and that many a time he cried out ‘euoe\n        saboe,’ and ‘hyes attes, attes hyes’; for these words are in the ritual of Sabazios and the\n        Mother [Kybele (Cybele)]. [cont.]\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 19 - 22 :\n        \"[19-22] Further, one might also find, in addition to these facts concerning these Daimones and their\n        various names, that they were called, not only ministers of gods, but also gods themselves. For instance, \n        (A)\n        Hesiod [poet C8th to 7th B.C.] says that five daughters were born to Hekateros (Hecaterus) and the daughter of\n        Phoroneus, ‘from whom sprang the mountain-ranging Nymphai, goddesses, and the breed of Satyroi, (Satyrs)\n        creatures worthless and unfit for work, and also the Kouretes (Curetes), sportive gods, dancers.’\n        (B) And the author of Phoronis [Greek epic C7th or C6th B.C.?] speaks of the Kouretes (Curetes) as flute-players\n        and Phrygians; and others as earth-born and wearing brazen shields.\n        (C)\n        Some call the Korybantes (Corybantes), and not the Kouretes, Phrygians, but the Kouretes ‘Kretes’\n        (Cretans), and say that the Kretes were the first people to don brazen armour in Euboia (Euboea), and that on\n        this account they were also called Khalkidians (Chalcidians);\n        (D)\n        Still others say that the Korybantes, who came from Baktriana (Bactriana)--some say from among the Kolkhians\n        (Colchians)--, were given as armed ministers to Rhea by the Titanes (Titans).\n        (E)\n        But in the Kretan (Cretan) accounts the Kouretes (Curetes) are called rearers of Zeus, and protectors of Zeus,\n        having been summoned from Phrygia to Krete (Crete) by Rhea.\n        (F) Some say that, of the nine Telkhines (Telchines) who lived in Rhodes, those who accompanied Rhea to Krete\n        and reared Zeus in his youth (kouros) were named Kouretes; and that Kyrbas (Cyrbas), a comrade of\n        these, who was the founder of Hierapytna [in Krete], afforded a pretext to the Prasians for saying among the\n        Rhodians that the Korybantes were certain Daimones, sons of Athena and Helios (the Sun).\n        (G)\n        Further, some call the Korybantes (Corybantes) sons of Kronos (Cronus), but others say that the Korybantes were\n        sons of Zeus and Kalliope (Calliope) and were identical with the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), and that these went off to\n        Samothrake, which in earlier times was called Melite, and that their rites were mystical.\n        (H)\n        But though the Skepsian [Demetrius of Scepsis C2nd B.C.], who compiled these myths, does not accept the last\n        statement, on the ground that no mystic story of the Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) is told in Samothrake, still he cites\n        also the opinion of Stesimbrotos the Thasian that the sacred rites in Samothrake were performed in honor of the\n        Kabeiroi: and the Skepsian says that they were called Kabeiroi after the mountain Kabeiros (Cabirus) in\n        Berekyntia (Berecyntia).\n        (I)\n        Some, however, believe that the Kouretes (Curetes) were the same as the Korybantes and were ministers of Hekate\n        (Hecate). [See the separate entries Korybantes Samothrakioi and Kabeiroi.]\n        (J)\n        But the Skepsian [C2nd B.C.] again states, in opposition to the words of Euripides, that the rites of Rhea were\n        not sanctioned or in vogue in Krete (Crete), but only in Phrygia and the Troad, and that those who say otherwise\n        are dealing in myths rather than in history, though perhaps the identity of the place-names contributed to their\n        making this mistake. For instance, Ida is not only a Trojan, but also a Kretan, mountain; and Dikte (Dicte) is a\n        place in Skepsia (Scepsia) [in the Troad] and also a mountain in Krete; and Pytna, after which the city\n        Hierapytna [in Krete] was named, is a peak of [Trojan] Ida. And there is a Hippokorona in the territory of\n        Adramyttion [in the Troad] and a Hippokoronion in Krete. And Samonion is the eastern promontory of the island\n        and a plain in the territory of Neandria and in that of the Alexandreians.\n        (K)\n        Akousilaüs (Acusilaus) [C5th B.C.], the Argive, calls Kadmilos (Cadmilus) the son of Kabeiro (Cabeiro) and\n        Hephaistos (Hephaestus), and Kadmilos the father of three Kabeiroi (Cabeiri), and these the fathers of the\n        Nymphai (Nymphs) called Kabeirides (Cabeirides) [see entry on the Kabeiroi].\n        (L)\n        Pherekydes (Pherecydes) [mythographer C5th B.C.] says that nine Kyrbantes (Corybantes) were sprung from Apollon\n        and Rhetia, and that they took up their abode in Samothrake [see the entry on the Korybantes Samothrakioi]; and that three Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) and three\n        Nymphai (Nymphs) called Kabeirides (Cabeirides) were the children of Kabeiro, the daughter of Proteus, and\n        Hephaistos, and that sacred rites were instituted in honor of each triad. Now it has so happened that the\n        Kabeiroi are most honored in Imbros and Lemnos, but they are also honored in separate cities of the Troad; their\n        names, however, are kept secret.\n        (M)\n        Herodotos (Herodotus) [historian C5th B.C.] says that there were temples of the Kabeiroi in Memphis, as also of\n        Hephaistos, but that Kambyses (Cambyses) [historical figure] destroyed them [actually of Egyptian Ptah and his\n        sons].\n        (O)\n        The places where these deities were worshipped are uninhabited, both the Korybanteion (Corybanteum) in Hamaxitia\n        [in the Troad] in the territory now belonging to the Alexandreians near Sminthion, and Korybissa (Corybissa) in\n        Skepsia in the neighborhood of the river Eurëeis [in the Troad] and of the village which bears the same\n        name and also of the winter torrent Aithalöeis.\n        (P)\n        The Skepsian [C2nd B.C.] says that it is probable that the Kouretes (Curetes) and the Korybantes were the same,\n        being those who had been accepted as young men, or youths, for the war-dance in connection with the holy rites\n        of the Mother of the gods, and also as korybantes from the fact that they ‘walked with a butting\n        of their heads’ in a dancing way. These are called by the poet betarmones: ‘’Come\n        now, all ye that are the best betarmones of the Phaiakes (Phaeacians).’\n        And because the Korybantes are inclined to dancing and to religious frenzy, we say of those who are stirred with\n        frenzy that they are ‘korybantising.’\n        (Q)\n        Some writers say that the name Daktyloi Idaioi (Idaean Dactyls) was given to the first settlers of the lower\n        slopes of Mt. Ida, for the lower slopes of mountains are called ‘feet,’ and the summits\n        ‘heads’; accordingly, the several extremities of Ida (all of which are sacred to the Mother of the\n        gods) were called Daktyloi [meaning ‘fingers’].\n        (R)\n        Sophokles (Sophocles) [tragedian C5th B.C.] thinks that the first male Daktyloi (Dactyls) were five in number,\n        who were the first to discover and to work iron, as well as many other things which are useful for the purposes\n        of life, and that their sisters were five in number, and that they were called Daktyloi from their number.\n        (S)\n        But different writers tell the myth in different ways, joining difficulty to difficulty; and both the names and\n        numbers they use are different; and they name one of them Kelmis (Celmis) and others Damnameneus and Herakles\n        (Heracles) and Akmon (Acmon).\n        (T)\n        Some call them natives of Ida, others settlers; but all agree that iron was first worked by these on Ida; and\n        all have assumed that they were wizards and attendants of the Mother of the gods, and that they lived in Phrygia\n        about Ida; and they use the term Phrygia for the Troad because, after Troy was sacked, the Phrygians, whose\n        territory bordered on the Troad, got the mastery over it. And they suspect that both the Kouretes and the\n        Korybantes were offspring of the Daktyloi Idaioi; at any rate, the first hundred men born in Krete were called\n        Idaean Daktyloi, they say, and as offspring of these were born nine Kouretes, and each of these begot ten\n        children who were called Daktyloi Idaioi. [cont]\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 23 :\n        [23] I have been led on to discuss these people rather at length, although I am not in the least fond of myths,\n        because the facts in their case border on the province of theology. And theology as a whole must examine early\n        opinions and myths, since the ancients expressed enigmatically the physical notions which they entertained\n        concerning the facts and always added the mythical element to their accounts. Now it is not easy to solve with\n        accuracy all the enigmas, but if the multitude of myths be set before us, some agreeing and others contradicting\n        one another, one might be able more readily to conjecture out of them what the truth is. For instance, men\n        probably speak in their myths about the mountain-roaming of religious zealots and of gods themselves, and about\n        their religious frenzies, for the same reason that they are prompted to believe that the gods dwell in the skies\n        and show forethought, among their other interests, for prognostication by signs. Now seeking for metals, and\n        hunting, and searching for the things that are useful for the purposes of life, are manifestly closely related\n        to mountain-roaming, whereas juggling and magic are closely related to religious frenzies, worship, and\n        divination. And such also is devotion to the arts, in particular to the Dionysiac and Orphic arts. But enough on\n        this subject.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 14. 1. 20 : \n        \"On the same coast [of Ephesos (Ephesus), Asia Minor], . . . is also Ortygia . . . here is the mythical\n        scene of the birth [i.e. Leto gave birth to Apollon and Artemis here] . . . Above the grove lies Mount\n        Solmissos, where, it is said, the Kouretes (Curetes) stationed themselves, and with the din of their arms\n        frightened Hera out of her wits when she was jealously spying on Leto, and when they helped Leto to conceal from\n        Hera the birth of her children [Apollon and Leto] . . . A general festival is held there annually; and by a\n        certain custom the youths vie for honor, particularly in the splendor of their banquets there. At that time,\n        also, a special college of the Kouretes holds symposiums and performs certain mystic sacrifices.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 7 Fragment 50 : \n        \"The Kabeiroi (Cabeiri) [of Samothrake] . . . the Kyrbantes (Corybantes) and Korybantes, and likewise the\n        Kouretes (Curetes) and the Daktyloi Idaioi (Idaean Dactyls), are identified with them.\"\n\nThe Korybantes (Corybantes) as protectors of the infant Dionysos appears to be a myth of late antiquity. It may\n        derive from the Euboian tradition where Aristaios (Aristaeus) and his brothers took care the young god. These\n        Daimones were later identified with the Kouretes (Curetes).\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 9. 160 ff (trans.

They found him once, a horned baby, covered with a cloak the colour of purple wine, lying\n        among the rocks where Ino had left him in charge of Mystis the mother Korymbos (Corymbus). All these came then\n        from the famous island: Prymneus, and Mimas Waddlefoot, and Akmon (Acmon) the forester, Damneus and Okythoos\n        (Ocythous) the shielfman; and with them came flash-helm Melisseus as comrade to Idaios (Idaeus), whom ther\n        father Sokos (Socus) under the insane goad of impiety had once cast out of the brinegirt country along with\n        Kombe (Combe) the mother of seven [Korybantes (Corybantes)]. They escaped and passed to Knossian soil, and again\n        went on their travels from Krete (Crete) to Phrygia, and from Phrygia to Athens; where they remained as foreign\n        settlers and hearthguests until Kekrops (Cecrops) destroyed Sokos with avenging blade of justice; then leaving\n        the land of brineflooded Marathon turned their steps homewards to the sacred soil of the Abantes, the earthborn\n        stock of the ancient Kouretes (Curetes), whose life is the tune of pipes, whose life is goodly noise of beaten\n        swords, whose heart is set upon rhythmic circling of the feet and the shield-wise dancing.

The story of Sokos (Socus) appears to be a distinctly Euboian tale.

So mailclad Mimas\n        brandished his spear in air in mimicry of the dance-at-arms, as he cut down the heads of his foes, an iron\n        harvest of battle; so he offered the firstfruits of the enemy to witnessing Bakkhos (Bacchus) with Indianslaying\n        axe and doublebiting sword; so he poured his libation of blood and gore to Dionysos, instead of the sacrifice of\n        cattle and the wonted drinkoffering of wine.\n        Beside Okythoos, [the Kourete] Akmon (Acmon) with brilliant helmet moved his restless circling feet in knowing\n        leaps. He fought unshakeable like the hammer-beaten anvil of his name, holding Korybantic shield, which had\n        often held in its hollow baby Zeus asleep among the mountains: yes, a little cave once was the home of Zeus,\n        where the sacred goat [Amaltheia] played the nurse to him with her milky udder for a makeshift, and cleverly let\n        him suck the strange milk, when the noise of shaken shields resounded beaten on the back with tumbling steel to\n        hide the little child with their clanging. Their help allowed Rheia to wrap up that stone of deceit, and gave it\n        to Kronos (Cronus) for a meal in place of Kronides (Cronides) [Zeus].\n        Sharpsighted [Kourete] Idaios (Idaeus) entered the revels of war, that dance of battle turning his intricate\n        steps, incessantly shaken with the mad passion for Indian carnage.\n        [The Kourete] Melisseus also scared all the dusky host with boldness unshaken.

The dance of the Kouretes was probably in a similar\n        manner to that of Krete.\n\nThe war-dance of the Kouretes (Curetes) was performed by Kretan (Cretan) youths re-enacting the story of the\n        infancy of Zeus. It was an orgiastic rite, similar to the Korybantic dances of Kybele (Cybele) in Phrygia.\n\nPlato, Laws 796b (trans. Lamb) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"Nor should we omit such mimic dances as are fitting for use by our choirs,--for instance, the sword-dance\n        of the Kouretes (Curetes) here in Krete (Crete), and that of the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri) in Lakedaimon\n        (Lacedaemon); and at Athens, too, our Virgin-Lady [Athena] gladdened by the pastime of the dance deemed it not\n        seemly to sport with empty hands, but rather to tread the measure vested in full panoply. These examples it\n        would well become the boys and girls to copy . . . alike for service in war and for use at festivals.\"\n        [I.e.

The Mystery religions gave these more distinct identity and their\n        own genealogies.
