  "content": "ARIADNE was the immortal wife of the wine-god Dionysos.\n\nThere were several versions of her story.\n        In one, Ariadne, a daughter of King Minos of Krete (Crete), assisted Theseus in his quest to slay the Minotauros (Minotaur) and then fled with the hero aboard his ship. When\n        they landed on the island of Naxos Theseus abandoned her as she slept. It was then that Dionysos discovered her\n        and made her his wife. Some say she was later slain by the goddess Artemis or else ascended to Olympos with her husband as an immortal.\n\nAccording to others Ariadne's bridal with Dionysos occurred several generations before this when the god was\n        still travelling the earth spreading his cult. During his war against Argives with a band of sea-women, Ariadne\n        was slain or turned to stone by King Perseus. The god descended into the underworld to recover her and brought\n        her back with him to Olympos.\n\nIn Greek vase painting Ariadne is often depicted alongside Dionysos--either feasting with the gods of Olympos\n        or in Bacchic scenes surrounded by dancing Satyroi (Satyrs) and Mainades. Dionysos'\n        discovery of the sleeping Ariadne on Naxos was also a popular scene in classical art.\n\n[1.1] MINOS (Homer Odysseu 11.320, Hesiod Theogony 947, Plutarch Theseus 20.1,\n          Diodorus Siculus 4.61.5, Ovid Metamorphoses 8.175, and others)\n        [1.2] MINOS & PASIPHAE (Apollonius Rhodius\n          3.997, Hyginus Fabulae 224. Ovid Heroides 4.59)\n\n[1.1] THOAS (by Dionysos) (Quintus Smyrnaeus\n          4.385, Apollonius Rhodius 4.425, Ovid Heroides 6.114)\n        [1.2] THOAS, STAPHYLOS, OINOPION, PEPARETHOS\n        (by Dionysos) (Apollodorus E1.9)\n        [1.3] OINOPION (by Dionysos) (Anacreon Frag\n          505e, Diodorus Siculus 5.79.1)\n        [1.4] OINOPION, STAPHYLOS (by Dionysos or Theseus) (Plutarch Theseus 20.1)\n        [2.1] PHLIASOS, EURYMEDON (by Dionysos) (Hyginus Fabulae 14)\n\nARIADNE (Ariadnê), a daughter of Minos and Pasiphaë or Creta. (Apollod. iii. 1. § 2.) When\n        Theseus was sent by his father to convey the tribute of the Athenians to Minotaurus, Ariadne fell in love with\n        him, and gave him the string by means of which he found his way out of the Labyrinth, and which she herself had\n        received from Hephaestus. Theseus in return promised to marry her (Plut. Thes. 19; Hygin. Fab.\n        42 ; Didym. ad Odyss. xi. 320), and she accordingly left Crete with him; but when they arrived in the\n        island of Dia (Naxos), she was killed there by Artemis. (Hom. Od. xi. 324.) The words added in the\n        Odyssey, Dionusou marturiêisin, are difficult to understand, unless we interpret them with\n        Pherecydes by \"on the denunciation of Dionysus,\" because he was indignant at the profanation of his grotto by\n        the love of Theseus and Ariadne. In this case Ariadne was probably killed by Artemis at the moment she gave\n        birth to her twin children, for she is said to have had two sons by Theseus, Oenopion and Staphylus. The more\n        common tradition, however, was, that Theseus left Ariadne in Naxos alive; but here the statements again differ,\n        for some relate that he was forced by Dionysus to leave her (Diod. iv. 61, v. 51; Paus. i. 20. § 2, ix. 40.\n        § 2, x. 29. § 2), and that in his grief he forgot to take down the black sail, which occasioned the\n        death of his father. According to others, Theseus faithlessly forsook her in the island, and different motives\n        are given for this act of faithlessness. (Plut. Thes. 20; Ov. Met. viii. 175, Heroid.\n        10 ; Hygin. Fab. 43.) According to this tradition, Ariadne put an end to her own life in despair, or\n        was saved by Dionysus, who in amazement at her beauty made her his wife, raised her among the immortals, and\n        placed the crown which he gave her at his marriage with her, among the stars. (Hesiod. Theog. 949; Ov.\n        Met. l. c. ; Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 5.) The Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius (iii. 996) makes\n        Ariadne become by Dionysus the mother of Oenopion, Thoas, Staphylus, Latromis, Euanthes, and Tauropolis. There\n        are several circumstances in the story of Ariadne which offered the happiest subjects for works of art, and some\n        of the finest ancient works, on gems as well as paintings, are still extant, of which Ariadne is the subject.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nFor the story of Theseus, Ariadne and the Minotaur see MINOTAUROS\n\nPhilostratus the Younger, Imagines 10 (trans.

Later, Dionysos gave it to his son Thoas, Thoas left it to Hypsipyle, and she, with many\n        another piece of finery, gave it to Iason (Jason) as a parting gift.\n        It was a work of art, a joy for ever, as pleasing to the eyes as to the sense of touch. And it still gave out\n        the ambrosial perfume it received when the Lord Dionysos lay on it, tipsy with wine and nectar, embracing Minos'\n        daughter, the fair young Ariadne, whom Theseus carried off from Knossos (Cnossus) and abandoned on the Isle of\n        Dia [Naxos].\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 61. 5 (trans.

At this same time, the\n        myths relate, Dionysos showed himself on the island, and because of the beauty of Ariadne he took the maiden\n        away from Theseus and kept her as his lawful wife, loving her exceedingly. Indeed, after her death he considered\n        her worthy of immortal honours because of the affection he had for her, and placed among the stars of heaven the\n        Crown of Ariadne [the constellation Corona].\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 51. 4 : \n        \"Theseus, on his voyage back from Krete together with Ariadne, was entertained as a guest by the\n        inhabitants of the island [of Naxos]; and Theseus, seeing in a dream Dionysos threatening him if he would not\n        forsake Ariadne in favour of the god, left her behind him there in his fear and sailed away. And Dionysos led\n        Ariadne away by night to the mountain which is know as Drios; and first of all the god disappeared, and later\n        Ariadne also was never seen again.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 79. 1 : \n        \"To Oinopion (Oenopion), the son of Minos's daughter Ariadne, he [Rhadamanthys] gave [the island of] Khios\n        (Chios).\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 20. 3 (trans.

Perrin) (Greek historian C1st to C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"There are many other stories about . . . Ariadne, but they do not agree at all. Some say that she hung\n        herself because she was abandoned by Theseus; others that she was conveyed to Naxos by sailors and there lived\n        with Oinaros (Oenarus) (Of the Wine) the priest of Dionysos, and that she was abandoned by Theseus because he\n        loved another woman . . .\n        Moreover, some say that Ariadne actually had sons by Theseus, Oinopion (Oenopion) and Staphylos (Staphylus), and\n        among these is Ion of Khios (Chios), who says of his own native city :--‘This, once, Theseus's son\n        founded, Oinopion.’\n        Now the most auspicious of these legendary tales are in the mouths of all men, as I may say; but a very peculiar\n        account of these matters is published by Paion (Paeon) the Amathusian. He says that Theseus, driven out of his\n        course by a storm to Kypros (Cyprus), and having with him Ariadne, who was big with child and in sore sickness\n        and distress from the tossing of the sea, set her on shore alone, but that he himself, while trying to succour\n        the ship, was borne out to sea again. The women of the island, accordingly, took Ariadne into their care, and\n        tried to comfort her in the discouragement caused by her loneliness, brought her forged letters purporting to\n        have been written to her by Theseus, ministered to her aid during the pangs of travail, and gave her burial when\n        she died before her child was born. Paion says further that Theseus came back, and was greatly afflicted, and\n        left a sum of money with the people of the island, enjoining them to sacrifice to Ariadne . . . [For the rest of\n        this passage see Cult of Ariadne below.]\n        Some of the Naxians also have a story of their own, that there were two Minoses and two Ariadnes, one of whom,\n        they say, was married to Dionysos in Naxos and bore him Staphylos and his brother, and the other, of a later\n        time, having been carried off by Theseus and then abandoned by him, came to Naxos, accompanied by a nurse named\n        Korkyne (Corcyne), whose tomb they show; and that this Ariadne also died there. . . .[For the rest of this\n        passage see Cult of Ariadne below.]\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 4. 430 ff (trans. Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Two great silver bowls those which Euneus [a great-grandson of Dionysos and Ariadne], Iason's (Jason's)\n        warrior son in sea-washed Lemnos to Akhilleus (Achilles) gave to ransom strong Lykaon (Lycaon) from his hands.\n        These had Hephaistos (Hephaestus) fashioned for his gift to glorious Dionysos, when he brought his bride divine\n        [Ariadne] to Olympos, Minos' child far-famous, whom in sea-washed Dia's isle [Naxos] Theseus unwitting left.\n        Dionysos brimmed with nectar these, and gave them to his son; and Thoas at his death to Hypsipyle with great\n        possessions left them. She bequeathed the bowls to her godlike son [Euneus], who gave them up unto Akhilleus\n        (Achilles) for Lykaon's life.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 15 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"That Theseus treated Ariadne unjustly--though some say not with unjust intent, but under the compulsion of\n        Dionysos--when he abandoned her while asleep on the island of Dia [Naxos], you must have heard from your nurse;\n        for those women are skilled in telling such tales and they weep over them whenever they will. I do not need to\n        say that it is Theseus you see there on the ship and Dionysos yonder on the land, nor will I assume you to be\n        ignorant and call your attention to the woman on the rocks, lying there in gentle slumber.\n        Nor yet is it enough to praise the painter for things for which someone else too might be praised; for it is\n        easy for anyone to paint Ariadne as beautiful and Theseus as beautiful; and there are countless characteristics\n        of Dionysos for those who wish to represent him in painting or sculpture . . . but this Dionysos the painter has\n        characterized by love alone. Flowered garments and thyrsoi and fawn-skins have been cast aside as out of place\n        for the moment, and the Bakkhai (Bacchae) are not clashing their cymbals now, nor are the Satyroi (Satyrs)\n        playing the flute, nay, even Pan checks his wild dance that he may not disturb the maiden's sleep. Having\n        arrayed himself in fine purple and wreathed his head with roses, Dionysos comes to the side of Ariadne,\n        ‘drunk with love’ as the Teian poet says of those who are overmastered by love. As for Theseus, he\n        is indeed in love, but with the smoke rising from Athens, and he no longer knows Ariadne, and never knew her,\n        and I am sure that he has even forgotten the labyrinth and could not tell on what possible errand he sailed to\n        Krete (Crete), so singly is his gaze fixed on what lies ahead of his prow. And look at Ariadne, or rather at her\n        sleep; for her bosom is bare to the waist, and her neck is bent back and her delicate throat, and all her right\n        armpit is visible, but the left hand rests on her mantle that a gust of wind may not expose her. How fair a\n        sight, Dionysos, and how sweet her breath!

But the Kydonian (Cydonian)\n        maiden lamented with the kingfishers, and paced the heavy murmuring shore which was all that the Erotes (Loves)\n        had given her. She called on the young man's name, madly she sought his vessel along the seaside, scolded the\n        envious sleep, reproached even more the Paphian's [Aphrodite's] mother, the sea. She prayed to Boreas and\n        adjured the wind, adjured Oreithyia to bring back the boy [Theseus] to the land of Naxos and to let her see that\n        sweet ship again. She besought hardhearted Aiolos (Aeolus) yet more; he heard her prayer and obeyed, sending a\n        contrary wind to blow, but Boreas lovelorn himself cared nothing for the miad stricken with desire--yes, even\n        the Aurai (Breezes) themselves must have had a spite against the maiden when they carried the ship to the\n        Athenian land.\n        Eros (Love) himself admired the maiden, and though he saw Aphrodite lamenting in Naxos where all is joy. She was\n        even more resplendent in her grief, and pain was a grace to the sorrower . . . At last in her tears she found a\n        voice to speak thus : ‘[Ariadne laments her fate] . . .’\n        Bakkhos (Bacchus) [Dionysos] was enraptured to hear this lament. He noticed Kekropia (Cecropia), and knew the\n        name of Theseus and the deceitful voyage from Krete (Crete). Before the girl he appeared in his radiant godhead;\n        Eros moved swiftly about, and with stinging cestus he whipt the maiden into a nobler love, that he might lead\n        Minos' daughter to join willingly with his brother Dionysos. Then Bakkhos comforted Ariadne, lovelorn and\n        lamenting, with these words in his mindcharming voice :\n        ‘Maiden, why do you sorrow for the deceitful man of Athens? Let pass the memory of Theseus; you have\n        Dionysos for your lover, a husband incorruptible for the husband of a day! If you are pleased with the mortal\n        body of a youthful yearsmate, Theseus can never challenge Dionysos in manhood or comeliness. But you will say\n        [he slew the Minotaur] . . . Not for nothing did that fleet [of Theseus] sail from my Naxos, but Pothos (Sexual\n        Longing) preserved you for a nobler bridal. Happy girl, that you leave the poor bed of Theseus to look on the\n        couch of Dionysos the desirable! What could you pray for higher than that? You have both heaven for your home\n        and Kronion (Cronion) [Zeus] for your godfather . . . for you I will make a starry crown [the constellation\n        Corona], that you may be called the shining bedfellow of crownloving Dionysos.’\n        So he comforted her; the girl throbbed with joy, and cast into the sea all her memories of Theseus when she\n        received the promise of wedlock from her heavenly wooer. Then Eros decked out the bridal chamber for Bakkhos,\n        the wedding dance resounded, about the bridal bed all flowers grew; the dancers of Orkhomenos [the Kharites\n        (Graces)] surrounded Naxos with foliage of spring, the Hamadryas (Hamadryad Nymph) sang of the wedding, the\n        Naias Nymphe (Naiad Nymph) by the fountains unveiled unshod praised the union of Ariadne with the vine-god :\n        Ortygia cried aloud in triumph, and chanting a bridal hymn for Lyaios (Lyaeus) [Dionysos] the brother of Phoibos\n        (Phoebus) [Apollon] cityholder she skipt in the dance, that unshakeable rock. Fiery Eros (Love) made a round\n        flowergarland with red roses and plaited a wreath coloured like the stars, as prophet and herald of the heavenly\n        Crown [the constellation Corona]; and round about the Naxian bride danced a swarm of the Erotes (Loves) which\n        attend on marriage.\n        The Golden Father [Dionysos] entering the chamber of wedded love sowed the seed of many children. Then rolling\n        the long circle of hoary time, he remembered Rheia his prolific mother; and leaving faultless Naxos still full\n        of Kharites (Graces) he visited all the town of Hellas.\"\n\nThe accounts of Ariadne's death obviously conflict with the story that Dionysos brought her to Olympos to be\n        his immortal wife.

Perrin) (Greek historian C1st to C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"A very peculiar account of these matters [the story of Ariadne] is published by Paion (Paeon) the\n        Amathusian. He says that Theseus, driven out of his course by a storm to Kypros (Cyprus), and having with\n        him Ariadne, who was big with child and in sore sickness and distress from the tossing of the sea, set her on\n        shore alone, but that he himself, while trying to succour the ship, was borne out to sea again. The women of the\n        island, accordingly, took Ariadne into their care, and tried to comfort her in the discouragement caused by her\n        loneliness, brought her forged letters purporting to have been written to her by Theseus, ministered to her aid\n        during the pangs of travail, and gave her burial when she died before her child was born. Paion says further\n        that Theseus came back, and was greatly afflicted, and left a sum of money with the people of the island,\n        enjoining them to sacrifice to Ariadne, and caused two little statuettes to be set up in her honor, one of\n        silver, and one of bronze. He says also that at the sacrifice in her honor on the second day of the month\n        Gorpiaeus, one of their young men lies down and imitates the cries and gestures of women in travail; and that\n        they call the grove in which they show her tomb, the grove of Ariadne Aphrodite.\n        Some of the Naxians also have a story of their own, that there were two Minoses and two Ariadnes, one of whom,\n        they say, was married to Dionysos in Naxos and bore him Staphylos and his brother, and the other, of a later\n        time, having been carried off by Theseus and then abandoned by him, came to Naxos, accompanied by a nurse named\n        Korkyne (Corcyne), whose tomb they show; and that this Ariadne also died there, and has honors paid her unlike\n        those of the former, for the festival of the first Ariadne is celebrated with mirth and revels, but the\n        sacrifices performed in honor of the second are attended with sorrow and mourning.\"\n\nPlutarch, Theseus 23. 2 : \n        \"It was Theseus who instituted also the Athenian festival of the Oskhophoria (Oschophoria). For it is said\n        that he did not take away with him all the maidens on whom the lot fell at that time, but picked out two young\n        men of his acquaintance who had fresh and girlish faces, but eager and manly spirits, and changed their outward\n        appearance almost entirely by giving them warn baths and keeping them out of the sun, by arranging their hair,\n        and by smoothing their skin and beautifying their complexions with unguents; he also taught them to imitate\n        maidens as closely as possible in their speech, their dress, and their gait, and to leave no difference that\n        could be observed, and then enrolled them among the maidens who were going to Krete, and was undiscovered by\n        any. And when he was come back, he himself and these two young men headed a procession, arrayed as those are now\n        arrayed who carry the vine-branches. They carry these in honor of Dionysos and Ariadne, and because of their\n        part in the story; or rather, because they came back home at the time of the vintage. And the women called\n        Deipnophoroi, or supper-carriers, take part in the procession and share in the sacrifice, in imitation of the\n        mothers of the young men and maidens on whom the lot fell, for these kept coming with bread and meat for their\n        children. And tales are told at this festival, because these mothers, for the sake of comforting and encouraging\n        their children, spun out tales for them. At any rate, these details are to be found in the history of\n        Damon.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: (mostly references to the story of Ariadne, Theseus & the\n          Minotauros): Odyssey 11.322, Apollodorus 1.9.16 & 3.1.2 & E1.8, Diodorus Siculus 4.60.4, Antoninus\n          Liberalis 27, Parthenius 1.3, Pausanias 1.3.1, Statius Thebaid 5.226.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
