  "content": "THE SATYROI (Satyrs) were rustic fertility spirits of the countryside and wilds. They consorted with the Nymphai (Nymphs) and were companions of the gods Dionysos, Hermes, Hephaistos, Pan, Rhea-Kybele and Gaia.\n\nSatyroi were depicted as animalistic men with asinine ears, pug noses, reclining hair-lines, and the tails of\n        horses. As companions of Dionysos they were usually shown drinking, dancing, playing flutes\n        and sporting with the Mainades (Maenads).\n\nSome of the more specific types of Satyroi were the Panes (goat-legged satyrs), Seilenoi (Silens) (elderly satyrs), Satyriskoi (Satyrisci) (child satyrs), and Tityroi (flute-playing satyrs).\n\nActors dressed as Satyroi formed the choruses of the so-called Satyr-plays which were performed at the\n        festivals of the god Dionysos.\n\n[1.1] THE HEKATERIDES (Hesiod\n          Fragments of Unknown Position 6)\n        [1.2] THE DAKTYLOI & THE\n          HEKATERIDES (Strabo 10.3.19)\n        [2.1] Various rustic gods incl HERMES, SEILENOS, PAN & THE\n          OREAIDES (various sources)\n\nAMPELOS (Ampelus) A Satyr boy (satyriskos) loved by the god Dionysos\n        who was gorged to death by a bull and transformed by the god into the first grapevine.\n\nARISTAIOS (Aristaeus) The Satyr-like god of shepherds, hunting, olive-growing and\n        beekeeping.\n\nASTRAIOS (Astraeus) An old Seilen (Silen) demi-god of shepherds.\n\nKERKOPES (Cercopes) A pair of monkey-like bandits, possibly Satyroi (Satyrs), who\n        plagued the land of Lydia which were transformed into monkeys by Zeus.\n\nKOMOS (Comus) A Satyr boy (satyriskos) who was the demi-god of\n        festive banquets and cup-bearer of Dionysos.\n\nKROTOS (Crotus) A Satyr of Mount Helikon in Boiotia (Central Greece) who was\n        rewarded by the Mousai (Muses) for the invention of rhythmic beats to accompany music by being placed amongst\n        the stars as the constellation Saggitarius.\n\nLENAI (Lenae) Wine-making Satyroi in the train of Dionysos. They were probably the same as the Seilenoi\n        (Silens).\n\nLENEUS An old Seilen (Silen) demi-god of wine-making.\n\nMARSYAS A Satyr of Mount Tmolos in Phrygia (Anatolia) who invented the music\n        of the flute and was flayed alive for challenging the god Apollon to a musical contest.\n\nPHERESPONDOS (Pherespondus), LYKOS\n        (Lycus) and PRONOMOS (Pronomus) Three Arkadian Satyroi who were sons of\n        Hermes and heralds of the god Dionysos.\n\nPOIMENIOS (Poemenius), THIASOS (Thiasus), HYPSIKEROS (Hypsicerus), ORESTES, PHLEGRAIOS (Phlegraeus), NAPAIOS\n        (Napaeus), GEMON, LYKON (Lycon), PHEREUS, PETRAIOS (Petraeus), LAMIS, LENOBIOS (Lenobius), SKIRTOS (Scirtus),\n        and OISTROS (Oestrus) Fourteen Satyrs who led the god Dionysos' Satyr troops in his war against the Indians.\n\nSATYROI LIBYES (Libyan Satyrs) Tribes of wild Satyroi believed\n        to inhabit the forests of Mount Atlas in North-West Africa. (N.B. Probably derived from travellers' accounts of\n        African apes.)\n\nSATYROI NESIOI (Island Satyrs) A tribe of wild Satyroi\n        inhabiting the Satyrides Islands (somewhere off the coast of Africa) which, according to a sailor's tale,\n        captured a female passenger when they made landfall.\n\nSATYROS AITHIOPIKOS (Ethiopian Satyr) A violent, phantom\n        Satyr which was pacified with wine by the pagan prophet Apollonius of Tyana to end its depredations on an\n        Ethiopian village.\n\nSATYROS ARGIOS (Argive Satyr) A Satyr of the Lernaean Spring near Argos (in\n        Southern Greece) which assaulted King Danaus' daughter Amymone when she came in search of water.\n\nSATYROS LEMNIOS (Lemnian Satyr) A Satyr of the Aegean island of\n        Lemnos which has a scandalous tryst with a local woman.\n\nSEILENOI (Silens) Three elderly Satyrs named Maron, Leneus and Astraios (Astraeus)\n        who were companions of the god Dionysos and sons of ancient Seilenos.\n\nSEILENOS (Silenus) The ancient Satyr nurse of the god Dionysos and the demi-god of\n        drunken excess.\n\nTITYROI (Tityri) Flute-playing Satyroi in the train of the god Dionysos.\n\nSA′TYRUS (Saturos), the name of a class of beings in Greek mythology, who are inseparably connected with\n        the worship of Dionysus, and represent the luxuriant vital powers of nature. In their appearance they somewhat\n        resembled goats or rams, whence many ancients believed that the word saturos was identical with tituros, a ram.\n        (Schol. ad Theocrit. iii. 2, vii. 72; Aelian, V. H. iii. 40; comp. Eustath. ad Hom.\n        p. 1157; Hesych. s. v.; and Strab. x. p. 466.) Homer does not mention any Satyr, while Hesiod\n        (Fragm. 94, ed. Göttling) speaks of them in the plural and describes them as a race good for\n        nothing and unfit for work, and in a passage quoted by Strabo (x. p. 471) he states that the Satyrs, Nymphs and\n        Curetes were the children of the five daughters of Hecataeus and the daughter of Phoroneus. The more common\n        statement is that the Satyrs were the sons of Hermes and Iphthima (Nonn. Dionys. xiv. 113), or of the\n        Naiads (Xenoph. Sympos. v. 7); Silen also calls them his own sons. (Eurip. Cycl. 13, 82, 269.)\n\nThe appearance of the Satyrs is described by later writers as robust, and rough, though with various\n        modifications, but their general features are as follows: the hair is bristly, the nose round and somewhat\n        turned upwards, the ears pointed at the top like those of animals (whence they are sometimes called\n        thêres, Eurip. Cycl. 624); they generally have little horns, or at least two hornlike\n        protuberances (phêrea), and at or near the end of the back there appears a little tail like that of a\n        horse or a goat. In works of art they were represented at different stages of life; the older ones, commonly\n        called Seilens or Silens (Paus. i. 23. § 6), usually have bald heads and beards, and the younger ones are\n        termed Satyrisci (Saturiskoi, Theocrit. iv. 62, xxvii. 48). All kinds of satyrs belong to the retinue of\n        Dionysus (Apollod. iii. 5. § 1; Strab. x. p. 468; Ov. Fast. iii. 737, Ars Am. i. 542,\n        iii. 157), and are always described as fond of wine, whence they often appear either with a cup or a thyrsus in\n        their hand (Athen. xi. p. 484), and of every kind of sensual pleasure, whence they are teen sleeping, playing\n        musical instruments or engaged in voluptuous dances with nymphs. (Apollod. ii. 1. § 4; Horat.\n        Carm. ii. 19. 3, i. 1. 30; Ov. Met. i. 692, xiv. 637; Philostr. Vit. Apoll. vi. 27 ;\n        Nonn. Dionys. xii. 82.) Like all the gods dwelling in forests and fields, they were greatly dreaded by\n        mortals. (Virg. Eclog. vi. 13; Theocrit. xiii. 44; Ov. Her. iv. 49.)\n\nLater writers, especially the Roman poets, confound the Satyrs with the Pans and the Italian Fauns, and\n        accordingly represent them with larger horns and goats' feet (Horat. Carm. ii. 19. 4; Propert. iii. 15.\n        34; Ov. Met. i. 193, vi. 392, xiv 637), although originally they were quite distinct kinds of beings,\n        and in works of art, too, they are kept quite distinct. Satyrs usually appear with flutes, the thyrsus, syrinx,\n        the shepherd staff, cups or bags filled with wine; they are dressed with the skins of animals, and wear wreaths\n        of vine, ivy or fir. Representations of them are still very numerous, but the most celebrated in antiquity was\n        the Satyr of Praxiteles at Athens (Paus. i. 20. § 1; Plin. H. N. xxxiv. 8, s. 19.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Fragments of Unknown Position 6 (from Strabo 10.3.19) (trans.

For instance, Hesiod says that five daughters were born to\n        Hekateros (Hecaterus) and the daughter of Phoroneus, ‘from whom sprang the mountain-ranging Nymphai\n        (Nymphs), goddesses, and the breed of Satyroi (Satyrs), creatures worthless and unfit for work, and also the\n        Kouretes (Curetes), sportive gods, dancers.’\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 3. 763 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Satyri (Satyrs) come running and laugh at their father's [Seilenos'] bloated face.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 14. 105 ff (trans.

Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"According to Eratosthenes, another story is told about the Asses. After Jupiter [Zeus] had declared war on\n        the Gigantes (Giants), he summoned all the gods to combat them, and Father Liber [Dionysos], Vulcanus\n        [Hephaistos (Hephaestus)], the Satyri (Satyrs), and the Sileni (Silens) came riding on asses. Since they were\n        not far from the enemy, the asses were terrified, and individually let out a braying such as the Gigantes had\n        never heard. At the noise the enemy took hastily to flight, and thus were defeated.\"\n\nSatyroi are appear as troops of the god Dionysos in Euripides' Cyclops (not currently quoted here).\n\nThe Choruses of the ancient satyr-plays were composed of men dressed as Satyrs. The only surviving example of\n        its kind is the fragmentary Ichneutae (Trackers) of Sophocles. A few fragments of some of Aeschylus'\n        and Euripides satyr-dramas also survive. Many Athenian vase-paintings from the era depict scenes from these\n        plays, for example, the Satyr-biga scene (shown above) likely represents a scene from Aeschylus' satyr-play\n        Isthmiastae in which the creatures compete in the contests of the Isthmian Games.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 4 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"He [Argos Panoptes] also ambushed and slew a Satyros (Satyr) that was hurting the Arkadians (Arcadians) by\n        stealing their herds.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 13 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[When Danaus arrived in the land of Argos] the land was without water, thanks to Poseidon, who, in anger\n        at Inakhos (Inachus) for testifying that the region belonged to Hera, had dried up even the springs. So Danaus\n        sent his daughters to find water. One of them, Amymone, while searching threw a spear at a deer and hit a\n        sleeping Satyros (Satyr), who woke, jumped up, and was ready to have sex with her. Then Poseidon appeared and\n        the Satyros ran off; so Poseidon himself made love to her.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 169 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"When Amymone, daughter of Danaus, was eagerly hunting in the woods, she struck a Satyrus (Satyr) with her\n        dart. He wanted to ravish her, but she begged the aid of Neptunus [Poseidon]. When Neptunus came there, he drove\n        away the Satyrus, and lay with her himself.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 169a :\n        \"Amymone, daughter of Danaus, was sent by her father to get water for performing sacred rites. While\n        hunting for it, she grew weary and fell asleep. A Satyrus (Satyr) tried to seduce her, but she implored the help\n        of Neptunus [Poseidon]. When Neptunus had hurled his trident at the Satyrus, it became fixed in a rock. Neptunus\n        drove off the Satyrus. When he asked the girl what she was doing in this lonely place she said she had been sent\n        by her father to get water. Neptunus lay with her.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 6. 111 ff (trans.

One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and\n        blew on them. When the Satyros asked the reason for this, he told him that he did it to warm his hands because\n        they were so cold. Later on in the day they sat down to eat, and the food prepared was quite scalding. The Man\n        raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it. When the Satyros again inquired the reason,\n        he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot. ‘I can no longer consider you as a\n        friend,’ said the Satyros, ‘a fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold.’\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 34 (trans.

And, in general, the Mousai (Muses) who bestowed benefits and delights through the advantages which\n        their education gave them, and the Satyroi by the use of devices which contribute to mirth, made the life of\n        Dionysos happy and agreeable.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 7 (trans.

They\n        pulled tight the dappled skins of fawns over the shoulder, they shouted the song of Bakkhos sounding tongue with\n        tongue, crushing the fruit with many a skip of the foot, crying ‘Euoi!’ The wine spurted up in the\n        grapefilled hollow, the runlets were empurpled; pressed by the alternating tread the fruit bubbled out red juice\n        with white foam. They scooped it up with oxhorns, instead of cups which had not yet been seen, so that ever\n        after the cup of mixed wine took this divine name of Winehorn.\n        And one went bubbling the mindcharming drops of Bakkhos as he turned his wobbling feet in zigzag jerks, crossing\n        right over left in confusion as he wetted his hairy cheeks with Bakkhos's drops. Another skipt up struck with a\n        tippler's madness when he heard the horrid boom of the beaten drumskin. One again who had drunk too deeply of\n        caredispellingwine purpled his dark beard with the rosy liquor. Another turning his unsteady took towards a tree\n        espied a Nymphe half-hidden, unveiled, close at hand; and he would have crawled up he highest tree in the\n        forest, feet slipping, hanging on by his toenails, had not Dionysos held him back. Near the fountains another\n        driven by the insane impulse of drunken excitement, chased a naked Naias of the waters; he would have seized her\n        with hairy hand as she swam, but she gave the slip and dived into deep water. To Dionysos alone had Rheia given\n        the amethyst, which preserves the windedrinker from the tyranny of madness.\n        Many of the horned Satyroi joined furiously in the festive dancing with sportive steps. One felt within him a\n        new hot madness, the guide to love, and threw a hairy arm round a Bakkhanal (Bacchanal) girl's waist. One shaken\n        by the madness of min-crazing drink laid hold of the girdle of a modest unwedded maid, and as she would have no\n        love-making pulled her back by the dress and touched her rosy thighs from behind. Another dragged back a\n        struggling mystic maiden while kindling the torch for the god's nightly dances, laid timid fingers upon her\n        bosom and pressed the swelling circle of her firm breast.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 13. 43 ff :\n        \"[Rhea summons rustic daimones to the army of Dionysos for his campaign against the Indians :] The heroic\n        breed of farscatterd champions, the hairy Satyroi (Satyrs), the blood of the Kentauroi (Centaur) tribe, the\n        bushyknee ancient [Seilenos (Silenus)] and his phalanx of Seilenoi (Silens), the regiment of Bassarides--do you\n        sing me these, O Korybantic Mousai (Corybantic Muses)!\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 14. 105 ff :\n        \"[The army of Dionysos gathers for a campaign against the Indians :] From these [Maron, Astraios (Astraeus)\n        and Leneus, the three Seilenoi (Silens) sons of Seilenos (Silenus),] had sprung the twiform generation of the\n        muchmarried Satyroi (Satyrs).

The Satyroi (Satyrs) dived into a bear's cave, and\n        hollowed their little bed in the rock with sharp finger-nails in place of cutting steel; until the light-brining\n        morning shone, and the brightness of Eos (the Dawn) newly risen showed itself peacefully to both Indians and\n        Satyroi.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 39. 328 ff :\n        \"[During the Indian War :] Korymbasos (Corymbasus) [king of the Aithiopians (Ethiopians)] cast a lance at a\n        Satyros' (Satyr's) tail, but the lance missed him.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 40. 151 ff :\n        \"[The Indian princess Kheirobie (Chirobia) speaks :] ‘Save me from sleeping in the arms of a horned\n        Satyros (Satyr).’\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 43. 307 ff :\n        \"[Poseidon led the gods of the sea against the companions of Dionysos in the contest for maiden Beroe :]\n        Satyroi (Satyrs) also bustled about in dancing tumult, trusting to the horns on their bull-heads, while the\n        straight tail draggled from their loins for a change as they hurried.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 45. 318 ff :\n        \"A Satyros (Satyr) rushed along carrying a snarling beast, a dangerous tiger which sat on his back, which\n        for all its wild nature did nit touch the bearer.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 47. 478 ff :\n        \"[Dionysos and his companions are driven out of Argos by King Perseus :] The people [of Argos] would not\n        receive him [Dionysos]; they chased away the danceweaving women and Satyroi (Satyrs); they repudiated the\n        thyrsus, lest Hera should be jealous and destroy her Pelasgian seat [of Argos] . . . \n        [Hera urges Perseus to fight :] ‘Make war on the Satyroi too: turn towards battling Lyaios (Lyaeus) the\n        deadly eye of snakehair Medousa (Medusa), and let me see a new Polydektes (Polydectes) made stone . . .\n        Kill the array of bull-horned Satyroi (Satyrs), change with the Gorgon's eye the human countenances of the\n        Bassarides into like images selfmade; with the beauty of the stone copies adorn your streets, and make statues\n        like an artist for the Inakhian market-places.’\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 48. 188 ff :\n        \"[The wedding of Dionysos and Pallene :] That was a wedding of many songs: the bridechamber was never\n        silent, Seilenoi (Silens) chanted, Bakkhantes (Bacchantes) danced, drunken Satyroi (Satyrs) wove a hymn of love\n        and sang the alliance which came of this victorious match.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 23. 6 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Wishing to know better than most people who the Satyroi (Satyrs) are I have inquired from many about this\n        very point. Euphemos the Karian (Carian) said that on a voyage to Italia he was driven out of his course by\n        winds and was carried into the outer sea, beyond the course of seamen. He affirmed that there were many\n        uninhabited islands, while in others lived wild men. The sailors did not wish to put in at the latter, because,\n        having put in before, they had some experience of the inhabitants, but on this occasion they had no choice in\n        the matter. The islands were called Satyrides by the sailors, and the inhabitants were red haired, and had upon\n        their flanks tails not much smaller than those of horses. As soon as they caught sight of their visitors, they\n        ran down to the ship without uttering a cry in the ship. At last the sailors in fear\n        cast a foreign woman on to the island. Her the Satyroi (Satyrs) outraged not only in the usual way, but also in\n        a most shocking manner.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 14. 2. 5 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The city of the Rhodians lies on the eastern promontory of Rhodes . . . [and it] has been adorned with\n        many votive offerings, which for the most part are to be found in the Dionysion (Temple of Dionysos) . . . and\n        there are also the paintings of Protogenes, his Ialysos and also his Satyros (Satyr), the latter standing by a\n        pillar, on top of which stood a male partridge. And at this partridge, as would be natural, the people were so\n        agape when the picture had only recently been set up, that they would behold him with wonder but overlook the\n        Satyros, although the latter was a very great success.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 43. 5 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The temple of Dionysos in Megara :] By the side of it is a Satyros (Satyr) of Parian marble.\"\n\nCallistratus, Descriptions 1 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[A description of an ancient Greek statue :] On a Satyros (Satyr). There was a certain cave near Thebes in\n        Egypt which resembled a shepherd's pipe, since as it followed its winding course in the depths of the earth it\n        formed a natural spiral; for it did not take a straight course at the opening and then branch off into\n        straight-running corridors, but winding about under the mountain it made a huge spiral, ending in a most\n        difficult maze. In it was set up an image of a Satyros wrought in marble. He stood on a base in the attitude of\n        one making ready to dance, and lifting the sole of his right foot backward he not only held a flute in his hand\n        but also was being the first to leap up at its sound; though in reality the flute's note was not reaching the\n        player's ear, nor yet was the flute endowed with voice, but the physical effect which flute-players experience\n        had been transferred to the stone by the skill of the artist. You could have seen the veins standing out as\n        though they were filled with a sort of breath, the Satyros drawing the air from his lungs to bring notes from\n        the flute, the statue eager to be in action, and the stone entering upon strenuous activity--for it persuaded\n        you that the power to blow the flute was actually inherent in it, and that the indication of breathing was the\n        result of its own inner powers--finding a way to accomplish the impossible. The body had no trace of delicacy,\n        but the hardness of the members had stolen away their beauty, making the form rugged with the symmetry of manly\n        limbs. For though soft skin and dainty limbs befit a beautiful girl, the appearance of a Satyros is unkempt, as\n        of a mountain spirit (daimon oreios) that leaps in honour of Dionysos. The statue was wreathed with\n        ivy, though the sculptor's art did not cull real berries from a meadow, nay, rather, it was the stone which for\n        all its hardness spread out into sprays and encircled the hair, creeping back from the forehead till the ends\n        met at the sinews of the neck. Pan stood beside him, delighting in the music of the flute and embracing Ekho\n        (Echo), in fear, I suppose, lest the flute set in motion some musical sound and induce the Nymphe to make an\n        echoing response to the Satyros.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
