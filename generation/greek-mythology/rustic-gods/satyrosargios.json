  "content": "THE SATYROS ARGIOS was an Argive satyr which the Danaid Amymone accidentally struck with her spear while\n        hunting deer. It tried to assault her but was driven off by the god Poseidon who lay with the girl instead.\n\nAeschylus, Amymone (lost play) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        Aeschylus' lost drama Amymone told the tale of the maiden's seduction by the god Poseidon. It was\n        probably a satyr-play whose plot followed the outline given by Apollodorus and Hyginus below.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 13 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[When Danaus arrived in Argos] the land was without water, thanks to Poseidon, who, in anger at Inakhos\n        (Inachus) for testifying that the region belonged to Hera, had dried up even the springs. So Danaus sent his\n        daughters to find water. One of them, Amymone, while searching threw a spear at a deer and hit a sleeping\n        Satyros (Satyr), who woke, jumped up, and was ready to have sex with her. Then Poseidon appeared and the Satyros\n        ran off; so Poseidon himself made love to her, after which he told her about the springs of Lerna.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 169 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"When Amymone, daughter of Danaus, was eagerly hunting in the woods, she struck a Satyr with her dart. He\n        wanted to ravish her, but she begged the aid of Neptunus [Poseidon]. When Neptunus came there, he drove away the\n        Satyr, and lay with her himself.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 169A :\n        \"Amymone, daughter of Danaus, was sent by her father to get water for performing sacred rites. While\n        hunting for it, she grew weary and fell asleep. A Satyr tried to seduce her, but she implored the help of\n        Neptunus [Poseidon]. When Neptunus had hurled his trident at the Satyr, it became fixed in a rock. Neptunus\n        drove off the Satyr. When he asked the girl what she was doing in this lonely place she said she had been sent\n        by her father to get water. Neptunus lay with her, and in return he did her a favour, bidding her draw out his\n        trident from the rock. She drew it out and three streams of water flowed, which were called the Amymonian Spring\n        from her name.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
