The different accounts about Aristaeus, who once was a mortal, and ascended to the dignity of a\n        god through the benefits he had conferred upon mankind, seem to have arisen in different places and\n        independently of one another, so that they referred to several distinct beings, who were subsequently identified\n        and united into one. He is described either as a son of Uranus and Ge, or according to a more general tradition,\n        as the son of Apollo by Cyrene, the grand-daughter of Peneius. Other, but more local traditions, call his father\n        Cheiron or Carystus. (Diod. iv. 81, &c.; Apollon. Rhod. iii. 500, &c. with the Schol.; Pind.\n        Pyth ix. 45, &c.) The stories about his youth are very marvellous, and show him at once as the\n        favourite of the gods. His mother Cyrene had been carried off by Apollo from mount Pelion, where he found her\n        boldly fighting with a lion, to Libya, where Cyrene was named after her, and where she gave birth to Aristaeus.\n        After he had grown up, Aristaeus went to Thebes in Boeotia, where he learned from Cheiron and the muses the arts\n        of healing and prophecy. According to some statements he married Autonoë, the daughter of Cadmus, who bore\n        him several sons, Charmus, Calaicarpus, Actaeon, and Polydorus. (Hesiod. Theog. 975.) After the\n        unfortunate death of his son Actaeon, he left Thebes and went to Ceos, whose inhabitants he delivered from a\n        destructive drought, by erecting an altar to Zeus Icmaeus. This gave rise to an identification of Aristaeus with\n        Zeus in Ceos. From thence he returned to Libya, where his mother prepared for him a fleet, with which he sailed\n        to Sicily, visited several islands of the Mediterranean, and for a time ruled over Sardinia. From these islands\n        his worship spread over Magna Graecia and other Greek colonies. At last he went to Thrace, where he became\n        initiated in the mysteries of Dionysus, and after having dwelled for some time near mount Haemus, where he\n        founded the town of Aristaeon, he disappeared. (Comp. Paus. x. 17. § 3.) Aristaeus is one of the most\n        beneficent divinities in ancient mythology: he was worshipped as the protector of flocks and shepherds, of vine\n        and olive plantations ; he taught men to hunt and keep bees, and averted from the fields the burning heat of the\n        sun and other causes of destruction; he was a theos nomios, agreus, and alexêtêr. The benefits which\n        he conferred upon man, differed in different places according to their especial wants : Ceos, which was much\n        exposed to heat and droughts, received through him rain and refreshing winds; in Thessaly and Arcadia he was the\n        protector of the flocks and bees. (Virg. Georg. i. 14, iv. 283, 317.) Justin (xiii. 7) throws\n        everything into confusion by describing Nomios and Agreus, which are only surnames of Aristaeus, as his\n        brothers. Respecting the representations of this divinity on ancient coins.\n\nAGREUS (Agreus), a hunter, occurs as a surname of Pan and Aristaeus. (Pind. Pyth. ix. 115; Apollon.\n        Rhod. iii. 507; Diod. iv. 81; Hesych. s.v.; Salmas. ad Solin. p. 81.)\n\nNO′MIUS (Noumios), a surname of divinities protecting the pastures and shepherds, such as Apollo, Pan.\n        Hermes, and Aristaeus. (Aristoph. Thesmoph. 983; Anthol. Palat. ix. 217; Callim. Hymn. in\n          Apoll. 47.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 498 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"At dawn the Etesian Winds were blowing in full force, as they do throughout the world by an ordinance from\n        Zeus. This is how it came about. Folk say that once upon a time there was a shepherdess called Kyrene (Cyrene)\n        who used to graze her flocks in the water-meadows of Peneos (Peneus). She was a virgin and she prized her\n        maidenhood. But one day when she was tending her sheep down by the river, Apollon carried her off from Haimonia\n        (Haemonia) and set her down among the Nymphai (Nymphs) of the land in distant Libya near the Myrtosian Mount.\n        There she bore him a son called Aristaios (Aristaeus), who is remembered now in the cornlands of Haimonia as\n        Agreus (the Hunter) and Nomios (the Shepherd). Kyrene herself was left in Libya by Apollon, who in token of his\n        love made her a Nymphe and huntress with the gift of a long life. But he took his infant son away to be brought\n        up by Kheiron (Chiron) in his cave.\n        When the child had grown up the divine Mousai (Muses) found him a bride, taught him the arts of healing and\n        prophecy, and made him the shepherd of all their flocks that grazed on the Athamantian plain in Phthia, round\n        Mount Othrys and in the valley of the sacred River Apidanos.\n        There came a time, however, when Aristaios (Aristaeus) migrated. The Dog-star Sirios (Sirius) was scorching the\n        Minoan Islands from the sky, and the people could find no permanent cure for the trouble till the Archer-King\n        Apollon put it in their heads to send for Aristaios. So, as his father's command, Aristaios assembled the\n        Parrhasian tribe, who are descendants of Lykaon (Lycaon), left Phthia, and settled in Keos (Ceos). He raised a\n        great altar to the Rain-god Zeus and made ritual offerings in the hills to the Dog-star and to Zeus himself, the\n        Son of Kronos. In response, Zeus gave his orders--and the Etesian Winds refresh the earth for forty days. The\n        priests of Keos still make yearly sacrifice before the rising of the Dog.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 81. 1 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"Aristaios (Aristaeus) was the son of Apollon and Kyrene (Cyrene), the daughter of Hypseus the son of [the\n        River] Peneios (Peneus), and the manner of his birth is given by certain writers of myths as follows: Apollon\n        became enamoured of a maiden by the name of Kyrene (Cyrene), who was reared in the neighbourhood of Mount Pelion\n        and was of surpassing beauty, and he carried her off from there to that part of the land of Libya where in later\n        times he founded a city and named it, after her, Kyrene.\n        Now Apollon begat by Kyrene in that land a son Aristaios and gave him while yet a babe into the hands of the\n        Nymphai (Nymphs) to nurture, and the latter bestowed upon him three different names, calling him, that is,\n        Nomios (the Shepherd), Aristaios, and Argeus (the Hunter). He learned from the Nymphai how to curdle milk [i.e.\n        how to make cheese], to make bee-hives, and to cultivate olive-trees, and was the first to instruct men in these\n        matters. And because of the advantage which came to them from these discoveries the men who had received his\n        benefactions rendered to Aristaios honours equal to those offered to the gods, even as they had done in the case\n        of Dionysos.\n        After this, they say, Aristaios went to Boiotia (Boeotia), where he married one of the daughters of Kadmos\n        (Cadmus), Autonoe, to whom was born Aktaion (Actaeon), who, as the myths relate, was torn to pieces by his own\n        dogs . . .\n        As for Aristaios, after the death of Aktaion, we are told, he went to the oracle of his father, Apollon, who\n        prophesied to him that he was to change his home to the island of Keos (Ceos) and told him likewise of the\n        honours which would be his among the Keans. To this island he sailed, but since a plague prevailed throughout\n        Greece the sacrifice he offered there was on behalf of all the Greeks. And since the sacrifice was made at the\n        time of the rising of the star Sirios (Sirius), which is the period when the etesian winds customarily blow, the\n        pestilential diseases, we are told, came to an end. Now the man who ponders upon this event may reasonably\n        marvel at the strange turn which fortune took; for the same man who saw his son done to death by the dogs\n        likewise put an end to the influence of the star which, of all the stars of heaven, bears the same name [i.e.\n        Sirius the Dog-Star] and is thought to bring destruction upon mankind, and by so doing was responsible for\n        saving the lives of the rest.\n        We are further informed that Aristaios left descendants behind on the island of Keos and then returned to Libya,\n        from where he set forth with the aid of his mother, a Nymphe, and put ashore on the island of Sardinia. Here he\n        made his home, and since he loved the island because of its beauty, he set out plantings on it and brought it\n        under cultivation, whereas formerly it had lain waste. Here he begat two sons, Kharmos (Charmus) and Kallicarpos\n        (Callicarpus).\n        And after this he visited other island and spent some time in Sikelia (Sicily), where, because of the abundance\n        of the fruits on the island and the multitude of flocks and herds which grazed there, he was eager to display to\n        its inhabitants the benefactions which were his to bestow. Consequently among the inhabitants of Sikelia, as men\n        say, Aristaios received especial honour as a god, in particular by those who harvested the fruit of the\n        olive-tree.\n        And finally, as the myths relate, he visited Dionysos in Thrake (Thrace) and was initiated into his secret\n        rites, and during his stay in the company of the god he learned from him much useful knowledge. And after\n        dwelling some time in the neighbourhood of Mount Haimos (Haemus) he never was seen again of men, and became the\n        recipient of immortal honours not only among the barbarians of that region but among the Greeks as well.\"\n\nHesiod, Catalogues of Women Fragment 93 (from Servius on Vergil, Georgics 1. 14)\n          (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.) :\n        \"He [Virgil] invokes Aristaios (Aristaeus), that is, the son of Apollon and Kyrene (Cyrene), whom Hesiod\n        calls the shepherd of Apollon.\"\n\nPindar, Pythian Ode 9. 59 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"[The kentauros Kheiron (centaur Chiron) prophesies the birth of Aristaios (Aristaeus) to Apollon :]\n        ‘There [in Libya] shall she [Kyrene (Cyrene), love of Apollon] bear a son [Aristaios], whom glorious\n        Hermes will take from his fond mother's breast, and carry to the enthroned Horai (Horae, Seasons) and Mother\n        Gaia (Gaea, Earth); and they will gently nurse the babe upon their knees, and on his lips distil ambrosia and\n        nectar, and shall ordain him an immortal being, a Zeus or holy Apollon, a joy to men who love him. And he shall\n        ever be at hand to tend their flocks, Agreos (Hunter) his name to some, to others Nomios (Shepherd), and some\n        will call him Aristaios.’ So Kheiron spoke and decreed for the god his bridal's dear fulfilment.\"\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 45 (from Scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes) (trans.

For where the favoured\n        people of Macedonian Canopus [Egypt] dwell by the still waters of the flooded Nile . . . First is chosen a\n        place, small and straitened for this very purpose. This they confine with a narrow roof of tiles and close\n        walls, and towards the four winds add four windows with slanting light. Then a bullock is sought, one just\n        arching his horns on a brow of two summer's growth. Struggle as he will, both his nostrils are stopped up, and\n        the breath of his mouth; then he is beaten to death, and his flesh is pounded to a pulp through the unbroken\n        hide. As thus he lies, they leave him in his prison, and strew beneath his sides broken boughs, thyme, and fresh\n        cassia. This is done when the zephyrs begin to stir the waves, before ever the meadows blush with their fresh\n        hues, before the chattering swallow hangs her nest from the rafters. Meantime the moisture, warming in the\n        softened bones, ferments, and creatures of wondrous wise to view, footless at first, soon with buzzing wings as\n        well, swarm together, and more and more essay the light air, until, like a shower pouring from summer clouds,\n        they burst forth . . .\n        What god, ye Musae (Muses), forged for us this device? Whence did man's strange adventuring take its rise?\n        Aristaeus the shepherd, quitting Tempe by the Peneus, when--so runs the tale--his bees were lost through\n        sickness and hunger, sorrowfully stopped beside the sacred fount at the stream's head, and with much complaint\n        called on his mother thus : ‘O mother, mother Cyrene, who dwell in this flood's depths, why, from the\n        gods' glorious line--if indeed, as you say, Thymbraean Apollo is my father--did you give me birth, to be hated\n        of the fates? Or whither is your love for me banished? Why did you bid me hope for Heaven? Lo, even this very\n        crown of my mortal life, which the skilful tending of crops and cattle had scarce wrought out for me for all my\n        endeavour--though you are my mother, I resign. Come, and with your own hand tear up my fruitful woods; put\n        hostile flame to my stalls, destroy my crops, burn my seedlings, and swing the stout axe against my vines, if\n        such loathing for my honour has seized you.’\n        But his mother heard the cry from her bower beneath the river's depths. About her the Nymphs were spinning\n        fleeces of Miletus . . . the wail of Aristaeus smote upon his mother's ear, and all upon their crystal thrones\n        were startled. Yet, first of all the sisters, Arethusa, looking forth, raised her golden head above the water's\n        brim, and cried from afar : ‘O sister Cyrene, not vain was your alarm at this loud lament. 'Tis even he,\n        your own beloved, your Aristaeus, standing sadly and in tears by the waters of our father, and crying out on you\n        by name for cruelty.’\n        To her the mother, her soul smitten with strange dread cries : ‘O bring him, bring him to us; lawful it is\n        for him to tread the threshold divine.’\n        And withal, she bade the deep streams part asunder far, that so the youth might enter in. And lo, the wave,\n        arched mountain-like, stood round about, and, welcoming him within the vase recess ushered him beneath the\n        stream . . . Soon as he reached the bower with its hanging roof of stone, and Cyrene heard the tale of her son's\n        idle tears, the sisters, in due order, pour on his hands clear spring-waters, and bring smooth-shorn napkins.\n        Some load the board with the feast, and in turn set on the brimming cups; the altars blaze up with Panchaean\n        fires. Then cried his mother : ‘Take the goblets of Maeonian wine; pour we a libation to Ocean!’\n        And she prayed to Ocean, universal father, and the sister Nymphs, who guard the hundred forests and a hundred\n        streams. Thrice with clear nectar she sprinkles the glowing hearth; thrice the flame, shooting up to the\n        rooftop, gleamed afresh.\n        With this omen to cheer his heart, she thus herself began :\n        ‘In Neptune's [Poseidon's] Carpathian flood there dwells a seer, [the sea-god] Proteus . . . Him, my son,\n        you must first take in fetters, that he may unfold to you all the cause of the sickness, and bless the issue.\n        For without force he will give you no counsel, nor shall you bend him by prayer. With stern force and fetters\n        make fast the captive; thereon alone his wiles will shatter themselves in vain. I myself, when the sun has\n        kindled his noonday heat, when the grass is athirst, and the shade is now welcome to the flock, will guide you\n        to the aged one's retreat, whither when weary he retires, so that you may assail him with ease as he lies\n        asleep. But when you hold him in the grasp of hands and fetters, then will manifold forms baffle you, and\n        figures of wild beasts. For of a sudden he will become a bristly boar, a deadly tiger, a scaly serpent, or a\n        lioness with tawny neck; or he will give forth the fierce roar of flame, and thus slip from his fetters, or he\n        will melt into fleeting water and be gone. But the more he turn himself into all shapes, the more, my son,\n        should you tighten his fetters, until after his last changes of body he become such as you saw when he closed\n        his eyes at the beginning of slumber.’\n        She spoke, and shed abroad ambrosia's fragrant stream, wherewith she steeped her son's whole frame: and lo, a\n        sweet effluence breathed from his smoothened locks, and vigour and suppleness passed into his limbs. There is a\n        vast cavern, hollowed in a mountain's side, whither many a wave is driven by the wind, then separates into\n        receding inlets--at times a haven most sure for storm-caught mariners. Within, Proteus shelters himself with the\n        barrier of a huge rock. Here the Nymph stations the youth in ambush, away from the light; she herself, veiled in\n        mist, stands aloof.\n        And now the Dog Star [Sirius], fiercely parching the thirsty Indians, was ablaze in heaven, and the fiery Sun\n        had consumed half his course; the grass was withering and the hollow streams, in their parched throats, were\n        scorched and baked by the rays down to the slime, when Proteus came from the waves, in quest of his wonted cave.\n        About him the watery race of the vast deep gamboled, scattering afar the briny spray . . . Soon as the chance\n        came to Aristaeus, he scarce suffered the aged one to settle his weary limbs, before he burst upon him with a\n        loud cry and surprised him in fetters as he lies. On his part, the seer forgets not his craft, but changes\n        himself into all wondrous shapes--into flame and hideous beast and flowing river. But when no stratagem wins\n        escape, vanquished he returns to himself, and at last speaks with human voice : ‘Why, who,’ he\n        cried, ‘most presumptuous of youths, bade you invade our home? Or what seek you hence?’ But he :\n        ‘You know, Proteus; you know of yourself, nor may one deceive you in aught, but give up your wish to\n        deceive. Following the counsel of Heaven, we are come to seek hence an oracle for our weary fortunes.’ So\n        much he spoke.\n        On this the seer, yielding at last to mighty force, rolled on him eyes ablaze with grey-green light, and grimly\n        gnashing his teeth, thus opened his lips to tell of fate's decrees :\n        ‘It is a god, no other, whose anger pursues you : Great is the crime you are paying for; this punishment,\n        far less than you deserve, unhappy Orpheus arouses against you--did not Fate interpose--and rages implacably for\n        the loss of his bride [Eurydike]. She, in headlong flight along the river, if only she might escape you, saw\n        not, doomed maiden, amid the deep grass the monstrous serpent at her feet that guarded the banks. But her sister\n        band of Dryads filled the mountaintops with their cries; the towers of Rhodope wept. [He then tells the tale of\n        Orpheus' journey to the underworld in search of Eurydike.] . . .’\n        Thus Proteus, and at a bound plunged into the deep sea, and where he plunged, whirled the water into foam\n        beneath the eddy. Cyrene stayed, and straightway spoke to the startled youth : ‘You may dismiss from your\n        mind the care that troubles it. This is the whole cause of the sickness, and hence it is that the Nymphae, with\n        whom she used to tread the dance in the deep groves, have sent this wretched havoc on your bees. You must offer\n        a suppliant's gifts, sue for peace, and pay homage to the gentle maidens of the woods; for they will grant\n        pardon to prayers, and relax their wrath. But first I will tell you in order the manner of your supplication.\n        Pick out four choice bulls, of surpassing form, that now graze among your herds on the heights of green Lycaeus,\n        and as many heifers of unyoked neck. For these set up four altars by the stately shrines of the goddesses, and\n        drain the sacrificial blood from their throats, but leave the bodies of the steers within the leafy grove.\n        Later, when the ninth Dawn displays her rising beams, you must offer to Orpheus funeral dues of Lethe's poppies,\n        slay a black ewe, and revisit the grove. Then with Eurydice appeased you should honour her with the slaying of a\n        calf.’\n        Tarrying not, he straightway does his mother's bidding. He comes to the shrine, raises the altars appointed, and\n        leads there four choice bulls, of surpassing form, and as many heifers of unyoked neck. Later, when the ninth\n        Dawn had ushered in her rising beams, he offers to Orpheus the funeral dues, and revisits the grove. But here\n        they espy a portent, sudden and wondrous to tell--throughout the paunch, amid the molten flesh of the oxen, bees\n        buzzing and swarming forth from the ruptured sides, then trailing in vast clouds, till at last on a treetop they\n        stream together, and hang in clusters from the bending boughs.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 975 ff (trans.

With\n        experienced hand he hurled a heavy stone for the death of his adversaries, as if he were crushing and pounding\n        the melting travail of the fat olive; he scattered his proud enemies with his favourite bull-roarer, swinging\n        the bronze plate which he used to whirl when he scattered the maddened stings of the swarming bees.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 37. 174 ff : \n        \"[Before the horse races at the funeral games of a friend of Dionysos killed in the Indian War :] Bold\n        Aktaion (Actaeon) was led away from the crowd by his father [Aristaios (Aristaeus)], who addressed these loving\n        injunctions to his eager son : ‘My son, your father Aristaios has more experience than you. I know you\n        have strength enough, that in you the bloom of youth is joined with courage; for you have in you the blood of\n        Apollon my father, and our Arkadian mares are stronger than any for the race. But all this is in vain, neither\n        strength nor running horses know how to win, as much as the driver's brains. Cunning, only cunning you want; for\n        horseracing needs a smart clever man to drive.\n        Then listen to your father, and I will teach you too all the tricks of the horsy art which time has taught me,\n        and they are many and various. Do your best, my boy, to honour your father by your successes. Horseracing brings\n        as great a repute as war; do your best to honour me on the racecourse as well as the battlefield. You have won a\n        victory in war, now win another, that I may call you prizewinner as well as spearman. My dear boy, do something\n        worthy of Dionysos your kinsman, worthy both of Phoibos (Phoebus) and of skilful Kyrene (Cyrene), and outdo the\n        labours of your father Aristaios. Show your horsemastery, win your even like an artist, by your own sharp wits;\n        for without instruction one pulls the car off the course in the middle of a race, it wanders all over the place,\n        and the obstinate horses in their unsteady progress are not driven by the whip or obedient to the bit, the\n        driver as he turns back misses the post, he loses control, the horses run away and carry him back where they\n        will. But one who is a master of arts and tricks, the driver with his wits about him, even with inferior horses,\n        keeps straight and watches the man in front, keeps a course ever close to the post, wheels his car round without\n        ever scratching the mark. Keep your eyes open, please, and tighten the guiding rein swinging the whole near\n        horse about and just clearing the post, throwing your weight sideways to make the car tilt, guide your course by\n        needful measure, watch until as your car turns the hub of the wheels seems almost to touch the surface of the\n        mark with the near-circling wheel. Come very near without touching; but take care of the stone, or you may\n        strike the post with the axle against the turning-post and wreck both horses and car together. As you guide your\n        team this way that that way on the course, act like a steersman; guide your car on a straight course, for the\n        driver's mind is like a car's rudder if he drives with his head.’\n        With this advise, he turned away and retired, having taught his son the various tricks of his trade as a\n        horseman, which he knew so well himself.\"\n\nIn Haimonia Aristaios was worshipped primarily as a god of hunters and shepherds.\n\nHe had a sacred cave on the island where he and his daughter Makris (Macris) nursed the god Dionysos.\n\nOn the island of Keos Aristaios was worshipped as the god of the Etesian Winds.\n\nHe was worshipped along with his mother Kyrene, the eponymous goddess of the city.\n\nSee Birth & Childhood of Aristaios (above)\n        See Migration of Aristaeus to Sardinia (above) (the Kyrenaians established colonies on\n        the island).\n\nHe was worshipped primarily as a god of olive-orchards.\n\nThe Cean Aristaios (Aristaeus), tamer of the scorching Dog-Star and summoner of the Etesian Winds, was\n        apparently closely identified with Astraios (Astraeus), the Titan-god\n        of winds and stars. Indeed the old poet Bacchylides described Aristaios as a Titan-god, son of Ouranos and Gaia.\n        A Gigante (Giant) named Aristaios or Astraios also appears in the\n        list of those who fought the gods. The Euboian Aristaios, mentor and companion of Dionysos, seems to be identical to the Seilen named Astraios, who in turn was a variant of the god Seilenos. The god in his role as discoverer of honey was connected with the Kourete (Curete) Melisseus (Honey-Man), who like the afore-mentioned Seilenos\n        belonged to the Titan generation of gods. Finally the Thessalian Aristaios was titled Agreus (Hunter) and Nomios\n        (Shepherd), two titles he shared with Pan the Arkadian god of shepherds and other rustic\n        pursuits. Further Pan was sometimes multiplied into twin rustic gods--the Panes\n          Agreus & Nomios.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
