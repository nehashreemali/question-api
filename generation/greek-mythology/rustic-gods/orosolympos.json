  "content": "OLYMPOS (Olympus) was a mountain-god of Anatolia in Phrygia (modern Turkey). He was an inventor of the flute\n        and the father of flute-playing Satyroi (Satyrs).\n\nThe Phrygian Mount Olympos should not be confused with the Thessalian mountain of the same name which was the\n        home of the Olympian gods.\n\nMARSYAS (Apollodorus 1.24, Ovid Metamorphoses\n          6.382)\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 24 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Apollon also slew Marsyas, the son of Olympos (Olympus).\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 20. 3. 14 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"And when they [the poets] bring Seilenos (Silenus) and Marsyas and Olympos (Olympus) into one and the same\n        connection [with Rhea and Dionysos], and make them the historical inventors of flutes, they again, a second\n        time, connect the Dionysiac and the Phrygian rites; and they often in a confused manner drum on Ida and Olympos\n        as the same mountain. Now there are four peaks of Ida called Olympos, near Antandria; and there is also the\n        Mysian Olympos, which indeed borders on Ida, but is not the same.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 6. 392 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The satyr Marsyas was flayed alive by the god Apollon :] The countryfolk, the Sylvan Deities (Numina\n          Silvarum), the Fauni (Fauns) [Panes] and brother Satyri (Satyrs) and the Nymphae (Nymphs), were all in\n        tears, Olympus too, still loved.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
