  "content": "TROKHILOS (Trochilus) was the demi-god or hero of the mill-wheel and a deity of the Eleusinian Mysteries. He\n        was the father of the agrarian hero Triptolemos \"the Husk-Pounder.\"\n\nTrokhilos' name means \"Of the Wheel\" from the Greek words trokhos \"wheel\" and\n        trochazô \"to turn\". He is perhaps the same as Dolikhos (Dolichus), an Eleusinian lord\n        mentioned in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter.\n\nTRIPTOLEMOS, EUBOULEOS (by Eleusis) (Pausanias 1.14.2)\n\nHomeric Hymn 2 to Demeter (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th or 6th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[Demeter disguised as an old woman arrives in Eleusis where she is met by Kallidike (Callidice) who names\n        the lords of Eleusis :] ‘But now I will teach you clearly, telling you the names of men who have great\n        power and honour here [in Eleusis] and are chief among the people, guarding our city's coif of towers by their\n        wisdom and true judgements: there is wise Triptolemos and Dioklos (Dioclus) and Polyxeinos and blameless\n        Eumolpos and Dolikhos (Dolichus) and our own brave father [King Keleos (Celeus)].&esquo;\" [N.B. Dioklos or\n        Dolikhos is probably Trokhilos.]\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 14. 2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"It is said, then, that when Demeter came to Argos she was received by Pelasgos into his home, and that\n        Khrysanthis (Chrysanthis), knowing about the rape of Kore (Core) [Persephone], related the story to her.\n        Afterwards Trokhilos (Trochilus), the priest of the mysteries, fled, they say, from Argos because of the enmity\n        of Agenor, came to Attika and married a woman of Eleusis, by whom he had two children Eubouleos (Eubuleus) and\n        Triptolemos. That is the account given by the Argives.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
