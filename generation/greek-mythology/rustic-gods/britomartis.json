  "content": "BRITOMARTIS was the virgin goddess of hunting-, fishing- and fowling-nets. The catch of the nets--small game,\n        fish, and fowl--was served by the ancient Greeks as a relish beside the staple meal of bread. Bread itself was\n        apparently the province of Britomartis' mother Karme (Carme) \"Lady of the Harvest\".\n\nBritomartis was a huntress of the island of Krete (Crete). When the lustful king Minos attempted to seduce her,\n        she fled his advances, raced the length of the island and leapt into the sea. There she was caught in the nets\n        of fishermen and carried to the safety of the island of Aigina (Aegina).\n\nBritomartis' name means \"Sweet Maiden\" from the ancient Greek words britos and\n        martis. She was also known as Diktynna (Dictynna) \"Lady of the Nets\". She was closely\n        idenfified with the goddess Artemis.\n\nZEUS & KARME (Pausanias 2.30.3, Diodorus Siculus 5.76.3, Antoninus Liberalis 40)\n\nBRITOMARTIS (Britomartis), appears to have originally been a Cretan divinity of hunters and fishermen. Her name\n        is usually derived from britus, sweet or blessing, and martis, i. e. marna, a maiden, so that the name would\n        mean, the sweet or blessing maiden. (Paus. iii. 14. § 2; Solin. 11.) After the\n        introduction of the worship of Artemis into Crete, Britomartis, between whom and Artemis there were several\n        points of resemblance, was placed in some relation to her: Artemis, who loved her, assumed her name and was\n        worshipped under it, and in the end the two divinities became completely identified, as we see from the story\n        which makes Britomartis a daughter of Leto. (Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 189, with the Schol.; Paus. ii. 30.\n        § 3; Schol. ad Aristoph. Ran. 1402; Eurip. Iphig. Taur. 126; Aristoph. Ran.\n        1358; Virg. Cir. 305.) The myths of Britomartis is given by some of the authorities just referred to.\n        She was a daughter of Zeus and Carme, the daughter of Eubulus. She was a nymph, took great delight in wandering\n        about hunting, and was beloved by Artemis. Minos, who likewise loved her, pursued her for nine months, but she\n        fled from him and at last threw herself into the nets which had been set by fishermen, or leaped from mount\n        Dictynnaeum into the sea, where she became entangled in the nets, but was saved by Artemis, who now made her a\n        goddess. She was worshipped not only in Crete, but appeared to the inhabitants of Aegina, and was there called\n        Aphaea, whereas in Crete she received the surname Dictymna or Dictynna (from diktuon, a net; comp. Diod. v. 76).\n        According to another tradition, Britomartis was fond of solitude, and had vowed to live in perpetual maidenhood.\n        From Phoenicia (for this tradition calls her mother Carme, a daughter of Phoenix) she went to Argos, to the\n        daughters of Erasinus, and thence to Cephallenia, where she received divine honours from the inhabitants under\n        the name of Laphria. From Cephallenia she came to Crete, where she was pursued by Minos; but she fled to the\n        sea-coast, where fishermen concealed her under their nets, whence she derived the surname Dictynna. A sailor,\n        Andromedes, carried her from Crete to Aegina, and when, on landing there, he made an attempt upon her chastity,\n        she fled from his vessel into a grove, and disappeared in the sanctuary of Artemis. The Aeginetans now built a\n        sanctury to her, and worshipped her as a goddess. (Anton. Lib. 40.) These wanderings of Britomartis\n        unquestionably indicate the gradual diffusion of her worship in the various maritime places of Greece mentioned\n        in the legend. Her connexion and ultimate identification with Artemis had naturally a modifying influence upon\n        the notions entertained of each of them. As Britomartis had to do with fishermen and sailors, and was the\n        protectress of harbours and navigation generally, this feature was transferred to Artemis also, as we see\n        especially in the Arcadian Artemis; and the temples of the two divinities, therefore, stood usually on the banks\n        of rivers or on the sea-coast. As, on the other hand, Artemis was considered as the goddess of the moon,\n        Britomartis likewise appears in this light: her disappearance in the sea, and her identification with the\n        Aeginetan Aphaea, who was undoubtedly a goddess of the moon, seem to contain sufficient proof of this, which is\n        confirmed by the fact, that on some coins of the Roman empire Dictynna appears with the crescent. Lastly,\n        Britomartis was like Artemis drawn into the mystic worship of Hecate, and even identified with her. (Eurip.\n        Hippol. 141, with the Schol.)\n\nDICTE (Diktê), a nymph from whom mount Dicte in Crete was said to have received its name. She was beloved\n        and pursued by Minos, but she threw herself into the sea, where she was caught up and saved in the nets\n        (diktuon) of fishermen. Minos then desisted from pursuing her, and ordered the district to be called the\n        Dictaean. (Serv. ad Aen. iii. 171.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis 188 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And beyond others thou [Artemis] lovest the Nymphe of Gortyn [in Krete (Crete)], Britomartis, slayer of\n        stags, the goodly archer; for love of whom was Minos of old distraught and roamed the hills of Krete. And the\n        Nymphe would hide herself now under the shaggy oaks and anon in the low meadows. And for nine months he roamed\n        over crag and cliff and made not an end of pursuing, until, all but caught, she leapt into the sea from the top\n        of a cliff and fell into the nets of fishermen which saved her. Whence in after days the Kydonians (Cydonians)\n        call the Nymphe Diktyna (Dictynna, Lady of the Nets) and the hill whence the Nymphe leaped they call the hill\n        Diktaion (Dicte, Of the Nets), and there they set up altars and do sacrifice. And the garland on that day is\n        pine or mastich, but the hands touch not myrtle. For when she was in flight, a myrtle branch became entangled in\n        the maiden's robes; wherefore she was greatly angered against the myrtle. Oupis (Opis) [Artemis], O queen,\n        fairfaced Bringer of Light, thee too the Kretans name after that Nymphe . . . These were the first who wore\n        gallant bow and arrow-holding quivers on their shoulders; their right shoulders bore the quiver strap, and\n        always the right breast showed bare.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 76. 3 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"Britomartis, who is also called Diktynna (Dictynna), the myths relate, was born at Kaino (Caeno) in Krete\n        (Crete) of Zeus and Karme (Carme), the daughter of Euboulos (Eubulus) who was the son of Demeter; she invented\n        the nets (diktya) which are used in hunting, whence she has been called Diktynna (Dictynna), and she\n        passed her time in the company of Artemis, this being the reason why some men think Diktynna and Artemis are one\n        and the same goddess; and the Kretans (Cretans) have instituted sacrifices and built temples in honour of this\n        goddess. But those men who tell the tale that she has been named Diktynna because she fled into some fishermen's\n        nets when she was pursued by Minos, who would have ravished her, have missed the truth; for its is not a\n        probable story that the goddess should ever have got into so helpless a state that she would have required the\n        aid that men can give, being as she is the daughter of the greatest one of the gods.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 4. 12 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Kallimachos (Callimachus) [poet C3rd B.C.] . . . says that Britomartis, in her flight from the violence of\n        Minos, leaped from Dikte (Dicte) into fishermen's nets, and that because of this she herself was called Diktynna\n        (Dictynna) by the Kydoniatai (Cydonians), and the mountain Dikte (Dicte).\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 20. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Karmanor (Carmanor), who purified Apollon after he killed Pytho, was the father of Eubulos (Eubulus), and\n        that the daughter of Zeus and of Karme (Carme), the daughter of Eubulos, was Britomartis. She took delight, they\n        say, in running and in the chase, and was very dear to Artemis. Fleeing from Minos, who had fallen in love with\n        her, she threw herself into nets which had been cast (apheimena) for a draught of fishes. She was made\n        a goddess by Artemis, and she is worshipped, not only by the Kretans (Cretans) but also by the Aiginetans.\"\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 40 (trans. Celoria) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Kassiepeia (Cassiepeia), daughter of Arabios, and Phoinix (Phoenix), son of Agenor, had a daughter Karme\n        (Carme) [sister of Europa]. Zeus made love to her and fathered Britomartis who avoided the company of mankind\n        and yearned to be a virgin for always.\n        First she arrived in Argos from Phoinikia (Phoenicia), entering into the company of the daughters of Erasinos,\n        Byze, Melite, Maira (Maera), Ankhirhoe (Anchirhoe).\n        Then she went from Argos to Kephallenia (Cephallenia). The Kephallenians gave her the name of Laphria and made\n        sacrifices to her as a god.\n        Then she went to Krete (Crete). When Minos saw her he lusted after her and pursued her. She took refuge among\n        some fishermen who hid her in their nets. Because of this the Kretans call her Diktynna (Dictynna), She of the\n        Nets, and offered sacrifices to her.\n        Having escaped from Minos, Britomartis arrived at Aigina (Aegina) on a boat of the fisherman Andromedes\n        (Male-Members). But he lusted for her and laid hands on her. Britomartis jumped off the boat and fled into a\n        grove, the very spot where today there is a temple of hers. She then disappeared from sight and they call her\n        Aphaia (Aphaea), the One Who Disappeared. Her statue appeared in the temple of Artemis.
