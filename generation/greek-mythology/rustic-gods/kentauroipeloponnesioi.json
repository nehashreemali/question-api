  "content": "THE KENTAUROI PELOPONNESIOI (Peloponnesian Centaurs) were a tribe of half-man, half-horse Arkadian wildmen who\n        fought Herakles for the wine of their hospitable brother Pholos (Pholus).\n        Most of them were slain in the battle which ensued--felled by poisoned arrows. The few survivors fled south to\n        the Malean peninsular or Eleusis where they were given refuge by Poseidon.\n\nThe Peloponnesian Kentauroi appear to be distinct from the Thessalian\n          Kentauroi (Centaurs) of Magnesia in northern Greece, although classical writers often conflate their two\n        stories.\n\n[1.1] IXION & NEPHELE (as immigrant Thessalian Kentauroi)\n        [2.1] SEILENOS & MELIA (as brothers of\n        the Arkadian kentauros Pholos)\n\n[1.1] PHOLOS, EURYTION, NESSOS, ANKHIOS, AGRIOS,\n          ELATOS (Apollodorus 2.83)\n          [1.2] RHOIKOS, HYLAIOS (Apollodorus 3.106, Callimachus Hymn to Artemis)\n          [1.3] PHOLOS, DAPHNIS, ARGEIOS, AMPHION, HIPPOTION, OREIOS, ISOPLES,\n          MELANKHAITES, THEREUS, DOUPON, PHRIXOS, HOMADOS (Diodorus Siculus 4.12.3)\n          [1.4] ELAIOS, PETRAIOS, ASBOLOS (Athenian Vase Painting O12.2)\n\nCENTAURI (Kentauroi). The Erymanthian boar, which Heracles was ordered to bring alive, had descended from mount\n        Erymanthus (according to others, from mount Lampe,) into Psophis. Heracles chased him through the deep snow, and\n        having thus worn him out, he caught him in a net, and carried him to Mycenae. (Apollod. ii. 5. § 4; Diod.\n        iv. 12.) It must be observed that this and subsequent labours of Heracles are connected with other subordinate\n        ones, called Parerga, and the first of these parerga is the fight of Heracles with the Centaurs; for it is said\n        that in his pursuit of the boar he came to the centaur Pholus, who had received from Dionysus a cask of\n        excellent wine. Heracles opened it, contrary to the wish of his host, and the delicious fragrance attracted the\n        other centaurs, who besieged the grotto of Pholus. Heracles drove them away: they fled to the house of Cheiron,\n        and Heracles, eager in his pursuit, wounded Cheiron, his old friend. Heracles was deeply grieved, and tried to\n        save Cheiron; but in vain, for the wound was fatal. As, however, Cheiron was immortal, and could not die, he\n        prayed to Zeus to take away his immortality, and give it to Prometheus. Thus Cheiron was delivered of his\n        burning pain, and died. Pholus, too, was wounded by one of the arrows, which by accident fell on his foot and\n        killed him. This fight with the centaurs gave rise to the establishment of mysteries, by which Demeter intended\n        to purify the hero from the blood he had shed against his own will. (Apollod. ii. 5. § 4; Diod. iv. 14;\n        Eurip. Herc. Fur. 364, &c.; Theocrit. vii. 150; Apollon. Rhod. i. 127; Paus. viii. 24. §2; Ov.\n        Met. ix. 192.)\n\nHYLAEUS (Hulaios), that is, the woodman, the name of an Arcadian centaur, who was slain by Atalante, when, in\n        conjunction with Rhoetus, he pursued her. (Apollod. iii. 9. § 2; Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 221;\n        Aelian, V. H. xiii. 1.) According to Propertius (i. 1, 13) Hylaeus had also attacked and severely\n        wounded Meilanion, the lover of Atalante. (Comp. Ov. Ars Am. ii. 191.) According to some legends,\n        Hylaeus fell in the fight against the Lapithae, and others again said that he was one of the centaurs slain by\n        Heracles. (Virg. Georg. ii. 457; Serv. ad Aen. viii. 294; comp. Horat. Carm. ii. 12,\n        5.)\n\nRHOECUS (Rhoikos), a centaur who, conjointly with Hylaeus, pursued Atalanta in Arcadia, but was killed by her\n        with an arrow (Apollod. iii. 9. § 2; Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 221; Aelian, V. H. xiii. 1).\n        This centaur is perhaps the same as the one who is called Rhoetus by Latin poets.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 83 - 87 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"As Herakles (Heracles) was travelling through [Mount] Pholoe, he stopped with a Kentauros (Centaur) named\n        Pholos (Pholus), the son of Seilenos (Silenus) and a Melian Nymphe. To Herakles he served roasted meat, although\n        his own was raw. Herakles asked for wine, but Pholos said that he was afraid to open the cask which was owned\n        jointly be the Kentauroi (Centaurs). But Herakles told him not to worry, and opened the cask himself. Shortly\n        thereafter, picking up the smell of the wine, the Kentauroi appeared at Pholos' cave, armed with rocks and clubs\n        of silver fir. The first two who ventured in, by name Ankhios (Anchius) and Agrios (Agrius), Herakles turned\n        back with a volley of fire-brands; he sent arrows after the others and chased them as far as [the peninsular of]\n        Malea. There they took refuge with Kheiron (Chiron), who, after the Lapithai (Lapiths) had driven him from Mount\n        Pelion, settled on Malea. Herakles let loose an arrow at the Kentauroi as they huddled round Kheiron, which\n        penetrated the arm of Elatos (Elatus) and landed in Kheiron's knee. In horror Herakles ran to him, pulled out\n        the arrow and dressed the wound with a salve that Kheiron handed him. The festering wound was incurable,\n        however, and Kheiron moved into his cave, where he yearned for death, but could not die because he was immortal.\n        Prometheus thereupon proposed Herakles to Zeus, to become immortal in place of Kheiron: and so Kheiron died.\n        The remaining Kentauroi fled this way and that, some to Mount Malea [the southernmost peninsular of the\n        Peloponnese], Eurytion to Pholoe, Nessos to the Euenus (Evenus) river. The rest were taken in at Eleusis by\n        Poseidon, who hid them away on a mountain. As for Pholos, as he was pulling an arrow out of a corpse, he\n        marvelled that such a little object could destroy such enormous adversaries. Just then it slipped from his hand,\n        fell on his foot and instantly killed him. When Herakles returned to Pholoe, he found Pholos dead, so he buried\n        him and proceeded on to find the boar.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 69. 4 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The Kentauroi (Centaurs) gathered all their forces, made a campaign against the Lapithes (Lapiths) [of\n        Thessalia (Thessaly)], and slew many of them, the survivors fleeing into Mt Pholoe in Arkadia (Arcadia)and\n        ultimately escaping from there to Cape Malea, where they made their home. And the Kentauroi, elated by these\n        successes, made Mount Pholoe the base of their operations, plundering the Greeks who passed by, and slew many of\n        their neighbours.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 12. 3 : \n        \"About the time that Herakles (Heracles) was performing these Labours [i.e. his quest for the Erymanthian\n        boar in Arkadia], there was a struggle between him and the Kentauroi (Centaurs), as they are called, the reason\n        being as follows. Pholos (Pholus) was a Kentauros (Centaur), from whom the neighbouring mountain came to be\n        called Pholoe, and received Herakles with the courtesies due to a guest and opened for him a jar of wine which\n        had been buried in the earth. This jar, the writers of myths relate, had of old been left with a certain\n        Kentauros by Dionysos, who had given him orders only to open it when Herakles should come to that place.\n        And so, four generations after that time, when Herakles was being entertained as a guest, Pholos recalled the\n        orders of Dionysos.\n        Now when the jar had been opened the sweet odour of the wine, because of its great age and strength, came to the\n        Kentauroi dwelling near there, it came to pass that they were driven mad; consequently they rushed in a body to\n        the dwelling of Pholos and set about plundering him of the wine in a terrifying manner. At this Pholos hid\n        himself in fear, but Herakles, to their surprise, grappled with those who were employing violence. He had indeed\n        to struggle with beings who were gods on their mother's side, who possessed the swiftness of horses, who had the\n        strength of two bodies, and enjoyed in addition the experience and wisdom of men.\n        The Kentauroi advanced upon him, some with pine trees which they had plucked up together with the roots, others\n        with great rocks, some of with burning firebrands, and still others with axes such as are used to slaughter\n        oxen. But he withstood them without sign of fear and maintained a battle which was worthy of his former\n        exploits. The Kentauroi were aided in their struggle by Nephele (Cloud), who sent down a heavy rain, by which\n        she gave no trouble to those which had four legs, but for him who was supported upon two made the footing\n        slippery. Despite all this Herakles maintained an astonishing struggle with those who enjoyed such advantages as\n        these, slew the larger part of them, and forced the survivors to flee.\n        Of the Kentauroi which were killed the most renown were Daphnis, Argeios (Argeus), Amphion, also Hippotion,\n        Oreios (Oreus), Isoples, Melankhaites (Melanchaetes), and Thereus, Doupon, and Phrixos (Phrixus).\n        As for those who escaped the peril be flight, every one of them later received a fitting punishment: Homados,\n        for instance was killed in Arkadia (Arcadia) when he was attempting to violate Alkyone (Alcyone), the sister of\n        Eurystheus. And for this feat it came to pass that Herakles was marvelled at exceedingly; for though he had\n        private grounds for hating his enemy [Eurystheus], yet because he pitied her who was being outraged, he\n        determined to be superior to others in humanity.\n        A peculiar thing also happened in the case of him who was called Pholos, the friend of Herakles. While he was\n        burying the fallen Kentauroi, since they were his kindred, and was extracting an arrow from one of them, he was\n        wounded by a barb, and since the wound could not be healed he came to his death. Herakles gave him a magnificent\n        funeral and buried him at the foot of the mountain, which serves better than a gravestone to preserve his glory;\n        for Pholoe makes known the identity of the buried man by bearing his name and no inscription is needed. Likewise\n        Herakles unwittingly by a shot from his bow killed the Kentauros Kheiron (Centaur Chiron), who was admired for\n        his knowledge of healing. But as for the Kentauroi let what we have said suffice.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 14. 3 : \n        \"Demeter instituted the Lesser Mysteries [at Athens] in honour of Herakles, that she might purify him of\n        the guilt he had incurred in the slaughter of the Kentauroi (Centaurs).\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 8. 3. 19 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"It [the River Anigros of Elis] emits an offensive odor for a distance of twenty stadia, and makes the fish\n        unfit to eat. In the mythical accounts, however, this is attributed by some writers to the fact that certain of\n        the Kentauroi (Centaurs) here washed off the poison they got from the Hydra.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 9. 4. 8 : \n        \"Here [in Ozolian Lokris], also, is Khalkis (Chalcis) . . . Here, also, is the hill Taphiassos, on which\n        are the tombs of Nessos (Nessus) and the other Kentauroi (Centaurs), from whose putrefied bodies, they say,\n        flows forth at the base of the hill the water which is malodorous and clotted; and it is on this account, they\n        add, that the tribe is also called Ozolian [i.e. from the Greek word ozein meaning ‘to\n        smell’].\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 18. 10 - 16 (trans.

Amidst the pine-trunks stricken to death they lay still grasping those strange\n        weapons in dead hands, while some with stems long-shafted still fought on in fury, and refrained not from the\n        strife; and all their heads, gashed in the pitiless fight, were drenched with gore--the whole scene seemed to\n        live--with blood the wine was mingled: meats and bowls and tables in one ruin shattered lay.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 7. 108 ff : \n        \"When of old on Pholoe's long-ridged heights upon the Kentauroi (Centaurs) terrible Herakles rushed\n        storming in might, and slew them, passing-swift and strong and battle-cunning though they were.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Younger, Imagines 16 (trans.

Breaking fresh branches off the pines they wove them\n        together and made garlands for themselves.
