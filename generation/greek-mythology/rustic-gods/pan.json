  "content": "PAN was the god of shepherds and hunters, and of the meadows and forests of the mountain wilds. His unseen\n        presence aroused panic in those who traversed his realm.\n\nPan idled in the rugged countryside of Arkadia (Arcadia), playing his panpipes and chasing Nymphs. One of these, Pitys, fled\n        his advances and was transformed into a mountain-pine, the god's sacred tree. Another, Syrinx, escaped but was turned into a clump of reeds from which Pan\n        crafted his pipes. And a third, Ekho (Echo), was cursed to fade away for\n        spurning the god, leaving behind just a voice to repeat his mountain cries.\n\nPan was depicted as a man with the horns, legs and tail of a goat, a thick beard, snub nose and pointed ears.\n        He often appears in scenes of the company of Dionysos.\n\nIn the classical age the Greeks associated his name with the word pan meaning \"all\". However\n        its true origin lay in an old Arcadian word for rustic.\n\nPan was closely identified with several other rustic deities including Aristaios\n          (Aristaeus), the shepherd-god of northern Greece who shared the god's titles of Agreus (Hunter) and Nomios\n        (Shepherd), the pipe-playing Phrygian satyr Marsyas who challenged Apollon to\n        a musical contest, and Aigipan (Aegipan), the goat-fish god of the constellation\n        Capricorn. Sometimes Pan was multiplied into a host of Panes, or a triad of gods named\n        Agreus, Nomios, and Phorbas.\n\n[1.1] HERMES & DAUGHTER OF\n          DRYOPOS (Homeric Hymn 19 to Pan)\n        [1.2] HERMES & THYMBRIS\n        (Apollodorus 1.22-23, Scholiast ad Theocritus 1.123)\n        [1.3] HERMES & PENELOPE\n        (Herodotus 2.145, Apollodorus E7.38, Hyginus Fabulae 224, Nonnus Dionysiaca 14.67,\n          Servius ad Aeneid 2.43)\n        [1.4] HERMES (Plato Cratylus 408b, Pliny Natural\n          History 7.204) \n        [1.5] HERMES & SOSE (Nonnus Dionysiaca 14.67)\n        [1.6] HERMES & KALLISTO (Scholiast ad\n          Theocritus 1.3)\n        [1.7] HERMES & ORNEIOS (Scholiast ad\n          Theocritus 1.3)\n\n[1.1] THE PANES x12 (Dionysiaca 14.67)\n        [2.1] KROTOS (by Eupheme) (Eratosthenes, Hyginus Fabulae 224, Hyginus Astr. 2.27)\n        [3.1] AKIS (by Symaithis)\n        (Ovid Metamorphoses 13.750)\n        [4.1] EURYMEDON (Statius Thebaid 11.32)\n        [5.1] KRENAIOS (by Ismenis) (Statius\n          Thebaid 9.318)\n        [6.1] IYNX (by Ekho) (Other references)\n        [7.1] SEILENOS (by Melia) (Other references)\n\nPAN (Pan), the great god of flocks and shepherds among the Greeks; his name is probably connected with the verb\n        paô. Lat. pasco, so that his name and character are perfectly in accordance with each\n        other. Later speculations, according to which Pan is the same as to pan, or the universe, and\n        the god the symbol of the universe, cannot be taken into consideration here. He is described as a son of Hermes\n        by the daughter of Dryops (Hom. Hymn. vii. 34), by Callisto (Schol. ad Theocr. i. 3), by\n        Oeneis or Thymbris (Apollod. i. 4. § 1; Schol. ad Theocrit. l. c.), or as the son of Hermes by\n        Penelope, whom the god visited in the shape of a ram (Herod. ii. 145; Schol. ad Theocrit. i. 123 ;\n        Serv. ad Aen. ii. 43), or of Penelope by Odysseus, or by all her suitors in common. (Serv. ad Virg.\n          Georg. i. 16; Schol. ad Lycoph. 766; Schol. ad Theocrit. i. 3.) Some again call him the\n        son of Aether and Oeneis, or a Nereid, or a son of Uranus and Ge. (Schol. ad Theocrit. i. 123; Schol.\n        ad Lycoph. l. c.) From his being a grandson or great grandson of Cronos, he is called Kronios. (Eurip.\n        Rhes. 36.) He was from his birth perfectly developed, and had the same appearance as afterwards, that\n        is, he had his horns, beard, puck nose, tail, goats' feet, and was covered with hair, so that his mother ran\n        away with fear when she saw him ; but Hermes carried him into Olympus, where all (pantes) the gods were\n        delighted with him, and especially Dionysus. (Hom. Hymn. vii. 36, &c.; comp. Sil. Ital. xiii. 332;\n        Lucian, Dial. Deor. 22.) He was brought up by nymphs. (Paus. viii. 30. § 2.)\n\nThe principal seat of his worship was Arcadia and from thence his name and his worship afterwards spread over\n        other parts of Greece; and at Athens his worship was not introduced till the time of the battle of Marathon.\n        (Paus. viii. 26. § 2; Virg. Eclog. x. 26; Pind. Frag. 63, ed. Boeckh.; Herod. ii. 145.)\n        In Arcadia he was the god of forests, pastures, flocks, and shepherds, and dwelt in grottoes (Eurip.\n        Ion, 501; Ov. Met. xiv. 515), wandered on the summits of mountains and rocks, and in valleys,\n        either amusing himself with the chase, or leading the dances of the nymphs. (Aeschyl. Pers. 448; Hom.\n        Hymn. vii. 6, 13, 20 ; Paus. viii. 42. § 2.) As the god of flocks, both of wild and tame animals,\n        it was his province to increase them and guard them (Hom. Hymn. vii. 5; Paus. viii. 38. § 8; Ov.\n        Fast. ii. 271, 277 ; Virg. Eclog. i. 33); but he was also a hunter, and hunters owed their\n        success to him, who at the same time might prevent their being successful. (Hesych. s. v. Agreus.) In\n        Arcadia hunters used to scourge the statue, if they hunted in vain (Theocrit. vii. 107); during the heat of mid\n        day he used to slumber, and was very indignant when any one disturbed him. (Theocrit. i. 16.) As god of flocks,\n        bees also were under his protection, as well as the coast where fishermen carried on their pursuit. (Theocrit.\n        v. 15; Anthol. Palat. vi. 239, x. 10.) As the god of every thing connected with pastoral life, he was\n        fond of music, and the inventor of the syrinx or shepherd's flute, which he himself played in a masterly manner,\n        and in which he instructed others also, such as Daphnis. (Hom. Hymn. vii. 15 ; Theocrit. i. 3;\n        Anthol. Palat. ix. 237, x. 11; Virg. Eclog. i. 32, iv. 58; Serv. ad\n          Virg. Eclog. v. 20.) He is thus said to have loved the poet Pindar, and to have sung and danced his lyric\n        songs, in return for which Pindar erected to him a sanctuary in front of his house. (Pind. Pyth. iii.\n        139, with the Schol.; Plut. Num. 4.) Pan, like other gods who dwelt in forests, was dreaded by\n        travellers to whom he sometimes appeared, and whom he startled with a sudden awe or terror. (Eurip.\n        Rhes. 36.) Thus when Pheidippides, the Athenian, was sent to Sparta to solicit its aid against the\n        Persians, Pan accosted him, and promised to terrify the barbarians, if the Athenians would worship him. (Herod.\n        vi. 105 ; Paus. viii. 54. § 5, i. 28. § 4.) He is said to have had a terrific voice (Val. Flacc. iii.\n        31), and by it to have frightened the Titans in their fight with the gods. (Eratosth. Catast. 27.) It\n        seems that this feature, namely, his fondness of noise and riot, was the cause of his being considered as the\n        minister and companion of Cybele and Dionysus. (Val. Flacc. iii. 47; Pind. Fragm. 63, ed. Boeckh;\n        Lucian, Dial. Deor. 22.) He was at the same time believed to be possessed of prophetic powers, and to\n        have even instructed Apollo in this art. (Apollod. i. 4. § 1.) While roaming in his forests he fell in love\n        with Echo, by whom or by Peitho he became the father of Iynx. His love of Syrinx, after whom he named his flute,\n        is well known from Ovid (Met. i. 691, &c.; comp. Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. ii. 31; and about\n        his other amours see Georg. iii. 391; Macrob. Sat. v. 22). Fir-trees were sacred to him, as\n        the nymph Pitys, whom he loved, had been metamorphosed into that tree (Propert. i. 18. 20), and the sacrifices\n        offered to him consisted of cows, rams, lambs, milk, and honey. (Theocrit. v. 58; Anthol.\n          Palat. ii. 630, 697, vi. 96, 239, vii. 59.) Sacrifices were also offered to him in common with\n        Dionysus and the nymphs. (Paus. ii. 24. § 7; Anthol. Palat. vi. 154.) The various epithets which\n        are given him by the poets refer either to his singular appearance, or are derived from the names of the places\n        in which he was worshipped. Sanctuaries and temples of this god are frequently mentioned, especially in Arcadia,\n        as at Heraea, on the Nomian hill near Lycosura, on mount Parthenius (Paus. viii. 26. § 2, 38. § 8, 54.\n        § 5), at Megalopolis (viii. 30. § 2, iii. 31. § 1), near Acacesium, where a perpetual fire was\n        burning in his temple, and where at the same time there was an ancient oracle, at which the nymph Erato had been\n        his priestess (viii. 37. § 8, &c.), at Troezene (ii. 32. § 5), on the well of Eresinus, between\n        Argos and Tegea (ii. 24. § 7), at Sicyon ii. 10. § 2), at Oropus (i. 34. § 2), at Athens (i. 28.\n        § 4; Herod. vi. 105), near Marathon (i. 32. in fin.), in the island of Psyttaleia (i. 36. § 2 ;\n        Aeschyl. Pers. 448), in the Corycian grotto near mount Parnassus (x. 32. § 5), and at Homala in\n        Thessaly. (Theocrit. vii. 103.)\n\nThe Romans identified with Pan their own god Inuus, and sometimes also Faunus. Respecting the plural (Panes) or\n        beings with goat's feet, see Satyri. In works of art Pan is represented as a voluptuous and sensual being, with\n        horns, puck-nose, and goat's feet, sometimes in the act of dancing, and sometimes playing on the syrinx.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomeric Hymn 19 to Pan (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Hermes . . . came to Arkadia (Arcadia), the land of many springs and mother of flocks, there where his\n        sacred place is as god of Kyllene (Cyllene). For there, though a god, he used to tend curly-fleeced sheep in the\n        service of a mortal man, because there fell on him and waxed a strong melting desire to wed the rich-tressed\n        daughter of Dryopos (Dryops), and there he brought about the merry marriage. And in the house she bare Hermes a\n        dear son who from his birth was marvellouse to look upon, with goat's feet and two horns--a noisy,\n        merry-laughing child. But when the nurse saw his uncouth face and full beard, she was afraid and sprang up and\n        fled and left the child. Then luck-bringing Hermes received him and took him in his arms : very glad in his\n        heart was the god. And he went quickly to the abodes of the deathless gods, carrying his son wrapped in warm\n        skins of mountain hares, and set him down beside Zeus and showed him to the rest of the gods. Then all the\n        immortals were glad in heart and Bakkheios (Bacchic) Dionysos in especial; and they called the boy Pan [i.e.\n        derived from the word pantes meaning ‘all’] because he delighted all their hearts.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 22 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Apollon, learnt the mantic art from Pan, son of Zeus and Thymbris.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E7. 39 :\n        \"Some say that Penelope [the wife of Odysseus] was seduced by Antinous [one the suitors], and returned by\n        Odysseus to her father Ikarios (Icarius), and that when she reached Mantineia in Arkadia (Arcadia), she bore\n        Pan, to Hermes.\"\n        [N.B. According to other sources Pan's mother Penelope was a nymphe of the wilds, not the wife of Odysseus.]\n\nHerodotus, Histories 2. 153. 1 (trans. Godley) (Greek historian C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Among the Greeks, Herakles (Heracles), Dionysos, and Pan are held to be the youngest of the gods . . . and\n        Pan the son of Penelope, for according to the Greeks Penelope and Hermes were the parents of Pan, was [first\n        worshipped in Greece] about eight hundred years before me [Herodotus], and thus of a later date than the Trojan\n        war . . . Had Dionysos son of Semele and Pan son of Penelope appeared in Hellas and lived there to old age, like\n        Herakles the son of Amphitryon, it might have been said that they too (like Herakles) were but men, named after\n        the older Pan and Dionysos, the gods of antiquity;  but as it is . . . for Pan, the Greeks do not know what\n        became of him after his birth. It is therefore plain to me that the Greeks learned the names of these two gods\n        later than the names of all the others, and trace the birth of both to the time when they gained the\n        knowledge.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 30. 2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"They say that Pan was so surnamed [Sinoeis] after a [Arkadian (Arcadian)] Nymphe Sinoe, who with others of\n        the Nymphai (Nymphs) nursed him on her own account.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 224 (trans.

Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"Two other Panes [i.e. two aspects of the god Pan--Hunter and Shepherd], the sons of Hermes, who divided\n        his love between two Nymphai (Nymphs); for one he visited the bed of Sose, the highland prophetess, and begat a\n        son inspired with the divine voice of prophecy, Agreus (Hunter), well versed in the beast-slaying sport of the\n        hunt; the other was Nomios (Shepherd), whom the pasturing sheep loved well, one practised in the shepherd's\n        pipe, for whom Hermes sought the bed of Penelope the country Nymphe. Along with these came Phorbas to join their\n        march, savage and insatiate.\"\n        [N.B. Phorbas means \"giver of grazing\" but it is also a play on the word phobos\n        \"fear\", the aspect of Pan which inspires irrational panic.]\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 13. 750 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Acis was son of Nympha Symaethis and Faunus [Pan] was his father, a great joy to both his parents.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 11. 32 ff (trans.

Twelve horned\n        Panes there were, with this changeling shape and hornbearing head, who were begotten of the one ancestral Pan\n        their mountainranging father.\"\n\nPan was sometimes identified with the goat-fish god Aigipan (Aegipan) who assisted Zeus in his battles with the\n        monster Typhoeus.

The crags of Tmolus, steep and wide and high, gazing across the sea, at one side\n        fall to Sardis, at the other reach their end at small Hypaepae. There Pan sang his songs, flaunting among the\n        gently Nymphae (Nymphs), and played light airs upon his pipes, and dared to boast Apollo's music second to his\n        own, essaying with old Tmolus as the judge unequal contest. On his mountain top the judge was seated; from his\n        ears he freed the forest trees; only a wreath of oak fringed his green locks, with acorns dangling round his\n        hollow temples. Then, looking towards the shepherd-god, he said, ‘The judge attends.’\n        So Pan made music on his rustic reeds and with his uncouth song entranced the king. Midas by chance was there.\n        To Phoebus [Apollon] next grave Tmolus turned and, as he turned, his fringe of trees turned too. Apollo's golden\n        hair was garlanded with laurel of Parnassus; his mantle, rich with Tyrian purple, swept the ground he trod; in\n        his left had he bore his lyre, inlaid with gems and ivory; his right the plectrum held; his very pose proclaimed\n        the artist. Then with expert touch he plucked the strings and, won by strains so sweet, old Tmolus bade the reed\n        bow to the lyre. The sacred Mountain's (Mons) judgement and award pleased all who heard; yet one voice\n        challenging, crass-witted Midas' voice, called in unjust. Delius [Apollon] could not suffer ears so dull to keep\n        their human shape. He filled them with coarse grey hairs, and hinged their base to move and twitch and flop; all\n        else was man; in that one part his punishment; he wears henceforth a little ambling ass's ears.

On his back he wears a spotted lynx-pelt, and he delights in\n        high-pitched songs in a soft meadow where crocuses and sweet-smelling hyacinths bloom at random in the\n        grass.\n        They sing of the blessed gods and high Olympos (Olympus) and choose to tell of such a one as luck-brining Hermes\n        above the rest, how he is the swift messenger of all the gods, and how he came to Arkadia (Arcadia), the land of\n        many springs and mother of flocks, there where his sacred place is as god of Kyllene (Cyllene). For there,\n        though a god, he used to tend curly-fleeced sheep in the service of a mortal man, because there fell on him and\n        waxed a strong melting desire to wed the rich-tressed daughter of Dryopos (Dryops), and there he brought about\n        the merry marriage. And in the house she bare Hermes a dear son who from his birth was marvellouse to look upon,\n        with goat's feet and two horns--a noisy, merry-laughing child. But when the nurse saw his uncouth face and full\n        beard, she was afraid and sprang up and fled and left the child. Then luck-bringing Hermes received him and took\n        him in his arms: very glad in his heart was the god. And he went quickly to the abodes of the deathless gods,\n        carrying his son wrapped in warm skins of mountain hares, and set him down beside Zeus and showed him to the\n        rest of the gods. Then all the immortals were glad in heart and Bakkheios (Bacchian) Dionysos in especial; and\n        they called the boy Pan because he delighted all their hearts [i.e. because pan means \"all\"].\n        And so hail to you, lord!
