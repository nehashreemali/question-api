  "content": "MARSYAS was a Phrygian Satyr who invented the music of the flute. He found the very first flute which had been\n        crafted but cast away by the goddess Athena who had been displeased by the\n        bloating of the cheeks. Marsyas later challenged the god Apollon to a\n        musical contest but lost when the god demanded they play their instruments upside-down in the second round--a\n        feat ill-suited to the flute. As punishment for his hubris, Apollon had Marsyas tied to a tree and flayed alive.\n        The rustic gods then transformed him into a stream.\n\nThe story of Marsyas' contest with Apollon is sometimes told of the Arkadian god Pan.\n        Marsyas was also connected with the flute-playing Tityroi satyrs in the train\n        of the god Dionysos.\n\n[1] A NYMPHE (Telestes Frag 805)\n        [2] OLYMPOS (Apollodorus 1.24, Ovid Metamorphoses\n          6.382)\n        [3] OIAGROS (Hyginus Fabulae 165)\n\nMA′RSYAS (Marsuas), a mythological personage, connected with the earliest period of Greek music. He is\n        variously called the son of Hyagnis, or of Oeagrus, or of Olympus. Some make him a satyr, others a peasant. All\n        agree in placing him in Phrygia. The following is the outline of his story, according to the mythographers.\n        Athena having, while playing the flute, seen the reflection of herself in water, and observed the distortion of\n        her features, threw away the instrument in disgust. It was picked up by Marsyas, who no sooner began to blow\n        through it than the flute, having once been inspired by the breath of a goddess, emitted of its own accord the\n        most beautiful strains. Elated by his success, Marsyas was rash enough to challenge Apollo to a musical contest,\n        the conditions of which were that the victor should do what he pleased with the vanquished. The Muses, or,\n        according to others, the Nysaeans, were the umpires. Apollo played upon the cithara, and Marsyas upon the flute;\n        and it was not till the former added his voice to the music of his lyre that the contest was decided in his\n        favour. As a just punishment for the presumption of Marsyas, Apollo bound him to a tree, and flayed him alive.\n        His blood was the source of the river Marsyas, and Apollo hung up his skin in the cave out of which that river\n        flows. His flutes (for, according to some, the instrument on which he played was the double flute) were carried\n        by the river Marsyas into the Maeander, and again emerging in the Asopus, were thrown on land by it in the\n        Sicyonian territory, and were dedicated to Apollo in his temple at Sicyon. (Apollod. Bibl. i. 4. §\n        2; Palaeph. de Incredib. 48; Liban. Narrat. 14, p. 1104; Nonn. Narrat. ad Greg.\n          Invect. ii. 10, p. 164; Diod. iii. 58, 59; Paus. ii. 7. § 9; Herod. vii. 26; Xen. Anab. i.\n        2. § 8; Plut. de Fluv. 10; Hygin. Fab. 165; Ovid, Metam. vi. 382, 400.) The\n        fable evidently refers to the struggle between the citharoedic and auloedic styles of music, of which the former\n        was connected with the worship of Apollo among the Dorians, and the latter with the orgiastic rites of Cybele in\n        Phrygia. It is easy to apply this explanation to the different parts of the legend; and it may be further\n        illustrated by other traditions respecting Marsyas. He is made by some the inventor of the flute, by others of\n        the double flute. (Plut. de Mus. p. 1132, a.; Suid. s. v. ; Athen. iv. p. 184, a., xiv. p.\n        616, 617; Plin. H. N. vii. 56.) By a confusion between the mythical and the historical, the\n        flute-player Olympus is made his son, or by some his father. He is spoken of as a follower of Cybele (Diod.\n        l. c.), and he occupies, in fact, the same place in the orgiastic worship of Cybele that Seilenus does\n        in the worship of Dionysus: Pausanias (l. c.) actually calls him Seilenus, and other writers connect\n        him with Dionysus.\n\nThe story of Marsyas was often referred to by the lyric and epigrammatic poets (Bode, Gesch. d. Lyr.\n          Dichtk. vol. ii. pp. 296, 297; Brunck, Anal. vol. i. p. 488, vol. ii. p. 97), and formed a\n        favourite subject for works of art. (Müller, Archäol. d. Kunst, § 362. n. 4.) In the\n        fora of ancient cities there was frequently placed a statue of Marsyas, with one hand erect, in token, according\n        to Servius, of the freedom of the state, since Marsyas was a minister of Bacchus, the god of liberty. (Serv.\n        in Aen. iv. 528.) It seems more likely that the statue, standing in the place where justice was\n        administered, was intended to hold forth an example of the severe punishment of arrogant presumption.\n        (Böttiger, Kleine Schriften, vol. i. p. 28.) The statue of Marsyas in the forum of Rome is well\n        known by the allusions of Horace (Sat. i. 6. 120), Juvenal (Sat. ix. 1,2),and Martial (ii. 64.\n        7). This statue was the place of assembly for the courtezans of Rome, who used to crown it with chaplets of\n        flowers. (Plin. H. N. xxi. 3; Senec. de Benef. vi. 32; Lipsins, Antiq. Lect. 3.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 24 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Apollon also slew Marsyas, the son of Olympos. This fellow had come upon the flute which Athene had thrown\n        away because it made her face misshapen, and he proceeded to face Apollon in a musical contest. It was decided\n        that the winner could do whatever he wanted with the loser. During the contest Apollon played lyre in a reverse\n        position, and invited Marsyas to do the same. But Marsyas was incapable of this feat, and so Apollon won. He\n        finished off Marsyas by hanging him from a lofty pine and flaying him.\"\n\nTelestes, Fragment 805 (from Athenaeus, Scholars at Dinner) (trans. Campbell, Vol.\n          Greek Lyric V) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"I do not believe in my heart that the clever one, divine Athena took the clever instrument in the mountain\n        thickets and then in fear of eye-offending ugliness threw it from her hands to be the glory of the Nymphe-born,\n        hand-clapping beast Marsyas; for why should a keen yearning for lovely beauty distress her, to whom Klotho\n        (Clotho) had assigned a marriageless and childless virginity.\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 1. 14. 3 (trans. Godley) (Greek historian C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"For Midas too made an offering [at Delphoi (Delphi)]: namely, the royal seat on which he sat to give\n        judgment [of the contest of Apollon and Marsyas], and a marvellous seat it is.\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 2. 26. 3 : \n        \"[Across] the river Halys [into] Phrygia, they marched through that country to Kelainai (Celaenae), where\n        rises the source of the river Maiandros (Meander) and of another river no smaller, which is called Kataraktes\n        (Cataracts); it rises right in the market-place of Keleinai and issues into the Maiandros. The skin of Marsyas\n        the Silenos (Silen) also hangs there; the Phrygian story tells that it was flayed off him and hung up by\n        Apollon.\"\n\nPlato, Euthydemus 285c (trans. Lamb) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"I am ready to offer myself to be skinned . . . if my hide is not to end by being made into a\n        wine-skin, like that of Marsyas.\"\n\nPlato, Laws 677d :\n        \"One or two thousand years ago some of them [i.e. inventions] were revealed to Daidalos (Daedalus), some to\n        Orpheus, some to Palamedes, musical arts to Marsyas and Olympos, lyric to Amphion, and, in short, a vast number\n        of others to other persons.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 75. 3 (trans.

Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"And when they [the poets] bring [the Satyrs] Silenos (Silenus) and Marsyas and Olympos into one and the\n        same connection [with Rhea and Dionysos], and make them the historical inventors of flutes, they again, a second\n        time, connect the Dionysiac and the Phrygian rites.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 12. 8. 15 : \n        \"Apameia [in Phrygia] is situated near the outlets of the Marsyas River, which flows through the middle of\n        the city and has its sources in the city; it flows down to the suburbs, and then with violent and precipitate\n        current joins the Maiandros (Meander River) . . . And here is laid the scene of the myth of Olympos and of\n        Marsyas and of the contest between Marsyas and Apollon. Above is situated a lake which produces the reed that is\n        suitable for the mouth-pieces of pipes; and it is from this lake that pour the sources of both the Marsyas and\n        the Maiandros.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 24. 1 (trans.

There is a story that\n        the flutes of Marsyas are dedicated here. When the Silenos met with his disaster, the river Marsyas carried the\n        flutes to the Maiandros (Meander); reappearing in the Asopos they were cast ashore in the Sikyonian territory\n        and given to Apollon by the shepherd who found them. I found none of these offerings still in existence, for\n        they were destroyed by fire when the temple was burnt.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 22. 2 :\n        \"Sakadas (Sacadas), who was the first to play at Delphoi (Delphi) the Pythian flute-tune; the hostility of\n        Apollon to flute-players, which had lasted ever since the rivalry of Marsyas the Silenos (Silen), is supposed to\n        have stayed because of Sakadas.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 9. 1 :\n        \"The Mantineans [of Mantinea, Arkadia (Arcadia)] possess a temple . . . of Leto and her children, and their\n        images were made by Praxiteles . . .

The Phrygians in\n        Kelainai (Celaenae) hold that the river [Marsyas] passing through the city was once this great flute-player, and\n        they also hold that the Song of the Mother [Rhea-Kybele], an air for the flute, was composed by\n        Marsyas. They say too that they repelled the army of the Gauls by the aid of Marsyas, who defended them against\n        the barbarians by the water from the river and by the music of his flute.\"\n\nPlutarch, Life of Alcibiades 2. 5 (trans.

A band of Satyroi (Satyrs) gaze lovingly upon the youth.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Younger, Imagines 2 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting :] Marsyas. The Phrygian has been overcome; at any\n        rate his glance is that of a man already perished, since he knows what he is to suffer, and he realizes that he\n        has played the flute for the last time, inasmuch as inopportunely he acted with effrontery toward [Apollon] the\n        son of Leto. His flute has been thrown away, condemned never to be played again, since just now it has been\n        convicted of playing out of tune. And he stands near the pine tree from which he knows he will be suspended, he\n        himself having named this penalty for himself--to be skinned for a wine-sack. He glances furtively at the\n        barbarian yonder who is whetting the edge of the knife to be applied to him; for you see, I am sure, that the\n        man's hands are on the whetstone and the iron, but that he looks up at Marsyas with glaring eyes, his wild and\n        squalid hair all bristling. The red on his cheek betokens, I think, a man thirsty for blood, and his eyebrow\n        overhands the eye, all contracted as it faces the light and giving a certain stamp to his anger; nay, he grins,\n        too, a savage grin in anticipation of what he is about to do--I am not sure whether because he is glad or\n        because his mind swells in pride as he looks forward to the slaughter. But Apollon is painted as resting upon a\n        rock; the lyre which lies on his left arm is still being struck by his left hand in gentle fashion, as though\n        playing a tune. You see the relaxed form of the god and the smile lighting up his face; his right hand rests on\n        his lap, gently grasping the plectrum, relaxed because of his joy in the victory. Here also is the river which\n        is to change its name to that of Marsyas. And look, please, at the band of Satyroi (Satyrs), how they are\n        represented as bewailing Marsyas, but as displaying, along with their grief, their playful spirit and their\n        disposition to leap about.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 165 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Athena] threw away the pipes [she had invented] and vowed that whoever picked them up should be punished\n        severly. Marsyas, a shepherd, son of Oeagrus, one of the Satyri, found them, and by practicing assiduously kept\n        making sweeter sounds day by day, so that he challenged Apollo to play the lyre in a contest with him. When\n        Apollo came there, they took the Musae (Muses) as judges. Marsyas was departing as victor, when Apollo turned\n        his lyre upside down, and played the same tune--a thing which Marsyas couldn't do with the pipes. And so Apollo\n        defeated Marsyas, bound him to a tree, and turned him over to a Scythian who stripped his skin off him limb by\n        limb. He gave the rest of his body for burial to his pupil Olympus. From his blood the river Marsyas took its\n        name.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 191 :\n        \"Midas, Mygdonian king, son of the Mother goddess from Timolus (Tmolus) was taken as judge at the time when\n        Apollo contested with Marsyas, or Pan, on the pipes. When Timolus gave the victory to Apollo, Midas said it\n        should rather have been given to Marsyas. Then Apollo angrily said to Midas : ‘You will have ears to match\n        the mind you have in judging,’ and with these words he caused him to have ass's ears.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 6. 382 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Someone recalled the Satyrus (Satyr) who had lost to Latous [Apollon son of Leto] the contest when he\n        played Tritonia's [Athena's] pipe, and paid the penalty. ‘No! no!’ he screamed, ‘Why tear me\n        from myself? Oh, I repent! A pipe's not worth the price!’ and as he screamed Apollo stripped his skin; the\n        whole of him was one huge wound, blood streaming everywhere, sinews laid bare, veins naked, quivering and\n        pulsing. You could count his twitching guts, and the tissues as the light shone through his ribs. The\n        countryfolk, the Sylvan Deities (Numina Silvarum), the Fauni [Panes] and brother Satyri (Satyrs) and\n        the Nymphae (NYmphs), were all in tears, Olympus too, still loved, and every swain who fed his fleecy flocks and\n        long-horned cattle on those mountainsides. The fertile earth grew moist and, moistened, held their falling tears\n        and drank them deep into her veins and, changing them to water there, issued them forth into the open air; and\n        thence a river hurries to the sea through falling banks, the river Marsyas, the freshest, clearest stream of\n        Phrygia.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 6. 697 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"I [Athena] first enabled the long flute to produce notes through spaced holes in perforated boxwood.

The bank receives my cast-off on its turf. A Satyrus\n        (Satyr) [Marsyas] finds it and marvels at first, ignorant of its use. He learns that breath creates sound; and,\n        fingering the pipe, he blows and draws in air. And now boasted of his art to the Nymphae (Nymphs). He challenges\n        Phoebus [Apollon], too.
