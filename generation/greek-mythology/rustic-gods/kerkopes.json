  "content": "THE KERKOPES (Cercopes) were a pair of monkey-like thieves which plagued the land of Lydia in western Anatolia.\n        They were once captured by Herakles who was so amused with their jokes that he set them free unharmed. The pair\n        later ran afoul of the god Zeus who transformed them into monkeys, or else\n        turned them to stone, as punishment for their crimes.\n\nThe Kerkopes were sons of the Titan Okeanos (Oceanus) by Theia, a daughter of the Aithiopian (Ethiopian) king\n        Memnon.\n\nCERCO′PES (Kerkôpes), droll and thievish gnomes who play a part in the story of Heracles. Their\n        number is commonly stated to have been two, but their names are not the same in all accounts, -- either Olus and\n        Eurybatus, Sillus and Triballus, Passalus and Aclemon, Andulus and Atlantus, or Candulus and Atlas. (Suidas,\n        s. vv.; Schol. ad Lucian. Alex. 4; Tzetz. Chil. v. 75.) Diodorus (iv. 31), however,\n        speaks of a greater number of Cercopes. They are called sons of Theia, the daughter of Oceanus; they annoyed and\n        robbed Heracles in his sleep, but they were taken prisoners by him, and either given to Omphale, or killed, or\n        set free again. (Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 91.) The place in which they seem to have made their first\n        appearance, was Thermopylae (Herod. vii. 216), but the comic poem Kerkôpes, which bore the name of Homer,\n        probably placed them at Oechalia in Euboea, whereas others transferred them to Lydia (Suid. s. v.\n        Eurubatos), or the islands called Pithecusae, which derived their name from the Cercopes who were changed into\n        monkeys by Zeus for having cunningly deceived him.

Evelyn-White) (Greek epic\n          C8th to 7th B.C.) : \n        \"Kerkopes (Cercopes). These were two brothers living upon the earth who practised every kind of knavery.\n        They were called Kerkopes (Monkeys) because of their cunning doings : one of them was named Passalos (Passalus)\n        and the other Akmon (Acmon). Their mother, a daughter of Memnon, seeing their tricks, told them to keep clear of\n        Black-Bottom, that is, of Herakles. These Kerkopes were sons of Theia and Okeanos (Oceanus), and are said to\n        have been turned to stone for trying to deceive Zeus. ‘Liars and cheats, skilled in deeds irremediable,\n        accomplished knaves. Far over the world they roamed deceiving men as they wandered continually.’\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 132 (trans.

Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"[Herakles] began to mete out punishment upon the robbers who infested the land [of Lydia]. As for the\n        Kerkopes (Cercopes), for instance, as they are called, who were robbing and committing many evil acts, some of\n        them he put to death and others he took captive and delivered in chains to Omphale.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 14. 89 ff (trans.

For once the Father of the Gods (Genitor Deum) [Zeus], who loathed the fraud and\n        falsehood of the Cercopes and all their crafty crimes, transformed the men into misshapen animals that seemed\n        both like and unlike humans, shrivelling their limbs, tilting and flattening their noses, ploughing their cheeks\n        with wrinkles of old age. Then, swathed all over in a tawny pelt, he sent them to dwell here, but first removed\n        the means of speech and use of tongues designed for shocking perjury, and left them but screeches and screams\n        for protest and complaint.\"\n\nSuidas s.v.
