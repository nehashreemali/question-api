  "content": "HYLONOME was one of the Kentaurides or female centaurs. She was the only female of the centaur-tribe to attend\n        the wedding of Peirithoos (Pirithous) and Hippodameia. When her husband Kyllaros (Cyllarus) was slain in the\n        fight which ensued, she committed suicide by casting herself upon his spear. Hylonome's name means\n        \"Woodland Pasture\" from the Greek words hylê and nomos.\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 12. 210 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[During the battle between the Centaurs and Lapiths of Thessaly :] Nor did his beauty ransom [the centaur]\n        Cyllarus, fighting that day, if hybrids such as he be granted beauty. His beard was just beginning, a golden\n        beard, and golden tresses fell down on his shoulders reaching to his flanks. High-mettled grace shone in his\n        face; his neck, chest, shoulders, hands and every manly part seemed like a sculptor's much-praised masterpiece.\n        Unblemished too his equine shape, nor less fine than his man's. With horse's head and neck he's make fit mount\n        for Castor, so high stood his chest-muscles, so rideable his back. Jet black he was, the whole of him, save that\n        his tail was white and legs were milk-white too. Many a centauress would be his mate, but one had gained his\n        heart, [the female centaur] Hylonome. In the high woods there was none comelier of all the centaur-girls, and\n        she alone by love and love's sweet words and winning ways held Cyllarus, yes, and the care she took to look her\n        best (so far as that may be with limbs like that). She combed her glossy hair, and twined her curls in turn with\n        rosemary or violets or roses, and sometimes she wore a pure white lily. Twice a day she bathed her face in the\n        clear brook that fell from Pagasae's high forest, twice she plunged her body in its flow, nor would she wear on\n        her left side and shoulder any skin but what became her from best-chosen beasts. Their love was equal; on the\n        hills they roamed together, and together they would go back to their cave; and this time too they went into the\n        Lapithae's palace side by side and side by side were fighting in the fray. A javelin (no knowing from whose\n        hand) came from the left and wounded Cyllarus, landing below the place where the chest joins neck--slight wound,\n        but when the point was pulled away, cold grew his damaged heart and cold his limbs. Hylonome embraced him as he\n        died, caressed the wound and, putting lips to lips, she tried to stay his spirit as it fled. And when she saw\n        him lifeless, she moaned words that in that uproar failed to reach my ears; and fell upon the spear that pierced\n        her love, and, dying, held her husband in her arms.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
