She was a daughter of Euboulos (Eubulus),\n        demi-god of ploughing, and the mother of the huntress Britomartis by Zeus. Karme's male counterpart was her\n        grandfather Karmanor (Carmanor), a Kretan consort of the goddess Demeter.\n\nKarme's name was derived from the word karma \"cropped\" and keirô \"to\n        crop or shear.\"\n\n[1] EUBOULOS (Pausanias 2.30.3, Diodorus\n          Siculus 5.76.3)\n        [2] PHOINIX & KASSIOPEA (Antoninus Liberalis 40)\n\n[1] BRITOMARTIS (by Zeus) (Pausanias 2.30.3, Diodorus Siculus 5.76.3, Antoninus Liberalis 40)\n\nCARME (Karmê), a daughter of Eubulus, who became by Zeus the mother of Britomartis.
