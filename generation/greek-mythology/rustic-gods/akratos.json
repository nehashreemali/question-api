  "content": "AKRATOS (Acratus) was the demi-god (daimon) of the drinking of unmixed wine. The Greeks traditionally\n        drank their wine mixed with water so Akratos was no doubt regarded as a deity of festive excess.\n\nHe was an attendant of the god Dionysos and a companion of Euphrosyne (Good Cheer).\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 2. 5 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[In the shrine of Dionysos at Athens :] Here there are images of . . . Apollon . . . and Akratos\n        (Acratus), a daimon attendant upon Apollon; it is only a face of him worked into the wall.\"\n\nAthenaeus, Deipnosophistae 39c - 39d (trans. Gullick) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Polemos says that in Mounykhia (Munychia) [in Attika] honours are paid to a hero [or daimon]\n        Akratopotes (Acratopotes, Drinker of Unmixed Wine), and that among the Spartans statues of heroes [or\n        daimones] named Matton (Kneader) and Keraon (Ceraon, Mixer) have been set up by certain cooks in the\n        public mess.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Polemo Historicus 40 (Keraon and Akratopotes).\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
