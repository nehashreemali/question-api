  "content": "KYAMITES (Cyamites) was the demi-god or hero of the cultivation of beans--or, more specifically, of the broad\n        bean (species Vicia faba). He was one of the deities of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Kyamites was\n        sometimes depicted amongst the Eleusinian companions of the goddess Demeter in ancient Athenian vase-painting and sculpture.\n\nCYAMI′TES (Kuamitês), the hero of beans, a mysterious being, who had a small sanctuary on the road\n        from Athens to Eleusis. No particulars are known about him, but Pausanias (i. 37. § 3) says, that those who\n        were initiated in the mysteries or had read the so-called Orphica would understand the nature of the hero.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 37. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Beside the River Kephissos (Cephissus) near Eleusis in Attika :] On the road stands a small temple called\n        that of Kyamites (Cyamites). I cannot state for certain whether he was the first to sow beans, or whether they\n        gave this name to a hero because they may not attribute to Demeter the discovery of beans. Whoever has been\n        initiated at Eleusis or has read what are called the Orphica knows what I mean.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
