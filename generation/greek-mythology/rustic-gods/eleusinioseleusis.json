  "content": "ELEUSIS was the eponymous demi-goddess or heroine of the town of Eleusis in Attika. She was an attendant of Demeter in the Eleusinian Mysteries and mother of the agrarian demi-gods\n        Triptolemos and Eubouleus.\n\nIn the image right Eniatos (Year) stands beside the goddess Eleusis--or Demeter of Eleusis. She is seated on a\n        pair of cushions and holds a four-headed Eleusinian torch.\n\nTRIPTOLEMOS, EUBOULEOS (by Trokhilos) (Pausanias 1.14.3)\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 14. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"It is said, then, that when Demeter came to Argos she was received by Pelasgos into his home, and that\n        Khrysanthis (Chrysanthis), knowing about the rape of Kore (Core) [Persephone], related the story to her.\n        Afterwards Trokhilos (Trochilus), the priest of the mysteries, fled, they say, from Argos because of the enmity\n        of Agenor, came to Attika and married a woman of Eleusis, by whom he had two children Eubouleos (Eubuleus) and\n        Triptolemos. That is the account given by the Argives.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
