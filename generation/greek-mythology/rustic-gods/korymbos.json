  "content": "KORYMBOS (Corymbus) was the rustic demi-god (daimon) of the fruit of the ivy. His mother Mystis was a\n        nurse of the god Dionysos on the island of Euboia (Euboea) and Korymbos\n        was probably his cradle-mate.\n\nMystis \"Of the Mysteries\" personified the Bacchic Orgies and her son Korymbos the sacred ivy wreath\n        worn by the celebrants. His name was derived from the Greek word korymbos which means both\n        \"ivy-berries\" and \"top of the hill.\"\n\nKorymbos' name is similar to that of Korybas (Corybas), eponym of the shield-clashing Korybantes, who were the Euboian guardians of the infant Dionysos.\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 13. 135 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"Shield-bearing Korybantes (Corybantes) [of Euboia], guardians of Dionysos in his growing days : who in the\n        Phrygian gulf beside mountain-ranging Rheia surrounded Bakkhos (Bacchus) still a child with their drumskins.\n        They found him once, a horned baby, covered with a cloak the colour of purple wine, lying among the rocks where\n        Ino had left him in charge of Mystis the mother of Korymbos (Corymbus).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
