  "content": "KHEIRON (Chiron) was eldest and wisest of the Kentauroi (Centaurs), a\n        Thessalian tribe of half-horse men. Unlike his brethren Kheiron was an immortal son of the Titan Kronos (Cronus) and a half-brother of Zeus. When Kronos' tryst with the\n        nymphe Philyra was interrupted by Rhea, he transformed himself into a horse to escape notice and the result was\n        this two-formed son.\n\nThe rest of the Kentauroi (Centaurs) were spawned by the cloud Nephele on the slopes of Mount Pelion in Magnesia where they were\n        nursed by the daughters of Kheiron.\n\nKheiron was a renowned teacher who mentored many of the greatest heroes of myth including the Argonauts Jason\n        and Peleus, the physician Asklepios (Asclepius), the demi-god Aristaios (Aristaeus) and Akhilleus (Achilles) of Troy.\n\nThe old Kentauros was accidentally wounded by Herakles when the hero was battling other members of the tribe.\n        The wound, poisoned with Hydra-venom, was incurable, and suffering unbearable pain Kheiron voluntarily\n        relinquished his immortality. Zeus then placed him amongst the stars as the constellation Sagittarius or Centaurus.\n\nIn ancient Greek vase painting Kheiron was often depicted with a form quite distinct from that of the other\n        Kentauroi--he had the full body of a man, from head to foot, with a partial horse-body attached to his rump, and\n        was clothed in a full-length chiton and boots. This unusual form might simply reflect his appearance in Greek\n        drama where costume-limitations required a simplication of the centaurine-form. The other Kentauroi, who do not\n        appear in Athenian drama, were depicted unclothed and with fully equine forms below the waist.\n\nKheiron's name was derived from the Greek word for hand (kheir) and meant something like \"skilled\n        with the hands.\" In myth it was also closely associated with the word kheirourgos\n        \"surgeon.\"\n\n[1.1] KRONOS & PHILYRA\n        (Titanomachia Frag 6, Pindar Pythian Ode 3, Apollodorus 1.8, Apollonius Rhodius\n          2.1231, Hyginus Faulaeb 138, Hyginus Astronomica 2.38, Ovid Metamorphoses 6.126 & 7.352, Ovid Fasti 5.379,\n          Virgil Georgics 3.92 & 3.549, Pliny Natural History 7.197)\n\n[1.1] THE NYMPHAI PELIONIDES (by Khariklo) (Pindar Pythian Ode\n          5)\n        [2.1] ENDEIS (Hyginus Fabulae 14)\n        [3.1] MELANIPPE (Euripides Melanippe\n          Frag, Callimachus Frag, Hyginus Astronomica 2.18)\n        [3.2] OKYRRHOE (by Khariklo) (Ovid Metamorphoses\n          2.635)\n        [4.1] KARYSTOS (by Khariklo) (Scholiast on Pindar's Pythian\n          4.181, Eustathius on Homer 281)\n\nCHEIRON (Cheirôn), the wisest and justest of all the centaurs. (Hom. Il. xi. 831.) He was the\n        instructor of Achilles, whose father Peleus was a friend and relative of Cheiron, and received at his wedding\n        with Thetis the heavy lance which was subsequently used by Achilles. (Il. xvi. 143, xix. 390.)\n        According to Apollodorus (i. 2. § 4), Cheiron was the son of Cronus and Philyra. He lived on mount Pelion,\n        from which he, like the other centaurs, was expelled by the Lapithae; but sacrifices were offered to him there\n        by the Magnesians until a very late period, and the family of the Cheironidae in that neighbourhood, who were\n        distinguished for their knowledge of medicine, were regarded as his descendants. (Plut. Sympos. iii. 1\n        ; Müller, Orchom. p. 249.) Cheiron himself had been instructed by Apollo and Artemis, and was\n        renowned for his skill in hunting, medicine, music, gymnastics, and the art of prophecy. (Xen. Cyneg.\n        1; Philostr. Her. 9, Icon. ii. 2; Pind. Pyth. ix. 65.) All the most distinguished heroes of\n        Grecian story are, like Achilles, described as the pupils of Cheiron in these arts. His friendship with Peleus,\n        who was his grandson, is particularly celebrated. Cheiron saved him from the hands of the other centaurs, who\n        were on the point of killing him, and he also restored to him the sword which Acastus had concealed. (Apollod.\n        iii. 13. § 3, &c.) Cheiron further informed him in what manner he might gain possession of Thetis, who\n        was doomed to marry a mortal. He is also connected with the story of the Argonauts, whom he received kindly when\n        they came to his residence on their voyage, for many of the heroes were his friends and pupils. (Apollon. Rhod.\n        i. 554; Orph. Argon. 375, &c.) Heracles too was connected with him by friendship ; but one of the\n        poisoned arrows of this hero was nevertheless the cause of his death, for during his struggle with the\n        Erymanthian boar, Heracles became involved in a fight with the centaurs, who fled to Cheiron, in the\n        neighbourhood of Malea. Heracles shot at then, and one of his arrows struck Cheiron, who, although immortal,\n        would not live any longer, and gave his immortality to Prometheus. According to others, Cheiron, in looking at\n        one of the arrows, dropped it on his foot, and wounded himself. (Ovid. Fast. v. 397; Hygin. Poet.\n          Astr. ii. 38.) Zeus placed Cheiron among the stars. He had been married to Nais or Chariclo, and his\n        daughter Endeis was the mother of Peleus. (Apollod. iii. 12. § 6.) Cheiron is the noblest specimen of a\n        combination of the human and animal forms in the ancient works of art; for while the centaurs generally express\n        the sensual and savage features of a man combined with the strength and swiftness of a horse, Cheiron, who\n        possesses the latter likewise, combines with it a mild wisdom. He was represented on the Amyclaean throne of\n        Apollo, and on the chest of Cypselus. (Paus. iii. 18. § 7, v. 19. § 2.) Some representations of him\n        are still extant, in which young Achilles or Erotes are riding on his back. (Mus. Pio-Clement. i. 52.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nEumelus of Corinth or Arctinus of Miletus, Titanomachia Frag 6 (from Scholiast on\n          Apollonius Rhodius 1. 554) (trans.

But Kronos and Philyra were surprised in the very\n        act by the goddess Rhea. Whereupon Kronos leapt out of bed and galloped off in the form of a long-maned\n        stallion, while Philyra in her shame left the place, deserting her old haunts, and came to the long Pelasgian\n        ridges.

This Akhilleus, a child not yet conscious of valour, whom Kheiron still nourishes upon\n        milk and marrow and honey, he has offered to the painter as a delicate, sport-loving child and already light of\n        foot.\n        Kheiron flatters him by saying that he catches hares like a lion and vies with fawns in running; at any rate, he\n        has just caught a fawn and comes to Kheiron to claim his reward, and Kheiron, delighting to be asked, stands\n        with fore-legs bent so as to be on a level with the boy and offers him apples fair and fragrant from the fold of\n        his garment--for their very fragrance seems to be depicted--and with his hand he offers him a honeycomb dripping\n        with honey, thanks to the diligent foraging of the bees. For when bees find good meadows and become big with\n        honey, the combs get filled to overflowing and their cells pour it forth. Now Kheiron is painted in every aspect\n        like a kentauros (centaur); yet to combine a horse and human body is no wondrous deed, but to gloss over the\n        juncture and make the two into one whole and, by Zeus, cause on to end and the other to begin in such wise as to\n        elude the eye of the observer who should try to detect where the human body ends, this seems to me to demand an\n        excellent painter. That the expression seen in the eye of Kheiron is gentle is the result of his justice, but\n        the lyre also does its part, through whose music he has become cultured; but now there is also something of\n        cozening in his look, no doubt because Kheiron knows that this soothes children and nurtures them better than\n        milk.\n        This is the scene at the entrance of the cave; and the boy out on the plain, the one who is sporting on the back\n        of the kentauros (centaur) as if it were a horse, is still the same boy; for Kheiron is teaching Akhilleus to\n        ride horseback and to use him exactly as a horse, and he measures his gait to what the boy can endure, and\n        turning around he smiles at the boy when he laughs aloud with enjoyment, and all but says to him, ‘Lo, my\n        hoofs paw the ground for you without use of spur; lo, I even urge you on; the horse is indeed a spirited animal\n        and gives no ground for laughter. For although you have been taught by me thus gently the art of horsemanship,\n        divine boy, and are suited to such a horse as I, some day you shall ride on Xanthos and Balios; and you shall\n        take many cities and slay many men, you merely running and they trying to escape you.’\n        Such is Kheiron's prophecy for the boy, a prophecy fair and auspicious and quite unlike that of Xanthos.\"\n        [N.B. in the Iliad the horse Xanthos foretells Akhilleus' death.]\n\nPtolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 6 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190)\n          (trans.

Once when the Thessalian pine\n        bore hither the princes of Argo, I saw the young Alcides [Heracles] and Theseus--but I say no more.’\n        Cold pallor seized the daughter of Nereus: lo! he [Achilles] has come . . . He has stricken a lioness lately\n        delivered and had left her in the empty lair, but had brought her cubs and was making them show their claws. Yet\n        when he sees his mother on the well-known threshold, away he throws them, catches her up and binds her in his\n        longing arms, already violent in his embrace and equal to her in height. Patroclus follows him, bound to him\n        even then by a strong affection . . .\n        Straightway with rapid bound he hies him to the nearest river, and freshens in its waters his steaming face and\n        hair . . . The old man [Chiron] marvels as he adorns him, caressing how his breast, and now his strong\n        shoulders: her very joy pierces his mother's heart. Then Chiron prays her to taste the banquet and the gifts of\n        Bacchus [Dionysos], and contriving various amusements for her beguiling at last brings forth the lyre and moves\n        the care-consoling strings, and trying the chords lightly with his finger gives them to the boy. Gladly he sings\n        of the mighty causes of noble deeds . . . lastly [he sung] of his mother's marriage-feast and Pelion trodden by\n        the gods. Then Thetis relaxed her anxious countenance and smiled. Night draws them on to slumber: the huge\n        Centaurus lays him down on a stony couch, and Achilles lovingly twines his arms about his shoulders--though his\n        faithful parent is there--and prefers the wonted breast.\n        But Thetis, standing by night upon the sea-echoing rocks, this way and that divides her purpose, and ponders in\n        what hiding-place she will set her son, in what country she shall choose to conceal him . . . Then in her own\n        arms she carries Achilles [to the island of Skyros], his body utterly relaxed in the boy's slumber, from the\n        rocks of the Haemonian cave down to the placid waters and the beach . . . Chiron escorts the goddess, and\n        careless of the sea entreats her speedy return, and hides his moistened eyes and high upon his horse's body\n        gazes out towards them as suddenly they are whirled away, and now--and now are lost to view, where for a short\n        while the foamy marks of their going gleam white and the wake dies away into the watery main. Him destined never\n        more to return to Thessalian Tempe now mournful Pholoe bewails, now cloudy Othrys, and Spercheos with diminished\n        flood and the silent grotto of the sage.\"\n\nStatius, Achilleid 1. 478 ff :\n        \"Whom else [but Akhilleus (Achilles)] did the Centaurus [Kheiron (Chiron)] take in hand and shape his rude\n        beginnings and tender years?\"\n\nStatius, Achilleid 2. 96 ff :\n        \"[The young Akhilleus (Achilles) addresses Odysseus after his discovery on the island of Skyros (Scyrus) :]\n        Even in my years of crawling infancy, when the Thessalian sage [Kheiron (Chiron)] received me on his stark\n        mountain-side, I am said to have devoured no wonted food, nor to have sated my hunger at the nourishing breast,\n        but to have gnawed the tough entrails of lions and the bowels of a half-slain she-wolf. That was my first bread,\n        that the bounty of joyous Bacchus [Dionysos, i.e. wine], in such wise did that father of mine [Kheiron (Chiron)]\n        feed me. Then he taught me to go with him through pathless deserts, dragging me on with mighty stride, and to\n        laugh at sight of the wild beasts, nor tremble at the shattering of rocks by rushing torrents or at the silence\n        of the lonely forest. Already at that time weapons were in my hand and quivers on my shoulders, the love of\n        steel grew apace within me, and my skin was hardened by much sun and frost; nor were my limbs weakened by soft\n        couches, but I shared the hard rock with my master's mighty frame.\n        Scarce had my youth turned the wheel of twice six years, when already he made me outpace the swift hinds and\n        Lapith steeds and running overtake the flung dart; often Chiron himself, while yet he was swift of foot, chased\n        me at full gallop with headlong speed o'er the plains, and when I was exhausted by roaming over the meads he\n        praised me joyously and hoisted me upon his back. Often too in the first freezing of the streams he would bid me\n        go upon them with light step nor break the ice. These were my boyhood's glories . . .\n        Never would he suffer me to follow unwarlike does through the pathless glens of Ossa, or lay low timid lynxes\n        with my spear, but only to drive angry bears from their resting-places, and boars with lightning thrust; or if\n        anywhere a mighty tiger lurked or a lioness with her cubs in some secret lair upon the mountain-side, he\n        himself, seated in his vast cave, awaited my exploits, if perchance I should return bespattered with dark blood;\n        nor did he admit me to his embrace before he had scanned my weapons. And already I was being prepared for the\n        armed tumults of neighbouring folk, and no fashion of savage warfare passed me by . . .\n        Scarce could I recount all my doings, successful though they were; now he instructs me to climb and grasp the\n        airy mountain-peak, with what stride to run upon the level, how to catch flung stones in mimic battle on my\n        shielded arm, to pass through burning houses, and to check flying four-horse teams on foot. Spercheus, I\n        remember, was flowing with rapid current, fed full with constant rains and melted snows and carrying on its\n        flood boulders and living trees, when the sent me in, there where the waves rolled fiercest, and bade me stand\n        against them and hurl back the swelling billows that he himself could scarce have borne, though he stood to face\n        them with so many a limb. I stove to stand, but the violence of the stream and the dizzy panic of the broad\n        spate forced me to give ground; he loomed o'er me from above and fiercely threatened, and flung taunts to shame\n        me. Nor did I depart till he gave me word, so far did the lofty love of fame constrain me, and my toils were not\n        too hard with such a witness.\n        For to fling the Oebalian quoit far out of sight into the clouds, or to practise the holds of the\n        sleek-wrestling bout, and to scatter blows with the boxing-gloves were sport and rest to me: nor laboured I more\n        therein that when I struck with my quill the sounding strings, or told the wondrous fame of heroes of old. Also\n        did he teach me of juices and the grasses that succour disease, what remedy will staunch to fast a flow of\n        blood, what will lull to sleep, what will close gaping wounds; what plague should be checked with a knife, what\n        will yield to herbs; and he implanted deep within my heart the precepts of divine justice, whereby he was wont\n        to give revered laws to the tribes that dwell on Pelion, and tame his own twy-formed folk [the Kentauroi\n        (Centaurs)].
