  "content": "ITHAX or ITHAS was the messenger of the Titan-gods. He played a role in the old\n        Titanomachia epic attributed to Eumelos but is otherwise unknown.\n\nHesychius suggests he is Prometheus. However this may simply be based on an\n        erroneous etymology linkin ithas with the -etheus portion of the Titan's name. Another writer,\n        Ptolemy Hephaestion, names Arke as the messenger of the Titanes. It is quite\n        possible that her name was derived from an epithet belonging to Ithax, since arkê (the swift) is\n        an appropriate Homeric title for a messenger.\n\nEumelus, Fragment 5 (from Hesychius Lexicon i387) (trans. West, Vol. Greek Epic\n          Fragments) (C7th B.C.) : \n        \"Ithas : The Titanes' herald, Prometheus. Some write Ithax.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
