  "content": "ASTRAIA (Astraea) was the virgin-goddess of justice. During the Golden Age she dwelt upon the earth with\n        mankind but was driven away by the increasing lawlessness of the subsequent Bronze Age. Zeus then set her\n        amongst the stars as the constellation Virgo.\n\nAstraia was closely identified with the goddesses Dike (Justice) and Nemesis (Rightful Indignation).\n\nImage T32.1 (right) : A figure labelled Astrape \"Lightning\" stands beside the throne of Zeus. She is\n        surely the goddess Astraia for she has all the accoutrements of a star-goddess--wings, shining aureole and a\n        flaming torch. The star-god Eosphoros was depicted in a similar fashion. As the goddess of justice she carries\n        the thunderbolt of Zeus--the implement of divine justice.\n\n[1.1] ASTRAIOS (Aratus Phaenomena 96)\n        [1.2] ASTRAIOS & EOS (Hyginus Astronomica 2.25)\n        [2.1] ZEUS & THEMIS (Astraia as Dike)\n        (Hyginus Astronomica 2.25)\n\nASTRAEA (Astraia), a daughter of Zeus and Themis, or according to others, of Astraeus by Eos. During the golden\n        age, this star-bright maiden lived on earth and among men, whom she blessed ; but when that age had passed away,\n        Astraea, who tarried longest among men, withdrew, and was placed among the stars. (Hygin. Poet. Astr.\n        ii. 25 ; Eratost. Catast. 9; Ov. Met. i. 149.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Works and Days 172 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or 7th B.C.)\n          :\n        [N.B. In the following passage Nemesis withdraws from earth in response to the growing corruption of mankind. In\n        Aratus and Ovid, see below, it is Astraia who departs.] \n        \"Would that I were not among the men of the fifth age [i.e. the current era which was the fifth age of\n        mankind], but either had died before or been born afterwards. For now truly is a race of iron, and men never\n        rest from labour and sorrow by day . . .\n        [And they will deteriorate even further over time so that :] Strength will be right and reverence will cease to\n        be; and the wicked will hurt\n        the worthy man, speaking false words against him, and will swear an oath upon\n        them. Zelos (Envy), foul-mouthed, delighting in evil, with scowling face, will go along with wretched men one\n        and all. And Nemesis (Just Retribution) and Aidos (Respect), shrouding their bright forms in pale mantles, shall\n        go from the wide-wayed earth back to Olympos, forsaking the whole race of mortal men, and all that will be left\n        by them to mankind will be wretched pain. And there shall be no defence against evil.\"\n\nAratus, Phaenomena 96 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek astronomical poem C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The [Constellation] Maiden (Parthenon), who in her hands bears the gleaming Ear of Corn. Whether she be\n        daughter of Astraios (Astraeus) [i.e. Astraia], who, men say, was of old the father of the Astron (Stars), or\n        child of other sire, untroubled be her course! But another tale is current among me, how of old she dwelt on\n        earth and met men face to face, nor ever disdained in olden times the tribes of men and women, but mingling with\n        them took her seat, immortal though she was. Her men called Dike (Justice); but she assembling the elders, it\n        might be in the market-place or in the wide-wayed streets, uttered her voice, ever urging on them judgements\n        kinder to the people. Not yet in that age had men knowledge of hateful strife, or carping contention, or din of\n        battle, but a simple life they lived. Far from them was the cruel sea and not yet from afar did ships bring\n        their livelihood, but the oxen and the plough and Dike herself, queen of the peoples, giver of things just,\n        abundantly supplied their every need. Even so long as the earth still nurtured the Golden Race, she had her\n        dwelling on earth. But with the Silver Race only a little and no longer with utter readiness did she mingle, for\n        that she yearned for the ways of the men of old. Yet in that Silver Age was she still upon the earth; but from\n        the echoing hills at eventide she came along, nor spake to any man in gentle words. But when she had filled the\n        great heights with gathering crowds, then would she with threats rebuke their evil ways, and declare that never\n        more at their prayer would she reveal her face to man. ‘Behold what manner of race the fathers of the\n        Golden Age left behind them! Far meaner than themselves! But ye will breed a viler progeny! Verily wars and\n        cruel bloodshed shall be unto men and grievous woe shall be laid upon them.’ Even so she spake and sought\n        the hills and left the people all gazing towards her still. But when they, too, were dead, and when, more\n        ruinous than they which went before, the Race of Bronze was born, who were the first to forge the sword of the\n        highwayman, and the first to eat of the flesh of the ploughing-ox, then verily did Dike (Justice) loathe that\n        race of men and fly heavenward and took up that abode, where even now in the night time the Maiden is seen of\n        men.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 25 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Constellation] Virgo. Hesiod calls her the daughter of Jove [Zeus] and Themis. Aratus says that she is\n        thought to be daughter of Astraeus and Aurora [Eos], who lived at the time of the Golden Age of men and was\n        their leader. On account of her carefulness and fairness she was called Justice [Dike], and at that time no\n        foreign nations were attacked in war, nor did anyone sail over the seas, but they were wont to live thier lives\n        caring for their fields. But those born after their death began to be less observant of duty and more greedy, so\n        that Justitia (Justice) [Dike] associated more rarely with men. Finally the disease became so extreme that it\n        was said the Brazen Race was born; then she could not endure more, and flew away to the stars.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 1. 148 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Last [of the Ages of Men] came the Race of Iron (Proles Ferro). In that hard age of baser vein\n        all evil straight broke out, and honour fled and truth and loyalty, replaced by fraud, deceit and treachery and\n        violence and wicked greed for gain . . . Honour and love lay vanquished, Astraea, virgin divine, the last of the\n        immortals, fled away.\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 2. 356 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The setting of the Pleiades in November marks the start of the stormy season :] At no other season of the\n        year does fiercer fear sway men's hearts; for then does Astraea [as the constellation Virgo] urge her plea, then\n        does she implore Jove's [Zeus'] anger against the nations, and leaving the earth importunes Saturnus' star with\n        her complaints. Then follows the darkling Eurus (East Wind), and with his brethren thunders upon the Aegean\n        main, and all the sea strains shoreward.\"\n\nStatius, Silvae 1. 4. 2 (trans. Mozley) (Roman poetry C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Kindly Astraea hath regard for pious folk, and comes back reconciled with Jove [Zeus].\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 41. 212 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"Virgin Astraia (Astraea), nurse of the whole universe, cherisher of the Golden Age, received Beroe [i.e.\n        the goddess of the city of Beruit, which was famous for its law-courts] from her mother [Aphrodite] into the\n        embrace of her arms, laughing, still a babe, and fed her with wise breast as she babbled words of law. With her\n        virgin milk, she let streams of statutes gush into the baby's lips, and dropt into the girl's mouth the sweet\n        produce of the Attic bee; she pressed the bee's riddled travail of many cells, and mixed the voiceful comb in a\n        sapient cup. If the girl thirsting asked for a drink, she gave the speaking Pythian water kept for Apollon, or\n        the stream of Ilissos, which is inspired by the Attic Mousa (Muse) when the Pierian breezes of Phoibos (Phoebus)\n        beat on the bank. She took the golden Cornstalk [i.e. the star Spica which Virgo holds in her hand] from the\n        stars, and entwined it in a cluster to put round the girl's neck like a necklace.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 41. 263 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"[Aphrodite addresses her daughter Harmonia :] ‘[Zeus] promised . . . that he would commit the\n        precepts of Justice (Dike) to one of the cities allotted to me. I wish to learn whether the gift is reserved for\n        land of Kypros (Cyprus) or Paphos or Korinthos (Corinth) or Sparta . . . or the noblemen's country of my own\n        daughter Beroe. Have a care then for Justice (Dike), and grant harmony to the world, you who are Harmonia, the\n        saviour of life! For I was sent here in haste by the Virgin of the Stars [Astraia (Astraea)] herself, the nurse\n        of law-abiding men; and what is more, law-loving Hermes has passed on this honour to me, that I alone be\n        enforcing the laws of marriage may preserve the men whom I have sown.’\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
