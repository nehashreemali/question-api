  "content": "TETHYS was the Titan goddess of the primal font of fresh water which nourishes the earth. She was the wife of\n        Okeanos (Oceanus), the earth-encircling, fresh-water stream, and the mother of\n        the Potamoi (Rivers), the Okeanides\n        (Oceanids) (nymphs of springs, streams and fountains), and the Nephelai\n        (Clouds). Tethys, daughter of Gaia (Earth), fed her children's springs with the waters of Okeanos drawn through\n        subterranean acquifers. Her name was derived from the Greek word têthê meaning\n        \"nurse\" or \"grandmother\".\n\nIn Greek vase painting Tethys appears as an unremarkable woman accompanied by Eileithyia, goddess of childbirth, and her fish-tailed husband Okeanos.\n        In mosaic art she was depicted with a small pair of wings on her brow which probably signified her role of\n        mother of rain-couds.\n\nTethys was perhaps identified with the Titanis Eurynome, one-time Queen of\n        Heaven, who was cast into the Ocean-stream along with her husband Ophion by Kronos (Cronus). She was probably also connected with the Protogenos Thesis\n        (Mother Creation) who appears in the Orphic cosmogony. Tethys was described by late classical poets as the sea\n        personified and was equated with Thalassa.\n\n[1.1] OURANOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 136, Apollodorus 1.2, Diodorus Siculus 5.66.1)\n\n[1.1] THE OKEANIDES, THE POTAMOI\n        (by Okeanos) (Hesiod Theogony 337, Aeschylus Prometheus\n          Bound 136, Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.2] THE OKEANIDES (by Okeanos) (Apollodorus 1.8, Calimachus Hymns 3.40, Nonnus Dionysiaca 38.108)\n        [1.3] THE POTAMOI (by Okeanos) (Aeschylus Seven 304, Diodorus Siculus 4.69.1, Hyginus Preface, Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          23.280)\n        [2.1] THE NEPHELAI (Orphic Hymn 22)\n\nTETHYS (Têthus), a daughter of Uranus and Gaea, and wife of Oceanus, by whom she was con ceived to be the\n        mother of the Oceanides and the numerous river-gods.

Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Omnipotens (the Almighty) [Zeus] swept away both son [Arkas (Arcas)] and mother [Kallisto (Callisto), a\n        love of Zeus] ... whirled in a wind together through the void, and set them in the sky as neighbouring stars\n        [Ursa Major and Ursa Minor]. Juno [Hera], in fury when that concubine shone midst the stars, descended to the\n        sea, to Tethys and old Oceanus, whom the gods greatly revere, and to their questioning replied: ‘You ask\n        why I, Regina Deorum (Queen of the Gods), come hither from the mansions of the sky? I am dethroned; another\n        reigns; my words are false unless, when night darkens the world, you see, new-honoured in heaven to injure me,\n        twin constellations at the utmost pole, where earth in last and shortest circle turns. Who now would hesitate to\n        insult Juno [Hera]? ... She whom I forbade to be a woman [by transforming her into a bear], made a goddess! Thus\n        the guilty pay! So great my sovereignty! ... But you who reared me, if your hearts are touched by my disgrace,\n        debar from your green deeps that sevenfold star that at the price of shame was set in heaven, nor let that\n        prostitute your waters' pure integrity pollute.’ The Sea-Gods (Di Mari) gave assent, and Saturnia\n        [Hera] departed heavenwards through the cloudless air with her light chariot.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 2. 189 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Kallisto (Callisto), the love of Zeus, and their son Arkas (Arcas) :] glitter as adjacent stars : the one\n        called Arctos (Ursa Major) leads; Arctophylax seems to follow behind. Saturnia [Hera] still fumes and asks white\n        Tethys's waters, not to bathe or touch Maenalian Arctos.\"\n\nTethys was sometimes described as a personification of the sea and identified with Thalassa and Amphitrite.\n\nHomeric Hymn 3 to Delian Apollo 89 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th\n          B.C.) :\n        \"Leto [on the island of Delos] was racked nine days and nine nights with pangs beyond wont. And there were\n        with her all the chiefest of the goddesses, Dione and Rheia and Ikhnaie (Ichnaie) and Themis and loud-moaning\n        Amphitrite and the other deathless goddesses. Then the child leaped forth to the light, and all the goddesses\n        raised a cry. Straightway, great Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon], the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with\n        sweet water, and swathed you in a white garment of fine texture, new-woven, and fastened a golden band about\n        you.\"\n        [N.B. The \"chiefest of the goddesses\" are the Titanides (TItanesses). Amphitrite stands in place of\n        Tethys, Dione is equivalent to Phoibe, and Ikhnaie \"the tracing goddess\" is Theia.]\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 4 to Delos 15 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"But none need grudge that she [the island Delos] be named among the first, whensoever unto Okeanos\n        (Oceanus) and unto Titanide (Titaness) Tethys the islands gather and she ever leads the way. Behind her\n        footsteps follow Phoinikian Kyrnos (Phoenicians Cyrnus), no mean isle, and Abantian Makris (Macris) of the\n        Ellopians, and delectable Sardo, and the isle whereto Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite] first swam from the water\n        [Kypros (Cyprus)] and which for fee of her landing she keeps safe.\"\n\nLycophron, Alexandra 229 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"The hoary Titanide (Titaness) bride [Tethys] of Ogenos [Okeanos (Oceanus)] seething with the corded\n        gulls.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 22 to Thalassa (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"To Thalassa (Sea), Fumigation from Frankincense and Manna. Tethys [here equated with Thalassa] I call,\n        with eyes cerulean bright, hid in a veil obscure from human sight: great Okeanos' empress, wandering through the\n        deep, and pleased, with gentle gales, the earth to sweep; whose ample waves in swift succession go, and lash the\n        rocky shore with endless flow: delighting in the sea serene to play, in ships exulting, and the watery way.\n        Mother of Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite], and of Nephelai (Nephelae, Clouds) obscure, great nurse of beasts, and\n        source of fountains pure. O venerable Goddess, hear my prayer, and make benevolent my life thy care; send,\n        blessed queen, to ships a prosperous breeze, and waft them safely over the stormy seas.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 13. 949 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"I [Glaukos (Glaucus)] was once a mortal . . . [but after eating a magical herb he was transformed into a\n        sea-god.] The Sea-Gods (Di Maris) welcomed me to join their company (so well was I esteemed) and called\n        on Tethys and Oceanus to take away my mortal essences. They purified me with a ninefold chant that purges my\n        sins; then bade me plunge my body beneath a hundred rivers. Instantly torrents cascaded down from near and far\n        and poured whole seas of waters on my head. So far I can relate what I recall, so far remember; but the rest is\n        lost. When sense returned, I found myself in body another self, nor was my mind the same. For the first time I\n        saw this bronze-green beard, these flowing locks that sweep along the swell, these huge broad shoulders and my\n        sea-blue arms, my legs that curve to form a fishes tail.\"\n\nVirgil, Georgics 1. 29 ff (trans. Fairclough) (Roman bucolic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"You [Caesar praised as Poseidon] come as god of the boundless sea and sailors worship your deity alone,\n        while farthest Thule owns your lordship and Tethys with the dowry of all her waves buys you to wed her daughter\n        [Amphitrite the Sea].\"\n\nSeneca, Medea 375 ff (trans. Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) : \n        \"Any little craft now wanders at will upon the deep. All bounds have been removed . . . There will come an\n        age in the far-off years when Oceanus shall unloose the bonds of things, when the whole broad earth shall be\n        revealed, when Tethys shall disclose new worlds and Thule [mythical northern land] not be the limit of the\n        lands.\"\n\nSeneca, Troades 878 ff : \n        \"[Helene speaks of Polyxena's marriage to the ghost of Akhilleus (Achilles), son of the sea-goddess Thetis\n        :] Thee will great Tethys call her own, thee, all the goddesses of the deep [the Nereides], and Thetis, calm\n        deity of the swelling sea; wedded to Pyrrhus.\"\n\nStatius, Achilleid 1. 221 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Her [Thetis'] team of dolphins twain, which Tethys, mighty queen, had nourished for her in an echoing vale\n        beneath the sea.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 11. 173 ff (trans.

In pity as he\n        fell Tethys received him gently, and as he swam clothed him with feathers; thus the golden chance of death so\n        much desired was never given. The lover, outraged to be forced to live against his will, to find his soul that\n        longed to leave its lamentable home restrained, with new wings on his shoulders flew aloft and once more\n        launched himself into the waves. His feathers broker his fall. In fury then poor Aesacus dived down into the\n        deep trying endlessly to take the road to death. Love made him leans; his jointed legs are long, and long his\n        neck, and long his head extends. He loves the sea; that name of his he keeps, a diver, for he dives into its\n        deep.\" [N.B. aisakos, is the Greek name for the diver-bird.]\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Plato Timaeus 40e.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
