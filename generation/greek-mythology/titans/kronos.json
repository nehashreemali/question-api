  "content": "KRONOS (Cronus) was the King of the Titanes and the god of time, in particular time when viewed as a\n        destructive, all-devouring force.\n\nHe ruled the cosmos during the Golden Age after castrating and deposing his father Ouranos (Uranus, Sky).\n        In fear of a prophecy that he would in turn be overthrown by his own son, Kronos swallowed each of his children\n        as they were born. Rhea managed to save the youngest, Zeus, by hiding him away on\n        the island of Krete (Crete), and fed Kronos a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. The god grew up, forced Kronos\n        to disgorge his swallowed offspring, and led the Olympians in a ten year war against the Titanes (Titans),\n        driving them in defeat into the pit of Tartaros (Tartarus).\n\nMany human generations later, Zeus released Kronos and his brothers from their prison, and made the old Titan\n        king of the Elysian Islands, home of the blessed dead.\n\nKronos was essentially the same as Khronos (Chronos), the primordial\n        god of time in the Orphic Theogonies.\n\n[1.1] OURANOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 116, Aeschylus Prometheus 200, Simonides Frag 511, Apollodorus 1.1,\n          Diodorus Siculus 5.65.1, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n        [1.2] AITHER (or OURANOS) &\n        GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] HESTIA, DEMETER, HERA, HAIDES, POSEIDON, ZEUS (by Rhea) (Homer Iliad 15.187, Hesiod Theogony 453,\n          Apollodorus 1.4, Diodorus Siculus 5.68.1, et al)\n        [2.1] KHEIRON (by Philyre) (Eumelus Titanomachia Frag 6,\n          Apollodorus 1.8, Apollonius Rhodius 2.1231, Hyginus Fabulae 13, Ovid Metamorphoses 6.126 & 7.352, Virgil\n          Georgics 3.92 & 3.549, Pliny Natural History 7.197)\n        [2.2] APHROS (by Philyre) (Suidas s.v.

He was married to Rhea, by whom he\n        became the father of Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. Cheiron is also called a son of Cronus.\n        (Hesiod. Theog. 137, 452, &c.; Apollod. i. 1. § 3, &c.) At the instigation of his mother,\n        Cronus unmanned his father for having thrown the Cyclopes, who were likewise his children by Ge, into Tartarus.\n        Out of the blood thus shed sprang up the Erinnyes. When the Cyclopes were delivered from Tartarus, the\n        government of the world was taken from Uranus and given to Cronus, who in his turn lost it through Zeus, as was\n        predicted to him by Ge and Uranus. [Zeus.] The Romans identified their Saturnus with the Cronus of the Greeks.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 126 ff (trans.

After them was born Kronos (Cronus) the wily, youngest and most terrible of\n        her children, and he hated his lusty sire. And again, she bare the Kyklopes (Cyclopes), overbearing in spirit,\n        Brontes, and Steropes and stubborn-hearted Arges.\n        And again, three other sons [the Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires)] were born of Gaia and Ouranos, great and\n        doughty beyond telling, Kottos (Cottus) and Briareos (Briareus) and Gyes. From their shoulders sprang a hundred\n        arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible\n        was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms. For of all the children that were born of Gaia and\n        Ouranos, these were the most terrible, and they were hated by their own father from the first. And he used to\n        hide them all away in a secret place of Gaia so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into\n        the light: and Ouranos rejoiced in his evil doing.And he [Ouranos] used to hide them all [the Hekatonkheires]\n        away in a secret place of Gaia (Earth) so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the\n        light : and Ouranos (Sky) rejoiced in his evil doing.\n        But vast Gaia (Earth) groaned within, being straitened, and she made the element of grey flint and shaped a\n        great sickle, and told her plan to her dear sons. And she spoke, cheering them, while she was vexed in her dear\n        heart : ‘My children, gotten of a sinful father, if you will obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of\n        your father; for he first thought of doing shameful things.’\n        So she said; but fear seized them all, and none of them uttered a word. But great Kronos (Cronus) the wily took\n        courage and answered his dear mother : ‘Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence not our\n        father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful things.’\n        So he said : and vast Gaia (Earth) rejoiced greatly in spirit, and set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his\n        hands a jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot.\n        And Ouranos (Sky) came, bringing on night and longing for love, and he lay about Gaia (Earth) spreading himself\n        full upon her. Then the son from his ambush stretched forth his left hand and in his right took the great long\n        sickle with jagged teeth, and swiftly lopped off his own father's members and cast them away to fall behind him.\n        And not vainly did they fall from his hand; for all the bloody drops that gushed forth Gaia (Earth) received,\n        and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great Gigantes (Giants) [perhaps the Kouretes\n        (Curetes)] with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphai (Nymphs) whom they call\n        Meliai (Meliae) all over the boundless earth. And so soon as he had cut off the members with flint and cast them\n        from the land into the surging sea, they were swept away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread\n        around them from the immortal flesh, and in it there grew a maiden [Aphrodite] . . .\n        But these sons whom be begot himself great Ouranos (Sky) used to call Titanes (Titans, Strainers) in reproach,\n        for he said that they strained and did presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come\n        afterwards.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 20 ff :\n        \"Kronos (Cronus) the crafty counsellor.\"\n\nPlato, Euthyphro 5e (trans.

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) was the first to rule over the entire world. He married Ge (Earth) and sired first\n        the Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires), who were names Briareos (Briareus), Gyes and Kottos (Cottus). They were\n        unsurpassed in both size and power, and each had a hundred hands and fifty heads. After these he sired the\n        Kyklopes (Cyclopes), by name Arges, Steropes, and Brontes, each of whom had one eye in his forehead. But Ouranos\n        (Sky) bound these and threw them into Tartaros (Tartarus) (a place in Haides' realm as dark as Erebos (Erebus),\n        and as far away from the earth as the earth is from the sky), and fathered other sons on Ge, namely the Titanes\n        (Titans) : Okeanos (Oceanus), Koios (Coeus), Hyperion, Kreios (Crius), Iapetos (Iapetus), and Kronos (Cronus)\n        the youngest; also daughters called Titanides : Tethys, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoibe (Phoebe), Dione,\n        Theia.\n        Now Ge (Earth), distressed by the loss of her children into Tartaros, persuaded the Titanes to attack their\n        father, and she gave Kronos a sickle made of adamant. So all of them except Okeanos set upon Ouranos (Sky), and\n        Kronos cut off his genitals, tossing them into the sea. (From the drops of the flowing blood Erinyes were born,\n        named Alekto (Alecto), Tisiphone, Megaira (Megaera).)

Well, then, tradition tells us how blissful was the life of\n        men in that age, furnished with everything in abundance, and of spontaneous growth. And the cause thereof is\n        said to have been this : Kronos (Cronus) was aware of the fact that no human being is capable of having\n        irresponsible control of all human affairs without becoming filled with pride and injustice; so, pondering this\n        fact, he then appointed as kings and rulers for our cities, not men, but beings of a race that was nobler and\n        more divine, namely, Daimones (Spirits). He acted just as we now do in the case of sheep and herds of tame\n        animals: we do not set oxen as rulers over oxen, or goats over goats, but we, who are of a nobler race,\n        ourselves rule over them. In like manner the god, in his love for humanity, set over us at that time the nobler\n        race of Daimones who, with much comfort to themselves and much to us, took charge of us and furnished peace and\n        modesty and orderliness and justice without stint, and thus made the tribes of men free from feud and happy. And\n        even today this tale has a truth to tell, namely, that wherever a State has a mortal, and no god, for ruler,\n        there the people have no rest from ills and toils; and it deems that we ought by every means to imitate the life\n        of the age of Kronos, as tradition paints it.\" [Cf.

So there were no states or families, but they had fruits in plenty\n        from the trees and other plants, which the earth furnished them of its own accord, without help from\n        agriculture.

Among all he met he introduced justice and\n        sincerity of the soul, and this is why the tradition has come down to later generations that he men of Kronos'\n        time were good-hearted, altogether guileless, and blest with felicity. His kingdom was strongest in the western\n        regions, where indeed he enjoyed his greatest honour; consequently, down even to comparatively recent times,\n        among the Romans [called by them Saturnus] and the Carthaginians [elsewhere the author mentions elsewhere that\n        the Carthaginians sacrificed children to the god], while their city still stood, and other neighbouring peoples,\n        notable festivals and sacrifices were celebrated in honour of this god and many places bore his name. And\n        because of the exceptional obedience to laws no injustice was committed by any one at nay time and all the\n        subjects of the rule of Kronos lived a life of blessedness, in the unhindered enjoyment of every pleasure. To\n        this the poet Hesiod also bears witness in the following words : ‘And they who were Kronos' day, what time\n        he reigned in heaven, lived like gods, no care in heart, remote and free from ills and toils severe, from\n        grievous sicknesses and cares; old age lay not upon their limbs, but they, equal in strength of leg and arm,\n        enjoyed endless delight of feasting far from ills, and when death came, they sank in it as in a sleep.

The Latin\n        designation ‘Saturnus’ on the other hand is due to the fact that he is ‘saturated’ or\n        ‘satiated with years’ (anni); the fable is that he was in the habit of devouring his\n        sons--meaning that Time devours the ages and gorges himself insatiably with the years that are past.

His kingdom was\n        strongest in the western regions, where indeed he enjoyed his greatest honour; consequently, down even to\n        comparatively recent times, among the Romans [called by them Saturnus] and the Carthaginians [elsewhere the\n        author mentions the Carthaginian sacrifice of children to the god], while their city still stood, and other\n        neighbouring peoples, notable festivals and sacrifices were celebrated in honour of this god and many places\n        bore his name. And because of the exceptional obedience to laws no injustice was committed by any one at nay\n        time and all the subjects of the rule of Kronos lived a life of blessedness, in the unhindered enjoyment of\n        every pleasure. To this the poet Hesiod also bears witness in the following words : ‘And they who were\n        Kronos' day, what time he reigned in heaven, lived like gods, no care in heart, remote and free from ills and\n        toils severe, from grievous sicknesses and cares; old age lay not upon their limbs, but they, equal in strength\n        of leg and arm, enjoyed endless delight of feasting far from ills, and when death came, they sank in it as in a\n        sleep. And many other things were theirs; grain-giving earth, unploughed, bore for them fruit abundantly and\n        without stint; and glad of heart they dwelt upon their tilth throughout the earth, in midst of blessing\n        manifold, rich in their flocks, loved by the blessed gods.’ This then, is what the myths have to say about\n        Kronos.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 14. 320 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"King Picus, son of Saturnus [Kronos (Cronus)], ruled the land of Ausonia [Latium], a king whose chief\n        delight was chargers for battle.\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 7. 48 ff (trans. Day-Lewis) (Roman epic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"Faunus was son of Picus, who called Saturnus his father--yes, Saturnus [Kronos (Cronus)] originated their\n        line.\"\n\nCicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 17 (trans. Rackham) (Roman rhetorician C1st B.C.)\n          :\n        \"If these brothers [Zeus, Poseidon, Haides] are included among the gods, can we deny the divinity of their\n        father Saturnus [Kronos (Cronus)], who is held in the highest reverence by the common people in the west\n        [Italy]? And if he is a god, we must also admit that his father Caelus (Sky) [Ouranos (Uranus)] is a god.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
