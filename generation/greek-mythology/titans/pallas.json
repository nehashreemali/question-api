The immortal Titanes\n        may have led their mortal brethren, the Gigantes, into battle.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 38 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[In the War of the Gigantes :] She [Athena] stripped the skin off Pallas and used it to protect her own\n        body during the battle.\"\n\nSuidas s.v. Pallas (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek lexicon C10th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Pallas : A great virgin. It is an epithet of Athena; from brandishing (pallein) the spear, or\n        from having killed Pallas, one of the Gigantes (Giants).\"\n\nPallas was the Titan-god of warcraft. His name, like the title of the goddess Athene, was believed to be\n        derived from the word pallô, meaning \"to wield or brandish a spear.\" As a son of\n        Heaven, Pallas may have also represented the Greek campaign season of late spring, early summer. He was the\n        father of four warlike gods--Nike (Victory), Kratos (Power), Bia (Force), and Zelos (Rivalry). His wife Styx\n        seems to represent the most binding oath of allegiance--for by her stream the gods were said to have sworn their\n        allegiance to Zeus at the beginning of the Titan-War.\n\nPallas may have presided over the Constellation Auriga (the\n        Charioteer) and its chief star Capella (the storm-bringing goat Aix), which rises in mid-spring and marked the\n        beginning of the Greek campaign season. His father Krios (Crius) and brother Perses probably ruled over the two\n        neighbouring constellations--Aries (Krios in Greek) and Perseus. Furthermore, the constellation Auriga contained\n        the two defining features of the Titan Pallas--firstly it depicted a chariot-riding warrior, and secondly it\n        contained the stormy-bringing goat-star Capella.\n\nPallas was surely imagined as a goatish god. In the story of the Titan-War, Athene vanquishes him in battle,\n        and crafts her stormy aigis (a goat-hide, arm-guard) from his skin. Pallas' father and brothers were\n        also apparently animalistic--Krios (Crius) is, of course, named simply the Ram,\n        was probably paired with the constellation of the same name (Aries); Astraios\n        (Astraeus), father of the horse-shaped wind-gods, may have been assine or equine in form; and Perses, father of Hekate, was perhaps dog-like god. Pallas' connection with the\n        stars is further emphasized when he is described as the father of the moon-goddess Selene.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
