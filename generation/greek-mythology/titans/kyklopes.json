When the Titanes overthrew Ouranos, they drove the giants into the\n        pit of Tartaros. Zeus and his brothers later released them and in return\n        they provided the god with his thunderbolts, Poseidon with his\n        storm-raising trident, and Haides with a helm of invisibility.\n\nSome say there were a total of seven forging Kyklopes. The lesser four, sons of the first, were slain by Apollon to avenge the death of his son Asklepios (Asclepius), who had been slain by Zeus with a Kyklops-forged\n        lightning-bolt.\n\nThe tribe of younger Kyklopes which Odysseus encountered on his\n        travels were a different breed.\n\n[1.1] OURANOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 139, Titanomachia Frag 1, Apollodorus 1.1, Hyginus Pref)\n\n[1.1] BRONTES, STEROPES, ARGES (Hesiod Theogony139, Apollodorus 1.1 Callimachus Hymn\n          to Artemis)\n        [1.2] BRONTES, STEROPES, AKMONIDES (Ovid Fasti 4.287)\n        [1.3] BRONTES, STEROPES, PYRAKMON (Virgil Aeneid 8.414)\n        [1.4] BRONTES, STEROPES (Statius Silvae 1.1.3)\n        [2.1] Seven (unnamed) (Strabo 8.6.11)\n        [2.2] BRONTES, STEROPES, ARGES, EURYALOS, ELATREUS, TRAKHIOS, HALIMEDES (Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 14.52)\n\nCYCLO′PES (Kuklôpes), that is, creatures with round or circular eyes. The tradition about these\n        beings has undergone several changes and modifications in its development in Greek mythology, though some traces\n        of their identity remain visible throughout. According to the ancient cosmogonies, the Cyclopes were the sons of\n        Uranus and Ge; they belonged to the Titans, and were three in number, whose names were Arges, Steropes, and\n        Brontes, and each of them had only one eye on his forehead. Together with the other Titans, they were cast by\n        their father into Tartarus, but, instigated by their mother, they assisted Cronus in usurping the government.\n        But Cronus again threw them into Tartarus, and as Zeus released them in his war against Cronus and the Titans,\n        the Cyclopes provided Zeus with thunderbolts and lightning, Pluto with a helmet, and Poseidon with a trident.\n        (Apollod. i. 1; Hes. Theog. 503.) Henceforth they remained the ministers of Zeus, but were afterwards\n        killed by Apollo for having furnished Zeus with the thunderbolts to kill Asclepius. (Apollod. iii. 10. §\n        4.) According to others, however, it was not the Cyclopes themselves that were killed, but their sons. (Schol.\n        ad Eurip. Alcest. 1.)\n\nIn the Homeric poems the Cyclopes are a gigantic, insolent, and lawless race of shepherds, who lived in the\n        south-western part of Sicily, and devoured human beings. They neglected agriculture, and the fruits of the field\n        were reaped by them without labour. They had no laws or political institutions, and each lived with his wives\n        and children in a cave of a mountain, and ruled over them with arbitrary power. (Hom. Od. vi. 5, ix.\n        106, &c., 190, &c., 240, &c., x. 200.) Homer does not distinctly state that all of the Cyclopes were\n        one-eyed, but Polyphemus, the principal among them, is described as having only one eye on his forehead.\n        (Od. i. 69, ix. 383, &c.; comp. Polyphemus.) The Homeric Cyclopes are no longer the servants of\n        Zeus, but they disregard him. (Od. ix. 275; comp. Virg. Aen. vi. 636 ; Callim. Hymn. in\n          Dian. 53.)\n\nA still later tradition regarded the Cyclopes as the assistants of Hephaestus. Volcanoes were the workshops of\n        that god, and mount Aetna in Sicily and the neighbouring isles were accordingly considered as their abodes. As\n        the assistants of Hephaestus they are no longer shepherds, but make the metal armour and ornaments for gods and\n        heroes; they work with such might that Sicily and all the neighbouring islands resound with their hammering.\n        Their number is, like that in the Homeric poems, no longer confined to three, but their residence is removed\n        from the south-western to the eastern part of Sicily (Virg. Georg. iv. 170, Aen. viii. 433;\n        Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 56, &c.; Eurip. Cycl. 599; Val. Flacc. ii. 420.) Two of their names\n        are the same as in the cosmogonic tradition, but new names also were invented, for we find one Cyclops bearing\n        the name of Pyracmon, and another that of Acamas. (Calim. Hymn. in Dian. 68; Virg. Aen. viii.\n        425; Val. Place. i. 583.)\n\nThe Cyclopes, who were regarded as skilful architects in later accounts, were a race of men who appear to be\n        different from the Cyclopes whom we have considered hitherto, for they are described as a Thracian tribe, which\n        derived its name from a king Cyclops. They were expelled from their homes in Thrace, and went to the Curetes\n        (Crete) and to Lycia. Thence they followed Proetus to protect him, by the gigantic walls which they constructed,\n        against Acrisius. The grand fortifications of Argos, Tiryns, and Mycenae, were in later times regarded as their\n        works. (Apollod. ii. 1. § 2; Strab. viii. p. 373; Paus. ii. 16. § 4; Schol.ad Eurip. Orest.\n        953.) Such walls, commonly known by the name of Cyclopean walls, still exist in various parts of ancient Greece\n        and Italy, and consist of unhewn polygones, which are sometimes 20 or 30 feet in breadth. The story of the\n        Cyclopes having built them seems to be a mere invention, and admits neither of an historical nor geographical\n        explanation. Homer, for instance, knows nothing of Cyclopean walls, and he calls Tiryns merely a polis\n        teichioessa. (Il. ii. 559.) The Cyclopean walls were probably constructed by an ancient race\n        of men--perhaps the Pelasgians--who occupied the countries in which they occur before the nations of which we\n        have historical records; and later generations, being struck by their grandeur as much as ourselves, ascribed\n        their building to a fabulous race of Cyclopes.\n\nIn works of art the Cyclopes are represented as sturdy men with one eye on their forehead, and the place which\n        in other human beings is occupied by the eyes, is marked in figures of the Cyclopes by a line. According to the\n        explanation of Plato (ap. Strab. xiii. p. 592), the Cyclopes were beings typical of the original\n        condition of uncivilized men ; but this explanation is not satisfactory, and the cosmogonic Cyclopes at least\n        must be regarded as personifications of certain powers manifested in nature, which is sufficiently indicated by\n        their names.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nN.B. Argilipos, Pyrakmon and Akmonides are alternate names for the three.\n\n* The prefix of the name Euryalos is derived from the Greek word eurys, \"wide.\" The suffix\n        comes from either alê, \"stepping\" \"roaming\" or hals, \"the\n        brine\" \"the sea.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 139 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And again, she [Gaia (Gaea) the Earth] bare [to Ouranos (Uranus) the Sky] the Kyklopes (Cyclopes),\n        overbearing in spirit, Brontes, and Steropes and stubborn-hearted Arges, who gave Zeus the thunder and made the\n        thunderbolt : in all else they were like the gods, but one eye only was set in the midst of their fore-heads.\n        And they were surnamed Kyklopes (Orb-eyed) because one orbed eye was set in their foreheads. Strength and might\n        and craft were in their works. And again, three other sons [the Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires) were born of\n        Gaia (Earth) and Ouranos (Sky) . . . \n        For of all the children that were born of Gaia and Ouranos, these [the Hekatonkheires and Kyklopes] were the\n        most terrible, and they were hated by their own father from the first [i.e. Father Sky hates the Storm-Giants].\n        And he used to hide them all away in a secret place of Gaia (Earth) so soon as each was born, and would not\n        suffer them to come up into the light: and Ouranos rejoiced in his evil doing. But vast Gaia (Earth) groaned\n        within, being straitened, and she made the element of grey flint and shaped a great sickle, and told her plan to\n        her dear sons [the Titanes]. And she spoke, cheering them, while she was vexed in her dear heart :\n        ‘My children, gotten of a sinful father, if you mwill obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your\n        father; for he first thought of doing shameful things.’\n        So she said; but fear seized them all, and none of them uttered a word. But great Kronos (Cronus) the wily took\n        courage and answered his dear mother :\n        ‘Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence not our father of evil name, for he first\n        thought of doing shameful things.’\n        So he said : and vast Gaia rejoiced greatly in spirit, and set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his hands a\n        jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot [i.e. to castrate and dethrone Ouranos and free her sons from\n        their bondage].\"\n\nEumelus or Arctinus, Titanomachia Fragment 1 (from Proclus, Chrestomathy) (Greek epic\n          C8th B.C.) :\n        \"The Epic Cycle begins with the fabled union of Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) and Ge (Gaea, Earth), by\n        which they make three Hekatontacheiroi (Hecatoncheires, Hundred-Handed) sons and three Kyklopes (Cyclopes) to be\n        born to him.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 1 - 4 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) was the first to rule over the entire world. He married Ge (Gaea, Earth) and sired\n        first the Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires), who were names Briareos (Briareus), Gyes and Kottos (Cottus) . . .\n        After these he sired the Kyklopes (Cyclopes), by name Arges (Flash), Steropes (Lightning), and Brontes\n        (Thunder), each of whom had one eye in his forehead. But Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) bound these and threw them into\n        Tartaros (Tartarus), a place in Haides' realm as dark as Erebos, and as far away from the earth as the earth is\n        from the sky.\n        Now Ge (Earth), distressed by the loss of her children into Tartaros, persuaded the Titanes (TItans) to attack\n        their father, and she gave Kronos (Cronus) a sickle made of adamant. So all of them except Okeanos (Oceanus) set\n        upon Ouranos (Sky), and Kronos cut off his genitals, tossing them into the sea . . . Thus having overthrown\n        Ouranos' rule the Titanes retrieved their brothers from Tartaros and gave the power to Kronos. But Kronos once\n        again bound the Kyklopes and confined them in Tartaros.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans.

He thereupon slew their jail-keeper Kampe (Campe), and\n        freed them from their bonds. In return the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) gave Zeus thunder, lightning, and a thunderbolt,\n        as well as a helmet for Plouton (Pluton) [Haides] and a trident for Poseidon. Armed with these the three gods\n        overpowered the Titanes, confined them in Tartaros, and put the Hekatonkheires in charge of guarding them.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 14. 445 ff (trans.

This altar was said to have been forged by the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) when the gods\n        swore oaths of allegiance to Zeus for the coming war against the Titanes. The eastern rising of the\n        constellation probably represented the annual release of the storms of the Hekatonkheires (Giants of\n        Storm-Clouds and Hurricane-Winds) and Kyklopes (Giants of Lightning and Thunder) from the pit of Tartaros.\n\nThe Kyklopes (Cyclopes) were the storm-giant forgers of thunder and lightning.\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1. 731 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Here were the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) sitting at work on an imperishable thunderbolt for Zeus the King. One\n        ray was lacking to complete its splendour, and this lay spurting flame as they beat it out with their iron\n        hammers.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1. 498 ff :\n        \"The earthborn Kyklopes (Cyclopes) had given him [Zeus] the bolt, the thunder and lightning that form his\n        glorious armament today.\"\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis 10 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[Artemis, still a young child, addresses her father Zeus :] ‘Father, I ask thee not for quiver or\n        for mighty bow : for me the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) will straightway fashion arrows and fashion for me a well-bent\n        bow.’\"\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis 46 ff :\n        \"And straightway she [Artemis] went to visit the Kyklopes (Cyclopes). Then she found in the isle of\n        Lipara--Lipara in later days, but at that time its name was Meligounis--at the anvils of Hephaistos\n        (Hephaestus), standing round a molten mass of iron. For a great work was being hastened on: they fashioned a\n        shores-trough for Poseidon. And the Nymphai (Nymphs) [handmaidens of Artemis] were affrighted when they saw the\n        terrible monsters like unto the crags of Ossa: all had single eyes beneath their brows, like a shield of\n        fourfold hide for size, glaring terribly from under; and when they heard the din of the anvil echoing loudly,\n        and the great blast of the bellows and the heavy groaning of the Kyklopes themselves. For Aitna (Etna) cried\n        aloud, and Trinakie (Trinacia) [Sicily] cried, the seat of the Sikanians (Sicanians), cried too their neighbour\n        Italie, and Kyrnos therewithal uttered a mighty noise, when they lifted their hammers above their shoulders and\n        smote with rhythmic swing the bronze glowing from the furnace or iron, labouring greatly. Wherefore the\n        Okeaninai (Oceanids) [handmaidens of Artemis] could not untroubled look upon them to face nor endure the din in\n        their ears. No shame to them! On those not even the daughters of the Blessed look without shuddering, though\n        long past childhood's years. But when any of the maidens doth disobedience to her mother, the mother calls the\n        Kyklopes to her child--Arges or Steropes; and from within the house comes Hermes stained with burnt ashes. And\n        straightway he plays bogey to the child and she runs into her mother's lap, with her hands upon her eyes. But\n        thou, Maiden [Artemis], even earlier, while yet but three years old, when Leto came bearing thee in her arms at\n        the bidding of Hephaistos that he might give thee handsel [i.e. gifts which were given when seeing a new born\n        child for the first time] and Brontes set thee on his stout knees--thou didst pluck the shaggy hair of his great\n        breast and tear it out by force. And even unto this day the mid part of his breast remains hairless, even as\n        when mange settles on a man's temples and eats away the hair.\n        Therefore right boldly didst thou address them then : ‘Kyklopes, for me too fashion ye a Kydonian bow and\n        arrows and a hollow casket for my shafts; for I also am a child of Leto, even as Apollon. And if I with my bow\n        shall slay some wild creature of monstrous beast, that shall the Kyklopes eat.’ So didst thou speak and\n        they fulfilled thy words. Straightway didst thou array thee, O Goddess.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 3. 302 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Zeus] soared ascending to the ethereal sky, and by his nod called up the trailing clouds and massed a\n        storm, with lightnings in the squalls, and thunder and the bolts that never miss . . . he tried, as far as he\n        had power, to curb his might, and would not wield [against his love Semele] the fire with which he's felled\n        hundred-handed Typhoeus. That was too fierce. There is another bolt, a lighter one, in which the Cyclopes forged\n        a flame less savage and a lesser wrath, called by the gods his second armament. With this in hand he went to\n        Semele in Cadmus' palace.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 4. 287 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Trinacrian [Sicilian] sea, where Brontes, Steropes and Acmonides dip the white iron.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 4. 473 ff : \n        \"And the Cyclops' caverns [in Sicily] scorched by fixed forges.\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 8. 418 ff (trans. Day-Lewis) (Roman epic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The Fire-lord [Hephaistos (Hephaestus)] rose from his downy bed and go to his ironworkds. Between the\n        Sicilian coast and Aeolian Lipare there's an island, whose cliffs, sheer-rising, jet out smoke from their\n        crannies : deep within it are vaults, a rumbling volcanic cavern scooped out by the action of the Cyclopes'\n        fires; you can hear the clang of hard blows on the anvils, the roaring when masses of ore are smelted within,\n        and a throbbing blast of flame form the furnaces. Here is Volcanos' (Vulcan's) [Hephaistos'] place; the island\n        is called Volcania. Hither now the Fire-god repaired form heaven above. The Cyclopes were hard at work in this\n        underground iron-foundry--Brontes and Steropes, Pyracmon stripped to the buff. They manufactured a thunderbolt,\n        such as the Father of heaven [Zeus] shoots down in such great numbers at earth from all over the sky : part of\n        it was already streamlined, part unfinished. They had given it three fins of twirling sleet, and three of\n        cloudburst, three of russet fire and three of stormwind. Now they were putting in as components frightening\n        flashes, the noise that creates panic, the piercing flames of wrath. Elsewhere, a job was being hurried on for\n        Mars [Ares]--a chariot with swift wheels, such as he rides in to rouse up men and nations. Some busily burnished\n        the aegis Athene wears in her angry moods--a fearsome thing with a surface of gold like scaly snake-skin, and he\n        linked serpents and the Gorgon herself upon the goddess' breast--a severed head rolling its eyes.\n        ‘Put all that work aside, pack in the jobs you're engaged on, you Cyclopes of Mount Aetna, and turn your\n        attention to this--the making of arms for a hot-blooded hero! Now there is need for your strength, your\n        speediest work and your master-craftmanship. Get bustling on it at once!’\n        That was all Vulcanos [Hephaistos] said : quickly they set to the business, shared out the tasks among them\n        equally. Rivers of molten bronze and gold are flowing; the deadly steel is smelted in an immense furnace. They\n        fashion a shield of heroic size, to withstand by itself every missile the Latins can use, welding seven round of\n        metal one on another to make it. Some pump away at the bellows, drawing in air and expelling it; some dip the\n        hissing metal in troughs. The cavern groans under the stress of anvils.

He was armed with a firebarbed thunderbolt from the underworld, and fought with\n        firebrands : the swarthy Indians trembled, amazed at that fire so like the heavenly fireburst. A champion all of\n        fire he was, and he sparks of earthborn lightning showered upon the enemies' heads. The Kyklops (Cyclops)\n        conquered ash-pikes and countless swords, shaking his hot missiles and his flashing points, with brands for his\n        arrows: one upon another, countless, he burnt the Indian men with the blazing shafts, slaying not only one enemy\n        of God . . .\n        Steropes (Lightning) also was armed with a mimic lightning, which he brandished like the lightningflash of the\n        sky, but an extinguishable brand, the child of Western flame, seed of Sikelian (Sicilian) fire and that smoky\n        forge; a dark pall covered it like a cloud, and beneath it he now hid the light, now showed it, in alternating\n        movements, just like the flashes in the sky; for the lightning comes in flashes and goes again.\n        Brontes (Thunder) also was in the battle, rattling a noisy tune with a din like rolling thunderclaps : he poured\n        an earthborn shower of his own with strange drops falling through the air, and lasting but a moment--an unreal\n        Zeus he was, with imitated raindrops and no clouds. Then leaving the artificial noise of this mock thunder, he\n        armed himself with Sicilian steel against the enemy; swinging the iron hammer high over his shoulders he smashed\n        many an enemy head, and struck the dusky ranks right and left, with a clang like blows as it he were ever\n        striking on the hammerbeaten anvil of Aitna (Mount Etna).\n        Next he broke off a crag from a farspreading rock, and rushed upon Deriades [the Indian king] with this stony\n        spear. He hurled the huge rock with merciless hand against the blackskin king who stood ready, and struck his\n        hairy chest with its rocky point. The king was wholly staggered with the heavy blow of this huge millstone full\n        on his chest, like a drunken man; but Hydaspes [a local River-God] rescued his stricken son from death. The bold\n        king, crushed by the blow, dropt the furious spear from his never-tiring hands, the twentycubit spear of bronze,\n        and threw his shield on the ground out of his shamed grasp, with little breath left in him; struck on the round\n        of his breast by the pointed stone, he fell down headlong out of his lofty car . . . The Indians crowded round\n        him and lifted him into the car, fearing that the ugly Kyklops might get another crag of some lofty hill and\n        throw again, and slay their king with a rough missile--for he [the Kyklops Brontes] was as tall as highcrested\n        Polyphemos. In the middle of this grim champion's forehead glared the light of one single round eye; the\n        blackskin Indians shook with wonder and fear when they saw the eye of the grim Kyklops; they thought Olympian\n        Selene (the Moon) must have come down from the sky and risen in the earth-born Kyklops' face, shining with her\n        full orb, to defend Lyaios (Lyaeus) [Dionysos].\n        Father Zeus, seeing how the Kyklops imitated his own noise, laughed on high in the clouds that the earth was\n        then flooded with a strange kind of shoer from earthclouds upon its bosom, a new experience, while the thirsty\n        air had no downpour through its bare dry expanse.\n        Trakhios (Trachius) [the Kyklops] also reared his head: and Elatreus, marching beside his brother, held and\n        shook a shield like a towering crag, and held a long firtree high in the clouds, sweeping off the enemies' heads\n        with his treespear.\n        Euryalos (Euryalus) [another Kyklops] reared his head. He cut off a large body of fugitives in the battle, away\n        from the plain and down towards the sea, shutting the Indian companies into the fishgiving gulf; so he conquered\n        his foes over the lancebearing main as he thrust his twenty-cubit blade through the water. Then with long\n        poleaxe he split off a rock near the brine, and threw it at his adversaries; many then felt the threads of Fate\n        in double fashion without burial, struck with the jagged missile, and brinedrowned in watery strife.\n        Another Kyklops of the tribe went raging and scattering his foes, the prime warrior Halimedes, a monster with\n        towering limbs; guarding himself he held before his great round eye a bossy oxhide shield. Then [the Indian]\n        Phlogios the avenger of the slain Indians saw him; he rounded his bow, and drew back the windswift shaft to\n        pierce the eye in that forehead--and he would have done it, but as he aimed, the high-headed Kyklops saw the\n        coming attack, and dodged the blow of the flying arrow by shifting aside. Then the other poised a rock and threw\n        the rough missile at Phlogios; but he retreated and stood by the car of oxhorned Deriades, and thus just evaded\n        the sharp stone flying through the air, and there he remained. But Halimedes, angry that Phlogios had retreated,\n        opened his deadly throat, and with one loud roar slew twelve men by pouring out one man-destroying boom of his\n        furious voice.\n        The warcries of the Kyklopes made Olympos ring with their terrible sounds.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 37. 111 ff : \n        \"[At the funeral games of Opheltes, a companion of Dionysos in the Indian War :] A giant Kyklops (Cyclops)\n        lifted this [a statue of Dionysos] in his hands and set it in the earth for a stone turning-post, and fixed\n        another like it at the opposite end.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 39. 218 ff : \n        \"[During a sea-battle of Dionysos' Indian War :] Troops of Kyklopes (Cyclopes) navigated by the sea,\n        showering rocks from the shore upon the ships; Euryalos (Euryalus) shouted the warcry, and Halimedes high as sky\n        dashed raging into battle with brine-blustering tumult.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 39. 340 ff : \n        \"[During a battle of the Indian War of Dionysos :] [The Kyklops (Cyclops)] Steropes also fought in the\n        forefront; Halimedes high uplifted upon his feet grasped the craf of a seabron cliff and threw it at the foe--a\n        stray ship sank, struck by the rounded mass of hard stone.\"\n\nKyklops (Cyclops) was a nick-name sometimes applied to those who had lost an eye.\n\nAelian, Historical Miscellany 12. 43 (trans.
