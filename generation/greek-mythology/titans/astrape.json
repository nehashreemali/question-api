  "content": "ASTRAPE and BRONTE were the goddesses of lightning and thunder, ministers of the weather-god Zeus.\n\nThe pair were late classical inventions. In early Greek myth the elder Kyklopes\n        Brontes and Steropes personified the same phenomena.\n\nIn the Apulian vase painting right, Astrape (labelled) stands beside the throne of Zeus bearing the armaments\n        of the sky-god. She also wields a torch and is a crowned with a shining aureole.\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 14 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        [From a description of an ancient Greek painting depicting the death of Semele :]\n        \"Bronte (Thunder), stern of face, and Astrape (Lightning), flashing light from her eyes, and raging fire\n        from heaven that has laid hold of a king's house, suggest the following tale, if it is one you know. A cloud of\n        fire encompassing Thebes breaks into the dwelling of Kadmos (Cadmus) as Zeus comes wooing Semele; and Semele\n        apparently is destroyed, but Dionysos is born, by Zeus, so I believe, in the presence of the fire.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Pliny, Natural History 25.96 (Bronte, Astrape &\n          Ceraunobolia).\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
