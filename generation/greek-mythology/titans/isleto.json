  "content": "LETO was one of the Titanides (female Titans), a bride of Zeus, and the mother of the twin gods Apollon and\n        Artemis. She was the goddess of motherhood and, with her children, a protectress of the young. Her name and\n        iconography suggest she was also a goddess of modesty and womanly demure. Like her sister Asteria she may also have been a goddess of the night, or alternatively of the\n        light of day.\n\nWhen Leto was pregant with the twins she was pursued relentlessly by the goddess Hera, who drove her from land to land preventing her from finding a place to\n        rest and give birth. The floating island of Delos eventually provided her with refuge.\n        Later when she was later travelling to Delphoi (Delphi), the giant Tityos (Tityus) attempted to abduct her, but Apollon intervened and\n        slew him with arrows.\n\nIn Greek vase painting Leto was usually depicted as a woman lifting her veil in a gesture of modesty. She was\n        usually depicted accompanied by her two children. The exact meaning of her name is obscure, some commentators\n        connect it with the word lethô, to move unseen, suggestive of modesty, others derive it from the\n        Lycian word for woman, lada.\n\n[1.1] KOIOS & PHOIBE (Hesiod Theogony 404, Apollodorus 1.9, Diodorus Siculus 5.67.1, Hyginus\n          Preface)\n        [1.2] KOIOS (Homeric Hymn III To Apollon 61, Pindar\n          Processional Song on Delos, Sappho Frag 44A, Callimachus Hymn to Delos, Orphic Hymn 35, Ovid Metamorphoses\n          6.186, Hyginus Fabulae 140)\n        [1.3] PHOIBE (Aeschylus Eumenides 6 &\n          323)\n\n[1.1] APOLLON, ARTEMIS (by\n        Zeus) (Hesiod Theogony 918, Hesiod Works &\n          Days 770, Homer Iliad 1.9 & 21.495, Homer Odyssey 6.100 & 11.318, Homeric Hymn 27 to Artemis, Pindar\n          Nemean Ode 6 & 8, Pindar Processional Song on Delos, Aeschylus Eumenides 6 & 323, Orphic Hymn 35,\n          Callimachus Hymn to Artemis & Hymn to Delos, Apollodorus 1.21 & 3.46, Pausanias 8.9.1 & 8.53.1.\n          Hyginus Fabulae 9 & 140, et al)\n\nLETO (Lêtô), in Latin LATONA, according to Hesiod (Theog. 406, 921), a daughter of the\n        Titan Coeus and Phoebe, a sister of Asteria, and the mother of Apollo and Artemis by Zeus, to whom she was\n        married before Hera. Homer, who likewise calls her the mother of Apollo and Artemis by Zeus (Il. i. 9,\n        xiv. 327, xxi. 499, Od. xi. 318, 580), mentions her as the friend of the Trojans in the war with the\n        Greeks, and in the story of' Niobe, who paid so dearly for her conduct towards Leto. (Il. v. 447, xx.\n        40, 72, xxiv. 607; comp. xxi. 502, Od. xi. 580, Hymn. in Apoll. 45, &c., 89, &c.) In\n        later writers these elements of her story are variously worked out and embellished, for they do not describe her\n        as the lawful wife of Zeus, but merely as a concubine, who was persecuted during her pregnancy by Hera.\n        (Apollod. i. 4, § 1; Callim. Hymn. in Del. 61, &c.; Schol. ad Eurip. Phoen. 232,\n        &c.; Hygin. Fab. 140.) All the world being afraid of receiving her on account of Hera, she wandered\n        about till she came to the island of Delos, which was then a floating island, and bore the name Asteria (Callim.\n        Hymn. in Dian. 35, 37, 191); but when Leto touched it, it suddenly stood still upon four pillars.\n        (Pind. Fragm. 38; Strab. xi. p. 485.) According to Hyginus (Fab. 93,140), Delos was previously\n        called Ortygia, while Stephanus Byzantinus (s. v. Korissos) mentions a tradition, according to which\n        Artemis was not born in Delos, but at Corissus. Servius (ad Aen. iii. 72) relates the following\n        legends: Zeus changed Leto into a quail (ortux), and in this state she arrived in the floating island, which was\n        hence called Ortygia; or, Zeus was enamoured with Asteria, but she being metamorphosed, through her prayers,\n        into a bird, flew across the sea; she was then changed into a rock, which, for a long time, lay under the\n        surface of the sea; but, at the request of Leto, it rose and received Leto, who was pursued by Python. Leto then\n        gave birth to Apollo, who slew Python. (Comp. Anton. Lib. 35; Ov. Met. vi. 370; Aristot. Hist.\n          Anim. vi. 35; Athen. xv. 701; Apollon. Rhod. ii. 707; Iamblich. Vit. Pyth. 10; Strab. xiv. p.\n        639: in each of these passages we find the tradition modified in a particular way.) But notwithstanding the many\n        discrepancies, especially in regard to the place where Leto gave birth to her children, most traditions agree in\n        describing Delos as the place. (Callim. Hymn. in Apoll. init. 59, in Del. 206, 261; Aeschyl.\n        Eum. 9; Herod. ii. 170.) After the birth of Apollo, his mother not being able to nurse him, Themis gave\n        him nectar and ambrosia; and by his birth the island of Delos became sacred, so that henceforth it was not\n        lawful for any human being to be born or to die on the island; and every pregnant woman was conveyed to the\n        neighbouring island of Rheneia, in order not to pollute Delos. (Strab. x. p. 486.)\n\nWe shall pass over the various speculations of modern writers respecting the origin and nature of this\n        divinity, and shall mention only the most probable, according to which Leto is \"the obscure\" or \"concealed,\" not\n        as a physical power, but as a divinity yet quiescent and invisible, from whom is issued the visible divinity\n        with all his splendour and brilliancy. This view is supported by the account of her genealogy given by Hesiod;\n        and her whole legend seems to indicate nothing else but the issuing from darkness to light, and a return from\n        the latter to the former. Leto was generally worshipped only in conjunction with her children, as at Megara\n        (Paus. i. 44. § 2), at Argos (ii. 21. § 10), at Amphigeneia (Strab. viii. p. 349), in Lycia (ibid.\n        xiv. p. 665), near Lete in Macedonia (Steph. Byz. s. v. Lêtê), in a grove near Calynda in\n        Caria (Strab. xiv. p. 651), and other places.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 404 ff (trans.

But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus who delights in\n        thunder; and then she unstrings his bow, and closes his quiver, and takes his archery from his strong shoulders\n        in her hands and hangs them on a golden peg against a pollar of his father's house. Then she leads him to a seat\n        and makes him sit : and the Father gives him nektar in a golden cup welcoming his dear son, while other gods\n        make him sit down there, and queenly Leto rejoices because she bare a mighty son and an archer. Rejoice, blessed\n        Leto, for you bare glorious children, the lord Apollon and Artemis who delights in arrows; her in Ortygia, and\n        him in rocky Delos, as you rested against the great mass of the Kynthion (Cynthian) hill hard by a palm-tree by\n        the streams of Inopos (Inopus).\n        Shall I sing how at the first Leto bare you [Apollon] to be the joy of men, as she rested against Mount Kynthos\n        (Cynthus) in that rocky isle, in sea-girt Delos--while on either hand a dark wave rolled on landwards driven by\n        shrill winds--whence arising you rule over all mortal men? Among those who are in Krete (Crete), and in the\n        township of Athens, and in the isle of Aigina (Aegina) and Euboia (Euboea), famous for ships, in Aigai (Aegae)\n        and Peiresiai (Piresiae) and Peparethos near the sea, in Threikios [Thracian] Athos and Pelion's towering\n        heights and Threikios (Thracian) Samos and the shady hills of Ida, in Skyros (Scyrus) and Phokaia (Phocaea) and\n        the high hill of Autokane (Autocane) and fair-lying Imbros and smouldering Lemnos and rich Lesbos, home of\n        Makaros (Makareus), the son of Aiolos (Aeolus), and Khios (Chios), brightest of all the isles that lie in the\n        sea, and craggy Mimas and the heights of Korykos (Corycus) and gleaming Klaros (Claros) and hte sheer hill of\n        Aisagia (Aesagia) and watered Samos and the steep heights of Mykale (Mycale), in Miletos (Miletus) and Kos\n        (Cos), the city of Meropian men, and steep Knidos (Cnidus) and windy Karpathos (Carpathus), in Naxos and Paros\n        and rocky Rhenaia--so far roamed Leto in travail with the god who shoots afar, to see if any land would be\n        willing to make a dwelling for her son. But they greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of\n        them, dared receive Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon], until queenly Leto set foot on Delos and uttered winged words\n        and asked her : ‘Delos, if you would be willing to be the abode of my son Phoibos Apollon and make him a\n        rich temple--; for no other will vouch you, as you will find: and I think you will be rich in oxen and sheep,\n        nor bear vintage nor yet produce plants abundantly. But if you have the temple of far-shooting Apollon, all men\n        will bring you hecatombs and gather here, and incessant savour of rich sacrifice will always arise, and you will\n        feed those who dwell in you from the hand of stangers; for truly your own soil is not rich.’\n        So spake Leto. And Delos rejoiced and answered and said : ‘Leto, most glorious daughter of great Koios\n        (Coeus), joyfully would I receive your child the far-shooting lord; for it is all too true that I am ill-spoken\n        of among men, whereas thus I should become very greatly honoured. But his saying I fear, and I will not hide it\n        from you, Leto. They say that Apollon will be one that is very haughty and will greatly lord it among gods and\n        men all over the fruitful earth. Therefore, I greatly fear in heart and spirit that as soon as he sees the light\n        of the sun, he will scorn this island--for truly I have but a hard, rocky soil--and overturn me and thrust me\n        down with his feet in the depths of the sea; then will the great ocean wash deep above my head for ever, and he\n        will go to another land such as will please him, there to make his temple and wooded groves. So, many-footed\n        creatures of the sea will make lairs in me and black seals their dwelling undisturbed, because I lack people.\n        Yet if you will but dare to sware a great oath, goddess (thea), that here first he will build a\n        glorious temple to be an oracle for men, then let him afterwards make temples and wooded groves amongst all men;\n        for surely he will be greatly renowned.’\n        So said Delos. And Leto sware the great oath of the gods : ‘Now hear this, Gaia (Gaea, Earth) and wide\n        Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven) above, and dropping water of Styx, this is the strongest and most awful oath of the\n        blessed gods, surely Phoibos shall have here his fragrant altar and precinct, and you he shall honour above\n        all.’\n        Now when Leto had sworn and ended her oath, Delos was very glad at the birth of the far-shooting lord, But Leto\n        was racked nine days and nine nights with pangs beyond wont. And there were with her all the chiefest of the\n        goddesses, Dione and Rheia and Ikhnaia (Ichnaea) and Themis and loud-moaning Amphitrite and the other deathless\n        goddesses save white-armed Hera, who sat in the halls of cloud-gathering Zeus. Only Eileithyia, goddess of sore\n        travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on the top of Olympos (Olympus) beneath golden clouds by\n        white-armed Hera's contriving, who kept her close through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses was soon to\n        bear a son faultless and strong.\n        But the goddesses sent out Iris from the well-set isle to bring Eileithyia, promising her a great necklace\n        strung with golden threads, nine cubits long. And they bade Iris call her aside from white-armed Hera, lest she\n        might afterwards turn her from coming with her words. When swift Iris, fleet of foot as the wind, had heard all\n        this, she set to run; and quickly finishing all the distance she came to the home of the gods, sheer Olympos,\n        and forthwith called Eileithyia out from the hall to the door and spoke winged words to her, telling her all as\n        the goddesses who dwell on Olympos had bidden her. So she moved the heart of Eileithyia in her dear breast; and\n        they went their way, like why wild-doves in their going.\n        And as soon as Eileithyia the goddess of sore travail set foot on Delos, the pains of birth seized Leto, and she\n        longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth [of\n        Delos] laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light, and all the goddesses raised a cry.\n        Straightway, great Phoibos, the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with sweet water, and swathed you in a\n        white garment of fine texture, new-woven, and fastened a golden band about you.\n        Now Leto did not give Apollon, bearer of the golden blade, her breast; but Themis duly poured nektar and\n        ambrosia with her divine hands : and Leto was glad because she had borne a strong son and an archer. But as soon\n        as you had tasted that divine heavenly food, O Phoibos, you could no longer then be held by golden cords nor\n        confined with bands, but all their ends were undone. Forthwith Phoibos Apollon spoke out among the deathless\n        goddesses : ‘The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will declare to men the unfailing\n        will of Zeus.’\n        So said Phoibos, the long-haired god who shoots afar and began to walk upon the wide-pathed earth; and all the\n        goddesses were amazed at him. Then with gold all Delos was laden, beholding the child of Zeus and Leto, for joy\n        because the god chose her above the islands and shore to make his dwelling in her : and she loved him yet more\n        in her heart blossomed as does a mountain-top with woodland flowers.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 3 to Delian Apollo 177 ff : \n        \"Apollon, god of the silver bow, whom rich-haired Leto bare.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 3 to Pythian Apollo 183 ff : \n        \"Leto's all-glorious son [Apollon].\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 27 to Artemis 14 ff : \n        \"Neat-ankled Leto bare children [Apollon and Artemis] supreme among the immortals both in thought and in\n        deed.\"\n\nTheognis, Fragment 1. 5 (trans.

The space of the continents did bold Ares watch, sitting armed on the high top of Thrakian Haimos\n        (Thracian Haemus), and his horses were stalled by the seven-chambered cave of Boreas (the North Wind). And the\n        other kept watch over the far-flung islands, even Thaumantia [Iris] seated on Mimas, whither she had sped. There\n        they sat and threatened all the cities which Leto approached and prevented them from receiving her. Fled Arkadia\n        (Arcadia), fled Auge's holy hill Parthenion, fled after her aged Pheneios (Pheneus), fled all the land of Pelops\n        that lies beside the Isthmos (Isthmus), save only Aigialos (Aegaeus) and Argos. For on those ways she set not\n        her feet, since Inakhos (Inachus) belonged unto Hera. Fled, too, Aonia [Boiotia] on the same course, and Dirke\n        (Dirce) and Strophia, holding the hands of their sire, dark-pebbled Ismenos (Ismenus); far behind followed\n        Asopos (Asopus), heavy-kneed, for he was marred by a thunderbolt. And the earth-born nymphe Melia wheeled about\n        thereat and ceased from the dance and her cheek paled as she panted for her coeval oak, when she saw the locks\n        of Helikon (Helicon) tremble [i.e. the oaks of the tree-nymphs trembled in fear] . . .\n        And Apollon, yet in his mother's womb, was sore angered against them and he uttered against Thebe no ineffectual\n        threat : ‘Thebe, wherefore wretched one, dost thou ask the doom that shall be thine anon? Force me not yet\n        to prophesy against my will. Not yet is the tripod seat at Pytho my care . . . Nevertheless I will speak unto\n        thee a word more clear than shall be spoken from the laurel branch. Flee on! Swiftly shall I overtake thee and\n        wash my bow in blood. Thou hast in thy keeping the children of a slanderous woman [i.e. Niobe who insulted Leto\n        and whose children were slain by Apollon and Artemis]. Not thou shalt be my dear nurse, nor Kithairon. Pure am I\n        and may I be the care of them that are pure.’\n        So he spake. And Leto turned and went back. But when the Akhaian cities refused her as she came--Helike, the\n        companion of Poseidon, and Bura, the steading of Dexamenos, the son of Oikeus--she turned her feet back to\n        Thessalia. And Anauros (Anaurus) fled and great Larisa and the cliffs of Kheiron (Chiron); fled, too, Peneios\n        (Peneus), coiling through Tempe.\n        But thy heart, Hera, was even then still pitiless and thou wert not broken down nor didst have compassion, when\n        she [Leto] stretched forth both her arms and spake in vain : ‘Ye Nymphai of Thessalides (Thessalian\n        Nymphs), offspring of a river [Peneios (Peneus)], tell your sire to hush his great stream. Entwine your hands\n        about his beard and entreat him that the children of Zeus be born in his waters. Phtiotian Peneios, why dost\n        thou now vie with the winds? O sire, thou dost not bestride a racing horse. Are they feet always thus swift, or\n        are they swift only for me, and hast thou today been suddenly made to fly?’ But he heard her not. ‘O\n        burden mine, whither shall I carry thee? The hapless sinews of my feet are outworn. O Pelion, bridal chamber of\n        Philyra, do thou stay, O stay, since on thy hills even the wild lionesses oftentimes lay down their travail of\n        untimely birth.’\n        Then shedding tears, Peneios answered her : ‘Leto, Ananke (Necessity) is a great goddess. It is not I who\n        refuse, O Lady, they travail; for I know of others who have washed the soilure of birth in me--but Hera hath\n        largely threatened me. Behold what manner of watcher keeps vigil on the mountain top, who would lightly drag me\n        forth from the depths. What shall I devise? Or is it a pleasant thing to thee that Peneios should perish? Let my\n        destined day take its course. I will endure for thy sake, even if I must wander evermore with ebbing flood and\n        thirsty, and alone be called of least honour among rivers. Here am I! What needeth more? Do thou but call upon\n        Eileithyia.’\n        He spake and stayed his great stream. But Ares was about to lift the peaks of Pangaion (Pangaeum) from their\n        base and hurl them in his eddying waters and hide his streams. And from on high he made a din as of thunder and\n        smote his shield with the point of his spear, and it rang with a warlike noise. And the hills of Ossa trembled\n        and the plain of Krannon (Crannon), and the windswept skirts of Pindos (Pindus), and all Thessalia (Thessaly)\n        danced for fear : such echoing din rang from his shield . . . But Peneios (Peneus) retired not back, but abode\n        his ground, steadfast even as before, and stayed his swift-eddying streams, until the daughter of Koios (Coeus)\n        [Leto] called to him : ‘Save thyself, farewell! Save thyself; do not for my sake suffer evil for this thy\n        compassion; thy favour shall be rewarded.’\n        So she spake and after much toil came unto the Isles (Nesoi) of the sea. But they received her not when\n        she came--not the Ekhinades (Echinades) with their smooth anchorage for ships, not Kerkyra (Corcyra) which is of\n        all other islands most hospitable, since Iris on lofty Mimas was wroth with them all and utterly prevented them.\n        And at her rebuke they fled all together, every one that she came to, along the waters. Then she came unto\n        primeval Kos (Cos), the isle of Merops, the holy retreat of the heroine Khalkiope (Chalciope), but the word of\n        her son [i.e. Apollon in the womb] restrained her : ‘Bear me not, mother, here. I blame not the island nor\n        have any grudge, since a bright isle it is and rich in pasture as any other. But there is due to her from the\n        Moirai (Moirae, Fates) another god . . . Greatly shalt thou praise in all the days to be him that prophesied\n        while yet in his mother's womb. But mark thou, mother : there is to be seen in the water a tiny island,\n        wandering over the seas. Her feet abide not in one place, but on the tide she swims even as stalks of asphodel,\n        where the South Wind or the East Wind blows, withersoever the sea carried her. Thither do thous carry me. For\n        she shall welcome thy coming.’\n        When he had spoken thus much, the other islands in the sea ran away. But thou, Asteria, lover of song, didst\n        come down from Euboia (Euboea) to visit the round Kyklades (Cyclades)--not long ago, but still behind thee\n        trailed the sea-weed of Geraistos (Geraestus) . . ((lacuna)) since they heart was kindled, seeing the unhappy\n        lady in the grievous pangs of birth : ‘Hera, do to me what thou wilt. For I heed not they threats. Cross,\n        cross over, Leto, unto me.’\n        So didst thou speak, and she gladly ceased from her grievous wandering and sat by the stream of Inopos (Inopus),\n        which the earth sends forth in deepest flood at the season when the Neilos (Nile) comes down in full torrent\n        from the Aithiopian (Ethiopian) steep. And she loosed her girdle and leaned back her shoulders against the trunk\n        of a palm-tree, oppressed by the grievous distress, and the sweat poured over her flesh like rain. And she spake\n        in her weakness : ‘Why, child, dost thou weigh down thy mother? There, dear child, is thine island\n        floating on the sea. Be born, be born, my child, and gently issue from the womb.’\n        O Spouse of Zeus, Lady of heavy anger, thou wert not to be for long without tidings thereof : so swift a\n        messenger hastened to thee. And, still breathing heavily, she spake--and her speech was mingled with fear:\n        ‘Honoured Hera, of goddesses most excellent far . . . Leto is undoing her girdle within and island. All\n        the others spurned her and received her not; but Asteria called her by name as she was passing by--Asteria that\n        evil scum of the sea : thou knowest it thyself . . .’\n        And Hera was grievously angered and spake to her [Iris] : ‘So now, O shameful creatures of Zeus, may ye\n        all wed in secret and bring forth in darkness, not even where the poor mill-women bring forth in difficult\n        labour, but where the seals of the sea bring forth, amid the desolate rocks. But against Asteria am I no wise\n        angered for this sin, nor can I do to her so unkindly as I should--for very wrongly has she done a favour to\n        Leto. Howbeit I honour her exceedingly for that she did not desecrate my bed, but instead of Zeus preferred the\n        sea.’\n        She spake: and with music the swans, the gods' own minstrels, left Maionian Paktolos (Maeonian Pactolus) and\n        circled seven times round Delos, and sang over the bed of child-birth, the Mousai's (Muses') birds, most musical\n        of all birds that fly. Hence that child in after days strung the lyre with just so many strings--seven strings,\n        since seven times the swans sang over the pangs of birth. No eight time sang they: ere that the child leapt\n        forth and the Nymphai Deliades (Delian Nymphs), offspring of an ancient river, sang with far-sounding voice the\n        holy chant of Eileithyia. And straightway the brazen sky echoed back the far-reaching chant and Hera grudged it\n        not, because Zeus had taken away her anger. In that hour, O Delos, all thy foundations became of gold: with gold\n        thy round lake flowed all day, and golden foliage thy natal olive-tree put forth and with gold flowed coiled\n        Inopos in deep flood.\n        And thou thyself [Delos] didst take up the child from the golden earth and lay him in thy lap and thou [the baby\n        Apollon] . . . and the child drew the sweet breast.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 5. 2 (trans.

She chanced to see, down in the dale below, a mere of no great size. Some farmfolk\n        there were gathering reeds and leafy osiers and sedge that marshes love. Reaching the edge, Titania [Leto] knelt\n        upon the ground to drink the cooling water, knelt to drink her fill. The group of yokels stopped her.\n        \"Why?\" said she, \"Why keep me from the water? Everyone has right to water. Nature never made the\n        sunshine private more the air we breathe, nor limpid water. No! A common right I've reached. Even so I ask, I\n        humbly ask, please give it me. I do not mean to wash, or bathe my weary limbs, only to quench my thirst. My\n        mouth is dry, as I am speaking, my throat is parched, words hardly find a way. A drink of water--nectar it will\n        be, and life, believe me, too; life you will give with water. And these babies here, who stretch their little\n        arms, must touch your hearts.\" It chanced the twins stretched out their arms. Whom could those words, those\n        gentle words the goddess spoke, not touch? Despite her pleas they stopped her, adding threats unless she went\n        away, and insults too. And, not contents with that, they even stirred the pond with hands and feet, and on the\n        bottom kicked the soft mud about in spiteful leaps. Her thirst gave way to anger. Of such boors she'd asked no\n        favour now, nor speak again in tones beneath a goddess. Raising her hands to heaven, \"Live in that pool of\n        yours,\" she cried, \"For evermore!\" And what she wished came true.

Yet her husband's [Amphion King of Thebes‘] skill, the high birth of\n        them both, their kingdom's power, though all indeed gave pleasure, none could give such pleasure as her\n        children. Niobe must have been thought the happiest of mothers, had she not thought so too. The prophetess Manto\n        daughter of Teiresias (Tiresias), had been spurred by heavenly promptings. Through the city's streets she cried\n        her holy call : ‘Women of Thebes, come in your throngs, with bay wreaths round your hair, and give Latona\n        [Leto] and her children twain incense and reverent worship. Through my lips Latona calls!’\n        And, in obedience, all the Theban women wreathe their brows and bring their prayers and incense to the holy\n        shrine.

Lovely she was, as far as rage allowed, tossing her graceful head and glorious hair that fell upon her\n        shoulders either side. She stopped, and in her full height cast her gaze, her haughty gaze around. ‘What\n        lunacy makes you prefer a fabled god,’ she said, ‘To gods you see? Latona [Leto], why should her\n        shrine be revered, when my divinity lacks incense still? My father's Tantalus, the only mortal gods in heaven\n        allowed to share their banquet-board. My mother ranks as sister of the Pleiades. That great giant, Atlas, whose\n        shoulders bear the circling sky, is one grandfather; Juppiter [Zeus] the other, my husband's father too I'm\n        proud to say. The Phrygian nation fears me. I am mistress of Cadmus' royal house; our city's walls, built by my\n        husband's music, and our people ruled by him and me. Enormous wealth I see throughout my home wherever I turn my\n        gaze; and godlike beauty too is mine. Then add my seven sons and seven daughters and soon my sons' wives and my\n        son-in-laws. Now ask yourselves the reason for my pride, and dare prefer me to that Titanis, whom Coeus sired,\n        whoever he may be, Latona whom the great globe once refused the smallest spot to give her children birth. Not\n        earth, nor sky, nor water would accept your goddess, outcast from the world, until Delos took pity on her\n        wanderings and said, \"You roam the land and I the sea, homeless,\" and gave her drifting refuge there.\n        She bore two children; so her womb was worth a seventh part of mine [i.e. Niobe had fourteen children]. O happy\n        me! (Who would deny it?) And happy I'll remain (Who could doubt that?). My riches make me safe. Yes, I'm too\n        great to suffer Fortuna's blows; much she may take, yet more than much she'll leave. My blessings banish fear.\n        Suppose some part of this my clan of children could be lost, and I bereft, I'll never be reduced to two,\n        Latona's litter--near enough childless! Away with you! Enough of this! Remove those laurels from your\n        hair!’\n        With wreaths removed, they left the ritual unfinished. They worshipped, as they might, in silent words. The\n        goddess [Leto] was outraged; upon the peak of Cynthus she addressed her pair of twins : ‘I, here, your\n        mother, proud to have borne you both, I, who will give no goddess precedence save Juno [Hera], find that my\n        divinity is doubted and unless you children help I'm barred from shrines and altars evermore. Nor is this all\n        that hurts. To injury Tantalis [i.e. Niobe, daughter of Tantalos] adds insult. Yes, she dares set her own\n        children above you, and calls me childless--may that fall on her own head! Her wicked tongue shows her\n        paternity!’\n        To this sad tale Latona had in mind to add to her entreaties, when ‘Enough!’ said Phoebus [Apollon],\n        ‘Long complaints do but delay the punishment,’ and Phoebe [Artemis] said the same. Then clothed in\n        cloud they glided swiftly down and reached the citadel of Cadmeia [Thebes] . . . [and there Apollon slew the\n        seven sons of Niobe with his arrows.]\n        Rumours of havoc, sorrow in the streets, her household's tears brought Niobe the news, news of her sudden ruin.\n        She was shocked that it could happen, angry that the gods had dared so far, that they possessed such power. The\n        father, Amphion, had already plunged a dagger in his heart and by his death ended both life and grief. Ah,\n        Niobe! Alas! How unlike now that Niobe who drove the Thebans from Latona's shrine, who walked her city's streets\n        with head so high, the envy of her friends--whom now her foes, even her foes, must pity! On the cold corpses she\n        threw herself and gave her last kisses convulsively to all her sons. Then raising her bruised arms to heaven,\n        she cried ‘Feast, cruel Latona, feast upon my grief! Yes, glut your savage heart! On seven biers I'm\n        borne. Exult! Triumph in victory! Even so, why victory? My wretchedness still gives me more than you your\n        happiness: after so many deaths I triumph still!’ Hard on her words a bowstring twanged, and all were\n        terrified, save only Niobe. Disaster made her bold . . .

Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          : \n        \"The poetess Praxilla represents Karneios (Carneus) as the son of Europa, Apollon and Leto being his\n        nurses.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 10. 13. 7 :\n        \"The Mantineans [of Arkadia (Arcadia)] dedicated a bronze Apollon [at Delphoi (Delphi), Phokis] . . .\n        Herakles (Heracles) and Apollon are holding on to the tripod, and are preparing to fight about it.

Apollon appeared and threatened him with death if he did not cease from this sacrifice and did\n        not offer up to him the usual goats, sheep and cattle . . . Now Lykios (Lycius) and Harpasos (Harpasus) heard\n        their father [telling them to desist from the sacrifice of asses] but went on telling him to sacrifice the asses\n        . . . they undid the halters of he asses and set to driving towards the altar. The god inflected the asses with\n        a madness and they began to eat up the children, their servants, Klinis (Clinis) too. As they were perishing\n        they cries out to the gods for help . . . Leto and Artemis saw fit to save Klinis, Artemikhe (Artemiche) and\n        Ortygios (Ortygius) for they had not been the cause of these impieties.\n        Apollon granted this favour to Leto and Artemis and changed them all into birds before they could be killed.\n        Klinis became a hypaietos (an under-eagle) . . . Lykios was changed into a raven that was white but\n        later by the wish of Apollon, he became of a sable colour, because he had been the first to announce the\n        marriage of Koronis (Coronis), daughter of Phlegyas, to Alkyoneus (Alcyoneus). Artemikhe became a lark, a bird\n        that gods and humans are fond of.

Grantest thou no end at all of punishment and misery? The\n        whole race of mankind beseeches thee, ay, the very mountains, worthy sire, and weary ridges with their forests\n        supplicate thee. Sufficiently hast thou punished the theft of fire and safeguarded the secrets of the ethereal\n        board.’ . . . He [Zeus] moved by the goddesses' tears and Phoebus' [Apollon's] high renown sends down\n        swift Iris on her rosy cloud. ‘Go,’ he says, ‘let Alcides [Herakles] . . . rescue the Titan\n        from the dreadful Bird.’\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 24. 94 ff (trans.

Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"I learn that the Cock is the favourite bird of Leto. The reason is, they say, that he was at her side when\n        she was so happily brought to bed of twins. That is why to this very day a Cock is at hand when women are in\n        travail, and is believed somehow to promote an easy delivery.\"\n\nAelian, On Animals 10. 47 :\n        \"The Ichneumon (mongoose) is both male and female in the same individual, partaking of both sexes, and\n        nature has enabled each single same animal both to procreate and to give birth . . .

The first\n        men who gave names [to the gods] were no ordinary persons, but high thinkers and great talkers . . . Leto [is\n        named] from her gentleness, because whatever is asked of her, she is willing (ethelêmôn).\n        But perhaps her name is Letho, as she is called by many foreigners; and those who call her by that name seem to\n        do so on account of the mild and gentle (leion, lêthô) kindness of her\n        character.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Servius on Virgil's Aeneid 3.72, Orphica Argonautica 975.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
