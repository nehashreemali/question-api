  "content": "EOS was the rosy-fingered goddess of the dawn. She and her siblings Helios (the Sun)\n        and Selene (the Moon) were numbered amongst the second-generation Titan gods. Eos rose into the sky from the river Okeanos (Oceanus) at the start of each day, and with her rays of light dispersed\n        the mists of night.\n\nShe was depicted either driving a chariot drawn by winged horses or borne aloft on her own wings.\n\nEos had an unquenchable desire for handsome young men, some say as the result of a curse laid upon her by the\n        goddess Aphrodite. Her lovers included Orion, Phaethon, Kephalos (Cephalus)\n        and Tithonos (Tithonus), three of which she ravished away to distant lands. The Trojan prince Tithonos became\n        her official consort. When the goddess petitioned Zeus for his immortality,\n        she neglected also to request eternal youth. In time he shrivelled up by old age and transformed into a\n        grasshopper.\n\nEos was closely identified with Hemera, the primordial goddess of day.\n        In some myths--such as the tales of Orion and Kephalos--Eos stood virtually as a non-virginal substitute for Artemis.\n\n[1.1] HYPERION & THEIA (Hesiod Theogony 371, Apollodorus 1.8, Hyginus Pref, Ovid Fasti 5.159)\n        [1.2] HYPERION & EURYPHAESSA (Homeric Hymn 31 to Helios)\n        [2.1] PALLAS (Ovid Fasti 4.373, Valerius Flaccus\n          2.72)\n\n[1.1] THE ANEMOI (BOREAS, ZEPHYROS, NOTOS), THE ASTRA (EOSPHOROS) (by Astraios) (Hesiod Theogony 378, Apollodorus\n          1.9)\n        [1.2] BOREAS, ZEPHYROS, NOTOS (by Astraios) (Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.3] BOREAS, ZEPHYROS, NOTOS, EUROS, EOSPHOROS (by Astraios) (Nonnus Dionysiaca 6.18 & 37.70 & 47.340)\n        [1.4] HESPEROS (by Kephalos) (Hyginus\n          Astronomica)\n        [2.1] ASTRAIA (by Astraios) (Hyginus Astronomica)\n        [3.1] MEMNON, EMATHION (by Tithonos) (Hesiod Theogony 984, Apollodorus 3.147)\n        [3.2] MEMNON (by Tithonos) (Aethiopis Frag 1, Quintus Smyrnaeus 2.549, Pindar\n          Nemean 6 str3, Diodorus Siculus 4.75.4, Callistratus Descriptions 9, Ovid Fasti 4.713)\n        [3.3] MEMNON (Philostratus Elder 1.7, Callistratus Descriptions 1)\n        [4.1] PHAETHON-TITHONOS (by Kephalos) (Hesiod\n          Theogony 984, Apollodorus 3.181, Pausanias 1.3.1)\n\nEOS (Êôs), in Latin Aurora, the goddess of the morning red, who brings up the light of day\n        from the east. She was a daughter of Hyperion and Theia or Euryphassa, and a sister of Helios and Selene. (Hes.\n        Theog. 371, &c.; Hom. Hymn in Sol. ii.) Ovid (Met. ix. 420, Fast. iv.\n        373) calls her a daughter of Pallas. At the close of night she rose front the couch of her beloved Tithonus, and\n        on a chariot drawn by the swift horses Lampus and Phaëton she ascended up to heaven from the river Oceanus,\n        to announce the coming light of the sun to the gods as well as to mortals. (Hom. Od. v. 1, &c.,\n        xxiii. 244; Virg. Aen. iv. 129, Georg. i. 446; Hom. Hymn in Merc. 185; Theocrit. ii.\n        148, xiii. 11.) In the Homeric poems Eos not only announces the coming Helios, but accompanies him throughout\n        the day, and her career is not complete till the evening; hence she is sometimes mentioned where one would have\n        expected Helios (Od. v. 390, x. 144); and the tragic writers completely identify her with Hemera, of\n        whom in later times the same myths are related as of Eos. (Paus. i. 3. § 1, iii. 18. § 7.) The later\n        Greek and the Roman poets followed, on the whole, the notions of Eos, which Homer had established, and the\n        splendour of a southern aurora, which lasts much longer than in our climate, is a favourite topic with the\n        ancient poets. Mythology represents her as having carried off several youths distinguished for their beauty.\n        Thus she carried away Orion, but the gods were angry at her for it, until Artemis with a gentle arrow killed\n        him. (Hom. Od. v. 121.) According to Apollodorus (i. 4. § 4) Eos carried Orion to Delos, and was\n        ever stimulated by Aphrodite. Cleitus, the son of Mantius, was carried by Eos to the seats of the immortal gods\n        (Od. xv. 250), and Tithonus, by whom she became the mother of Emathion and Memnon, was obtained in like\n        manner. She begged of Zeus to make him immortal, but forgot to request him to add eternal youth. So long as he\n        was young and beautiful, she lived with him at the end of the earth, on the banks of Oceanus ; and when he grew\n        old, she nursed him, until at length his voice disappeared and his body became quite dry. She then locked the\n        body up in her chamber, or metamorphosed it into a cricket. (Hom. Hymn. in Ven. 218, &c.; Horat.\n        Carm. i. 22. 8, ii. 16. 30; Apollod. iii. 12. § 4; Hes. Theog. 984; Serv. ad Virg.\n          Georg. i. 447, iii. 328, Aen. iv. 585.) When her son Memnon was going to fight against Achilles,\n        she asked Hephaestus to give her arms for him, and when Memnon was killed, her tears fell down in the form of\n        morning dew. (Virg. Aen. viii. 384.) By Astraeus Eos became the mother of Zephyrus, Boreas, Notus,\n        Heosphorus, and the other stars. (Hesiod. Theog. 378.) Cephalus was carried away by her from the summit\n        of mount Hymetttus to Syria, and by him she became the mother of Phaëton or Tithonus, the father of\n        Phaëton; but afterwards she restored her beloved to his wife Procris. (Hes. Theog. 984; Apollod.\n        iii. 14. § 3; Paus. i. 3. § 1; Ov. Met. vii. 703, &c.; Hygin. Fab 189.) Eos was\n        represented in the pediment of the kingly stoa at Athens in the act of carrying off Cephalus, and in the same\n        manner she was seen on the throne of the Amyclaean Apollo. (Paus. i. 3. § 1, iii. 18. § 7.) At Olympia\n        she was represented in the act of praying to Zeus for Memnon. (v. 22. 2.) In the works of art still extant, she\n        appears as a winged goddess or in a chariot drawn by four horses.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 371 ff (trans.

He refused, since he had given his\n        promise to Procris. Then Aurora said : ‘I don't want you to break faith, unless she has done so before\n        you.’ And so she changed his form into that of a stranger, and gave him beautiful gifts to give to\n        Procris. When Cephalus had come in his changed form, he gave the gifts to Procris and lay with her. Then Aurora\n        took away his new appearance. When Procris saw Cephalus, she knew she had been deceived by Aurora, and fled to\n        the island of Crete . . . \n        [Procris was eventually reunited with Cephalus] nevertheless out of fear of Aurora she followed him to watch him\n        in the early morning, and hid among the bushes.

Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Within two months after our [Kephalos (Cephalus) and Prokris' (Procris')] marriage, while I [Kephalos]\n        spread my nets to catch the antlered deer, the saffron Aurora [Eos the Dawn], above Hymettus' ever-flowery peak,\n        saw me at daybreak as the twilight fled, and carried me away against my will. And may the goddess pardon me, if\n        I say what is true : her rosy cheeks are fair, she rules the borderlands of dark and day, she drinks the\n        nectar's honeydew, but I loved Procris, Procris ever in my heart, and Procris on my lips. I spoke of bonds of\n        holy wedlock, of love's fresh delights, my vows so new and my deserted bride, until in rage the goddess cried :\n        ‘Enough of your complaining! Have your Procris! But, if I can see the future, you will rue the day you had\n        her,’ and so sent me back. On my way home the goddess' prophecy began to form, fear that my wife had\n        failed her marriage vows . . . Intent on heartbreak I resolved to test her loyalty with presents. And Aurora\n        [Eos] favoured my fears and changed my form and face (If felt the change) and so I entered Athens unrecognisable\n        and made my way back home . . . [and attempted to seduce his wife in the form of another man. Prokris failed the\n        test and fled him, but the two were eventually reconciled.]\n        I would go hunting when the sun's first beams coloured the hilltops, as a young man will, roving the woods alone\n        . . . and when my hand had had its fill of sport I used to seek the coolness of the shade and of the breeze, the\n        aura breathing from the chilly dales. I sought the gentle aura in the heat, I waited for the\n        aura, for its balm, my labour's rest. ‘Come, aura,’ I would call, how I remember!\n        ‘soothe me, welcome guest, come to my breast, relieve, as is your way, the heat with which I burn.’\n        And I might add, so my fate led me on, more blandishments. ‘You comfort and refresh me. For your sake I\n        love the lonely places and the woods; your breath I seek for ever on my lips.’\n        Some fool who overheard my words mistook the double sense and thought that aura (breeze) called so\n        often was the goddess [Aurora, Eos the Dawn], and I in love. This hasty tell-tale hurried off to Procris and\n        told in whispers my supposed offence. Love will believe too soon. In sudden grief she swooned, they told me,\n        then, restored at last, bemoaned her misery, her cruel fate, accused my honour and, imagining a false offence,\n        feared a mere nothing, feared an insubstantial name, poor soul, and grieved as over a true rival paramour. Yet\n        she had doubts and in her wretchedness hoped she was wrong, refusing to accept the tale or, till her eyes had\n        evidence convict her husband of such villainy.\n        Next day the gleam of dawn had banished night and out into the woods I went and found good sport and, lying on\n        the grass, I called ‘Come, aura (breeze), come and soothe my weariness! And suddenly, as I spoke,\n        I seemed to hear a sound of moaning, but I called again ‘Come, best and loveliest!’ A falling leaf\n        made a slight rustle and I thought it was some lurking beast and hurled my [magic never-failing] javelin. It was\n        my wife! Clutching her wounded breast, ‘Ay me! Ay me!’ she cried. I knew her voice, my Procris'\n        voice, and like a madman rushed headlong towards the sound. And there, half-dead, her clothes blood-splattered,\n        plucking from the wound the gift (heaven help me!) she had given me, I found her . . .\n        Exhausted then and dying, these few words she forced herself to murmur : ‘By our vows of wedlock, by the\n        gods of home and heaven, by my deserts, if I have well deserved, by my death's cause, my own still-living love,\n        I beg you, I implore you, not to take Aura [that is, Aurora or Eos] to be your wife in place of my.’ And\n        then at last I learnt of her mistake and told her all. But what did telling help? She slipped away; what little\n        strength was left ebbed with her failing blood; and while her eyes had power still to gaze, she gazed at me, and\n        on my lips her life's last breath was spent; but she looked glad and seemed to die content.\"\n        [N.B. \"aura\" was also the Greek word for breeze.

The Gods gathered them up\n        from many lands, and made thereof a far-resounding river, named of all that dwell beneath long Ida's flanks\n        Paphlagoneion. As its waters flow twixt fertile acres, once a year they turn to blood, when comes the woeful day\n        whereon died Memnon. Thence a sick and choking reek steams : thou wouldst say that from a wound unhealed\n        corrupting humours breathed an evil stench. Ay, so the Gods ordained : but now flew on bearing Eos' mighty son\n        the rushing Aetai (Winds) skimming earth's face and palled about with night.\n        Nor were his Aithiopian (Ethiopian) comrades left to wander of their King forlorn : a God [Eos] suddenly winged\n        those eager souls with speed such as should soon be theirs for ever, changed to flying fowl, the children of the\n        air. Wailing their King in the winds' track they sped . . . so they left far behind that stricken field of\n        blood, and fast they followed after those swift Aetai (Winds) with multitudinous moaning, veiled in mist\n        unearthly. Trojans over all the plain and Danaans marvelled, seeing that great host vanishing with their King.\n        All hearts stood still in dumb amazement. But the tireless Aetai (Winds) sighing set hero Memnon's giant corpse\n        down by the deep flow of Aisepos' (Aesepus') stream, where is a fair grove of the bright-haired Nymphai\n        (Nymphs), the which round his long barrow afterward Aisepos' daughters planted, screening it with many and\n        manifold trees: and long and loud wailed those Immortals, chanting his renown, the son of Erigeneia (the\n        Dawn-goddess) splendour-throned.\n        Now sank the sun: Eos (the Lady of the Morn) wailing her dear child from the heavens came down. Twelve maidens\n        [the twelve Horai, Hours] shining-tressed attended her, the warders of the high paths of the sun for ever\n        circling, warders of the night and dawn . . . These came down from heaven, for Memnon wailing wild and high; and\n        mourned with these the Pleiades [star-nymphs]. Echoed round far-stretching mountains, and Aisepos' stream.\n        Ceaseless uprose the keen, and in their midst, fallen on her son and clasping, wailed Eos; ‘Dead art thou,\n        dear, dear child, and thou hast clad thy mother with a pall of grief. Oh, I, now thou art slain, will not endure\n        to light the Immortal Heavenly Ones! No, I will plunge down to the dread depths of the underworld, where thy\n        lone spirit flitteth to and fro, and will to blind night leave earth, sky, and sea, till Khaeos (Chaos) and\n        formless darkness brood o'er all, that Kronos' (Cronus') son [Zeus] may also learn what means anguish of heart.\n        For not less worship-worthy than Nereos' (Nereus') Child, by Zeus's ordinance, am I, who look on all things, I,\n        who bring all to their consummation. Recklessly my light Zeus now despiseth! Therefore I will pass into the\n        darkness. Let him bring up to Olympos Thetis from the sea to hold for him light forth to Gods and men!\n        My sad soul loveth darkness more than day, lest I pour light upon thy slayer's head.’\n        Thus as she cried, the tears ran down her face immortal, like a river brimming aye : drenched was the dark earth\n        round the corse. Nyx (the Night) grieved in her daughter's anguish, and the heaven drew over all his stars a\n        veil of mist and cloud, of love unto Erigeneia (the Lady of Light).\n        All night in groans and sighs most pitiful Eos (the Dawn-queen) lay: a sea of darkness moaned around her. Of the\n        dayspring nought she recked: she loathed Olympos' spaces. At her side fretted and whinnied still her fleetfoot\n        steeds, trampling the strange earth, gazing at their Queen grief-stricken, yearning for the fiery course.\n        Suddenly crashed the thunder of the wrath of Zeus; rocked round her all the shuddering earth, and on immortal\n        Eos trembling came.\n        Swiftly the dark-skinned Aethiopes (Ethiopians) from her sight buried their lord lamenting. As they wailed\n        unceasingly, Erigeneia (the Dawn-queen) lovely-eyed changed them to birds sweeping through air around the barrow\n        of the mighty dead. And these still do the tribes of men ‘The Memnones’ call; and still with wailing\n        cries they dart and wheel above their king's tomb, and they scatter dust down on his grave, still shrill the\n        battle-cry, in memory of Memnon, each to each. But he in Haides' mansions, or perchance amid the Blessed on the\n        Elysian Plain, laugheth. Divine Eos comforteth her heart beholding them : but theirs is toil of strife unending,\n        till the weary victors strike the vanquished dead, or one and all fill up the measure of their doom around his\n        grave.\n        So by command of Erigeneia (Lady of Light) the swift birds dree their weird. But Eos (Dawn) divine now\n        heavenward soared with the all-fostering Horai (Hours), who drew her to Zeus' threshold, sorely loth, yet\n        conquered by their gentle pleadings, such as salve the bitterest grief of broken hearts. Nor Eos (the\n        Dawn-queen) forgat her daily course, but quailed before the unbending threat of Zeus, of whom are all things,\n        even all comprised within the encircling sweep of Okeanos' (Oceanus') stream, Earth and the palace-dome of\n        burning stars.

But when\n        his limbs were laid on the last flames, she could not bear to look.

Black rolling smoke darkened the\n        daylight, as a stream breathes forth the mist it breeds that lets no sunlight through. Up flew black ashes, and\n        they clustered thick into a single mass, which took a shape and from the fire drew heat and breath of life. Its\n        lightness gave it wings and like a bird at first, and presently a real bird, its great wings whirred and with it\n        sister-birds whirred beyond counting, all from the same source. Three times they circled round the pyre; three\n        times their cries, united, echoed through the air. One the fourth flight the flock split up; then two fierce\n        legions, so divided, fought each other with claws and beaks in full fury, till their wings and battling breasts\n        were weary; then they fell, death-offerings, on the ash whose kin they were, recalling that brave soul from whom\n        they sprang. He who begot them gave those sudden birds their name ‘Memnonides’ ; and when the sun\n        has coursed through the twelve signs, they fight again to die in memory of Memnon slain . . .
