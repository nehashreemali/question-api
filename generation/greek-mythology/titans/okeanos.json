  "content": "OKEANOS (Oceanus) was the primordial Titan god of the great, earth-encircling River Okeanos, font of all of the earth's fresh-water - rivers, wells,\n        springs and rain-clouds. He was also the god who regulated the heavenly bodies which rose from and set into his\n        waters.\n        Okeanos' wife Tethys \"the Nurse\" was probably envisioned distributing\n        his nourishing waters across the earth through subterranean acquifers. Their children were the Potamoi, gods of rivers, and the Okeanides (Oceanids), nymphs of springs and fountains. Unlike his\n        Titan-brothers Okeanos did not participate in the castration of their father Ouranos nor join the war against Zeus and the Olympian gods.\n\nOkeanos was probably identical to Ophion, an elder Titan in the Orphic myths who\n        ruled heaven briefly before being wrestled and cast into the Ocean stream by Kronos\n          (Cronus).\n\nOkeanos was depicted in ancient Greek vase painting as a bull-horned god with the tail of a serpentine fish, a\n        form shared by his River-God sons. His usual attributes were a fish and serpent.\n\nIn the Hellenistic era, Okeanos was reimagined as the god of the then increasingly accessible Atlantic and\n        Indian Oceans, and the old cosmological idea of a great, earth-encircling, fresh-water stream was discarded. In\n        mosaic art he is therefore usually depicted as a sea-god or the sea itself personified, with crab-claw horns,\n        and for attributes, a serpent, oar and school of fish. His wife Tethys, shown seated beside him, had wings on\n        her brow, in her role as the mother of rain-clouds.\n\n[1.1] OURANOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 133, Apollodorus 1.2, Diodorus Siculus 5.66.1)\n        [1.2] AITHER (or OURANOS) &\n        GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] THE OKEANIDES, THE POTAMOI\n        (by Tethys) (Hesiod Theogony 133, Aeschylus\n          Prometheus Bound 139, Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.2] THE POTAMOI (by Tethys) (Aeschylus Seven 304, Diodorus Siculus 4.69.1, Hyginus Preface, Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          23.280)\n        [1.3] THE POTAMOI (Homer Iliad 21.190,\n          Philostratus Elder 2.8)\n        [1.4] THE OKEANIDES (by Tethys) (Apollodorus 1.8, Calimachus Hymns 3.40, Nonnus Dionysiaca 38.108)\n        [2.1] THE AURAI (Homer Odyssey 4.561)\n        [3.1] THE NEPHELAI (Aristophanes Clouds\n          264)\n        [4.1] THE KERKOPES (by Theia) (Homerica\n          Cercopes Frag 1)\n        [5.1] TRIPTOLEMOS (by Gaia) (Pherecydes Frag, Apollodorus\n          1.32)\n        [6.1] THE LIMNAI (DNonnus ionysiaca\n          6.352)\n\nOCE′ANUS (Ôkeanos), the god of the river Oceanus, by which, according to the most ancient notions\n        of the Greeks, the whole earth was surrounded. An account of this river belongs to mythical geography, and we\n        shall here confine ourselves to describing the place which Oceanus holds in the ancient cosmogony. In the\n        Homeric poems he appears as a mighty god, who yields to none save Zeus. (Il. xiv. 245, xx. 7, xxi.\n        195.) Homer does not mention his parentage, but calls Tethys his wife, by whom he had three daughters, Thetis,\n        Eurynome and Perse. (Il. xiv. 302, xviii. 398, Od. x. 139.) His palace is placed somewhere in\n        the west (Il. xiv. 303, &c.), and there he and Tethys brought up Hera, who was conveyed to them at\n        the time when Zeus was engaged in the struggle with the Titans. Hesiod (Theog. 133, 337, &c., 349,\n        &c.) calls Oceanus a son of Uranus and Gaea, the eldest of the Titans, and the husband of Tethys, by whom he\n        begot 3000 rivers, and as many Oceanides, of whom Hesiod mentions only the eldest. (Comp. Apollod. iii. 8.\n        § 1, 10. § 1.) This poet (Theog. 282) also speaks of sources of Oceanus. Representations of\n        the god are seen on imperial coins of Tyre and Alexandria.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 132 ff (trans.

Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[Enter Okeanos (Oceanus) on a winged steed.] [Prometheus is chained to a crag in the Kaukasos (Caucasus)\n        mountains.]\n        Okeanos : I have come to the end of a long journey in my passage to you, Prometheus, guiding by my own will,\n        without a bridle, this swift-winged bird. For your fate, you may be sure, I feel compassion. Kinship, I think,\n        constrains me to this; and, apart from blood ties, there is none to whom I should pay greater respect than to\n        you. You shall know this for simple truth and that it is not in me to utter vain and empty words; come, tell me;\n        what aid can I render you? For you shall never say that you have a friend more loyal than Okeanos.\n        Prometheus : Ha! What have we here? So then you too have come to stare upon my sufferings? How did you summon\n        courage to quit the stream that bears your name and the rock-roofed caves you yourself have made and come to\n        this land, the mother of iron? Is it that you have come to gaze upon my state and join your grief to my\n        distress? Look upon me here--a spectacle, the friend of Zeus, who helped him to establish his sovereign power,\n        by what anguish I am bent by him!\n        Okeanos : I see, Prometheus; and I want to give you the best advice, although you yourself are wily. Learn to\n        know yourself and adapt yourself to new ways; for new also is the ruler among the gods. If you hurl forth words\n        so harsh and of such whetted edge, perhaps Zeus may hear you, though throned far off, high in the heavens, and\n        then your present multitude of sorrows shall seem but childish sport. Oh wretched sufferer! Put away your\n        wrathful mood and try to find release from these miseries. Perhaps this advice may seem to you old and dull; but\n        your plight, Prometheus, is only the wages of too boastful speech. You still have not learned humility, nor do\n        you bend before misfortune, but would rather add even more miseries to those you have. Therefore take me as your\n        teacher and do not add insult to injury, seeing that a harsh monarch now rules who is accountable to no one. So\n        now I will depart and see whether I can release you from these sufferings. And may you hold your peace and be\n        not too blustering of speech. Or, can it be that for all your exceeding wisdom, you do not know that\n        chastisement is inflicted on a wagging tongue? \n        Prometheus : I envy you because you have escaped blame for having dared to share with me in my troubles. So now\n        leave me alone and let it not concern you. Do what you want, you cannot persuade him; for he is not easy to\n        persuade. Beware that you do not do yourself harm by the mission you take.\n        Okeanos : In truth, you are far better able to admonish others than yourself. It is by fact, not by hearsay,\n        that I judge. So do not hold back one who is eager to go. For I am confident, yes, confident, that Zeus will\n        grant me this favor, to free you from your sufferings.\n        Prometheus : But you are not inexperienced, and do not need me to teach you. Save yourself, as you know best;\n        while I exhaust my present lot until the time comes when the mind of Zeus shall abandon its wrath.\n        Okeanos : Do you not know then, Prometheus, that words are the physicians of a disordered temper?\n        Prometheus : If one softens the soul in season, and does not hasten to reduce its swelling rage by violence.\n        Okeanos : What lurking mischief do you see when daring joins to zeal? Teach me this. \n        Prometheus : Lost labor and thoughtless simplicity. \n        Okeanos : Leave me to be affected by this, since it is most advantageous, when truly wise, to be deemed a\n        fool.\n        Prometheus : This fault will be seen to be my own. \n        Okeanos : Clearly the manner of your speech orders me back home.\n        Prometheus : So that you won't win enmity for yourself by lamenting for me. \n        Okeanos : In the eyes of the one who is newly seated on his omnipotent throne?\n        Prometheus : Beware lest the time come when his heart is angered with you. \n        Okeanos: Your plight, Prometheus, is my instructor. \n        Prometheus : Go away, depart, keep your present purpose.\n        Okeanos : Your urging meets my eagerness; for my four-footed winged beast fans with his wings the smooth pathway\n        of the air; and truly he will be glad to rest his knees in his stall at home.\n        [Exit.]\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 14. 311 ff (trans.
