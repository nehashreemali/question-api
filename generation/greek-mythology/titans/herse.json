  "content": "HERSE was the goddess of the dew, a daughter of the rain-god Zeus and moon-goddess Selene. Her moisture\n        nourished the plants of the earth.\n\nHerse was perhaps the same as Pandeia, a daughter of the same gods mentioned in the\n        Homeric Hymns. Another Herse, a heroine daughter of King Kekrops (Cecrops), was worshipped by the\n        Athenians.\n\nAlcman, Fragment 57 (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric II) (Greek lyric C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Such things as are nurtured by Ersa (Dew), daughter of Zeus and Selene (Moon).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
