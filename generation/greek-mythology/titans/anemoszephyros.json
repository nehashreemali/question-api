  "content": "ZEPHYROS (Zephyrus) was the god of the west wind, one of the four seasonal Anemoi (Wind-Gods). He was also the\n        god of spring, the husband of Khloris (Chloris) (Greenery), and\n        father of Karpos (Carpus, Fruit).\n\nIn myth Zephyros was a rival of the god Apollon for the love of\n        Hyakinthos (Hyacinthus). One day he spied the pair playing a game of quoits in a meadow, and in a jealous rage,\n        blew the disc off-course with a gust of wind, causing it to strike the boy in the head killing him instantly.\n        Apollon, stricken with grief, transformed the dying youth into a larkspur flower.\n\nZephyros was depicted in classical art as a handsome, winged youth. In Greek vase painting, the unlabelled\n        figures of a winged god embracing a youth are often identified as Zephyros and Hyakinthos--although some\n        commentators interpret them as Eros (Love) with a generic youth. In\n        Greco-Roman mosaic the god usually appears in the guise of spring personified carrying a basket of unripe fruit.\n\n[1.1] ASTRAIOS & EOS (Hesiod Theogony 378, Hyginus Pref, Nonnus Dionysiaca 6.18 & 47.340)\n        [2.1] GAIA (Aeschylus Agamemnon\n          690)\n\n[1.1] XANTHOS, BALIOS (by Podarge) (Homer Iliad 16.149, Quintus Smyrnaeus 3.743)\n        [2.1] EROS (by Iris) (Alcaeus Frag 327)\n        [2.2] POTHOS (by Iris) (Nonnus Dionysiaca 47.340)\n        [3.1] AREION (by a Harpyia) (Quintus Smyrnaeus 4.569)\n        [4.1] KARPOS (by Khloris) (Ovid\n          Fasti)\n        [5.1] THE TIGERS (Oppian Cynegetica 3.350)\n\nZE′PHYRUS (Zephuros), the personification of the west wind, is described by Hesiod (Theog. 579)\n        as a son of Astraeus and Eos. Zephyrus and Boreas are frequently mentioned together by Homer, and both dwelt\n        together in a palace in Thrace. (Il. ix. 5, Od. v. 295.) By the Harpy Podarge, Zephyrus became\n        the father of the horses Xanthus and Balius, which belonged to Achilles (Hom. Il. xvi. 150, &c.);\n        but he was married to Chloris, whom he had carried off by force, and by whom he had a son Carpus. (Ov.\n        Fast. v. 197; Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. v. 48.)

The winged youth you see is an indication that a song is being sung, for he is\n        the wind Zephyros (the West Wind) and he gives the swans the keynote of their song. He is painted as a tender\n        and graceful boy in token of the nature of the south-west wind, and the wings of the swans are unfolded that the\n        breezes may strike them.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 11 :\n        \"[From a description of an ancient Greek painting depicting the fall of Phaethon :] In his passion for\n        driving [Phaethon] the son of Helios (the Sun) ventured to mount his father's chariot, but because he did not\n        keep a firm rein he came to grief and fell into the Eridanos (Eridanus) . . . Now the youth is thrown from the\n        chariot and is falling headlong--for his hair is on fire and his breast smouldering with the heat; his fall will\n        end in the river Eridanos and will furnish this stream with a mythical tale. For swans scattered about,\n        breathing sweet notes, will hymn the youth; and flocks of swans rising aloft will sing the story to\n        Kaÿstros (Cayster) and Istros (Istrus) [rivers of Lykia (Lycia) and Skythia (Scythia)]; nor will any place\n        fail to hear the strange story. And they will have Zephyros (the West Wind), nimble god of wayside shrines, to\n        accompany their song, for it is said that Zephyros has made a compact with the swans to join them in the music\n        of the dirge. This agreement is even now being carried out, for look! The wind is playing on the swans as on\n        musical instruments.\"\n\nThe Lyric poets made Zephyros the father of Pothos (Passion) by Iris the rainbow. The imagery of rainbow\n        (iris) and west wind (zephyros) symbolised the variegated brilliance of passion\n        (pothos). It was also a play on the love story of Zephyros and Hyakinthos (Hyacinthus), who was\n        tranformed into an iris-flower on his death--\"iris\" in Greek was the word for both the flower and the\n        rainbow.\n\nAlcaeus, Fragment 327 (from Plutarch, Dialogue on Love) (trans.

Fast in mad onrush, fast across the deep they darted; roared beneath them as they flew the sea, the land;\n        above crashed thunder-voiced clouds headlong hurtling through the firmament. Then by decree of Zeus down on the\n        pyre of slain Akhilleus, like a charging host swooped they; upleapt the Fire-god's madding breath: uprose a long\n        wail from the Myrmidons. then, though with whirlwind rushes toiled the Anemoi (Winds), all day, all night, they\n        needs must fan the flames ere that death-pyre burned out. Up to the heavens vast-volumed rolled the smoke. The\n        huge tree-trunks groaned, writhing, bursting, in the heat, and dropped the dark-grey ash all round.
