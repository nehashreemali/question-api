  "content": "PASIPHAE was an immortal daughter of the sun-god Helios. Like her siblings, Aeetes and Kirke (Circe), she was a skilled practitioner of witchcraft (pharmakeia).\n\nPasiphae married King Minos of Krete (Crete) and bore him a number of sons and daughters. As punishment for\n        some offence against the gods--committed either by herself or her husband--she was cursed with lust for the\n        king's finest bull. The queen enlisted the help of the artisan Daidalos (Daedalus) who built her an animate,\n        wooden cow wrapped in bovine-skin. Hidden inside the contraption she coupled with the bull and conceived a\n        hybrid child--the bull-headed Minotauros (Minotaur).\n\nPasiphae's husband King Minos also proved unfaithful. When she learned of his indiscretions she bewitched him,\n        causing him to ejaculate poisoned creatures and destroy his lovers. Pasiphae herself, being an immortal, was\n        alone immune to the spell. Minos was later cured by the Athenian girl Prokris (Procris) who devised a remedy for\n        the strange afflication.\n\nPasiphae was an early Kretan moon-goddess similar to the classical Selene. Both her\n        taurine lover and her Minotaur son--who was also named Asterios (Starry One)--were associated with the constellation Taurus.\n\n[1.1] HELIOS & PERSEIS (Apollodorus 1.80, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.19)\n        [1.2] HELIOS (Apollonius Rhodius 3.997, Antoninus Liberalis\n          41, Hyginus Fabulae 40, Ovid Metamorphoses 9.737, Seneca Phaedra 112)\n        [1.3] HELIOS & KRETE (Diodorus Siculus 4.60.4)\n\n[1.1] THE MINOTAUROS (by the Kretan\n          Bull) (Apollodorus 3.8, Diodorus Siculus 4.77.1, Philostratus the Elder 1.16,\n          Hyginus Fabulae 40, Ovid Metamorphoses 8.132, Seneca Phaedra 112, Nonnus Dionysiaca 47.395, Suidas)\n        [2.1] KATREUS, DEUKALION, GLAUKOS, ANDROGEOS, AKALLE, XENODIKE, ARIADNE,\n        PHAIDRA (by Minos) (Apollodorus 3.7)\n        [2.2] ARIADNE, DEUKALION, KATREUS, ANDROGEUS (by Minos) (Diodorus Siculus 4.60.4)\n        [2.3] ARIADNE (by Minos) (Apollonius Rhodius\n          3.997)\n        [2.4] IDOMENEUS (by Minos) (Pausanias 5.25.9)\n        [2.5] ASTERIOS (by Minos) (Nonnus Dionysiaca 40.290)\n        [2.6] DEUKALION (by Minos) (Hyginus Fabulae 14)\n        [2.7] PHAEDRA, ARIADNE (by Minos) (Ovid\n          Heroides 4.53 & 157, Seneca Phaedra 112)\n\nPAST′PHAE (Pasiphaê). 1.

Even so, in return for the fleet hound and the straight-hitting javelin that Minos owned, and\n        after giving him a potion made from the Kirkaian (Circaean) root to keep him from hurting her, she went to bed\n        with him.\"\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 41 (trans.

Now Minos would ejaculate snakes, scorpions and millipedes, killing the women with whom he had\n        intercourse.\n        But his wife Pasiphae, daughter of Helios the Sun, was immortal. Prokris accordingly devised the following to\n        make Minos fertile. She inserted the bladder of a goat into a woman and Minos first emitted the snakes into the\n        bladder; then he went over to Pasiphae and entered her.

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Minos aspired to the throne [of Krete (Crete)], but was rebuffed. He claimed, however, that he had\n        received the sovereignty from the gods, and to prove it he said that whatever he prayed for would come about. So\n        while sacrificing to Poseidon, he prayed for a bull to appear from the depths of the sea, and promised to\n        sacrifice it upon its appearance. And Poseidon did send up to him a splendid bull. Thus Minos received the rule,\n        but he sent the bull to his herds and sacrificed another . . .\n        Poseidon was angry that the bull was not sacrificed, and turned it wild. He also devised that Pasiphae should\n        develop a lust for it. In her passion for the bull she took on as her accomplice an architect named Daidalos\n        (Daedalus) . . . He built a wooden cow on wheels, . . . skinned a real cow, and sewed the contraption into the\n        skin, and then, after placing Pasiphae inside, set it in a meadow where the bull normally grazed. The bull came\n        up and had intercourse with it, as if with a real cow. Pasiphae gave birth to Asterios (Asterius), who was\n        called Minotauros (Minotaur). He had the face of a bull, but was otherwise human. Minos, following certain\n        oracular instructions, kept him confined and under guard in the labyrinth. This labyrinth, which Daidalos built,\n        was a cage with convoluted flextions that disorders debouchment.”\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 4 to Delos 311 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"[Theseus] having escaped the cruel bellowing and the wild on of Pasiphae and the coiled habitation of the\n        crooked labyrinth.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 13. 4 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The next Labour which Herakles undertook was to bring back from Krete (Crete) the bull of which, they say,\n        Pasiphae had been enamoured.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 77. 1 : \n        \"Now according to the myth which was handed down to us Pasiphae, the wife of Minos, became enamoured of the\n        bull, and Daidalos (Daedalus), by fashioning a contrivance in the shape of a cow, assisted Pasiphae to gratify\n        her passion. In explanation of this the myths offer the following account: before this time it had been the\n        custom of Minos annually to dedicate to Poseidon the fairest bull born in his herds and to sacrifice it to the\n        god; but at the time in question there was born a bull of extraordinary beauty and he sacrificed another from\n        among those which were inferior, whereupon Poseidon becoming angry at Minos, caused his wife Pasiphae to become\n        enamoured of the bull. And by means of the ingenuity of Daidalos Pasiphae had intercourse with the bull and gave\n        birth to the Minotauros (Minotaur), famed in the myth. This creature, they say, was of double form, the upper\n        parts of the body as far as the shoulders being those of a bull and the remaining parts those of a man. As a\n        place in which to keep this monstrous thing Daidalos, the story goes, built a labyrinth, the passage-ways of\n        which were so winding that those unfamiliar with them had difficulty in making their way out; in this labyrinth\n        the Minotaur was maintained and here it devoured the seven youths and seven maidens which were sent to it from\n        Athens, as we have already related.\n        But Daidalos, they say, on learning that Minos had made threats against him because he had fashioned the cow,\n        became fearful of the king and departed from Krete (Crete), Pasiphae helping him and providing and vessel for\n        his escape . . . But certain writers of myths have the following account: Daidalos remained a while longer in\n        Krete, being kept hidden by Pasiphae, and king Minos, desiring to wreak bengeance upon him and yet being unable\n        to find him, caused all the boats which were on the island to be searched and announced that he would give a\n        great sum of money to the man who should discover Daidalos. Thereupon Daidalos, despairing of making his escape\n        by any boat, fashioned with amazing ingenuity wings whish were cleverly designed and marvellously fitted\n        together with wax.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 16 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] Pasiphae is in love with\n        the bull and begs Daidalos (Daedalus) to devise some lure for the creature; and he is fashioning a hollow cow\n        like a cow of the herd to which the bull is accustomed. What their union brought forth is shown by the form of\n        the Minotauros (Minotaur), strangely composite in its nature. Their union is not depicted here, but this is the\n        workshop of Daidalos; and about it are statues, some with forms blocked out, others in a quite complete state in\n        that they are already stepping forward and give promise of walking about [i.e. Daidalos was a crafter of animate\n        statues]. Before the time of Daidalos, you know, the art of making statues had not yet conceived such a thing.\n        Daidalos himself is of the Attic type in that his face suggests great wisdom and that the look of the eye is so\n        intelligent; and his very dress also follows the Attic style; for he wears this dull coarse mantle and also he\n        is painted without sandals, in a manner peculiarly affected by the Athenians. He sits before the framework of\n        the cow and he uses Erotes (Love-Gods) as his assistants in the device so as to connect with it something of\n        Aphrodite . . .\n        Pasiphae outside the workshop in the cattlefold gazes on the bull, thinking to draw him to her by her beauty and\n        by her robe, which is divinely resplendent and more beautiful than any rainbow. She has a helpless look--for she\n        knows what the creature is that she loves --and she is eager to embrace it, but takes no notice of her and gazes\n        at its own cow. The bull is depicting with proud mien, the leader of the herd, with splendid horns, white,\n        already experienced in love, its dewlap low and its neck massive, and it gazes fondly at the cow; but the cow in\n        the herd, ranging free and all white but for a black head, disdains the bull. For its purpose suggests a leap,\n        as of a girl who avoids the importunity of a lover.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 30 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"The bull with which Pasiphae lay he [Heraces] brought alive from the island of Crete to Mycenae.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 40 :\n        \"Pasiphae, daughter of Sol [Helios] and wife of Minos, for several years did not make offerings to the\n        goddess Venus [Aphrodite]. Because of this Venus [Aphrodite] inspired in her an unnatural love for a bull. At\n        the time when Daedalus came there as an exile, he asked her to help him. For her he made a wooden heifer, and\n        put in it the hide of a real heifer, and in this she lay with the bull. From this intercourse she bore the\n        Minotaur, with bull's head but human body. Then Daedalus made for the Minotaur a labyrinth with an\n        undiscoverable exit in which it was confined.
