  "content": "THE TITANES (Titans) were six elder gods named Kronos (Cronus), Koios (Coeus), Krios (Crius), Iapetos (Iapetus), Hyperion and Okeanos (Oceanus), sons of Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) and Gaia (Gaea, Earth), who\n        ruled the cosmos before the Olympians came to power. When their father was king he imprisoned six giant brothers\n        of the Titanes--the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) and Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires)--in the belly of Earth. Gaia was incensed and\n        incited her Titan sons to rebel. Led by Kronos, five of the six brothers, laid an ambush for their father,\n        seizing hold of him as he descended to lie upon Earth. Four of them--Hyperion, Krios, Koios and Iapetos--were\n        posted at the four corners of the earth to hold Sky fast, while Kronos in the centre castrated him with an\n        adamantine sickle.\n        After they had seized control of the cosmos, the Titanes released their storm giant brothers from Gaia's belly,\n        only to lock them away shortly afterwards in the pit of Tartaros (Tartarus).\n\nOuranos and Gaia prophesied that a son of Kronos would eventually depose the Titanes, and so the Titan-king, in\n        fear for his throne, took to devouring each one of his offspring as soon as they were born. Only Zeus escaped this fate through the intervention of his mother Rhea, who deposited him in a cave on the island of Krete (Crete) and fed Kronos a\n        substitute rock. Upon reaching adulthood, Zeus forced Kronos to disgorge his siblings, and with an army of\n        divine-allies, made war on the Titanes and cast them into the pit of Tartaros (Tartarus). According to some\n        (e.g. Pindar and Aeschylus) Kronos and the Titanes were later released from this prison, and the old Titan\n        became king of Elysion (Elysium).\n\nThe sisters of the six Titanes--Rhea, Theia, Phoibe (Phoebe), Mnemosyne, Themis and Tethys--were titled Titanides (or female Titanes). Many of their sons and daughters also received the\n        appelation of Titan including Atlas, Prometheus\n        and Helios.\n\n[1.1] OURANOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 133, Alcman Frag 61, Aeschylus Prometheus 207, Apollodorus 1.1, Orphic\n          Hymn 37, Diodorus Siculus 5.66.1)\n        [1.2] AITHER (or OURANOS) & GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n        [2.1] TITAN (Anacreon Frag 505d)\n        [2.2] KOURETE & TITAIA (Diodorus Siculus 5.66.1)\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS, KOIOS, KRIOS, HYPERION, IAPETOS, KRONOS (Hesiod\n          Theogony 133, Apollodorus 1.1, Diodorus Siculus 5.66.1)\n        [1.2] OKEANOS, IAPETOS, KRONOS (Homer Iliad 8.479 & 14.200)\n        [1.3] OKEANOS, POLOS, HYPERION, KRONOS (Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.4] IAPETOS, KRONOS, ADANOS, OSTASOS, ANDES,\n        OLYMBROS (Stephanus of Byzantium s.v.

This name commonly appears in the plural Titanes, from Titanides, as the name of the sons and\n        daughters of Uranus and Ge, whence they are also called Ouraniônes or Ouranidai. (Hom. Il. v.\n        898; Apollon. Rhod. ii. 1232.) These Titans are Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Cronus, Theia, Rheia,\n        Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Tethys, to whom Apollodorus (i. 1. § 3) adds Dione. (Hes. Theog.\n          133, &c.) Some writers also add Phorcys and Demeter. (Heyne, ad Apollod. i. 1. § 1;\n        Clemens, Homil. vi. 2.) Stephanus of Byzantium (s. v. Asana) has the following as the names of\n        the children of Uranus and Ge : Adanus, Ostasus, Andes, Cronus, Rhea, Iapetus, Olymbrus; and Pausanias (viii.\n        37. § 3) mentions a Titan Anytus, who was believed to have brought up the Arcadian Despoena. Uranus, the\n        first ruler of the world, threw his sons, the Hecatoncheires, Briareus, Cottys, Gyes (Hes. Theog. 617),\n        and the Cyclopes, Arges, Steropes, and Brontes, into Tartarus. Gaea, indignant at this, persuaded the Titans to\n        rise against their father, and gave to Cronus an adamantine sickle (harpê). They did as their mother bade\n        them, with the exception of Oceanus. Cronus, with his sickle, unmanned his father, and threw the part into the\n        sea, and out of the drops of his blood there arose the Erinnyes, Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera. The Titans then\n        deposed Uranus, liberated their brothers who had been cast into Tartarus, and raised Cronus to the throne. But\n        he again threw the Cyclopes into Tartarus, and married his sister Rhea (Ovid, Met. ix. 497, calls her\n        Ops). As, however, he had been foretold by Gaea and Uranus, that he should be dethroned by one of his own\n        children, he, after their birth, swallowed successively his children Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Pluto and Poseidon.\n        Rhea therefore, when she was pregnant with Zeus. went to Crete, gave birth to the child in the Dictaean Cave,\n        and entrusted him to be brought up to the Curetes, and the daughters of Melissus, the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida.\n        The armed Curetes guarded the infant in the cave, and struck their shields with their spears, that Cronus might\n        not hear the voice of the child. Rhea, moreover, deceived Cronus by giving him a stone wrapped up in cloth,\n        which he swallowed, believing it to be his newly-born son. (Apollod. i. §§ 1-5; Ov. Fast. iv.\n        179, &c.) When Zeus had grown up he availed himself of the assistance of Metis, the daughter of Oceanus who\n        gave to Cronus a potion which caused him to bring up the stone and the children he had swallowed. United with\n        his brothers and sisters, Zeus now began the contest against Cronus and the ruling Titans. This contest (usually\n        called the Titanomachia), which was carried on in Thessaly, the Titans occupying Mount Othrys, and the sons of\n        Cronus Mount Olympus, lasted for ten years, when at length Gaea promised victory to Zeus, if he would deliver\n        the Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires from Tartarus. Zeus accordingly slew Campe, who guarded the Cyclopes, and the\n        latter furnished him with thunder and lightning, Pluto wave him a helmet, and Poseidon a trident. The Titans\n        then were overcome, and hurled down into a cavity below Tartarus (Hom. Il. xiv. 279; Hes. Theog.\n          697, 851 ; Hom. Hymn. in Apoll. 335 ; Paus. viii. 37. § 3), and the Hecatoncheires were set\n        to guard them. (Hom. Il. viii. 479; Hes. Theog. 617, &c.; Apollod. i. 2. § 1.) It\n        must be observed that the fight of the Titans is sometimes confounded by ancient writers with the fight of the\n        Gigantes.\n\n2. The name Titans is also given to those divine or semi-divine beings who were descended from the Titans, such\n        as Prometheus, Hecate (Hes. Theog. 424 ; Serv. ad Aen. iv. 511), Latona (Ov. Met. vi.\n        346), Pyrrha (i. 395), and especially Helios and Selene (Mene), as the children of Hyperion and Theia, and even\n        the descendants of Helios, such as Circe. (Serv. ad Aen. iv. 119, vi. 725 ; Schol. ap Apollon.\n          Rhod. iv. 54; Ov. Fast. i. 617, iv. 943, Met. iii. 173, xiv. 382; Tibull. iv. 1. 50.)\n\n3. The name Titans, lastly, is given to certain tribes of men from whom all mankind is descended. Thus the\n        ancient city of Cnosos in Crete is said to have originally been inhabited by Titans, who were hostile to Zeus,\n        but were driven away by Pan with the fearful sounds of his shell-trumpet. (Hom. Hymn. in Apoll. 336 ;\n        Diod. iii. 57, v. 66 ; Orph. Hymn. 36. 2 ; comp. Höck, Creta, p. 171, &c.; Lobeck,\n        Aglaoph. p. 763; Völcker, Mythol. des Iapet.

The name Hyperion also occurs but only as a title of Helios (Helius).\n\nHesiod, Theogony 133 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"She [Gaia, Earth] lay with Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) and bare deep-swirling Okeanos (Oceanus), Koios (Coeus)\n        and Krios (Crius) and Hyperion and Iapetos (Iapetus), Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned\n        Phoibe (Phoebe) and lovely Tethys.

Alkman (Alcman), they say, tells that the heaven belongs to Akmon\n        (Acmon).\"\n        [N.B. The word akmon also occurs in Hesiod's Theogony in connection with the Titanes. Here\n        akmon is an anvil of bronze, which is described falling from the apex of heaven down to earth and from\n        earth to the bottom of the pit of Tartaros, prison of the Titanes, as a measure of distances in the cosmos.]\n\nAnacreon, Frag 505d (from Fulgentius, Mythologies) (trans.

But vast Gaia (Earth) groaned within, being\n        straitened, and she made the element of grey flint and shaped a great sickle, and told her plan to her dear sons\n        [the six Titanes]. And she spoke, cheering them, while she was vexed in her dear heart : ‘My children,\n        gotten of a sinful father, if you will obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father; for he first\n        thought of doing shameful things.’ So she said; but fear seized them all, and none of them uttered a word.\n        But great Kronos the wily took courage and answered his dear mother : ‘Mother, I will undertake to do this\n        deed.’\n        So he said: and vast Gaia (Earth) rejoiced greatly in spirit, and set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his\n        hands a jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot.\n        And Ouranos (Sky) came, bringing on night and longing for love, and he lay about Gaia (Earth) spreading himself\n        full upon her.

For she herself recounted all things to the gods fully, how that with these they would gain victory\n        and a glorious cause to vaunt themselves. For the Titan gods and as many as sprang from Kronos [Zeus, Poseidon\n        and Haides] had long been fighting together in stubborn war with heart-grieving toil, the lordly Titenes\n        (Titans) from high [Mount] Othrys, but the gods, givers of good, whom rich-haired Rhea bare in union with Kronos\n        (Cronus), from Olympos. So they, with bitter wrath, were fighting continually with one another at that time for\n        ten full years, and the hard strife had no close or end for either side, and the issue of the war hung evenly\n        balanced.\n        But when he had provided those three [the Hekatonkheires] with all things fitting, nectar and ambrosia which the\n        gods themselves eat, and when their proud spirit revived within them all after they had fed on nectar and\n        delicious ambrosia, then it was that the father of men and gods spoke amongst them : ‘Hear me, bright\n        children [Hekatonkheires] of Gaia (Gaea) and Ouranos (Uranus), that I may say what my heart within me bids. A\n        long while now have we, who are sprung from Kronos [Zeus, Poseidon, Haides] and the Titan gods, fought with each\n        other every day to get victory and to prevail. But do you show your great might and unconquerable strength, and\n        face the Titenes (Titans) in bitter strife; for remember our friendly kindness, and from what sufferings you are\n        come back to the light from your cruel bondage under misty gloom through our counsels.’\n        So he said. And blameless Kottos (Cottus) answered him again : ‘Divine one, you speak that which we know\n        well: nay, even of ourselves we know that your wisdom and understanding is exceeding, and that you became a\n        defender of the deathless ones from chill doom. And through your devising we are come back again from the murky\n        gloom and from our merciless bonds, enjoying what we looked not for, O lord, son of Kronos. And so now with\n        fixed purpose and deliberate counsel we will aid your power in dreadful strife and will fight against the\n        Titanes in hard battle.’\n        So he said: and the gods, givers of good things, applauded when they heard his word, and their spirit longed for\n        war even more than before, and they all, both male and female, stirred up hated battle that day, the Titan gods,\n        and all that were born of Kronos together with those dread, mighty ones of overwhelming strength whom Zeus\n        brought up to the light from Erebos (Erebus) beneath the earth. An hundred arms sprang from the shoulders of all\n        alike, and each had fifty heads growing upon his shoulders upon stout limbs. These, then, stood against the\n        Titanes in grim strife, holding huge rocks in their strong hands. And on the other part the Titanes eagerly\n        strengthened their ranks, and both sides at one time showed the work of their hands and their might. The\n        boundless sea rang terribly around, and the earth crashed loudly: wide Heaven was shaken and groaned, and high\n        Olympos reeled from its foundation u nder the charge of the undying gods, and a heavy quaking reached dim\n        Tartaros (Tartarus) and the deep sound of their feet in the fearful onset and of their hard missiles. So, then,\n        they launched their grievous shafts upon one another, and the cry of both armies as they shouted reached to\n        starry heaven; and they met together with a great battle-cry.\n        Then Zeus no longer held back his might; but straight his heart was filled with fury and he showed forth all his\n        strength. From Heaven and from Olympos he came forthwith, hurling his lightning: the bold flew thick and fast\n        from his strong hand together with thunder and lightning, whirling an awesome flame.The life-giving earth\n        crashed around in burning, and the vast wood crackled loud with fire all about.All the land seethed, and\n        Okeanos' (Oceanus') streams and the unfruitful sea. The hot vapour lapped round the Titenes Khthonios (Chthonian\n        Titans) (Earthly): flame unspeakable rose to the bright upper air (aither): the flashing glare of the\n        thunder-stone and lightning blinded their eyes for all that there were strong. Astounding heat seized air\n        (khaos): and to see with eyes and to hear the sound with ears it seemed even as if Earth (Gaia) and\n        wide Heaven (Ouranos) above came together; for such a mighty crash would have arisen if Earth (Gaia) were being\n        hurled to ruin, and Heaven (Ouranos) from on high were hurling her down; so great a crash was there while the\n        gods were meeting together in strife. Also the winds brought rumbling earthquake and duststorm, thunder and\n        lightning and the lurid thunderbolt, which are the shafts of great Zeus, and carried the clangour and the warcry\n        into the midst of the two hosts. An horrible uproar of terrible strife arose: mighty deeds were shown and the\n        battle inclined. But until then, they kept at one another and fought continually in cruel war.\n        And amongst the foremost Kottos (Cottus) and Briareos (Briareus) and Gyes insatiate for war raised fierce\n        fighting : three hundred rocks, one upon another, they launched from their strong hands and overshadowed the\n        Titanes with their missiles, and buried them beneath the wide-pathed earth, and bound them in bitter chains when\n        they had conquered them by their strength for all their great spirit, as far beneath the earth to Tartaros . . .\n        There by the counsel of Zeus who drives the clouds the Titan gods are hidden under misty gloom, in a dank place\n        where are the ends of the huge earth. And they may not go out; for Poseidon fixed gates of bronze upon it, and a\n        wall runs all round it on every side.There [the Hekatonkheires] Gyes and Kottos and great-souled Obriareus live,\n        trusty warders of Zeus who holds the aegis . . .\n        But when Zeus had driven the Titanes from heaven [then Gaia bore the monstrous giant Typhoeus to oppose\n        Zeus].\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 881 ff :\n        \"But when the blessed gods had finished their toil, and settled by force their struggle for honours with\n        the Titenes (Titans), they pressed far-seeing Zeus Olympios (Olympian) to reign and to rule over them, by Gaia's\n        (Earth's) prompting.

Each one of them was the discover of things of benefit to mankind,\n        and because of the benefaction they conferred upon all men they were accorded honours and everlasting\n        fame.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 67. 3 :\n        \"And so these gods [the Titanes], by reason of the many benefactions which they conferred upon the life of\n        man, were not only accorded immortal honours, but it was also believed that they were the first to make their\n        home on Mount Olympos after they had been translated from among men.\"\n\nThe story of the Titanes of Drepane (below) probably belonged to the same tradition.\n\nThe island of Drepane, home of Titanes (Titans) and Phaiakians (Phaeacians) was identified with both Korkyra\n        (Corcyra) and Sikelia (Sicily).\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 982 ff (trans.

Others\n        call it the reaping-hook of Demeter Khthonia (Chthonia, of the Underworld), who lived there once and taught the\n        Titanes (Titans) to reap corn for food, in her affection for Makris (Macris). From this reaping-hook the island\n        takes its name of Drepane, the sacred Nurse of the Phaiakians (Phaeacians), who by the same token trace their\n        ancestry to Ouranos (Heaven).\"\n\nIn the story of the Thraco-Orphic godling Zagreus (a divinity combining aspects of Zeus and Dionysos) the\n        Titanes (Titans) were a tribe of giants who dwelt on the white-chalk (titanos) peaks of Mount Titanos\n        or Titarios in northern Thessaly.

Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"Zagreus the horned baby [son of Persephone & Zeus], who by himself climbed upon the heavenly throne of\n        Zeus and brandished lightning in his little hand, and newly born, lifted and carried thunderbolts in his tender\n        fingers [for Zeus meant him to be king of the universe]. But he did not hold the throne of Zeus for long. By the\n        fierce resentment of implacable Hera, the Titanes (Titans) cunningly smeared their round faces with disguising\n        chalk (titanos), and while he contemplated his changeling countenance reflected in a mirror they\n        destroyed him with an infernal knife. There where his limbs had been cut piecemeal by the Titan steel, the end\n        of his life was the beginning of a new life as Dionysos. He appeared in another shape, and changed into many\n        forms : now young like crafty Kronides (Cronides) [Zeus] shaking the aegis-cape, now as ancient Kronos\n        heavy-kneed, pouring rain. Sometimes he was a curiously formed baby, sometimes like a mad youth with the flower\n        of the first down marking his rounded chin with black. Again, a mimic lion he uttered a horrible roar in furious\n        rage from a wild snarling throat, as he lifted a neck shadowed by a thick mane, marking his body on both sides\n        with the self-striking whip of a tail which flickered about over his hairy back. Next, he left the shape of a\n        lion's looks and let out a ringing neigh, now like an unbroken horse that lifts his neck on high to shake out\n        the imperious tooth of the bit, and rubbing, whitened his cheek with hoary foam. Sometimes he poured out a\n        whistling hiss from his mouth, a curling horned serpent covered with scales, darting out his tongue from his\n        gaping throat, and leaping upon the grim head of some Titan encircled his neck in snaky spiral coils. Then he\n        left the shape of the restless crawler and became a tiger with gay stripes on his body; or again like a bull\n        emitting a counterfeit roar from his mouth he butted the Titanes with sharp horn. So he fought for his life,\n        until Hera with jealous throat bellowed harshly through the air--that heavy-resentful step-mother! And the gates\n        of Olympos rattled in echo to her jealous throat from high heaven. Then the bold bull collapsed: the murderers\n        each eager for his turn with the knife chopt piecemeal the bull-shaped Dionysos [Zagreus].\n        After the first Dionysos had been slaughtered, Father Zeus learnt the trick of the mirror with its reflected\n        image. He attacked the mother of the Titanes [Gaia the Earth] with avenging brand, and shut up the murderers of\n        horned Dionysos within the gate of Tartaros [after a long war]: the trees blazed, the hair of suffering Gaia\n        (Earth) was scorched with heat . . . Now Okeanos poured rivers of tears from his watery eyes, a libation of\n        suppliant prayer. Then Zeus clamed his wrath at the sight of the scorched earth; he pitied her, and wished to\n        wash with water the ashes of ruin and the fiery wounds of the land. Then Rainy Zeus covered the whole sky with\n        clouds and flooded all the earth [in the flood of Deukalion (Deucalion)].\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 48. 41 ff :\n        \"[Gaia (Gaea) addresses the Gigantes (Giants), inciting them to make war on the gods :] ‘Wound him\n        [Dionysos] with cutting steel and kill him for me like Zagreus, that one may say, god or mortal, that Gaia in\n        her anger has twice armed her slayers against the breed of Kronides (Cronides) [Zeus]--the older Titanes\n        (Titans) against the former Dionysos [Zagreus], the younger Gigantes against Dionysos later born.’\"\n\nThe Titanes (Titans) were sometimes identified by the Greeks with Set, the evil god who slew and dismembered\n        Osiris in Egyptian mythology.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 6. 1 (trans.

The Orphic tradition\n        alternatively has them named for titanos, white-chalk gypsum, which thte Titanes were said to have\n        smeared on their faces when they snuck into Olympos to slay the infant god Zagreus. A mountain peak close by\n        Olympos was also named Titanos after deposits of this mineral. Nearby flowed the river Tartaressos (cf.\n        Tartaros), which Homer says drew its water from the netherworld Styx. It is unclear if the region was\n        traditionally associated with the Titanes.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 207 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"These sons whom be begot himself great Ouranos (Sky) used to call Titanes (Titans, Strainers) in reproach,\n        for he said that they strained and did presumptuously a fearful deed [the brothers strained to hold Ouranos down\n        whilst Kronos castrated him].\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 7 Fragments 39 - 40 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to\n          C1st A.D.) :\n        \"The Paionians (Paeonians) [people of the highlands of Thrake (Thrace)] were called Pelagonians . . . Since\n        the paianismos [chanting of the paian or hymn] of the Thrakians is called titanismos [i.e. cry\n        to Titan] by the Greeks, in imitation of the cry uttered in paians, the Titanes too were called\n        Pelagonians.\"\n\nThe Titanes were composite deities, who were represented in a number of ways through the classical age.\n\nIn the ancient cosmogonies the four represented the four great cosmic pillars which either held earth and sky\n        asunder, or the entire cosmos aloft--Hyperion in the west, Iapetos (Iapetus) in the east, Koios (Coeus) in the\n        north and Krios (Crius) in the south. The fifth Kronos (Cronus, Time) stood in the centre, and the sixth,\n        Okeanos (Oceanus), circled the world in the form of the river Ocean.\n\nHomer and Hesiod also represent them as anti-gods, divinities residing in the pit of Tartaros (Tartarus), the\n        cosmic inverse of heaven--for just as Heaven was imagined as a solid bronze dome rising above the earth, so\n        Tartaros was a huge pit, or reverse dome, which enclosed the underworld. The home of the Titanes in the depths\n        of the pit, was the cosmic opposite of the apex of heaven, the home of the Olympian gods.\n\nHesiod also seems to imagine the Titanes as gods of time who mastered Heaven. Individually they were apparently\n        responsible for the establishment of the portions of time:--Kronos, was time the destroyer; Krios (Crius, the\n        Ram), leader of the constellations, and so regulator of the seasons; Koios (Coeus) (also known as Polos\n        \"the pole\"), lord of the axis of heaven, around which the constellations revolved measuring the year;\n        Hyperion, overlord of the day and night, father of sun, moon and dawn; Iapetos (Iapetus) \"the\n        piercer,\" Titan-god of mortal life-span and ancestor of man; and Okeanos (Oceanus) the earth-encircler, who\n        oversaw the rising and setting of the heavenly bodies.\n        Hesiod later confines five of the Titanes to the Tartarean pit, and Zeus assumes control over the regulation of\n        time in their stead.\n\nIn the Cretan tradition, the Titanes were portrayed as agrarian gods who lived in the vicinity of Knossos\n        (Cnossus) in Krete (Crete) where they ruled over mankind during the Golden Age. At this time the Earth produced\n        an endless bounty, and presented the Titanes with the first sickle for the harvest. The Sicilian myths also\n        speak of the Titanes harvesting the first grain. When the Titanes attempted to destroy the infant Zeus, Gaia\n        (Gaea) and Rhea hid him away in a cave on Mount Ida from where he later returned to destroy them.\n\nIn the Thrakian (Thracian) and Thessalian tradition, the Titanes were portrayed as a barbarous tribe of giants\n        who made war on the gods. They were almost indistinguishable from the Thrakian Gigantes (Giants) of Pallene.\n        These barbarian gods once snuck into Olympos, their faces smeared with with white chalk (titanos), and\n        seized the child Zagreus who was seated on the throne of heaven, removing his lightning bolts, and dismembered\n        him with their knives. The god was reborn and the Titanes-Gigantes destroyed in the war which ensued. Certain\n        local landmarks on the mountainous borders of Thessalia (Thessaly) and Thrake were apparently identified with\n        this Titan-story: including the river Titaressos (c.f. Tartaros) whose murky waters were said to be drawn from\n        the infernal Styx, and Mount Titanos or Titarios opposite Olympos whose deposits of white-chalk gypsum were the\n        Titanes' disguise.\n\nThe individual Titanes also appear in the guise of obscure local gods with minor cults in the regions of\n        central and southern Greece. The cult of Kronos (Cronus) was centred on the hill of Kronos at Olympia in the\n        Peloponnese; Koios (Coeus) posssessed a stream in Messenia; Krios (Crius) one in Akhaia (Achaea) and perhaps\n        Euboia (Euboea); Hyperion possibly had a shrine at Titane in Sikyonia (Sicyonia); and Iapetos (Iapetus) is\n        located in the valleys of southern Arkadia (Arcadia). Second generation Titanes such as Prometheus, Atlas and\n        Helios (Helius), and the female Titanes Themis, Dione, Rhea, Eurynome and Phoibe (Phoebe) also had minor cults\n        scattered around the region.\n\nSome of the Titanes were also apparently gods of foreign import : Atlas and the fire-stealing Prometheus, for\n        example, were frequently associated with the Anatolian kingdom of Lydia. The cosmic story of five Titanes--four\n        holding the corners of heaven--may be Phoenician in origin. Late Greek writers also equated the Titanes with\n        Set, enemy of the god-king Osiris in Eygptian myth.\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Stephanus of Byzantium, Clement Homiles 6.2.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
