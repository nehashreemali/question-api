  "content": "BOREAS was the purple-winged god of the north wind, one of the four seasonal Anemoi (Wind-Gods). He was also\n        the god of winter who swept down from the cold mountains of Thrake (Thrace), chilling the air with his icy\n        breath. Beyond his mountain home lay Hyperborea, a mythical land of eternal spring untouched by the god's winds.\n\nWhen Boreas sought a wife, he carried off Oreithyia (\"Mountain Gale\"), daughter of King Erekhtheus\n        (Erechtheus) of Athens, who was playing with her companions in a riverside meadow. Their children included\n        Khione (Chione), goddess of snow, and the Boreades, a pair of winged heroes.\n\nBoreas and his brother-winds were often imagined as horse-shaped gods in form. An old Greek folk belief was\n        that the winds Boreas and Zephyros would sweep down upon the mares in early\n        spring and fertilize them in the guise of wind-formed stallions. The horses born from these couplings were the\n        swiftest and finest of their kind. The fabulous horses of King\n          Laomedon of Troy were said to have been sired in this way by Boreas upon the Trojan mares.\n\nIn Greek vase painting Boreas was depicted as a striding, winged god. Sometimes his hair and beard were spiked\n        with ice. In mosaic art he often appears as a gust blowing head with bloated cheeks up among the clouds. This\n        imagery carried over into post-Classical art, and is frequently found in old maps. Boreas' name is simply the\n        ancient Greek word for \"north-wind\" which was perhaps in turn derived from the Greek verb\n        boraô meaning \"to devour\".\n\n[1.1] ASTRAIOS & EOS (Hesiod Theogony 378, Hyginus Preface, Nonnus Dionysiaca 6.18)\n\n[1.1] ZETES, KALAIS (Hesiod Catalogues Frag 40A, Pindar Pythian Ode 4)\n        [1.2] ZETES, KALAIS (by Oreithyia) (Simonides Frag 534, Apollonius Rhodius 1.212, Hyginus Fabulae 14, Ovid Metamorphoses\n          6.679, Propertius 1.20, Suidas s.v.

He dwelt in a cave of mount Haemus in Thrace.\n        (Callim. hymn. in Del. 63.) He is mixed up with the early legends of Attica in the story of his having\n        carried off Oreithyia, the daughter of Erechtheus, by whom he begot Zetes, Calais, and Cleopatra, the wife of\n        Phineus, who are therefore called Boreades. (Ov. Met. vi. 683, &c.; Apollon. Rhod. i. 211; Apollod.\n        iii. 15. § 2; Paus. i. 19. § 6.) In the Persian war, Boreas shewed his friendly disposition towards\n        the Athenians by destroying the ships of the barbarians. (Herod. vii. 189.) He also assisted the Megalopolitans\n        against the Spartans, for which he was honoured at Megalopolis with annual festivals. (Paus. viii. 36. §\n        3.) According to an Homeric tradition (Il. xx. 223), Boreas begot twelve horses by the mares of\n        Erichthonius, which is commonly explained as a mere figurative mode of expressing the extraordinary swiftness of\n        those horses. On the chest of Cypselus he was represented in the act of carrying off Oreithyia, and here the\n        place of his legs was occupied by tails of serpents. (Paus. v. 19. § 1.) Festivals of Boreas were\n        celebrated at Athens and other places.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 378 ff (trans.

According to the Hellenic story, Boreas\n        had an Attic wife, Orithyia, the daughter of Erekhtheus (Erechtheus), ancient king of Athens. Because of\n        this connection, so the tale goes, the Athenians considered Boreas to be their son-in-law. They were stationed\n        off Khalkis (Chalcis) in Euboia (Euboea), and when they saw the storm rising, they then, if they had not\n        already, sacrificed to and called upon Boreas and Orithyia to help them by destroying the barbarian fleet, just\n        as before at Athos. I cannot say whether this was the cause of Boreas falling upon the barbarians as they lay at\n        anchor, but the Athenians say that he had come to their aid before and that he was the agent this time. When\n        they went home, they founded a sacred precinct of Boreas beside the Ilissos (Ilissus) river.\n        There was no counting how many grain-ships and other vessels were destroyed. The generals of the fleet were\n        afraid that the Thessalians might attack them now that they had been defeated, so they built a high palisade out\n        of the wreckage. The storm lasted three days. Finally the [Persian] Magi made offerings and cast spells\n        upon the Wind [Boreas], sacrificing also to Thetis and the Nereides.
