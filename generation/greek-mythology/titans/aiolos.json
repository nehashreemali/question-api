  "content": "AIOLOS (Aeolus) was the divine keeper of the winds and king of the mythical, floating island of Aiolia\n        (Aeolia). He kept the violent Storm-Winds locked safely away inside the\n        cavernous interior of his isle, releasing them only at the command of greatest gods to wreak devastation upon\n        the world.\n\nThe hero Odysseus once visited Aiolos' isle and was entrusted with a bag containing all of the Storm-Winds to\n        ensure a safe voyage home. However, during the trip, the hero's greedy companions opened the bag in a search for\n        gold and the escaping winds carried their ship all the way back to Aiolos' shore.\n\nThe Winds were often conceived of as horse-shaped gods or spirits, and as such Aiolos was titled Hippotades,\n        \"the reiner of horses,\" from the Greek words hippos (\"horse\") and\n        tadên (\"reined in tightly\").\n\nHomer's wind-god Aiolos bears many similarities to Hesiod's Ouranos\n        (Uranus)--both are described as having six sons and daughers joined in wedlock, and both kept a group of\n        storm-spirits locked behind a threshold of bronze. In the case of Ouranos, the twelve children were the\n        Titan-gods, and the storm-gods were the Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires) and Kyklopes (Cyclopes) in Tartaros.\n        Aiolos also resembles Astraios (Astraeus), Hesiod's father of the winds and\n        stars. Stesichorus seems to confirm this connection when he describes Aiolos Hippotades as the cousin of Iris\n        Thaumantias (\"the wondrous rainbow\") for Astraios was a son of Eurybia and Iris a daughter of\n        Eurybia's brother Thaumas.\n        It should also be noted that the Greek words aiolos (\"glittering\"), aiolokhros\n        (\"spangled\"), and astraios (\"starry\") were all adjectives applied to the starry\n        night-sky (ouranos).\n\n[1.1] HIPPOTES (Homer Odyssey 10., Stesichorus Frag 222B, Quintus Smyrnaeus 14.467,\n          Ovid Metamorphoses 14.223, Diodorus Siculus 5.7.5)\n        [1.2] HIPPOTES & MELANIPPE (Diodorus Siculus 4.67.3)\n\n[1.1] 6 SONS & 6 DAUGHTERS (Homer Odyssey 10.4, Quintus Smyrnaeus\n          14.467)\n        [1.2] IOKASTOS (Callimachus Frag 202)\n        [1.3] POLYMELA, DIORES (Philetas Hermes Frag, Parthenius Love Romances 2)\n        [1.4] ASTYOKHOS, XUTHOS, ANDROKLES, PHERAIMON, IOKASTOS, AGATHYRNOS (by Kyane) (Diodorus Siculus 5.7.5)\n        [1.5] ALKYONE (Ovid Metamorphoses 11.430)\n        [1.6] ARNE (Diodorus Siculus 4.67.3)\n\nAE′OLUS (Aiolos). In the mythical history of Greece there are three personages of this name, who are\n        spoken of by ancient writers as connected with one another, but this connexion is so confused, that it is\n        impossible to gain a clear view of them. (Müller, Orchom. p. 138, &c.) We shall follow\n        Diodorus, who distinguishes between the three, although in other passages he confounds them. \n        1. A son of Hellen and the nymph Orseïs, and a brother of Dorus and Xuthus. He is described as the ruler of\n        Thessaly, and regarded as the founder of the Aeolic branch of the Greek nation. He married Enarete, the daughter\n        of Deimachus, by whom he had seven sons and five daughters, and according to some writers still more. (Apollod.\n        i. 7. § 3; Schol. ad Pind. Pyth. iv. 190.) According to Müller's supposition, the most\n        ancient and genuine story knew only of four sons of Aeolus, viz. Sisyphus, Athamas, Cretheus, and Salmoneus, as\n        the representatives of the four main branches of the Aeolic race. The great extent of country which this race\n        occupied, and the desire of each part of it to trace its origin to some descendant of Aeolus, probably gave rise\n        to the varying accounts about the number of his children. According to Hyginus (Fab. 238, 242) Aeolus\n        had one son of the name of Macareus, who, after having committed incest with his sister Canace, put an end to\n        his own life. According to Ovid (Heroid. 11) Aeolus threw the fruit of this love to the dogs, and sent\n        his daughter a sword by which she was to kill herself (Comp. Plut. Parallel. p. 312.)\n        2. Diodorus (iv. 67) says, that the second Aeolus was the great-grandson of the first Aeolus, being the son of\n        Hippotes and Melanippe, and the grandson of Mimas the son of Aeolus. Arne, the daughter of this second Aeolus,\n        afterwards became mother of a third Aeolus. (Comp. Paus. ix. 40. § 3.) In another passage (v. 7) Diodorus\n        represents the third Aeolus as a son of Hippotes.\n        3. According to some accounts a son of Hippotes, or, according to others, of Poseidon and Arne, the daughter of\n        the second Aeolus. His story, which probably refers to thus emigration of a branch of the Aeolians to the west,\n        is thus related : Arne declared to her father that she was with child by Poseidon, but her father disbelieving\n        her statement, gave her to a stranger of Metapontum in Italy, who took her to his native town. Here she became\n        mother of two sons, Boeotus and Aeolus (iii.), who were adopted by the man of Metapontum in accordance with an\n        oracle. When they had grown up to manhood, they took possession of the sovereignty of Metapontum by force. But\n        when a dispute afterwards arose between their mother Arne and their foster-mother Autolyte, the two brothers\n        slew the latter and fled with their mother front Metapontum. Aeolus went to some islands in the Tyrrhenian sea,\n        which received from him the name of the Aeolian islands, and according to some accounts built the town of\n        Lipara. (Diod. iv. 67. v. 7.) Here he reigned as a just and pious king, behaved kindly to the natives, and\n        taught them the use of sails in navigation, and foretold them from signs which he observed in the fire the\n        nature of the winds that were to rise. Hence, says Diodorus, Aeolus is described in mythology as the ruler over\n        the winds, and it was this Aeolus to whom Odysseus came during his wanderings. A different account of the matter\n        is given by Hyginus. (Fab. 186.)\n        In these accounts Aeolus, the father of the Aeolian race, is placed in relationship with Aeolus the ruler and\n        god of the winds. The groundwork on which this connexion has been formed by later poets and mythographers, is\n        found in Homer. (Od. x. 2, &c.) In Homer, however, Aeolus, the son of Hippotes, is neither the god\n        nor the father of the winds, but merely the happy ruler of the Aeolian island, whom Cronion had made the\n        tamiês of the winds, which he might soothe or excite according to his pleasure. (Od. x.\n        21, &c.) This statement of Homer and the etymology of the name of Aeolus from aellô were the cause,\n        that in later times Aeolus was regarded as the god and king of the winds, which he kept enclosed in a mountain.\n        It is therefore to him that Juno applies when she wishes to destroy the fleet of the Trojans. (Virg.\n        Aen. i. 78.) The Aeolian island of Homer was in the time of Pausanias believed to be Lipara (Paus. x.\n        11. § 3), and this or Strongyle was accordingly regarded in later times as the place in which the god of\n        the winds dwelled. (Virg. Aen. viii. 416, i. 52; Strab. vi. p. 276.) Other accounts place the residence\n        of Aeolus in Thrace (Apollon. Rhod. i. 954, iv. 765; Callim. Hymm. in Del. 26), or in the neighbourhood\n        of Rhegium in Italy. (Tzetz. ad Lycophr. 732; comp. Diod. v. 8.) The following passages of later poets\n        also shew how universally Aeolus had gradually come to be regarded as a god: Ov. Met. i. 264, xi. 748\n        xiv. 223; Val. Flacc. i. 575; Quint. Smyrn. xiv. 475. Whether he was represented by the ancients in works of art\n        is not certain, but we now possess no representation of him.\n\nHIPPO′TADES (Hippotadês), a name given to Aeolus, the son of Hippotes. (Hom. Od. x. 2 ;\n        Ov. Met. xiv. 224; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1644.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nKeeps Horses on Tight Rein (hippos, tadên),\n            Son of Hippotes\n\nHomer, Odyssey 10. 1 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"[Odysseus tells the tale of his wanderings :] We came to the Aiolian (Aeolian) island (nesos\n          Aiolios); here lived Aiolos (Aeolus) Hippotades (son of Hippotas); the deathless gods counted him their\n        friend. His island is a floating one; all round it there is a wall of bronze, unbreakable, and rock rises sheer\n        above it. Twelve children of his live in the palace with him; six are daughters, six are sons in the prime of\n        youth; moreover the king has given his daughters as wives to his sons. These all hold a continual feast with\n        their dear father and much-loved mother; countless dainties are there before them, and through the daytime the\n        hall is rich with savoury smells and murmurous with the sound of music. At night they sleep, each with his own\n        chaste wife, on inlaid bedsteads with coverlets over them.\n        To their city and noble palace we now came, and for a whole month Aiolos gave me hospitality and questioned me\n        on all manner of things, Ilion [i.e. Troy] and the Argive ships and how the Akhaians (Achaeans) sailed for home.\n        I duly told him all he desired; then in my turn I asked his leave to depart and begged him to help me on my way.\n        Nor was he unwilling; he set about speeding my return. He gave me a bag made from the hide of a full-grown ox of\n        his, and in the bag he had penned up every Wind (anemos) that blows whatever its course might be;\n        because Kronion (Cronion) [Zeus] had made him warden of all the Winds (anemoi), to bid each of them\n        rise or fall at his own pleasure. He placed the bag in my own ship's hold, tied with a glittering silver cord so\n        that through that fastening not even a breath could stray; to Zephyros (the West Wind) only he gave commission\n        to blow for me, to carry onwards my ships and men. Yet he was not after all to accomplish his design, because\n        our own folly ruined us.\n        For nine days and through nine nights we sailed on steadily; on the tenth day our own country began to heave in\n        sight; we were near enough to see men tending their fires on shore. It was then that beguiling sleep surprised\n        me; I was tired out, because all this time I had kept my own hands on the steering-oar, never entrusting it to\n        one of the crew, for I wished to speed our journey home. Meanwhile the crew began murmuring among themselves;\n        they were sure I was taking home new presents of gold and silver from Aiolos.\n        One of them would say as he eyed his neighbour : ‘What injustice! In whatever city or land he comes to,\n        this man wins everyone's friendship and regard. He is taking back a mass of fine things from the spoils of Troy,\n        while we who have journeyed with him from the first to last are returning home all empty-handed. And now come\n        these latest gifts that Aiolos in his hospitality had indulged him with. Come, let us look without wasting time.\n        What are these gifts? How much gold and silver is there inside the bag?’\n        Thus the men talked among themselves, and the counsels of folly were what prevailed. They undid the bag, the\n        Winds (anemoi) rushed out all together, and in a moment a tempest (thuella) had seized my crew\n        and was driving them--now all in tears--back to the open sea and away from home.\n        I myself awoke, and wondered if now I should throw myself overboard and be drowned in ocean or if I should bear\n        it all in silence and stay among the living. I did bear it and did remain, but covered my face as I lay on deck.\n        My own ship and the others with it were carried back by raging storm (anemos thuella) to the island of\n        Aiolos (nesos Aioloios), amid the groaning of all my company.\n        There we set foot ashore and drew water, and without delay my crews and I took our meal by the rapid ships. When\n        we had had our portion of food and drink, I chose to come with me one man as my own attendant and one besides;\n        then I sent up to the place of Aiolos, and found him feasting there with his wife and children. We went in and\n        we sat down at the threshold by the doorposts, while the household asked in deep amazement : ‘Odysseus,\n        how is it that you are here again? What malicious god has set upon you? Surely we did our best before to speed\n        you upon your way, meaning to reach your own land and home or whatever place you might desire?’\n        So they spoke, and I said despondently : ‘Faithless comrades were my undoing, they and the slumber that\n        betrayed me. But you are my friends; you have the remedy; grant it me.’\n        With these humble words I made my appeal to them. They remained in silence, except the father, who answered me :\n        ‘Away from this island, away at once, most despicable of creatures! I am forbidden to welcome here or to\n        help send elsewhere a man whom the blessed gods abhor. This return reveals you as god-forsaken; go!’\n        And with these words he drove me forth despite my pitiful lamentations. Then we sailed onwards sick at\n        heart.\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 23. 309 :\n        \"[Odysseus told Penelope of his journeys :] His coming to Aiolos (Aeolus), who received him gladly and sent\n        him upon his way, though his homecoming was still barred by fate, and a tempest caught him up again and drove\n        him in lamentation over the teeming sea.\"\n\nStesichorus, Fragment 222B (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric III) (C7th to 6th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Thaumantias [Iris, daughter of Thaumas], the cousin of Aiolos (Aeolus)\n        Hippotades.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E7. 10 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Odysseus went on to the island of Aiolia (Aeolia), of which Aiolos (Aeolus) was king. Zeus had set him up\n        as coordinator of the Anemoi (Winds), for both stopping them and stirring them up. After playing host to\n        Odysseus, he gave him an ox-skin, in which he had tied up the Anemoi (Winds). He explained which Winds would be\n        needed for sailing, and fastened the skin securely in the ship. So Odysseus, by using the correct Winds, had a\n        good voyage, but as they drew near enough to Ithaka to see the smoke rising from the polis, he fell asleep. His\n        comrades, in the belief that he carried gold in the skin, opened it and let the winds escape. Back again they\n        went, captured by the Winds, but when Odysseus made his way to Aiolos to ask for a sailing breeze, Aiolos threw\n        him off the island, saying he could not save him as long as the gods had other ideas.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 762 ff (trans.

Now, as it fell out, this stay was most agreeable to Odysseus, for he had fallen in love with\n        Polymela, one of Aiolos's daughters, and was engaged in a secret intrigue with her. But after Odysseus had gone\n        off with the winds shut up in a bag, the girl was found jealously guarding some stuffs from among the Trojan\n        spoils which he had given her, and rolling among them with bitter tears. Aiolos reviled Odysseus bitterly\n        although he was away, and had the intention of exacting vengeance upon Polymela; however, her brother Diores was\n        in love with her, and both begged her off her punishment and persuaded his father to give her to him as his\n        wife.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 66. 6 (trans.

Day-Lewis) (Roman epic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"[Juno-Hera, calls upon Aiolos (Aeolus) to send a storm to destroy the fleet of the Trojan hero Aeneas :]\n        The goddess [Juno-Hera] came to the storm-cloud country, the womb-land of brawling siroccos, Aeolia. Here in a\n        huge cavern King Aeolus keeps curbed and stalled, chained up in durance to his own will, the heaving Winds and\n        far-reverberating Tempests. Behind the bars they bellow, mightily fretting: the mountain is one immense murmur.\n        Aeolus, aloft on his throne of power, sceptre in hands, gentles and disciplines their fierce spirits. Otherwise,\n        they'd be bolting off with the earth and the ocean and the deep sky--yes, brushing them all away into space. But\n        to guard against this the Father of heaven [Zeus] put the Winds in a dark cavern and laid a heap of mountains\n        upon them, and gave them an overlord who was bound by a firm contract to rein them in or give them their head,\n        as he was ordered. Him Juno [Hera] now petitioned. Here are the words she used:--‘Aeolus, the king of gods\n        and men has granted you the rule of the winds, to lull the waves or lift them. A breed I have no love for now\n        sails the Tyrrhene sea [i.e. Aeneas and his Trojans]. Transporting Troy's defeated gods to Italy. Lash fury into\n        your Winds! Whelm those ships and sink them! Flail the crews apart! Litter the sea with their fragments!\n        Fourteen nymphae I have--their charms are quite out of the common--of whom the fairest in form, Deiopea, I'll\n        join to you in lasting marriage and seal her yours for ever, a reward for this great favour I ask, to live out\n        all the years with you, and make you the father of handsome children.’\n        Aeolus answered thus:--‘O queen, it is for you to be fully aware what you ask: my duty is to obey. Through\n        you I hold this kingdom, for what it's worth, as Jove's [Zeus'] viceroy; you grant the right to sit at the gods'\n        table; you are the one who makes me grand master of cloud and storm.’\n        Thus he spoke, and pointing his spear at the hollow mountain, pushed at its flank : and the Winds, as it were in\n        a solid mass, hurl themselves through the gates and sweep the land with tornadoes. They have fallen upon the\n        sea, they are heaving it up from its deepest abysses, the whole sea--East wind, South, Sou-wester thick with\n        squalls--and bowling great billows at the shore. There follows a shouting of men, a shrilling of stays and\n        halyards. All of a sudden the Storm-clouds are snatching the heavens, the daylight from the eyes of the Trojans;\n        night, black night is fallen on the sea. The welkin explodes, the firmament flickers with thick-and-fast\n        lightning, and everything is threatening the instant death of men . . . \n        Even as he cried out thus, a howling gust from the North hit the front of the sail, and a wave climbed the sky.\n        Oars snapped; then the ship yawed, wallowing broadside on to the seas: and then, piled up there, a precipice of\n        sea hung. One vessel was poised on a wave crest; for another the waters, collapsing, showed sea-bottom in the\n        trough: the tide-race boiled with sand. Three times did the South wind spin them towards an ambush of rocks\n        (those sea-girt rocks which Italians call by the name of The Altars), rocks like a giant spine on the sea: three\n        times did the East wind drive them in to the Syrtes shoal, a piteous spectacle--hammering them on the shallows\n        and hemming them round with sandbanks . . . \n        Meanwhile Neptunus [Poseidon] has felt how greatly the sea is in turmoil, felt the unbridled storm disturbing\n        the water even down to the sea-bed, and sorely troubled has broken surface; he gazes forth on the seep with a\n        pacific mien. He sees the fleet of Aeneas all over the main, dismembered, the Trojans crushed by waves and the\n        sky in ribbons about them: Juno's vindictive stratagems do not escape her brother.\n        He summons the East and the West Winds, and then proceeds to say:--‘Does family pride tempt you to such\n        impertinence? Do you really dare, you Winds, without my divine assent to confound earth and sky, and raise this\n        riot of water? You, whom I--! Well, you have made the storm, I must lay it. Next time, I shall not let you so\n        lightly redeem your sins. Now leave, and quickly leave, and tell your overlord this--not to him but me was\n        allotted the stern trident dominion over the seas. His domain is the mountain of rock, your domicile, O East\n        Wind. Let Aeolus be king of that castle and let him keep the Winds locked up in its dungeon.’\n        He spoke; and before he had finished, the insurgent sea was calmed.\"\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 3. 92 - 94 (trans. Rackham) (Roman encyclopedia C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"At a distance of nearly 25 miles from Italy, are the seven islands called the Aeoliae and also the\n        Liparean; their Greek name is Hephaestiades, and the Roman Volcaniae; they are called Aeoliae from King Aeolus,\n        who reigned there in the Homeric period . . .

It differs from the Lipara\n        only in the fact that its flame is more liquid; the local population are reported to be able to foretell from\n        its smoke three days ahead what winds are going to blow, and this is the source of the belief that the winds\n        obeyed the orders of Aeolus.\"\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 7. 203 :\n        \"[On inventions :] Aeolus on of Hellen [invented] the theory of winds.\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 1. 416 ff (trans.

When the king can no longer curb their roaring mouths, then of his own will\n        he unbars the doors and by granting egress lulls their savage complaints. Boreas now with these tidings drives\n        him from his lofty throne : ‘Ah! What monstrous deed, Aeolus, have I spied from the heights of Pangaeus!\n        Grecian heroes have devised a strange engine with the axe [i.e. a boat], and now triumph joyously over the seas\n        with a huge sail, nor have I power of myself to stir up the sea from its sandy depths, as I had or ever I was\n        fettered and imprisoned.
