  "content": "THE HESPERIDES were the goddess-nymphs of evening and the golden light of sunsets. They were the daughters of\n        either Nyx (Night) or the heaven-bearing Titan Atlas. The Hesperides were entrusted with the care of the tree of\n        the golden apples which was had been presented to the goddess Hera by Gaia (the Earth) on her wedding day. They were assisted by a hundred-headed\n        guardian-Drakon (Dragon). Herakles was sent to fetch the apples as\n        one of his twelve labours and, upon slaying the serpent, stole the precious fruit. Athena later returned them to the Hesperides.\n\nThe Hesperides were also the keepers of other treasures of the gods. Perseus obtained from them the artifacts he needed to slay the Gorgon Medousa (Medusa).\n\nThe three nymphs and their glowing, golden apples were regarded as the source of the golden light of sunset--a\n        phenomena which celebrated the bridal of Zeus and Hera, the king and queen of heaven.\n\n[1.1] NYX (no father) (Hesiod Theogony\n          215)\n        [1.2] EREBOS & NYX (Hyginus Pref, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n        [2.1] ATLAS & HESPERIS (Diodorus Sicululs\n          4.26.2)\n        [2.2] ATLAS (Pherecydes Frag, Hyginus Astronomica\n          2.3)\n        [3.1] HESPEROS (Scholiast on Euripides\n          Hippolytus)\n        [4.1] ZEUS & THEMIS (Servius on Virgil's Aeneid 4.484)\n        [5.1] PHORKYS & KETO (Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius 4.1399)\n\n[1.1] AIGLE, ERYTHEIA, HESPERETHOOSA (Hesiod Doubtful Frag 3)\n        [1.2] AIGLE, ERYTHEIS, HESPERIE, ARETHOUSA (Apollodoros 2.113)\n        [1.3] AIGLE, ERYTHEIS, HESPERE (Apollonius Rhodius 4.1390)\n        [1.4] AIGLE, HESPERIE, AERIKA (Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.5] ASTEROPE, KHRYSOTHEMIS, LIPARA (Vase Painting N14.1)\n\nHESPE′RIDES (Hesperides), the famous guardians of the golden apples which Ge had given to Hera at her\n        marriage with Zeus. Their names are Aegle, Erytheia, Hesperia, and Arethusa, but their descent is not the same\n        in the different traditions ; sometimes they are called the daughters of Night or Erebus (Hes. Theog.\n        215; Hygin. Fab. init.), sometimes of Phorcys and Ceto (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1399),\n        sometimes of Atlas and Hesperis, whence their names Atlantides or Hesperides (Diod. iv. 27), and sometimes of\n        Hesperus, or of Zeus and Themis. (Serv. ad Aen. iv. 484; Schol. ad Eurip. Hipp. 742.) Instead\n        of the four Hesperides mentioned above, some traditions know only of three, viz. Hespere, Erytheis, and Aegle,\n        Arethusa, and Hesperusa or Hesperia (Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1427; Serv. l. c.; Stat. Theb. ii.\n        281); whereas others mention seven. (Diod. l. c.; Hygin. Fab. init.) The poets describe them\n        as possessed of the power of sweet song. (Hes. Theog. 518; Orph. Fragm. 17; Eurip. Herc.\n          Fur. 394; Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1399.) In the earliest legends, these nymphs are described as living on the\n        river Oceanus, in the extreme west (Hes. Theog. 334, &c., 518; Eurip. Hipp. 742); but the\n        later attempts to fix their abodes, and the geographical position of their gardens, have led poets and\n        geographers to different parts of Libya, as in the neighbourhood of Cyrene, Mount Atlas, or the islands on the\n        western coast of Libya (Plin. H. N. vi. 31, 36; Virg. Aen. iv. 480; Pomp. Mela, iii. 10), or\n        even to the northern extremity of the earth, beyond the wind Boreas, among the Hyperboreans.

They\n        dashed off, like mad dogs, in search of fresh water; and they were fortunate. They [the Argonauts] found the\n        sacred plot where, till the day before, the serpent Ladon, a son of the Libyan soil, had kept watch over the\n        golden apples in the Garden of Atlas, while close at hand and busy at their tasks the Hesperides sang their\n        lovely song. But now the snake, struck down by Herakles, lay by the trunk of the apple-tree. Only the tip of his\n        tail was still twitching; from the head down, his dark spine showed not a sign of life. His blood had been\n        poisoned by arrows steeped in the gall of the Hydra Lernaia (Lernaean), and flies perished in the festering\n        wounds.\n        Close by, with their white arms flung over their golden heads, the Hesperides were wailing as the Argonauts\n        approached. The whole company came on them suddenly, and in a trice the Nymphai (Nymphs) turned to dust and\n        earth on the spot where they had stood. Orpheus, seeing the hand of Heaven in this, addressed a prayer to them\n        on behalf of his comrades : ‘Beautiful and beatific Powers, Queens indeed, be kind to us, whether Olympos\n        or the underworld counts you among its goddesses, or whether you prefer the name of Solitary Nymphai. Come,\n        blessed Spirits, Daughters of Okeanos (Oceanus), make yourselves manifest to our expectant eyes and lead us to a\n        place where we can quench this burning, never-ending thirst with fresh water springing from a rock or gushing\n        from the ground. And if ever we bring home our ship into an Akhaian (Achaean) port, we will treat you as we\n        treat the greatest goddesses, showing our gratitude with innumberable gifts of wine and offerings at the festal\n        board.’\n        Orpheus sobbed as he prayed. But the Nymphai were still at hand, and they took pity on the suffering men. They\n        wrought a miracle. First, grass sprung up from the ground, then long shoots appeared above the grass, and in a\n        moment three saplings, tall, straight and in full leaf, were growing there. Hespere (Hespera) became a poplar;\n        Erytheis an elm; Aigle (Aegle) a sacred willow. Yet they were still themselves; the trees could not conceal\n        their former shapes--that was the greatest wonder of all. And now the Argonauts heard Aigle in her gentle voice\n        tell them what they wished to know.\n        ‘You have indeed been fortunate,’ she said. ‘There was a man here yesterday, an evil man, who\n        killed the watching Snake, stole our golden apples, and is gone. To us he brought unspeakable sorrow; to you\n        release from suffering. He was a savage brute, hideous to look at; a cruel man, with glaring eyes and scowling\n        face. He wore the skin of an enormous lion and carried a great club of olive-wood and the bow and arrows with\n        which he shot our monster here. It appeared that he, like you, had come on foot and was parched with thirst. For\n        he rushed about the place in search of water; but with no success, till he found the rock that you see over\n        there near to the Tritonian lagoon. Then it occurred to him, or he was prompted by a god, to tap the base of the\n        rock.

With regard to these apples there is disagreement among the\n        writers of myths, and some say that there were golden apples in certain gardens of the Hesperides in Libya,\n        where they were guarded without ceasing by a most formidable Drakon (Dragon), whereas others assert that the\n        Hesperides possessed flocks of sheep which excelled in beauty and were therefore called for their beauty, as the\n        poets might do, ‘golden mela’ [the ancient Greek word mela means both apples and\n        sheep], just as Aphrodite is called golden because of her loveliness. There are some, however, who say that it\n        was because the sheep had a peculiar colour like gold that they got this designation, and the Drakon was the\n        name of the shepherd of the sheep . . . But with regards to such matters it will be every man's privilege to\n        form such opinions as accord with his own belief. At any rate Herakles slew the guardian of the apples, and\n        brought them to Eurystheus . . . \n        But we must not fail to mention what the myths relate about Atlas and about the race of the Hesperides. The\n        account runs like this : In the country known as Hesperitis there were two brothers whose fame was known abroad,\n        Hesperos (Hesperus) and Atlas. These brothers possessed flocks of sheep which excelled in beauty and were in\n        colour of a golden yellow, this being the reason why the poets, in speaking of these sheep as mela, called them\n        golden mela. Now Hesperos begat a daughter named Hesperis, who he gave in marriage to his brother and after whom\n        the land was given the name Hesperitis; and Atlas begat by her seven daughters, who were named after their\n        father Atlantides, and after their mother Hesperides. And since these Atlantides excelled in beauty and\n        chastity, Busiris the king of the Aigyptians (Egyptians), the account says, was seized with a desire to get the\n        maidens into his power; and consequently he dispatched pirates by sea with orders to seize the girls and deliver\n        them into his hands . . .\n        [Herakles came across Busiris in Egypt and slew him.]\n        Meanwhile the pirates had seized the girls while they were playing in a certain garden and carried them off, and\n        fleeing swiftly to their ships had sailed away with them. Herakles came upon the pirates as they were taking\n        their meal on a certain strand, and learning from the maidens what had taken place he slew the pirates to a man\n        and brought the girls back to Atlas their father; and in return Atlas was so grateful to Herakles for his kindly\n        deed that he not only gladly gave him such assistance as his Labour called for.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 21 (trans.
