  "content": "THE TWELVE HORAI (Horae) were goddesses of the hours of the day (and perhaps also the twelve months of the\n        year). They guided the path of the sun-god Helios as he journeyed across the sky, dividing the day into\n        portions.\n\nThe ancient Greeks did not have hours of fixed length as we do today. Instead they divided the hours of\n        daylight into twelve portions identified by the position of the sun in the sky. Thus the length of the hour\n        varied between the longer days of summer and shorter ones of winter.\n\nThe twelve Horai were not always clearly distinguishable from the Horai of\n        the seasons who were also described as overseeing the path of the sun.\n\n[1.1] HELIOS (Quintus Smyrnaeus 2.490)\n        [2.1] KHRONOS (Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          12.15)\n\n[1.1] AUGE, ANATOLE, MOUSIKA, GYMNASTIKA, NYMPHE, MESEMBRIA, SPONDE, ELETE, AKTE, HESPERIS, DYSIS (Hyginus Fabulae 183)\n        [1.2] ANATOLIA, MESEMBRIA, DYSIS, ARKTOS (Nonnus Dionysiaca 41.263)\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 1. 48 ff (trans. Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"As when descends Eos (the Dawn) from Olympos' crest of adamant, Eos, heart-exultant in her radiant steeds\n        amidst the bright-haired Horai (Horae, Hours); and o'er them all, how flawless-fair soever these may be, her\n        splendour of beauty glows pre-eminent.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 2. 490 ff :\n        \"Erigeneia (the Child of the Mist) [Eos the Dawn] in her chariot through the sky she rode. Marvelled the\n        Daughters of the Sun (Helioio Thugatres) [the Horai (Horae)] who stood near her, around that wondrous\n        splendour-ring traced for the race-course of the tireless sun by Zeus, the limit of all Nature's life and death,\n        the dally round that maketh up the eternal circuit of the rolling years.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 2. 549 ff :\n        \"Eos (the Lady of the Morn) wailing her dear child [Memnon] from the heavens came down. Twelve maidens [the\n        twelve Horai (Horae)] shining-tressed attended her, the warders of the high paths of the sun for ever circling,\n        warders of the night and dawn, and each world-ordinance framed of Zeus, around whose mansion's everlasting doors\n        from east to west they dance, from west to east, whirling the wheels of harvest-laden years, while rolls the\n        endless round of winter's cold, and flowery spring, and lovely summer-tide, and heavy-clustered autumn. These\n        came down from heaven, for Memnon wailing wild and high; and mourned with these the Pleiades. Echoed round\n        far-stretching mountains, and Aisepos' (Aesepus') stream. Ceaseless uprose the keen, and in their midst, fallen\n        on her son and clasping, wailed Eos.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 2. 658 ff :\n        \"Eos (the Dawn) divine now heavenward soared with the all-fostering Horai (Horae, Hours), who drew her to\n        Zeus' threshold, sorely loth, yet conquered by their gentle pleadings, such as salve the bitterest grief of\n        broken hearts.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 183 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The names of the Horae, daughters of Jove [Zeus], son of Saturn [Kronos (Cronus)], and Themis, daughter\n        Titanidis (Titaness), are these : Auxo, Eunomia (Order), Pherusa, Carpo (Fruit), Dice (Justice), Euporia, Irene\n        (Peace), Orthosie, Thallo (Bud). Other writers give ten by these names: Auge (When light first appears), Anatole\n        (Dawn), Musica (Music-hour), Gymnastica (Gymn-hour), Nymphe (Bath-hour), Mesembria (Noon), Sponde (Libations\n        poured after lunch), Elete, Acte, Hesperis (Evening), and Dysis (Setting).\" [N.B. The name of the twelfth\n        Hora (Hour) is not preserved in this list.]\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 4. 90 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The bridles are jingling in the Titanian caves [of Helios the Sun]; hastened by the golden-haired Horae\n        (Hours) Sol (the Sun) [Helios] puts on his diadem of myriad rays.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 3. 406 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Far on the sloping margin of the western sea sinking Sol (the Sun) [Helios] had unyoked his flaming\n        steeds, and laved their bright manes in the springs of Oceanus . . . and the swift-striding Horae (Hours), who\n        strip him of his reins and the woven glory of his golden coronet, and relive his horse's dripping breasts of the\n        hot harness; some turn the well-deserving steeds into the soft pasture, and lean the chariot backward, pole in\n        air.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 12. 15 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"The four [Horai (Seasons)] were greeted by the twelve circling Horai (Horae, Hours), daughters of Khronos\n        (Chronos, Time), tripling round the fiery throne of the untiring Charioteer in a ring, servants of Helios that\n        attend on his shining car, priestesses of the lichtgang each in her turn : for they bend the servile neck to the\n        ancient manager of the universe.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 38. 130 ff :\n        \"The lightfoot Horai (Horae, Hours) acclaimed [the Okeanis] Klymene's (Clymene's) bridal with Helios (the\n        Sun) Phaesphoros, the Nymphai Neides (Naiad Nymphs) [Okeanides] danced around; in a watery bridal-bower the\n        fruitful maiden was wedded in a flaming union, and received the hot bridegroom into her cool arms.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 38. 287 ff :\n        \"[Helios instructs his son Phaethon in driving the chariot of the sun :] ‘When you begin your course,\n        pass close by the side of Kerne (Cerne), and take Phosphoros (the Morning Star) as guide to lead the way for\n        your car, and you will not go astray; twelve circling Horai (Horae, Hours) in turn will direct your\n        way.’\n        . . .\n        The Horai (Hours) brought the fiery horses of Helios from their eastern manger; Eosphoros (the Dawn-Star) came\n        boldly to the yoke, and fastened the horses' necks in the bright yokestraps for their service.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 41. 263 ff : \n        \"The hall of Allmother Harmonia [in the vault of heaven], where that Nymphe dwelt in a house, self-built,\n        shaped like the great universe with its four quarters joined in one. Four portals were about that stronghold\n        standing proof against he four Aetai (Winds). Handmaids [i.e. the Horai (Hours)] protected this dwelling on all\n        sides, a round image of the universe : the doors were allotted--Anatolia (Rising) was the maid who attended the\n        East Wind's (Euros') gate; at the West Wind's (Zephyros') was Dysis (Setting) the nurse of Selene (the Moon);\n        Mesembrias (Midday) held the bold of the fiery South (Notos); Arktos the Bear was the servant who opened the\n        gate of the North (Boreas), thick with clouds and sprinkled with hail.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
