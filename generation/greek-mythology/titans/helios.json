  "content": "HELIOS (Helius) was the Titan god of the sun, a guardian of oaths, and the god of sight. He dwelt in a golden\n        palace in the River Okeanos (Oceanus) at the far ends of the earth from\n        which he emerged each dawn, crowned with the aureole of the sun, driving a chariot drawn by four winged steeds.\n        When he reached the the land of the Hesperides in the far West he descended into a\n        golden cup which bore him through the northern streams of Okeanos back to his rising place in the East.\n\nOnce his son Phaethon tried to drive the chariot of the sun, but he lost control\n        and set the earth ablaze. Zeus struck the boy down with a thunderbolt.\n\nHelios was depicted as a handsome, usually beardless, man clothed in purple robes and crowned with the shining\n        aureole of the sun. His sun-chariot was drawn by four, sometimes winged, steeds.\n\nHelios was identified with several other gods of fire and light such as Hephaistos (Hephaestus) and light-bringing Phoibos Apollon (Phoebus Apollo).\n\n[1.1] HYPERION & THEIA (Hesiod Theogony 371, Apollodorus 1.8)\n        [1.2] HYPERION & EURYPHAESSA (Homeric Hymn 31)\n        [1.3] HYPERION & AETHRA (Hyginus Pref)\n        [1.4] HYPERION (Homer Odyssey 12.168, Homeric Hymn to\n          Demeter 19, Homeric Hymn to Athena 12, Mimnermus Frag 12, Pindar Olympian 7 str3, Ovid Metamorphoses\n          4.170)\n\nHE′LIOS (Hêlios or Êelios), that is, the sun, or the god of the sun. He is described as the\n        son of Hyperion and Theia, and as a brother of Selene and Eos. (Hom. Od. xii. 176, 322, Hymn. in\n          Min. 9, 13; Hes. Theog. 371, &c.) From his father, he is frequently called Hyperionides, or\n        Hyperion, the latter of which is an abridged form of the patronymic, Hyperionion. (Hom. Od. xii. 176,\n        Hymn. in Cer. 74; Hes. Theog. 1011; Hom. Od. i. 24, ii. 19, 398, Hymn. in Apoll.\n          Pyth. 191.) In the Homeric hymn on Helios, he is called a son of Hyperion and Euryphaëssa. Homer\n        describes Helios as giving light both to gods and men: he rises in the east from Oceanus, though not from the\n        river, but from some lake or bog (limnê) formed by Oceanus, rises up into heaven, where he reaches the\n        highest point at noon time, and then he descends, arriving in the evening in the darkness of the west, and in\n        Oceanus. (Il. vii. 422, Od. iii. 1, &c., 335, iv. 400, x. 191, xi. 18, xii. 380.) Later\n        poets have marvellously embellished this simple notion: they tell of a most magnificent palace of Helios in the\n        east, containing a throne occupied by the god, and surrounded by personifications of the different divisions of\n        time (Ov. Met. ii. 1, &c.); and while Homer speaks only of the gates of Helios in the west, later\n        writers assign to him a second palace in the west, and describe his horses as feeding upon herbs growing in the\n        islands of the blessed. (Nonn. Dionys. xii. 1, &c.; Athen. vii. 296; Stat. Theb. iii.\n        407.) The points at which Helios rises and descends into the ocean are of course different at the different\n        seasons of the year; and the extreme points in the north and south, between which the rising and setting take\n        place, are the tropai êelioio. (Od. xv. 403; Hes. Op. et Dies, 449, 525.) The manner in\n        which Helios during the night passes front the western into the eastern ocean is not mentioned either by Homer\n        or Hesiod, but later poets make him sail in a golden boat round one-half of the earth, and thus arrive in the\n        east at the point from which he has to rise again. This golden boat is the work of Hephaestus. (Athen. xi. 469;\n        Apollod. ii. 5. § 10; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1632.) Others represent him as making his nightly voyage\n        while slumbering in a golden bed. (Athen. xi. 470.) The horses and chariot with which Helios makes his daily\n        career are not mentioned in the Iliad and Odyssey, but first occur in the Homeric hymn on Helios (9, 15; comp.\n        in Merc. 69, in Cer. 88), and both are described minutely by later poets. (Ov. Met.\n        ii. 106, &c.; Hygin. Fab. 183; Schol. ad Eurip. Pholen. 3 ; Pind. Ol. vii. 71.)\n\nHelios is described even in the Homeric poems as the god who sees and hears every thing, but, notwithstanding\n        this, he is unaware of the fact that the companions of Odysseus robbed his oxen, until he was informed of it by\n        Lampetia. (Od. xii. 375.) But, owing to his omniscience, he was able to betray to Hephaestus the\n        faithlessness of Aphrodite, and to reveal to Demeter the carrying off of her daughter. (Od. viii. 271,\n        Hymn. in Cer. 75, &c., in Sol. 10; comp. Soph. Ajax, 847, &c.) This idea of\n        Helios knowing every thing, which also contains the elements of his ethical and prophetic nature, seems to have\n        been the cause of Helios being confounded and identified with Apollo, though they were originally quite\n        distinct; and the identification was, in fact, never carried out completely, for no Greek poet ever made Apollo\n        ride in the chariot of Helios through the heavens, and among the Romans we find this idea only after the time of\n        Virgil. The representations of Apollo with rays around his head, to characterise him as identical with the sun,\n        belong to the time of the Roman empire.\n\nThe island of Thrinacia (Sicily) was sacred to Helios, and he there had flocks of oxen and sheep, each\n        consisting of 350 heads, which never increased or decreased, and were attended to by his daughters Phaetusa and\n        Lampetia. (Hom. Od. xii. 128. 261, &c.; Apollon. Rhod. iv. 965, &c.) Later traditions ascribe\n        to him flocks also in the island of Erytheia (Apollod. i. 6. § 1; comp. ii. 5. § 10 ; Theocrit. xxv.\n        130), and it may be remarked in general, that sacred flocks, especially of oxen, occur in most places where the\n        worship of Helios was established. His descendants are very numerous, and the surnames and epithets given him by\n        the poets are mostly descriptive of his character as the sun. Temples of Helios (êlieia) seem to have\n        existed in Greece at a very early time (Hom. Od. xii. 346), and in later times we find his worship\n        established in various places, as in Elis (Paus. vi. 25. § 5), at Apollonia (Herod. ix. 93), Hermione\n        (Paus. ii. 34. § 10), in the acropolis of Corinth (ii. 4. § 7; comp. ii. 1. § 6), near Argos (ii.\n        18. § 3), at Troezene (ii. 31. § 8), Megalopolis (viii. 9. § 2, 31. § 4), and several other\n        places, especially in the island of Rhodes, where the famous colossus of Rhodes was a representation of Helios:\n        it was 70 cubits in height, and, being overthrown by an earthquake, the Rhodians were commanded by an oracle not\n        to erect it again. (Pind. Ol. vii. 54, &c.; Strab. xiv. p. 652; Plin. H. N. xxxiv. 7, 17.)\n        The sacrifices offered to Helios consisted of white rams, boars, bulls, goats, lambs, especially white horses,\n        and honey. (Hom. Il. xix. 197; Eustath. ad Hom. pp. 36,1668; Hygin. Fab. 223; Paus.\n        iii. 20. § 5; Herod. i. 216; Strab. xi. 513.) Among the animals sacred to him, the cock is especially\n        mentioned. (Paus. v. 25. § 5.) The Roman poets, when speaking of the god of the sun (Sol), usually adopt\n        the notions of the Greeks, but the worship of Sol was introduced also at Rome, especially after the Romans had\n        become acquainted with the East, though traces of the worship of the sun and moon occur at a very early period.\n        (Varro, de Ling. Lat. v. 74; Dionys. ii. 50; Sext. Ruf. Reg. Urb. iv.) Helios was represented\n        on the pedestal of the Olympian Zeus, in the act of ascending his chariot (Paus. v. 11. § 3), and several\n        statutes of him are mentioned (vi. 24. § 5, viii. 9. § 2, 31. § 4); he was also represented\n        riding in his chariot, drawn by four horses.

None\n        other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering Zeus who gave her to Aides [Haides], her\n        father's brother, to be called his buxom wife. And Aides seized her and took her loudly crying in his chariot\n        down to his realm of mist and gloom. Yet, goddess, cease your loud lament and keep not vain anger\n        aunrelentingly: Aidoneus, the Ruler of Many, is no unfitting husband among the deathless gods for your child,\n        being your own brother and born of the same stock: also, for honour, he has that third share which he received\n        when division was made at the first, and is appointed lord of those among whome he dwells.’\n        So he spake, and called to his horses : and at his chiding they quickly whirled the swift chariot along, like\n        long-winged birds.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 4. 575 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"She [Demeter] roams the heaven, too [in search of Persephone], and accosts the Stars free of limpid\n        Oceanus near the chilly pole : ‘Parrhasian Stars (you can know everything, since you never sink beneath\n        Oceanus' stream), show this wretched parent her daughter, Persephone.’ She spoke.

Here were the fine broad-browed herds, here\n        were the plentiful fat flocks of Hyperion [Helios]. While the dark ship was still out at sea, I heard sheep\n        bleating and cows lowing as they entered their quarters for the night; and into my heart came back the blind\n        prophet's [Teiresias' (Tiresias') ] words and Aiaian Kirke's (Aeaean Circe's) also; both of them had enjoined me\n        earnestly to shun this island of the all-gladdening Helios. Troubled at heart, I spoke to my comrades thus :\n        ‘Comrades, listed to what I say, sad though your plight is; I must tell you of the prophetic words of\n        Theban Teiresias and of Kirke. They urged me solemnly, both of them, to shun this island of the all-gladdening\n        sun-god Helios, because there, they said, the direst of perils awaited us. Take heed then; row the dark vessel\n        past this island.’\n        So I spoke, and the men's hearts sank within them. Eurylokhos (Eurylochus) answered me at once [and with the\n        other men insist that Odysseus land's the ship] . . . We beached our ship and dragged it up to a certain cave\n        within whose hollows the Nymphai (Nymphs) could sit or weave their lovely dances. Then I called an assembly of\n        my men and spoke thus among them : ‘Friends, in our ship we have food and drink enough. Let us keep our\n        hands from the cattle, then, lest evil should overtake us; these beasts the cows and fat sheep, belong to the\n        dread divinity, Helios the sun-god, who sees all things and hears all things.’\n        So I spoke, and their own strong wills gave consent. Then for a whole month the south wind blew without ceasing\n        . . . [the men of Odysseus were starving, so the hero departed to pray in private to the gods.]\n        Among my comrades Eurylokhos put forth evil counsel : ‘Comrades, in this sad plight of ours, hear what I\n        have to say. Every form of death is loathsome to wretched mortals, but to perish of hunger, to starve to death -\n        that is the most pitiful thing of all. Enough! Let us carry off the best of Helios' cattle and give them in\n        sacrifice to the Deathless Ones whose home is wide heaven. And if ever we should return again to our own land,\n        Ithaka, we will hasten to build a sumptuous temple to Hyperion the sun-god, and there we may place fine\n        offerings in plenty. But if in anger over his long-horned cattle he resolves to wreck our ship and the other\n        gods second him--why, then, I would rather drink the brine and lose life at one gulp than waste away by inches\n        in this forsaken island.’\n        So spoke Eurylokhos, and the rest of the crew applauded him. They drove off at once the best of Helios'\n        cattle--it was near at hand, not far from the ship, that they were grazing, these handsome beasts with their\n        broad brows and curling horns. The men surrounded them and began their prayer to the gods, and because they had\n        no barley-meal in the ship, they plucked instead the fresh tender leaves of a tall oak. Prayer over, they\n        slaughtered and flayed the cows, cut out the thigh-bones and covered them with a double fold of fat, then laid\n        the raw meat above. They had no wine to make libation over the burning sacrifice, but instead poured water as\n        they set to roasting the inward parts. When the thigh-bones were quite consumed and the entrails tasted, they\n        sliced and spitted the rest.\n        At that moment the sleep that had soothed me [Odysseus] passed of a sudden from my eyelids, and I took my way to\n        the shore and ship again. Then, as I neared the curving vessel, the rich savour of roasting meat was wafted all\n        about me. I groaned aloud, I cried out to the deathless gods : ‘Oh Father Zeus, oh blessed and ever-living\n        gods, surely it was for my destruction that you lulled me with that fatal slumber, while the comrades that I\n        left behind me devised this deed of unrighteousness.’\n        But without delay Lampetie (Lampetia) of the trailing robe sped off to Hyperion [Helios] the sun god to tell him\n        that we had slain his cattle, and he with his heart inflamed with anger spoke out at once to the Deathless Ones\n        : ‘O Father Zeus, O blessed and ever-living gods, take vengeance on the crew of Laertes' son Odysseus; in\n        their lawlessness they have slain the cattle in which I always took delight, both as I climbed the starry sky\n        and as I took my path again back from the sky and down towards the earth. Unless these men pay a just atonement\n        for my cattle, I will descend to Haides' kingdom and shine among the dead.’\n        Zeus who masses the clouds made answer : ‘Helios, shine in the sight of the Deathless One and of mortals\n        over the fertile earth. As for those you speak of, soon enough I will strike their ship with my white-hot\n        thunderbolt and shatter and shiver it in mid-ocean.’\n        All this I heard from Kalypso (Calypso) of the lovely hair, who herself heard it, so she told me, from Hermes,\n        messenger of the gods.\n        When I reached the sea where the ship lay, I went round to the men one by one and upbraided them, but as for a\n        remedy, there was none to be found; the cattle were killed already. Then the gods began to show signs and\n        wonders to my crew. The beasts' hides began to move; the flesh on the spits, raw or roasted, began to bellow,\n        and there was a noise like the noise of cattle [perhaps because the cattle were immortal and could not die].\n        For six days more the crew still banqueted on the choice cattle that they had seized; but when Zeus brought us\n        the seventh day, the wind and raging tempest ceased. So without delay we went aboard, stepped the mast, hauled\n        the white sails and launched into wide ocean . . .

In consequence of these events the island was considered to be sacred to Helios, and the\n        Rhodians of later times made it their practice to honour Helios above all the other gods, as the ancestor and\n        founder from whom they were descended.
