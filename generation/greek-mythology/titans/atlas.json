  "content": "ATLAS was the Titan god who bore the sky aloft. He personified the quality of endurance (atlaô).\n\nAtlas was a leader of the Titanes (Titans) in their war against Zeus and\n        after their defeat he was condemned to carry the heavens upon his shoulders. According to others he was instead\n        (or later) appointed guardian of the pillars which held the earth and sky asunder. Atlas was also the god who\n        instructed mankind in the art of astronomy, a tool which was used by sailors in navigation and farmers in\n        measuring the seasons. These roles were often combined and Atlas becomes the god who turns the heaven on their\n        axis, causing the stars to revolve.\n\nHerakles (Heracles) encountered the Titan during his quest for the Golden Apples of the Hesperides. He agreed to take the heavens upon his shoulders while Atlas fetched\n        the apples. The hero also slew the Hesperian Drakon (Hesperian\n        Dragon), which in vase painting appears as the Titan's tormentor, and built two great pillars at the ends of the\n        earth, perhaps to relieve the Titan of his labour.\n\nIn a late myth, Atlas was transformed into the stony Atlas mountain by Perseus using the Gorgon's head. The Titan was also the constellation Kneeler.\n\n[1.1] IAPETOS & KLYMENE (Hesiod Theogony 507, Hyginus Pref)\n        [1.2] IAPETOS & ASIA (Apollodorus 1.8)\n        [1.3] IAPETOS (Ovid Metamorphoses 4.627)\n\n[1.1] THE PLEIADES (Hesiod Works &\n          Days 383, Hesiod Astronomy Frag 1, Simonides Frag 555, Aeschylus Frag 172, Ovid Metamorphoses 6.169, Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 3.349)\n        [1.2] THE PLEIADES (by Pleione) (Apollodorus 3.110, Ovid Fasti\n          5.79)\n        [1.3] THE PLEIADES, THE\n          HYADES, HYAS (by Pleione or Aethra) (Hyginus Fabulae 192, Hyginus\n          Astronomica 2.21, Ovid Fasti 5.164)\n        [2.1] KALYPSO (Homer Odyssey 1.52,\n          Apollodorus E7.23)\n        [3.1] MAIRA (Pausanias 8.12.7)\n        [4.1] DIONE (Hyginus Fabulae 83, Ovid\n          Metamorphoses 6.172)\n        [5.1] THE HESPERIDES (by Hesperis) (Diodorus Sicululs 4.26.2)\n        [5.2] THE HESPERIDES (Hyginus Astronomica 2.3)\n\nATLAS (Atlas), according to Hesiod (Theog. 507, &c.), a son of Japetus and Clymene, and a brother\n        of Menoetius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus; according to Apollodorus (i. 2. § 3), his mother's name was Asia;\n        and, according to Hyginus (Fab. Praef.), he was a son of Aether and Gaea. For other accounts see Diod.\n        iii. 60, iv. 27; Plat. Critias, p. 114; Serv. ad Aen. iv. 247. According to the description of\n        the Homeric poems, Atlas knows the depth of all the sea, and bears the long columns which keep asunder, or carry\n        all around (amphis echousi), earth and heaven. (Od. i. 52.) Hesiod only says, that he bore heaven with\n        his head and hands. (Comp. Aeschyl. Prom. 347, &c.; Paus. v. 18. § 1, 11. § 2.) In these\n        passages Atlas is described either as bearing heaven alone, or as bearing both heaven and earth; and several\n        modern scholars have been engaged in investigating which of the two notions was the original one. Much depends\n        upon the meaning of the Homeric expression amphis echousi; if the signification is \"the columns which keep\n        asunder heaven and earth,\" the columns (mountains) must be conceived as being somewhere in the middle of the\n        earth's surface; but if they mean \"bear or support all around,\" they must be regarded as forming the\n        circumference of the earth, upon which the vault of heaven rests apparently. In either case, the\n        meaning of keeping asunder is implied. In the Homeric description of Atlas, the idea of his being a superhuman\n        or divine being, with a personal existence, seems to be blended with the idea of a mountain. The idea of\n        heaven-bearing Atlas is, according to Letronne, a mere personification of a cosmographic notion, which arose\n        from the views entertained by the ancients respecting the nature of heaven and its relation to the earth; and\n        such a personification, when once established, was further developed and easily connected with other myths, such\n        as that of the Titans. Thus Atlas is described as the leader of the Titans in their contest with Zeus, and,\n        being conquered, he was condemned to the labour of bearing heaven on his head and hands. (Hesiod, l c.;\n        Hygin. Fab. 150.) Still later traditions distort the original idea still more, by putting rationalistic\n        interpretations upon it, and make Atlas a man who was metamorphosed into a mountain. Thus Ovid (Met.\n        iv. 630,&c., comp. ii. 296) relates, that Perseus came to him and asked for shelter, which he was refused,\n        whereupon Perseus, by means of the head of Medusa, changed him into mount Atlas, on which rested heaven with all\n        its stars. Others go still further, and represent Atlas as a powerful king, who possessed great knowledge of the\n        courses of the stars, and who was the first who taught men that heaven had the form of a globe. Hence the\n        expression that heaven rested on his shoulders was regarded as a mere figurative mode of speaking. (Diod. iii.\n        60, iv. 27; Paus. ix. 20. § 3; Serv. ad Aen. i. 745; Tzetz. ad Lycophr. 873.) At first,\n        the story of Atlas referred to one mountain only, which was believed to exist on the extreme boundary of the\n        earth; but, as geographical knowledge extended, the name of Atlas was transferred to other places, and thus we\n        read of a Mauritanian, Italian, Arcadian, and even of a Caucasian, Atlas. (Apollod. iii. 10. § 1 ; Dionys.\n        i. 61; Serv. ad Aen. viii. 134.) The common opinion, however, was, that the heaven-bearing Atlas was in\n        the north-western part of Africa, and the range of mountains in that part of the world bears the name of Atlas\n        down to this day. Atlas is said to have been the father of the Pleiades by Pleione or by Hesperis, of the Hyades\n        and Hesperides by Aethra, and of Oenomaus and Maea by Sterope. (Apollod. iii. 10. § 1; Diod. iv. 27; Serv.\n        ad Aen. viii. 130.) Dione and Calypso, and Hyas and Hesperus, are likewise called his children. (Hom.\n        Od. vii. 245; Hygin. Fab. 83.) Atlas was painted by Panaenus on the parapet surrounding the\n        statue of the Olympian Zeus (Paus. v. 11. § 2); on the chest of Cypselus he was seen carrying heaven and\n        holding in his hands the golden apples of the Hesperides; and on the throne of Apollo at Amyclae he was likewise\n        represented. (Paus. v. 18. § 1, iii. 18. § 7.)\n\nTE′LAMON (Telamôn). A surname of Atlas, describing him as the sufferer or bearer of heaven, from\n        tlaô.

This is shown by the eager look on his face, the club\n        thrown on the ground and the hands that beg for the task. There is no need to admire the shaded parts of\n        Herakles' body because they are vigorously drawn--for the attitudes of recumbent figures or persons standing\n        erect are easily shaded, and their accurate reproduction is not at all a mark of skill--but the shadows on Atlas\n        show a high degree of skill; for the shadows on a crouching figure like his run into one another, and do not\n        darken any of the projecting parts but they produce light on the parts that are hollow and retreating. The belly\n        of Atlas, for instance, one can see although he is bending forward, and one can perceive that he is panting. The\n        bodies in the heavens which he carries are painted in the ether that surrounds the stars; one can recognize a\n        bull, that is the Bull of the heavens [i.e. Taurus], and bears, the kind that are seen here. Of the winds some\n        are represented facing in the same direction and others as facing in the opposite direction, and while some are\n        friendly with each other others seem to keep up their strife in the heavens.\n        You will uphold these heavenly bodies for the present, Herakles; but before long you will live with them in the\n        sky, drinking, and embracing the beautiful Hebe.\"\n\nOvid, Heroides 9. 17 ff (trans.

Atlas Iapetionides (son of Iapetos) surpassed all men in\n        giant size. He ruled the world's last lands and that far sea that greets the panting horses of the sun and\n        welcomed their tired wheels. A thousand herds roamed on his pastures and a thousand flocks, unchecked,\n        untroubled by a neighbour's bounds; and there were trees whose glittering leaves of gold clothed golden apples\n        under golden boughs. ‘Good friend,’ Perseus addressed him, ‘if renown of lineage may count, I\n        take my line from Juppiter [Zeus], my father; or if deeds can win your admiration, mine you will admire. I ask\n        for rest and lodging.’ But the giant recalled the oracle which Themis Parnasia had given : ‘Atlas, a\n        time shall come when from your tree the gold shall be despoiled, and of that spoil a son of Jove shall\n        boast.’ In fear he had walled his orchards all around with massive ramparts and for guardian set an\n        enormous Draco; and drove off all strangers from the borders of his realm. To Perseus too ‘Away!\n        Begone!’ he cried, ‘Or you shall find no joy in that renown your lies invent, no joy in Juppiter\n        [Zeus]’, and added force to threats, as Perseus tried fair words at first, then bravely grappled him. But\n        when he found his strength surpassed (for who could match the strength of Atlas?) ‘Very well!’ he\n        taunted, ‘If you rate my thanks so low, accept a gift!’ and turned his face away and on his left\n        held out the loathsome head, Medusa's head. Atlas, so huge, became a mountain; beard and hair were changed to\n        forests, shoulders were cliffs, hands ridges; where his head had lately been, the soaring summit rose; his bones\n        were turned to stone. Then each part grew beyond all measure (so the gods ordained) and on his shoulders rested\n        the whole vault of heaven with all the innumerable stars.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 26. 2 (trans.

The account runs like\n        this: In the country known as Hesperitis there were two brothers whose fame was known abroad, Hesperos\n        (Hesperus) and Atlas. These brothers possessed flocks of sheep which excelled in beauty and were in colour of a\n        golden yellow, this being the reason why the poets, in speaking of these sheep as mela, called them\n        golden mela. Now Hesperos begat a daughter named Hesperis, who he gave in marriage to his brother and\n        after whom the land was given the name Hesperitis; and Atlas begat by her seven daughters, who were named after\n        their father Atlantides, and after their mother Hesperides. And since these Atlantides excelled in beauty and\n        chastity, Busiris the king of the Aigyptians (Egyptians), the account says, was seized with a desire to get the\n        maidens into his power; and consequently he dispatched pirates by sea with orders to seize the girls and deliver\n        them into his hands . . .\n        [Herakles (Heracles) slew Busiris.]\n        Meanwhile the pirates had seized the girls while they were playing in a certain garden and carried them off, and\n        fleeing swiftly to their ships had sailed away with them. Herakles came upon the pirates as they were taking\n        their meal on a certain strand, and learning from the maidens what had taken place he slew the pirates to a man\n        and brought the girls back to Atlas their father; and in return Atlas was so grateful to Herakles for his kindly\n        deed that he not only gladly gave him such assistance as his Labour called for, but he also instructed him quite\n        freely in the knowledge of astrology. For Atlas had worked out the science of astrology to a degree surpassing\n        others and had ingeniously discovered the spherical arrangement of the stars, and for that reason was generally\n        believed to be bearing the entire firmament upon his shoulders.
