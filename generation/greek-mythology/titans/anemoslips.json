  "content": "LIPS was the god of the south-west wind. On the Tower of the Winds in Athens he is depicted as a winged man\n        holding the stern of a ship.\n\nEuenus, Fragment 7 (trans. Gerber, Vol. Greek Elegiac) (Greek elegy C5th B.C.) :\n        \n        \"Lips Anemos (South-West Wind) quickly brings clouds and quickly a clear sky, but all the clouds accompany\n        Argestes Anemos (North-West Wind).\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 34. 2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"I will also relate what astonished me most in Methana [in Argolis]. The wind called Lips, striking\n        the budding vines from the Saronic Gulf, blights their buds. So while the wind is still rushing on, two men cut\n        in two a cock whose feathers are all white, and run round the vines in opposite directions, each carrying half\n        of the cock. When they meet at their starting place, they bury the pieces there. Such are the means they have\n        devised against the Lips.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
