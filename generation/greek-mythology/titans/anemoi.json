  "content": "THE ANEMOI were the gods of the four winds--namely Boreas the North-Wind, Zephryos (Zephyrus) the West, Notos (Notus) the\n        South, and Euros (Eurus) the East. Each of these was associated with a\n        season--Boreas was the cold breath of winter, Zephyros the god of spring breezes, and Notos the god of summer\n        rain-storms.\n\nThe Winds were portrayed as either man-shaped, winged gods who lived together in a cavern on Mount Haimos\n        (Haemus) in Thrake (Thrace), or as horse-shaped divinities stabled by Aiolos (Aeolus)\n        Hippotades, \"the Reiner of Horses\", on the island of Aiolia and set out to graze on the shores of the\n        earth-encircling River Okeanos (Oceanus).\n\nEarly poets, such as Homer and Hesiod, drew a clear distinction between the four, relatively benign, seasonal\n        Winds (Anemoi) and the destructive Storm-Winds (Anemoi Thuellai). The latter,\n        spawned by the monster Typhoeus, were either housed in the caverns of Aiolos or guarded by the Hekatonkheires in the pits of Tartaros. Later authors blurred the distinction between the two.\n\nThe female counterparts of the Anemoi were the Aellai Harpyiai\n        (Harpies). Mated with the Winds they produced many swift, immortal horses.\n\n[1.1] ASTRAIOS & EOS (Hesiod Theogony 378, Apollodorus 1.8, Hyginus Preface, Nonnus Dionysiaca 6.18 &\n          47.340)\n        [1.2] EOS (Quintus Smyrnaeus 2.549)\n        [1.3] ASTRAIOS (Ovid Metamorphoses 14.544)\n\n[1.1] ZEPHYROS, BOREAS, NOTOS (Hesiod Theogony 378 & 869, Pindar Maiden\n          Songs Frag 104)\n        [1.2] ZEPHYROS, BOREAS (Homer Iliad 9.4 & 23.194)\n        [1.3] ZEPHYROS, BOREAS, NOTOS, EUROS (Homer\n          Odyssey 5.291, Quintus Smyrnaeus 12.189, Valerius Flaccus 1.574, Nonnus Dionysiaca 6.18)\n        [1.4] ZEPHYROS, BOREAS, NOTOS, EUROS, KAIKIAS, APELIOTES, SKIRON, LIPS\n        (Tower of the Winds in Athens)\n\nEight Wind-Gods are depicted on the Tower of the Winds in Athens dating from the C1st B.C. Their names and\n        attributes are:--\n\nBOREAS The god of the North-Wind is depicted with shaggy hair and beard, with a\n        billowing cloak and a conch shell in his hands.\n\nKAIKIAS (Caicias) The god of the North-East Wind is portrayed as a bearded man with a shield full of\n        hail-stones.\n\nAPELIOTES The god of the East Wind appears as a clean-shaven man, holding a cloak full of fruit and grain.\n\nEUROS (Eurus) The god of the South-East Wind who is sculpted as a bearded man\n        holding a heavy cloak.\n\nNOTOS (Notus) The god of the South Wind pours water from a vase.\n\nLIPS The God of the South-West Wind is represented holding the stern of a ship.\n\nZEPHYROS (Zephyrus) God of the West-Wind is depicted as a beardless youth\n        scattering flowers from his mantle.\n\nSKIRON (Sciron) The god of the North-West is a bearded man tilting a cauldron, signifying the onset of winter.\n\nVENTI (Anemoi), the winds. They appear personified even in the Homeric poems, but at the same time they are\n        conceived as ordinary phenomena of nature. The master and ruler of all the winds is Aeolus, who resides in the\n        island Aeolia (Virg. Aen. i. 52, &c.; comp. Aeolus) ; but the other gods also, especially Zeus,\n        exercise a power over them. (Hom. Il. xii. 281.) Homer mentions by name Boreas (north wind), Eurus\n        (east wind), Notus (south wind), and Zephyrus (west wind). When the funeral pile of Patroclus could not be made\n        to burn, Achilles promised to offer sacrifices to the winds, and Iris accordingly hastening to them, found them\n        feasting in the palace of Zephyrus in Thrace. Boreas and Zephyrus, at the invitation of Iris, forthwith hastened\n        across the Thracian sea into Asia, to cause the fire to blaze. (Hom. Il. xxiii. 185, &c. ; comp.\n        ii. 145, &c., v. 534, ix. 5, Od. v. 295.) Boreas and Zephyrus are usually mentioned together by\n        Homer, just as Eurus and Notus. (Comp. Boreas and Zephyrus.) According to Hesiod (Theog. 378, &c.,\n        869, &c.), the beneficial winds, Notus, Boreas, Argestes, and Zephyrus, were the sons of Astraeus and Eos,\n        and the destructive ones, as Typhon, are said to be the sons of Typhoeus. Later, especially philosophical\n        writers, endeavoured to define the winds more accurately, according to their places in the compass. Thus\n        Aristotle (Meteor. ii. 6), besides the four principal winds (Boreas or Aparctias, Euris, Notus, and\n        Zephyrus) mentions three, the Meses, Caicias, and Apeliotes. between Boreas and Eurus ; between Eurus and Notus\n        he places the Phoenicias ; between Notus and Zephyrus he has only the Lips, and between Zephyrus and Boreas he\n        places the Argestes (Olympias or Sciron) and the Thrascias. It must further be observed that according to\n        Aristotle, the Eurus is not due east, but south east. In the Museum Pio-Clementinum there exists a marble\n        monument upon which the winds are described with their Greek and Latin names, viz. Septentrio (Aparctias), Eurus\n        (Euros, or southeast), and between these two Aquilo (Boreas), Vulturnus (Caicias) and Solanus (Apheliotes).\n        Between Eurus and Notus (Notos) there is only one, the Euroauster (Euronotus); between Notus and Favonius\n        (Zephyrus) are marked Austro-Africus (Libonotus), and Africus (Lips); and between Favonius and Septentrio we\n        find Chrus (Iapyx) and Circius (Thracius). See the tables of the winds figured in Göttling's edit. of\n        Hesiod, p. 39. The winds were represented by poets and artists in different ways; the latter usually represented\n        them as beings with wings at their heads and shoulders (Ov. Met. i. 264, &c.; Philostr.\n        Icon. i. 24). On the chest of Cypselus, Boreas in the act of carrying off Oreithyia, was represented\n        with serpents in the place of legs (Paus. v. 19. § 1). The most remarkable monument representing the winds\n        is the octagonal tower of Andronicus Cyrrhestes at Athens. Each of the eight sides of the monument represents\n        one of the eight principal winds in a flying attitude. A moveable Triton in the centre of the cupola pointed\n        with his staff to the wind blowing at the time. All these eight figures have wings at their shoulders, all are\n        clothed, and the peculiarities of the winds are indicated by their bodies and various attributes. (Hirt,\n        Mythol. Bilderb. p. 140, &c.) Black lambs were offered as sacrifices to the destructive winds, and\n        white ones to favourable or good winds. (Aristoph. Ran. 845; Virg. Aen. iii. 117.) Boreas had\n        a temple on the river Ilissus in Attica (Herod. vii. 189; comp. Paus. viii. 27. § 9), and between Titane\n        and Sicyon there was an altar of the winds, upon which a priest offered a sacrifice to the winds once in every\n        year. (Paus. ii. 12. § 1.) Zephyrus had an altar on the sacred road to Eleusis. (i. 37. § 1.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 378 ff (trans.

Here the seasonal winds are clearly distinguished from the storm winds.]\n\nHomer, Iliad 23. 194 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"[The funeral of Akhilleus' (Achilles') friend Patroklos (Patroclus) :] The pyre of the dead Patroklos\n        would not light. Then swift-footed brilliant Akhilleus thought of one more thing that he must do. He stood apart\n        from the pyre and made his prayer to the two winds Boreas and Zephryos (Zephyrus), north wind and west, and\n        promised them splendid offerings, and much outpouring from a golden goblet entreated them to come, so that the\n        bodies might with best speed burn in the fire and the timber burst into flame. And Iris, hearing his prayer,\n        went swiftly as messenger to the Winds for him. Now the Winds assembled within the house of storm-blowing\n        Zephyros were taking part in a feast, and Iris paused in her running and stood on the stone doorsill; but they,\n        when their eyes saw her, sprang to their feet, and each one asked her to sit beside them. But she refused to be\n        seated and spoke the word to them : ‘I must not sit down. I am going back to the running waters of Okeanos\n        (Oceanus) and the Aithiopians' (Ethiopians') land, where they are making grand sacrifice to the immortals; there\n        I, too, shall partake of the sacraments. But Akhilleus' prayer is that Boreas and blustering Zephyros may come\n        to him, and he promises them splendid offerings, so that you may set ablaze the funeral pyre, whereon lies\n        Patroklos, with all Akhaians (Achaeans) mourning about him.’\n        She spoke so, and went away, and they with immortal clamour rose up, and swept the clouds in confusion before\n        them. They came with a sudden blast upon the sea, and the waves rose under the whistling wind. They came to the\n        generous Troad and hit the pure, and a huge inhuman blaze rose, roaring. Nightlong they piled the flames on the\n        funeral pyre together and blew with a screaming blast . . . At that time when Eosphoros (the Dawn-Star) passes\n        across earth, harbinger of light, and after him Eos (the Dawn) of the saffron mantle is scattered across the\n        sea, the fire died down and the flames were over. The Winds took their way back toward home again, crossing the\n        Thracian water, and it boiled with a moaning swell as they crossed it.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 2. 549 ff (trans. Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The funeral of Memnon, son of Eos the Dawn :] At their mother's [Eos'] hest all the light Aetai (Winds)\n        [Anemoi] took hands, and slid down one long stream of sighing wind to Priamos' (Priam's) plain, and floated\n        round the dead, and softly, swiftly caught they up, and bare through silver mists Eos' (the Dawn-queen's) son\n        [the body of Memnon], with hearts sore aching for their brother's fall, while moaned around them all the air . .\n        . Now flew on bearing Eos' mighty son the rushing Aetai (Winds) skimming earth's face and palled about with\n        night.\n        Nor were his Aithiopian (Ethiopian) comrades left to wander of their King forlorn: a God suddenly winged those\n        eager souls with speed such as should soon be theirs for ever, changed to flying fowl, the children of the air.\n        Wailing their King in the Aetai's (Winds') track they sped . . . so they left far behind that stricken field of\n        blood, and fast they followed after those swift Aetai (Winds) with multitudinous moaning, veiled in mist\n        unearthly. Trojans over all the plain and Danaans marvelled, seeing that great host vanishing with their King.\n        All hearts stood still in dumb amazement. But the tireless Aetai (Winds) sighing set hero Memnon's giant corpse\n        down by the deep flow of Aisepos' (Aesepus') stream [i.e. where the hero was burried].\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 3. 580 ff :\n        \"[The funeral of Akhilleus (Achilles) :] For honour to the goddess [Thetis], Nereus' child, he [Zeus] sent\n        to Aiolos (Aeolus) Hermes, bidding him summon the sacred might of his swift Anemoi (Winds), for that the corpse\n        of Aiakos' (Aeacus') son [Akhilleus] must now be burned. With speed he went, and Aiolos refused not: tempestuous\n        Boreas (North-wind) in haste he summoned, and the wild blast of Zephyros (the West); and to Troy sped they on\n        their whirlwind wings. Fast in mad onrush, fast across the deep they darted; roared beneath them as they flew\n        the sea, the land; above crashed thunder-voiced clouds headlong hurtling through the firmament. Then by decree\n        of Zeus down on the pyre of slain Akhilleus, like a charging host swooped they; upleapt the Fire-god's madding\n        breath: uprose a long wail from the Myrmidones. then, though with whirlwind rushes toiled the Anemoi (Winds),\n        all day, all night, they needs must fan the flames ere that death-pyre burned out. Up to the heavens\n        vast-volumed rolled the smoke. The huge tree-trunks groaned, writhing, bursting, in the heat, and dropped the\n        dark-grey ash all round. So when the Anemoi (Winds) had tirelessly fulfilled their mighty task, back to their\n        cave they rode cloud-charioted.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 4. 1 ff :\n        \"[The death of Glaukos (Glaucus) in the Trojan War :] Nor did the hapless Trojans leave unwept the\n        warrior-king Hippolokhos' (Hippolochus') hero-son [Glaukos], but laid, in front of the Dardanian gate, upon the\n        pyre that captain war-renowned. But him Apollon's self caught swiftly up out of the blazing fire, and to the\n        Anemoi (Winds) gave him, to bear away to Lykia-land (Lycia). And fast and far they bare him, 'neath the glens of\n        high Telandros (Telandrus), to a lovely glade; and for a monument above his grave upheaved a granite rock.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 1. 205 ff (trans.

To the stars she stretched her\n        arms, and thrice she turned about and thrice bedewed her locks with water, thrice a wailing cry she gave, then\n        kneeling on the stony ground, ‘O Nox (Night) [Nyx], Mother of Mysteries, and all ye golden Astra (Stars)\n        who with Luna (the Moon) [Selene] succeed the fires of day, and thou, divine triceps (three-formed) Hecate, who\n        . . . dost fortify the arts of magic, and thou, kindly Tellus (the Earth) [Gaia], who dost for magic potent\n        herbs provide; ye Venti (Winds) [Anemoi] and Aurae (Airs) . . . be with me now! By your enabling power, at my\n        behest . . . my magic song rouses the quiet, calms the angry seas; I bring the clouds and make the clouds\n        withdraw, I call the winds and quell them.’\"\n\nIn the Orphic Hymns the Winds were hymned as the gods of the seasons--Zephyros\n          (Zephyrus) was spring, Notos (Notus) summer, and Boreas winter. The early Greeks only recognised three, rather\n          than four, seasons. The fourth Wind, Euros (Eurus), is similarly absent from Homer and Hesiod.\n\nOrphic Hymn 80 to Boreas (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"To Boreas (the North-Wind), Fumigation from Frankincense. Boreas, whose wintry blasts, terrific, tear the\n        bosom of the deep surrounding air; cold icy power, approach, and favouring blow, and Thrake (Thrace) awhile\n        desert, exposed to snow: the air's all-misty darkening state dissolve, with pregnant clouds whose frames in\n        showers resolve. Serenely temper all within the sky, and wipe from moisture aither's splendid eye.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 81 to Zephyrus :\n          \"To Zephyros (Zephyrus, the West-Wind), Fumigation from Frankincense. Sea-born, aerial, blowing from the\n          west, sweet Breezes (Aurai, Aurae), who give to wearied labour rest. Vernal and grassy, and of murmuring\n          sound, to ships delightful through the sea profound; for these, impelled by you with gentle force, pursue with\n          prosperous fate their destined course. With blameless gales regard my suppliant prayer, Zephyros unseen,\n          light-winged, and formed from air.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 82 to Notus :\n        \"To Notos (Notus, the South-Wind), Fumigation from Frankincense. Wide-coursing gales, whose lightly leaping\n        feet with rapid wings the air's wet bosom beat, approach, benevolent, swift-whirling powers, with humid clouds\n        the principles of showers; for showery clouds are portioned to your care, to send on earth from all-surrounding\n        air. Hear, blessed power, these holy rites attend, and fruitful rains on earth all-parent send.\"\n\nThe Winds were occasionally worshipped as a group. Cults of individual Winds also existed, see Boreas and Lips.\n\nHerodotus, Histories 7. 178 (trans. Godley) (Greek historian C5th B.C.) :\n        \"So with all speed the Greeks went their several ways to meet the enemy [i.e. the invading Persians]. In\n        the meantime, the Delphians, who were afraid for themselves and for Hellas, consulted the god. They were advised\n        to pray to the Anemoi (Winds), for these would be potent allies for Hellas. When they had received the oracle,\n        the Delphians first sent word of it to those Greeks who desired to be free; because of their dread of the\n        barbarian, they were forever grateful. Subsequently they erected an altar to the Winds at Thyia, the present\n        location of the precinct of Thyia the daughter of Kephisos (Cephisus), and they offered sacrifices to them.\n        This, then, is the reason why the Delphians to this day offer the Winds sacrifice of propitiation.\n        The story is told that because of an oracle the Athenians invoked Boreas, the north wind, to help them, since\n        another oracle told them to summon their son-in-law as an ally. According to the Hellenic story, Boreas had an\n        Attic wife, Orithyia, the daughter of Erekhtheus (Erechtheus), ancient king of Athens. Because of this\n        connection, so the tale goes, the Athenians considered Boreas to be their son-in-law. They were stationed off\n        Khalkis (Chalcis) in Euboia (Euboea), and when they saw the storm rising, they then, if they had not already,\n        sacrificed to and called upon Boreas and Orithyia to help them by destroying the barbarian fleet, just as before\n        at Athos.  I cannot say whether this was the cause of Boreas falling upon the barbarians as they lay at\n        anchor, but the Athenians say that he had come to their aid before and that he was the agent this time. When\n        they went home, they founded a sacred precinct of Boreas beside the Ilissos (Ilissus) river.\n        There was no counting how many grain-ships and other vessels were destroyed ...  The storm lasted three\n        days. Finally the [Persian] Magi made offerings and cast spells upon the Wind [Boreas], sacrificing also to\n        Thetis and the Nereides. In this way they made the Wind stop on the fourth day--or perhaps it died down on its\n        own. They sacrificed to Thetis after hearing from the Ionians the story that it was from this place that Peleus\n        had carried her off and that all the headland of Sepia [in Euboia] belonged to her and to the other Nereides.\n        The storm, then, ceased on the fourth day [but a large portion of the Persian fleet was destroyed].\"\n\nAelian, On Animals 7. 27 (trans.
