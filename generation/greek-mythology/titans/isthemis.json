  "content": "THEMIS was the Titan goddess of divine law and order--the traditional rules of conduct first established by the\n        gods. She was also a prophetic goddess who presided over the most ancient oracles, including Delphoi (Delphi).\n        In this role, she was the divine voice (themistes) who first instructed mankind in the primal laws of\n        justice and morality, such as the precepts of piety, the rules of hospitality, good governance, conduct of\n        assembly, and pious offerings to the gods. In Greek, the word themis referred to divine law, those\n        rules of conduct long established by custom. Unlike the word nomos, the term was not usually used to\n        describe laws of human decree.\n\nThemis was an early bride of Zeus and his first counsellor. She was often\n        represented seated beside his throne advising him on the precepts of divine law and the rules of fate.\n\nThemis was closely identified with Demeter Thesmophoros (\"Bringer\n        of Law\"). Indeed Themis' six children, the spring-time Horai (Horae, Seasons) and death-bringing Moirai\n        (Moirae, Fates), reflect the dual-functions of Demeter's own daughter Persephone. Themis was also identified with Gaia (Gaea, Earth) especially in the role of the oracular voice of earth.\n\n[1.1] OURANOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 132, Orphic Hymn 79, Euripides Eumenides 1, Apollodorus 1.13, Diodorus\n          Siculus 5.66.1)\n        [1.2] AITHER (or OURANOS) &\n        GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] THE MOIRAI, THE HORAI (EUNOMIA, EIRENE, DIKE) (by Zeus) (Hesiod Theogony 901, Apollodorus 1.13)\n        [1.2] THE HORAI (EUNOMIA, EIRENE, DIKE) (by Zeus) (Pindar Olympian 9 & 13, Pindar Frag 30,\n          Hyginus Pref)\n        [1.3] THE NYMPHAI (by Zeus)\n        (Apollodorus 2.114)\n        [2.1] PROMETHEUS (Aeschylus Prometheus 8 & 211\n          & 873)\n\nTHEMIS (Themis). A daughter of Uranus (others say Helios, Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 129) and Ge, was married\n        to Zeus, by whom she became the mother of the Horae, Eunomia, Dice (Astraea), Eirene, and the Moerae. (Hes.\n        Theog. 135, 901, &c.; Apollod. i. 3. § 1.) In the Homeric poems, Themis is the personification\n        of the order of things established by law, custom, and equity, whence she is described as reigning in the\n        assemblies of men (Od. ii. 68, &c.), and as convening, by the command of Zeus, the assembly of the\n        gods. (Il. xx. 4.) She dwells in Olympus, and is on friendly terms with Hera. (xv. 87, &c.) This\n        character of Themis was recognised in the fact that at Thebes she had a sanctuary in common with the Moerae and\n        Zeus Agoraeus (Paus. ix. 25. § 4), and at Olympia in common with the Horae. (Paus. v. 14. § 8, 17.\n        § 1; comp. Diod. v. 67.) Besides this she is also described as an ancient prophetic divinity, and is said\n        to have been in possession of the Delphic oracle as the successor of Ge, and previous to Apollo. (Ov.\n        Met. i. 321, iv. 642; Apollon. Rhod. iv. 800; Serv. ad Aen. iv. 246; Apollod. i. 4. § 1 ;\n        Paus. x. 5. § 3; Aeschyl. Eum. init.) The worship of Themis was established at Thebes, Olympia,\n        Athens (Paus. i. 22. § 1), at Tanagra (ix. 22. § 1), and at Troezene, where an altar was dedicated to\n        the Themides. (ii. 31. § 8.) Nymphs believed to be daughters of Zeus and Themis lived in a cave on\n        the river Eridanus (Apollod. ii. 5. § 11 ; Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1396; Hesych. s.\n          v. Themistiades), and the Hesperides also are called daughters of Zeus and Themis. (Schol. ad Eurip.\n          Hippol. 737.) She is often represented on coins resembling the figure of Athena with a cornucopia and a\n        pair of scales.
