  "content": "SELENE was the Titan goddess of the moon. She was depicted as a woman riding sidesaddle on a horse or driving a\n        chariot drawn by a pair of winged steeds. Her lunar sphere or crescent was either a crown set upon her head or\n        the fold of a raised, shining cloak. She was sometimes said to drive a team of oxen and her lunar crescent was\n        likened to a pair of bull's horns.\n\nSelene's great love was the shepherd prince Endymion. The beautiful boy\n        was granted eternal youth and immortality by Zeus and placed in a state of eternal slumber in a cave near the\n        peak of Lydian Mount Latmos (Latmus). His heavenly bride consorted with him there in the night.\n\nA number of other goddesses were also associated with the moon, however, only Selene was represented by the old\n        Greek poets represented as the moon incarnate. Other Greek moon goddesses included Pasiphae, the Leukippides\n          (Leucippes), Eileithyia, Hekate (Hecate), Artemis, Bendis, and Hera (who sometimes doubled for Selene in the Endymion myth).\n\n[1.1] HYPERION & THEIA (Hesiod Theogony 371, Apollodorus 1.8, Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.2] HYPERION & EURYPHAESSA (Homeric Hymn 31 to Helios)\n        [2.1] PALLAS (Homeric Hymn 4 to Hermes 100, Ovid Fasti\n          4.373)\n        [3.1] HELIOS (Euripides Phoenicians 175, Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          44.198)\n\n[1.1] PANDEIA (by Zeus) (Homeric Hymn 32 to Selene, Hyginus Preface)\n        [2.1] ERSA (by Zeus) (Greek Lyric II Alcman Frag 57)\n        [3.1] NEMEA (by Zeus) (Scholiast on Pindar's Nemean Ode)\n        [4.1] THE HORAI x4 (by Helios) (Quintus Smyrnaeus 10.334)\n        [5.1] THE MENAI x50 (by Endymion) (Pausanias 5.1.5)\n        [6.1] NEMEAN LION (Aelian On Animals 12.7,\n          Hyginus Fabulae 30, Seneca Hercules Furens 83)\n        [7.1] MOUSAIOS (Ion of Chiod Frag 30a, Plato Republic 364d, Philodemus On\n          Piety)\n        [8.1] NARKISSOS (by Endymion) (Nonnus Dionysiaca 48.582)\n\nSELE′NE (Selênê), also called Mene, or Latin Luna, was the goddess of the moon, or the moon\n        personified into a divine being. She is called a daughter of Hyperion and Theia, and accordingly a sister of\n        Helios and Eos (Hes. Theog. 371, &c.; Apollod. i. 2. § 2; Schol. ad Pind. Isthm. v.\n        1, ad Apollon. Rhod. iv. 55); but others speak of her as a daughter of Hyperion by Euryphaessa (Hom.\n        Hymn. 31. 5), or of Pallas (Hom. Hymn. in Merc. 99, &c.), or of Zeus and Latona (Schol.\n        ad Eurip. Phoen. 175), or lastly of Helios (Eurip. l.c.; comp. Hygin. Praef. p. 10,\n        ed. Muncker). She is also called Phoebe, as the sister of Phoebus, the god of the sun. By Endymion, whom she\n        loved, and whom she sent to sleep in order to kiss him, she became the mother of fifty daughters (Apollod. i. 7.\n        § 5; Cic. Tusc. i. 38; Catull. 66. 5; Paus. v. 1. § 2); by Zeus she became the mother of\n        Pandeia, Ersa, and Nemea (Hom. Hymn. 32. 14 ; Plut. Sympos. iii. in fin.; Schol. ad Pind.\n          Nem. Hypoth. p. 425, ed. Böckh). Pan also is said to have had connexion with her in the shape of a\n        white ram (Virg. Georg. iii. 391). Selene is described as a very beautiful goddess, with long wings and\n        a golden diadem (Hom. Hymn. 32. 1, 7), and Aeschylus (Sept. 390) calls her the eye of night.\n        She rode, like her brother Helios, across the heavens in a chariot drawn by two white horses, cows, or mules\n        (Ov. Fast. iv. 374, iii. 110, Rem. Am. 258 ; Auson. Ep. v. 3; Claudian, Rapt.\n          Proserp. iii. 403; Nonn. Dionys. vii. 244). She was represented on the pedestal of the throne of\n        Zeus at Olympia, riding on a horse or a mule (Paus. v. 11. § 3); and at Elis there was a statue of her with\n        two horns (Paus. vi. 24. § 5). In later times Selene was identified with Artemis, and the worship of the\n        two became amalgamated (Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 114, 141 ; Soph. Oed. Tyr. 207 ; Plut.\n        Sympos. l.c.; Catull. 34. 16; Serv. ad Aen. iv. 511, vi. 118). In works of art, however, the\n        two divinities are usually distinguished; the face of Selene being more full and round, her figure less tall,\n        and always clothed in a long robe; her veil forms an arch above her head, and above it there is the crescent. At\n        Rome Luna had a temple on the Aventine. (Liv. xl. 2; Ov. Fast. iii. 884.)\n\nMENE (Mênê), a female divinity presiding over the months. (Hom.

A vase painting depicts Endymion waving such a fleece before the goddess'\n        chariot.

Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And next, sweet voiced Mousai (Muses), daughters of Zeus, well skilled in song, tell of the long-winged\n        Mene (Moon) [Selene]. From her immortal head a radiance is shown from heaven and embraces earth; and great is\n        the beauty that ariseth from her shining light. The air, unlit before, glows with the light of her golden crown,\n        and her rays beam clear, whensoever bright Selene having bathed her lovely body in the waters of Okeanos\n        (Oceanus), and donned her far-gleaming raiment, and yoked her strong-necked, shining team, and drives on her\n        long-maned horses at full speed, at eventime in the mid-month: then her great orbit is full and then her beams\n        shine brightest as she increases. So she is a sure token and a sign to mortal men.\n        Once Kronides (Cronides) [Zeus] was joined with her in love; and she conceived an bare a daughter Pandeia,\n        exceeding lovely amongst the deathless gods. Hail, white-armed goddess, bright Selene, mild, bright-tressed\n        queen! And now I will leave you and sing the glorious of men half-divine, whose deeds minstrels, the servants of\n        the Mousai, celebrate with lovely lips.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 9 to Selene (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"To Selene (Moon), Fumigation from Aromatics. Hear, goddess queen (thea basileia), diffusing\n        silver light, bull-horned, and wandering through the gloom of night. With stars surrounded, and with circuit\n        wide night's torch extending, through the heavens you ride: female and male, with silvery rays you shine, and\n        now full-orbed, now tending to decline. Mother of ages, fruit-producing Mene (Moon), whose amber orb makes\n        night's reflected noon: lover of horses, splendid queen of night, all-seeing power, bedecked with starry light,\n        lover of vigilance, the foe of strife, in peace rejoicing, and a prudent life: fair lamp of night, its ornament\n        and friend, who givest to nature's works their destined end. Queen of the stars, all-wise Goddess, hail! Decked\n        with a graceful robe and amble veil. Come, blessed Goddess, prudent, starry, bright, come, moony-lamp, with\n        chaste and splendid light, shine on these sacred rites with prosperous rays, and pleased accept thy suppliants'\n        mystic praise.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 26. 1 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"From Oitylos (Oetylus) to Thalamai (Thalamae) [in Lakedaimonia] the road is about eighty stades long. On\n        it is a sanctuary of Ino and an oracle. They consult the oracle in sleep, and the goddess reveals whatever they\n        wish to learn, in dreams. Bronze statues of Pasiphae and of Helios (the Sun) stand in the unroofed part of the\n        sanctuary. It was not possible to see the one within the temple clearly, owing to the garlands, but they say\n        this too is of bronze. Water, sweet to drink, flows from a sacred spring. Pasiphae is a title of Selene (the\n        Moon), and is not a local goddess of the people of Thalamai.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 6. 24. 6 :\n        \"In another part [of the market-place of Elis] are the stone images of Helios (the Sun) and Selene (the\n        Moon); from the head of Selene project horns, from the head of Helios, his rays.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 3. 883 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"March 31 Comitialis.
