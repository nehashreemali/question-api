  "content": "PROMETHEUS was the Titan god of forethought and crafty counsel who was given the task of moulding mankind out\n        of clay. His attempts to better the lives of his creation brought him into conflict with Zeus. Firstly he tricked the gods out of the best portion of the sacrificial\n        feast, acquiring the meat for the feasting of man. Then, when Zeus withheld fire, he stole it from heaven and\n        delivered it to mortal kind hidden inside a fennel-stalk. As punishment for these rebellious acts, Zeus ordered\n        the creation of Pandora (the first woman) as a means to deliver misfortune\n        into the house of man, or as a way to cheat mankind of the company of the good spirits. Prometheus meanwhile,\n        was arrested and bound to a stake on Mount Kaukasos (Caucasus) where an eagle was set to feed upon his ever-regenerating liver (or, some say,\n        heart). Generations later the great hero Herakles (Heracles) came along and released the old Titan from his\n        torture.\n\nPrometheus was loosely identified in cult and myth with the fire-god Hephaistos (Hephaestus) and the giant Tityos (Tityus).\n\n[1.1] IAPETOS & KLYMENE (Hesiod Theogony 507, Hesiod Works & Days 54, Hyginus Fabulae 142)\n        [1.2] IAPETOS & ASIA (Apollodorus 1.8)\n        [1.3] IAPETOS (Quintus Smyrnaeus 10.190, Diodorus Sic.\n          5.67.1, Ovid Metamorphoses 1.82, Valerius Flaccus 4.60, Oppian Halieutica 5.4)\n        [2.1] THEMIS or GAIA (Aesch.

Theog. 507). His name signifies \"forethought,\" as that of his brother Epimetheus\n        denotes \"afterthought.\" Others call Prometheus a son of Themis (Aeschyl. Prom. 18), or of Uranus and\n        Clymene, or of the Titan Eurymedon and Hera (Potter, Comment. ad Lyc. Cass. 1283; Eustath. ad\n          Hom. p. 987). By Pandora, Hesione, or Axiothea, he is said to have been the father of Deucalion (Aesch.\n        Prom. 560 ; Tzetz. ad Lyc. 1283; Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. ii. 1086), by Pyrrha or\n        Clymene he begot Hellen (and according to some also Deucalion; Schol. ad Apollon. l. c.;\n        Schol. ad Pind. Ol. ix. 68), and by Celaeno he was the father of Lycus and Chimareus (Tzetz. ad.\n          Lyc. 132, 219), while Herodotus (iv. 45) calls his wife Asia.\n\nThe following is an outline of the legends related of him by the ancients. Once in the reign of Zeus, when gods\n        and men were disputing with one another at Mecone (afterwards Sicyon, Schol. ad Pind. Nem. ix. 123),\n        Prometheus, with a view to deceive Zeus and rival him in prudence, cut up a bull and divided it into two parts :\n        he wrapped up the best parts and the intestines in the skin, and at the top he placed the stomach, which is one\n        of the worst parts, while the second heap consisted of the bones covered with fat. When Zeus pointed out to him\n        how badly he had made the division, Prometheus desired him to choose, but Zeus, in his anger, and seeing through\n        the stratagem of Prometheus, chose the heap of bones covered with the fat. The father of the gods avenged\n        himself by withholding fire from mortals, but Prometheus stole it in a hollow tube (ferula,\n        narthêx, Aeschyl. Prom. 110). Zeus now, in order to punish men, caused Hephaestus to mould a\n        virgin, Pandora, of earth, whom Athena adorned with all the charms calculated to entice mortals; Prometheus\n        himself was put in chains, and fastened to a pillar, where an eagle sent by Zeus consumed in the daytime his\n        liver, which, in every succeeding night, was restored again. Prometheus was thus exposed to perpetual torture,\n        but Heracles killed the eagle and delivered the sufferer, with the consent of Zeus, who thus had an opportunity\n        of allowing his son to gain immortal fame (Hes. Theog. 521, &c., Op. et Dies, 47, &c.\n        ; Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 15; Apollod. ii. 5. § 11). Prometheus had cautioned his brother\n        Epimetheus against accepting any present from Zeus, but Epimetheus, disregarding the advice, accepted Pandora,\n        who was sent to him by Zeus, through the mediation of Hermes. Pandora then lifted the lid of the vessel in which\n        the foresight of Prometheus had concealed all the evils which might torment mortals in life. Diseases and\n        sufferings of every kind now issued forth, but deceitful hope alone remained behind (Hes. Op. et Dies,\n        83, &c.; comp. Horat. Carm. i. 3. 25, &c.). This is an outline of the legend about Prometheus,\n        as contained in the poems of Hesiod.\n\nAeschylus, in his trilogy Prometheus, added various new features to it, for, according to him,\n        Prometheus himself is an immortal god, the friend of the human race, the giver of fire, the inventor of the\n        useful arts, an omniscient seer, an heroic sufferer, who is overcome by the superior power of Zeus, but will not\n        bend his inflexible mind. Although he himself belonged to the Titans, he is nevertheless represented as having\n        assisted Zeus against the Titans (Prom. 218), and he is further said to have opened the head of Zeus\n        when the latter gave birth to Athena (Apollod. i. 3. § 6). But when Zeus succeeded to the kingdom of\n        heaven, and wanted to extirpate the whole race of man, the place of which he proposed to give to quite a new\n        race of beings, Prometheus prevented the execution of the scheme, and saved the human race from destruction\n        (Prom. 228, 233). He deprived them of their knowledge of the future, and gave them hope instead (248,\n        &c.). He further taught them the use of fire, made them acquainted with architecture, astronomy,\n        mathematics, the art of writing, the treatment of domestic animals, navigation, medicine, the art of prophecy,\n        working in metal, and all the other arts (252, 445, &c., 480, &c.). But, as in all these things he had\n        acted contrary to the will of Zeus, the latter ordered Hephaestus to chain him to a rock in Scythia, which was\n        done in the presence of Cratos and Bia, two ministers of Zeus. In Scythia he was visited by the Oceanides; Io\n        also came to him, and he foretold her the wanderings and sufferings which were yet in store for her, as well as\n        her final relief (703, &c.). Hermes then likewise appears, and desires him to make known a prophecy which\n        was of great importance to Zeus, for Prometheus knew that by a certain woman Zeus would beget a son, who was to\n        dethrone his father, and Zeus wanted to have a more accurate knowledge of this decree of fate. But Prometheus\n        steadfastly refused to reveal the decree of fate, whereupon Zeus, by a thunderbolt, sent Prometheus, together\n        with the rock to which he was chained, into Tartarus (Horat. Carm. ii. 18, 35). After the lapse of a\n        long time, Prometheus returned to the upper world, to endure a fresh course of suffering, for he was now\n        fastened to mount Caucasus, and tormented by an eagle, which every day, or every third day, devoured his liver,\n        which was restored again in the night (Apollon. Rhod. ii. 1247, &c. iii. 853; Strab. xv. p. 688 ; Philostr.\n        Vit. Apoll. ii. 3; Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 15; Aeschyl. Prom. 1015, &c.). This\n        state of suffering was to last until some other god, of his own accord, should take his place, and descend into\n        Tartarus for him (Prom. 1025). This came to pass when Cheiron, who had been incurably wounded by an\n        arrow of Heracles, desired to go into Hades; and Zeus allowed him to supply the place of Prometheus (Apollod.\n        ii. 5. § 4; comp. Cheiron). According to others, however, Zeus himself delivered Prometheus, when at length\n        the Titan was prevailed upon to reveal to Zeus the decree of fate, that, if he should become by Thetis the\n        either of a son, that son should deprive him of the sovereignty. (Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. vi. 42 ;\n        Apollod. iii. 13. § 5; Hygin. Fab. 54; comp. Aeschyl. Prom. 167, &c. 376.)\n\nThere was also an account, stating that Prometheus had created men out of earth and water, at the very\n        beginning of the human race, or after the flood of Deucalion, when Zeus is said to have ordered him and Athena\n        to make men out of the mud, and the winds to breathe life into them (Apollod. i. 7. § 1; Ov. Met.\n        i. 81; Etym. Mag. s. v. Promêtheus). Prometheus is said to have given to men something of all the\n        qualities possessed by the other animals (Horat Carm. i. 16. 13). The kind of earth out of which\n        Prometheus formed men was shown in later times near Panopeus in Phocis (Paus. x. 4. § 3), and it was at his\n        suggestion that Deucalion, when the flood approached, built a ship, and carried into it provisions, that he and\n        Pyrrha might be able to support themselves during the calamity (Apollod. i. 7. § 2). Prometheus, in the\n        legend, often appears in connection with Athena, e. g., he is said to have been punished on mount Caucasus for\n        the criminal love he entertained for her (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. ii. 1249) and he is further said,\n        with her assistance, to have ascended into heaven, and there secretly to have lighted his torch at the chariot\n        of Helios, in order to bring down the fire to man (Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. vi. 42). At Athens Prometheus\n        had a sanctuary in the Academy, from whence a torch-race took place in honour of him (Paus. i. 30. § 2;\n        Schol. ad Soph. Oed. Col. 55; Harpocrat. s. v. lampas).\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 507 ff (trans.

This arrow, they say, is one of the weapons of Hercules (Heracles), with\n        which he is said to have killed the eagle which ate the liver of Prometheus. It seems not unprofitable to speak\n        of Prometheus at greater length. When the men of old with great ceremony used to carry on the sacrificial rites\n        of the immortal gods, they would burn the victims entire in the flame of the sacrifice. And so, when the poor\n        were prevented from making sacrifices on account of the great expense, Prometheus, who with his wonderful wisdom\n        is thought to have made men, by his pleading is said to have obtained permission from Jove [Zeus] for them to\n        cast only a part of the victim into the fire, and to use the rest for their own food. This practice custom later\n        established. Since he had obtained this permission, not as from a covetous man, but easily, as from a god,\n        Prometheus himself sacrifices two bulls. When he had first placed their entrails on the altar, he put the\n        remaining flesh of the two bulls in one heap, covering it with an oxhide. Whatever bones there were he covered\n        with the other skin and put it down between them, offering Jove [Zeus] the choice of either part for himself.\n        Jupiter [Zeus], although he didn't act with divine forethought, nor as a god who ought to foresee everything,\n        was deceived by Prometheus--sinve we have started to believe the tale!--and thinking each part was a bull, shoe\n        the bones for his half. And so after this, in solemn rites and sacrifices, when the flesh of victims has been\n        consumed, they burn with fire the remaining parts which are the gods.\n        But, to come back to the subject, Jupiter [Zeus], when he realized what had been done, in anger took fire from\n        mortals, lest the favour of Prometheus should seem to have more weight than the power of the gods, and that\n        uncooked flesh should not be useful to men. Prometheus, however, who was accustomed to scheming, planned by his\n        own efforts to bring back the fire that had been taken from men. So, when the others were away, he approached\n        the fire of Jove, and with a small bit of this shut in a fennel-stalk he came joyfully, seeming to fly, not to\n        run, tossing the stalk so that the air shut in with its vapours should not put out the flame in so narrow a\n        space. Up to this time, then, men who bring good news usually come with speed. In the rivalry of the games they\n        also make it a practice for the runners to run, shaking torches after the manner of Prometheus.\n        In return for this deed, Jupiter, to confer a like favour on men, gave a woman to them, fashioned by Vulcanus\n        [Hephaistos (Hephaestus)], and endowed with all kinds of gifts by the will of the gods. For this reason she was\n        called Pandora. But Prometheus he bound with an iron chain to a mountain in Scythia named Caucasus for thirty\n        thousand years, as Aeschylus, writer of tragedies, says. Then, too, he sent an eagle to him to eat out his liver\n        which was constantly renewed at night. Some have said that this eagle was born from Typhon and Echidna, other\n        from Terra (Earth) [Gaia] and Tartarus, but many point out it was made by the hands of Vulcanus and given life\n        by Jove.\n        The following reason for the release of Prometheus has been handed down. When Jupiter [Zeus], moved by the\n        beauty of Thetis, sought her in marriage, he couldn't win the consent of the timid maiden, but none the less\n        kept planning to bring it about. At that time the Parcae [Moirai, Fates] were said to have prophesied what the\n        natural order of events should be. They said that the son of Thetis' husband, whoever he might be, would be more\n        famous than his father. Prometheus heard this as he kept watch, not from inclination but from necessity, and\n        reported it to Jove. He, fearing that what he had done to his father Saturnus in a similar situation, would\n        happened to him, namely, that he would be robbed of his power, gave up by necessity his desire to wed Thetis,\n        and out of gratitude to Prometheus thanked him and freed him from his chains. But he didn't go so far as to free\n        him from all binding, since he had sworn to that, but for commemoration bade him bind his finger with the two\n        things, namely, with stone and with iron. Following this practice men have rings fashioned of stone and iron,\n        that they may seem to be appeasing Prometheus. Some also have said that he wore a wreath, as if to claim that he\n        as victor had sinned without punishment. And so men began the practice of wearing wreaths at times of great\n        rejoicing and victory. You may observe this in sports and banquets.\n        But to come back to the beginning of the inquiry and the death of the eagle. Hercules, when sent by Eurystheus\n        for the apples of the Hesperides, out of ignorance of the way came to Prometheus, who was bound on Mount\n        Caucasus, as we have shown above. When victor, he returned to Prometheus to tell him that that Draco we have\n        mentioned was slain, and to thank him for his kindness since he had pointed out the way. Straightway he gave\n        what honour he could to the one that deserved it, for he killed the eagle and since it was slain, men began,\n        when victims were sacrificed, to offer livers on the altars of the gods to satisfy them in place of the liver of\n        Prometheus.\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound (extant play), Prometheus Unbound,\n            Prometheus Fire-Bringer, Prometheus Fire-Kindler (lost plays) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n          Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound was the second of a trilogy of plays describing the story of the Titan\n          Prometheus. Weir Smyth (L.C.L.) summarises evidence of the lost plays: \"The Medicean Catalogue of\n          Aeschylus' plays names three entitled Promêtheus (desmôtês, lyomenos,\n            purphoros); a fourth, Promêtheus purkaeus (Pollux, Vocabulary 9. 156, 10. 64)\n          was probably the satyric drama of the trilogy Phineus, Persai, Glaukos (pontios) produced in\n          472 B.C. From the Scholiast on Prom. 511 it is to be inferred that the Lyomenos followed the\n          Desmôtês. The theme and place of the Pyrphoros are still disputed: (1) it is\n          another name for the Pyrkaeus; (2) it preceded the Desmôtês in the trilogy and\n          dealt with the Titan's theft of fire--in this sense, it is the Fire-Bringer or Fire-Giver;\n          (3) as the Fire-Bearer, it followed the Lyomenos, and described the inauguration of the\n          Promêtheia, the Athenian festival at which torch-races were held in honour of the Titan, now\n          become the god of the potter-guild.

First of all, though they had eyes to see, they saw to no avail; they had ears, but they\n        did not understand ; but, just as shapes in dreams, throughout their length of days, without purpose they\n        wrought all things in confusion. They had neither knowledge of houses built of bricks and turned to face the sun\n        nor yet of work in wood; but dwelt beneath the ground like swarming ants, in sunless caves. They had no sign\n        either of winter or of flowery spring or of fruitful summer, on which they could depend but managed everything\n        without judgment, until I taught them to discern the risings of the stars and their settings, which are\n        difficult to distinguish.\n        Yes, and numbers, too, chiefest of sciences, I invented for them, and the combining of letters, creative mother\n        of the Mousai's (Muses') arts, with which to hold all things in memory. I, too, first brought brute beasts\n        beneath the yoke to be subject to the collar and the pack-saddle, so that they might bear in men's stead their\n        heaviest burdens; and to the chariot I harnessed horses and made them obedient to the rein, to be an image of\n        wealth and luxury. It was I and no one else who invented the mariner's flaxen-winged car that roams the sea.\n        Wretched that I am--such are the arts I devised for mankind, yet have myself no cunning means to rid me of my\n        present suffering . . . \n        Hear the rest and you shall wonder the more at the arts and resources I devised. This first and foremost : if\n        ever man fell ill, there was no defence--no healing food, no ointment, nor any drink--but for lack of medicine\n        they wasted away, until I showed them how to mix soothing remedies with which they now ward off all their\n        disorders. And I marked out many ways by which they might read the future, and among dreams I first discerned\n        which are destined to come true; and voices baffling interpretation I explained to them, and signs from chance\n        meetings. The flight of crook-taloned birds I distinguished clearly--which by nature are auspicious, which\n        sinister--their various modes of life, their mutual feuds and loves, and their consortings; and the smoothness\n        of their entrails, and what color the gall must have to please the gods, also the speckled symmetry of the\n        liver-lobe; and the thigh-bones, wrapped in fat, and the long chine I burned and initiated mankind into an\n        occult art. Also I cleared their vision to discern signs from flames,which were obscure before this. Enough\n        about these arts. Now as to the benefits to men that lay concealed beneath the earth--bronze, iron, silver, and\n        gold--who would claim to have discovered them before me? No one, I know full well, unless he likes to babble\n        idly. Hear the sum of the whole matter in the compass of one brief word--every art possessed by man comes from\n        Prometheus.\"\n\nAeschylus, Fragment 108 Prometheus Unbound (from Plutarch, On\n            Fortune 3. 98C) :\n        \"[Prometheus speaks of his gifts to mankind :] Giving to them stallions--horses and asses--and the race of\n        bulls to serve them as slaves and to relieve them of their toil.\"\n\nPlato, Philebus 16b (trans.

Lamb) :\n        \"Prometheus arrived to examine his distribution [of gifts to animals and men], and saw that whereas the\n        other creatures were fully and suitably provided, man was naked, unshod, unbedded, unarmed; and already the\n        destined day was come, whereon man like the rest should emerge from earth to light. Then Prometheus, in his\n        perplexity as to what preservation he could devise for man, stole from Hephaistos (Hephaestus) and Athena wisdom\n        in the arts together with fire--since by no means without fire could it be acquired or helpfully used by\n        any--and he handed it there and then as a gift to man. Now although man acquired in this way the wisdom of daily\n        life, civic wisdom he had not, since this was in the possession of Zeus; Prometheus could not make so free as to\n        enter the citadel which is the dwelling-place of Zeus, and moreover the guards of Zeus were terrible: but he\n        entered unobserved the building shared by Athena and Hephaistos for the pursuit of their arts, and stealing\n        Hephaistos's fiery art and all Athena's also he gave them to man, and hence it is that man gets facility for his\n        livelihood, but Prometheus, through Epimetheus' fault, later on (the story goes) stood his trial for theft.\n        And now that man was partaker of a divine portion [i.e. of the arts originally apportioned to gods alone], he,\n        in the first place, by his nearness of kin to deity, was the only creature that worshipped gods, and set himself\n        to establish altars and holy images; and secondly, he soon was enabled by his skill to articulate speech and\n        words, and to invent dwellings, clothes, sandals, beds, and the foods that are of the earth.\"\n        [For the first part of this extract from Plato see \"Prometheus & the Creation of Man\" (above).]\n\nPlato, The Statesman 269a - 274d (trans.

On all these accounts they were in\n        great straits; and that is the reason why the gifts of the gods that are told of in the old traditions were\n        given us with the needful information and instruction,--fire by Prometheus, the arts by Hephaistos (Hephaestus)\n        and the goddess [Athena] who is his fellow-artisan, seeds and plants by other deities [i.e. Demeter and\n        Dionysos].

It is said that Prometheus stole fire, and the story goes that Zeus was\n        angered and bestowed upon those who laid information of the theft a drug to ward off old age. So they took it,\n        as I am informed, and placed it upon an ass. The ass proceeded with the load on its back; and it was summer\n        time, and the ass came thirsting to a spring in its need for a drink. Now the snake which was guarding the\n        spring tried to prevent it and force it back, and the ass in torment gave it as the price of the loving-cup the\n        drug it happened to be carrying. And so there was an exchange of gifts: the ass got his drink and the snake\n        sloughed his old age, receiving in addition, so the story goes, the ass's thirst.\n        What then? Did I invent the legend? I will deny it, for before me it is celebrated by Sophokles, the tragic poet\n        [C5th B.C.], and Dinolokhos [C5th B.C.], the rival of Epikharmos (Epicharmus), and Ibykos of Rhegion (Ibycus of\n        Rhegium), and the comic poets Aristias and Apollophanes.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 144 (trans.

Prometheus, however, who was\n        accustomed to scheming, planned by his own efforts to bring back the fire that had been taken from men. So, when\n        the others were away, he approached the fire of Jove, and with a small bit of this shut in a fennel-stalk he\n        came joyfully, seeming to fly, not to run, tossing the stalk so that the air shut in with its vapours should not\n        put out the flame in so narrow a space. Up to this time, then, men who bring good news usually come with speed.\n        In the rivalry of the games they also make it a practice for the runners to run, shaking torches after the\n        manner of Prometheus.\n        In return for this deed, Jupiter, to confer a like favour on men, gave a woman to them, fashioned by Vulcanus\n        [Hephaistos (Hephaestus)], and endowed with all kinds of gifts by the will of the gods.

Before the rest he set flesh and inner\n        parts thick with fat upon the hide, covering them with an ox paunch; but for Zeus he put the white bones dressed\n        up with cunning art and covered with shining fat. Then the father of men and of gods said to him : ‘Son of\n        Iapetos (Iapetus), most glorious of all lords, good sir, how unfairly you have divided the portions!’\n        So said Zeus whose wisdom is everlasting, rebuking him. But wily Prometheus answered him, smiling softly and not\n        forgetting his cunning trick : ‘Zeus, most glorious and greatest of the eternal gods, take which ever of\n        these portions your heart within you bids.’\n        So he said, thinking trickery. But Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, saw and failed not to perceive the trick,\n        and in his heart he thought mischief against mortal men which also was to be fulfilled. With both hands he took\n        up the white fat and was angry at heart, and wrath came to his spirit when he saw the white ox-bones craftily\n        tricked out: and because of this the tribes of men upon earth burn white bones to the deathless gods upon\n        fragrant altars. But Zeus who drives the clouds was greatly vexed and said to him : ‘Son of Iapetos,\n        clever above all! So, sir, you have not yet forgotten your cunning arts!’\n        So spake Zeus in anger, whose wisdom is everlasting; and from that time he was always mindful of the trick, and\n        would not give the power of unwearying fire to the Melian race of mortal men who live on the earth. But the\n        noble son of Iapetos outwitted him and stole the far-seen gleam of unwearying fire in a hollow fennel stalk.

This practice custom later established. Since he\n        had obtained this permission, not as from a covetous man, but easily, as from a god, Prometheus himself\n        sacrifices two bulls. When he had first placed their entrails on the altar, he put the remaining flesh of the\n        two bulls in one heap, covering it with an oxhide.

Jupiter, although he\n        didn't act with divine forethought, nor as a god who ought to foresee everything, was deceived by\n        Prometheus--since we have started to believe the tale!--and thinking each part was a bull, shoe the bones for\n        his half. And so after this, in solemn rites and sacrifices, when the flesh of victims has been consumed, they\n        burn with fire the remaining parts which are the gods.

And so Thetis was given in marriage to Peleus, son of Aeacus, and Hercules was sent\n        to kill the eagle which was eating out Prometheus' heart.

This arrow, they say, is one of the weapons of Hercules, with which he is\n        said to have killed the eagle which ate the liver of Prometheus . . . Prometheus [for stealing fire] he [Zeus]\n        bound with an iron chain to a mountain in Scythia named Caucasus for thirty thousand years, as Aeschylus, writer\n        of tragedies, says. Then, too, he sent an eagle to him to eat out his liver which was constantly renewed at\n        night. Some have said that this eagle was born from Typhon and Echidna, other from Terra [Gaia the Earth] and\n        Tartarus, but many point out it was made by the hands of Vulcanus [Hephaistos] and given life by Jove\n        [Zeus].\n        The following reason for the release of Prometheus has been handed down. When Jupiter [Zeus], moved by the\n        beauty of Thetis, sought her in marriage, he couldn't win the consent of the timid maiden, but none the less\n        kept planning to bring it about. At that time the Parcae [Moirai, Fates] were said to have prophesied what the\n        natural order of events should be. They said that the son of Thetis' husband, whoever he might be, would be more\n        famous than his father. Prometheus heard this as he kept watch, not from inclination but from necessity, and\n        reported it to Jove. He, fearing that what he had done to his father Saturnus in a similar situation, would\n        happened to him, namely, that he would be robbed of his power, gave up by necessity his desire to wed Thetis,\n        and out of gratitude to Prometheus thanked him and freed him from his chains.\n        But he didn't go so far as to free him from all binding, since he had sworn to that, but for commemoration bade\n        him bind his finger with the two things, namely, with stone and with iron. Following this practice men have\n        rings fashioned of stone and iron, that they may seem to be appeasing Prometheus . . . \n        But to come back to the beginning of the inquiry and the death of the eagle. Hercules, when sent by Eurystheus\n        for the apples of the Hesperides, out of ignorance of the way came to Prometheus, who was bound on Mount\n        Caucasus, as we have shown above. When victor, he returned to Prometheus to tell him that that Draco we have\n        mentioned was slain, and to thank him for his kindness since he had pointed out the way. Straightway he gave\n        what honour he could to the one that deserved it, for he killed the eagle and since it was slain, men began,\n        when victims were sacrificed, to offer livers on the altars of the gods to satisfy them in place of the liver of\n        Prometheus.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 6 :\n        \"[Constellation the Kneeler :] Others say he is Prometheus, bound on Mount Caucasus.\"\n\nPropertius, Elegies 2. 1 (trans.

That is what I\n        have come to tell you; for you know my constant and habitual goodwill towards men.\n        Pisthetairos : Oh, yes! it's thanks to you that we roast our meat.\n        Prometheus : I hate the gods, as you know.\n        Pisthetairos : Aye, by Zeus, you have always detested them.\n        Prometheus : Towards them I am a veritable Timon; but I must return in all haste, so give me the umbrella; if\n        Zeus should see me from up there, he would think I was escorting one of the Kanephoroi (Canephori).\n        Pisthetairos : Wait, take this stool as well.\n        (Prometheus leaves.)\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 15 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Prometheus . . . planned by his own efforts to bring back the fire that had been taken from men. So, when\n        the others were away, he approached the fire of Jove [Zeus], and with a small bit of this shut in a fennel-stalk\n        he came joyfully . . . In the rivalry of the games they also make it a practice for the runners to run, shaking\n        torches after the manner of Prometheus.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astromomica 2. 15 : \n        \"Prometheus he bound with an iron chain to a mountain in Scythia named Caucasus . . . [but later] freed him\n        from his chains. But he didn't go so far as to free him from all binding, since he had sworn to that, but for\n        commemoration bade him bind his finger with the two things, namely, with stone and with iron. Following this\n        practice men have rings fashioned of stone and iron, that they may seem to be appeasing Prometheus. Some also\n        have said that he wore a wreath, as if to claim that he as victor had sinned without punishment. And so men\n        began the practice of wearing wreaths at times of great rejoicing and victory. You may observe this in sports\n        and banquets.\"\n\nHyginus, Astromomica 2. 15 : \n        \"[Herakles] killed the eagle [which fed on the liver of Prometheus] and since it was slain, men began, when\n        victims were sacrificed, to offer livers on the altars of the gods to satisfy them in place of the liver of\n        Prometheus.\"\n\nSee also the story of Prometheus and the division of the sacrificial feast (above) for the role attributed him\n        in the first sacrifice to the gods.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 30. 2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"In the Akademia [the Academy outside Athens] is an altar to Prometheus, and from it they run to the city\n        carrying burning torches. The contest is while running to keep the torch still alight; if the torch of the first\n        runner goes out, he has no longer any claim to victory, but the second runner has. If his torch also goes out,\n        then the third man is the victor. If all the torches go out, no one is left to be the winner.\"\n\nThe Argives possessed a tomb of Prometheus, where they honoured him as a dead hero.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 19. 8 :\n        \"As to the tomb of Prometheus, their account seems to me to be less probable than that of the Opountians\n        (Opuntians) [who also claimed a grave], but they hold to it nevertheless.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 10. 4. 4 :\n        \"At Panopeus [in Phokis] there is by the roadside a small building of unburnt brick, in which is an image\n        of Pentelic marble, said by some to be Asklepios (Asclepius), by others Prometheus. The latter produce evidence\n        of their contention. At the ravine there lie two stones, each of which is big enough to fill a cart. They have\n        the colour of clay, not earthly clay, but such as would be found in a ravine or sandy torrent, and they smell\n        very like the skin of a man. They say that these are remains of the clay out of which the whole race of man was\n        fashioned by Prometheus.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 19. 8 :\n        \"As to the tomb of Prometheus, their [the Argives] account seems to me to be less probable than that of the\n        Opountians (Opuntians) [who also claimed the grave], but they hold to it nevertheless.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
