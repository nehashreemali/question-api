  "content": "MNEMOSYNE was the Titan goddess of memory and remembrance and the inventress of language and words.\n\nAs a Titan daughter of Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven), Mnemosyne was also a goddess of time. She represented the rote\n        memorisation required to preserve the stories of history and the sagas of myth before the introduction of\n        writing. In this role she was the mother of the Mousai (Muses) who were originally patron goddesses of poets of\n        the oral tradition.\n\nFinally Mnemosyne was a minor oracular goddess like her sister-Titanesses. She presided over the underground\n        oracle of Trophonios (Trophonius) in Boiotia (Boeotia).\n\nThe Titanis (Titaness) Mnemosyne was sometimes named as one of three Elder Mousai\n          (Muses), who preceded the nine daughters of Zeus as goddesses of music.\n\n[1.1] OURANOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 132, Pindar Paean 7, Apollodorus 1.8, Diodorus Siculus 5.66.1)\n        [1.2] AITHER (or OURANOS) &\n        GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] THE MOUSAI (by Zeus) (Hesiod Theogony 53, Homeric Hymn IV, Orphic Hymn 76 & 77, Pindar Isthmian Ode 6,\n          Terpander Frag 4, Alcman Frag 8, Apollodorus 1.13, Antoninus Liberalis 9, Hyginus Preface, Cicero De Natura\n          Deorum 3.21)\n        [1.2] THE MOUSAI (by Zeus)\n        (Pindar Paean 7, Terpander Frag 4, Aristotle Frag 842, Plato Theaetetus 191c)\n\nMNEMO′SYNE (Mnêmosunê), i. e. memory, a daughter of Uranus, and one of the Titanides, became\n        by Zeus the mother of the Muses. (Hom. Hymn. in Merc. 429; Hes. Theog. 54, 915; Diod. v. 67;\n        Orph. Hymn. 76; Cic. De Nat. Deor. iii. 21.) Pausanias (i. 2. § 4) mentions a statue of\n        Mnemosyne at Athens; and near the oracle of Trophonius she had a sacred well and a throne. (Paus. ix. 39. §\n        4, &c.)\n\nMNEME (Mnêmê), i. e. memory, was one of the three Muses that were in early times worshipped at\n        Ascra in Boeotia. (Paus. ix. 29. § 2.) But there seems to have also been a tradition that Mneme was the\n        mother of the Muses, for Ovid (Met. v. 268) calls them Mnemonides; unless this be only an abridged form\n        for the daughters of Mnemosyne.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 132 ff (trans.

The males were Kronos (Cronus),\n        Hyperion, Koios (Coeus), Iapetos (Iapetus), Krios (Crius) and Okeanos (Oceanus), and their sisters were Rhea,\n        Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoibe (Phoebe) and Tethys. Each one of them was the discover of things of benefit to\n        mankind, and because of the benefaction they conferred upon all men they were accorded honours and everlasting\n        fame.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 9. 29. 1 (trans.
