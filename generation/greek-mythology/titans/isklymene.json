  "content": "KLYMENE (Clymene) was one of the elder Okeanides and the Titan goddess of fame and renown. She was the wife of\n        the Titan Iapetos and the mother of Prometheus and Atlas.\n\nKlymene was also named Asia and in this guise portrayed as the eponymous goddess of Anatolia (Asia Minor).\n\nIn ancient Greek vase painting she appears as a handmaiden of the goddess Hera. In the scene (right) she attends the Judgement of Paris and likely\n        personified the gift of fame the goddess offered the prince.\n\nAsia-Klymene was frequently confounded with Asia-Hesione, the wife of\n        Prometheus. The nymph Klymene who was loved by the sun-god Helios\n        seems to have been a distinct personage despite sharing the name and parentage of the wife of Iapetos.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS (Hesiod Theogony 507, Apollodorus 1.8, Nonnus Dionysiaca 38.108)\n\n[1.1] ATLAS, PROMETHEUS, EPIMETHEUS, MENOITIOS (by Iapetos) (Hesiod Theogony 508, Apollodorus\n          1.8)\n        [1.2] PROMETHEUS, EPIMETHEUS (Lycophron 1282 &\n          1411)\n        [1.3] PROMETHEUS, EPIMETHEUS (by Iapetos) (Hyginus Preface)\n\nCLY′MENE (Klumenê).

A daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, who became by Japetus the mother of Atlas, Prometheus,\n        and Epimetheus. (Hesiod. Theog. 359; Apollod. i. 2. § 2, &c.) According to some traditions the\n        continent of Asia derived its name from her. (Herod. iv. 45.) There are two other mythical personages of this\n        name. (Hygin. Fab.
