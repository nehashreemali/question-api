  "content": "EOSPHOROS (Eosphorus) and HESPEROS (Hesperus) were the gods of the star (aster planeta) Venus. They\n        were originally regarded as two distinct divinities--the first, whose name means \"Dawn-Bringer,\" was\n        the god of the dawn-star, while the second, \"Evening,\" was the star of dusk. The two star-gods were\n        later combined.\n\nIn ancient Greek vase-painting Eosphoros-Hesperos was as a youthful man either in the form of a bust surrounded\n        by the shining orb of his star or as a winged god holding a torch and crowned with a shining aureole.\n\n[1.1] ASTRAIOS & EOS (Hesiod Theogony 378, Apollodorus 1.8, Nonnus Dionysiaca 6.18 & 37.70)\n        [1.2] KEPHALOS & EOS (Hyginus Astronomica 2.42)\n\n[1.1] KEYX (Apollodorus 1.52, Hyginus Fabulae 60)\n        [1.2] KEYX, DAIDALION (Ovid Metamorphoses 11.270)\n        [2.1] HESPERIS (Diodorus Sicululs 4.26.2)\n        [2.2] THE HESPERIDES (Scholiast on Euripides\n          Hippolytus)\n        [3.1] LEUKONOE (Hyginus Fabulae 61)\n\nPHO′SPHORUS (Phôsphoros),or as the poets call him Heôsphoros or Phaesphoros (Lat.\n        Lucfer), that is, the bringer of light or of Eos, is the name of the planet Venus, when seen in the\n        morning before sunrise (Hom. Il. xxiii. 226; Virg. Gerg. i. 288; Ov. Met. ii. 115,\n        Trist. i. 3. 72.) The same planet was called Hesperus (Vesperugo, Vesper, Noctif or\n        Nocturnus) when it appeared in the heavens after sunset. (Hom. Il. xxii. 318 ; Plin. H.\n          N. ii. 8; Cic. De Nat. Deor. ii. 20; Catull. 62, 64; Horat. Carm. ii. 9. 10.)\n        Phosphorus as a personification is called a son of Astraeus and Eos (Hes. Theog. 381), of Cephalus and\n        Eos (Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 42), or of Atlas (Tzetz. ad Lyc. 879). By Philonis he is said to\n        have been the father of Ceyx (Hygin. Fab. 65; Ov. Met. xi. 271), and he is also called the\n        father of Daedalion (Ov. Met. xi. 295), of the Hesperides (Serv. ad Aen. iv. 484), or of\n        Hesperis, who became by his brother Atlas the mother of the Hesperides. (Diod. iv. 27; Serv. ad Aen. i.\n        530.) Phosphorus also occurs as a surname of several goddesses of light, as Artemis (Diana Lucifera,\n        Paus. iv. 31. § 8; Serv. ad Aen. ii. 116), Eos (Eurip. Ion. 1157) and Hecate. (Eurip.\n        Helen. 569.)\n\nHE′SPERUS (Hesperos), the evening-star, is called by Hesiod a son of Astraeus and Eos, and was regarded,\n        even by the ancients, as the same as the morning star, whence both Homer and Hesiod call him the bringer of\n        light, heôsphoros (Il. xxii. 317, xxiii. 226; comp. Plin. H. N. ii. 8; Mart. Capell.\n        viii. § 882, &c., ed. Kopp.) Diodorus (iii. 60) calls him a son of Atlas, who was fond of astronomy,\n        and once, after having ascended Mount Atlas to observe the stars, he disappeared. He was worshipped with divine\n        honours, and regarded as the fairest star in the heavens. (Eratosth. Catast. 24.) Hyginus (de Sign.\n          Coel. 2) says that some called him a son of Eos and Cephalus. The Romans designated him by the names\n        Lucifer and Hesperus, to characterise him as the morning or evening star.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nN.B. The Greeks also named the star itself Aster Aphrodition or Star of the goddess Aphrodite. The Romans\n        followed suit when they called it the Star of Venus, Venus being the Roman counterpart of Aphrodite.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 378 ff (trans.

The account runs like this : In the country known as\n        Hesperitis there were two brothers whose fame was known abroad, Hesperos (Hesperus) and Atlas. These brothers\n        possessed flocks of sheep which excelled in beauty and were in colour of a golden yellow, this being the reason\n        why the poets, in speaking of these sheep as mela, called them golden mela. Now Hesperos begat\n        a daughter named Hesperis, who he gave in marriage to his brother and after whom the land was given the name\n        Hesperitis; and Atlas begat by her seven daughters, who were named after their father Atlantides, and after\n        their mother Hesperides.\" [N.B.

Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) :\n        \"From the land of Aurora (the Dawn) [i.e. the far East] to Hesperus (the Evening Star) [the far West], and\n        where the sun, holding mid-heaven, gives to shapes no shadows.\"\n\nSeneca, Medea 874 ff :\n        \"Now, O Phoebus [Helios the Sun], speed thy chariot with no check of rein; let friendly darkness veil the\n        light and let Hesperus, vanguard of the night, plunge deep this fearful day.\"\n\nSeneca, Oedipus 739 ff :\n        \"[The Spartoi] measured their life by a single day; born after the passing of Lucifer (the Morning Star)\n        [Eosphoros], they perished ere Hesperus (the Evening Star) arose.\"\n\nSeneca, Phaedra 749 ff :\n        \"Such as he is the messenger of night, who brings the first shadows back, Hesperus (the Evening Star),\n        fresh bathed in ocean; and when the shadows have been driven away again, Luciferus (the Morning Star)\n        [Eosphoros] also.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 6. 237 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Now nine times had Lucifer [(the Morning Star) [Eosphoros] chased the dewy Astra (Stars) from heaven, and\n        as often changed his steed and nightly heralded the lunar fires [i.e. when he becomes Hesperos the Evening\n        Star]--yet he deceived not the conscious Astra (Stars), but is found the same in his alternate risings.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 6. 580 ff :\n        \"When the star-light glitters on a tranquil sea, and the spangled heaven is mirrored tremulous in the deep.\n        Brilliant is every star, but more brilliant than the rest does Hesperus shoot his beams, and brightly as he\n        flames in the high heavens, so bright is his reflection in the dark-blue waves.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 8. 159 ff :\n        \"Dark Vesper (the Evening Star) [Hesperos] is already leading forth the horses of the moon.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 7. 280 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"[Zeus] resolved to mount Semele's nightly couch, and turned his eye to the west, to see when sweet\n        Hesperos (Evening) would come : ‘. . . I will make rising Hesperos, instead of setting Hesperos, the\n        regular usher of the loves. Come now [Helios the sun], draw your own forerunner Phosphoros (Light-Bringer) to\n        his setting . . . give light to my desire with the star of the Kyprian [Eosphoros], make long the sweet darkness\n        for the wooing of Zeus.’\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 12. 3 ff :\n        \"These [the Horai, Seasons] by the brows of western Okeanos (Oceanus) took ship for the mansion of Helios\n        (the Sun) their father. As they approached, Hesperos the Evening Star leapt up and went out of the hall to meet\n        them. Selene (the Moon) herself also darted out newrisen, showing her light as she drove her cattle.\n        The Sisters at the sight of the lifegiving Charioteer [Helios the Sun] stayed their fruitful step. He had just\n        finished his course and come down from the sky. Bright Phosphoros was ready for the fire-eyed driver, near his\n        chariot and four. He put away the hot yokestraps and starry whip, and washed in the neighbouring Okeanos stream\n        the bodies of the firefed horses wet with sweat. The colts shook the dripping manes on their necks, and stamped\n        with sparkling hooves the shining mangertrough.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionsyiaca 26. 144 ff :\n        \"Hesperos shines amid the stars and brightens the sky, Hesperos, harbringer of the murky gloom which\n        follows when light fails.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 6. 18 ff :\n        \"She [Demeter] hastened with quick foot to the house of Astraios (Astraeus) . . . Eosphoros saw her and\n        brought the news . . . Hesperos led Deo to a chair beside his father's seat . . . Eosphoros plaited garlands of\n        flowers in posies yet proud with the morning dew; Hesperos held aloft the torch which is ownt to give light in\n        the night, and spun about with dancing leg while he tossed high his curving foot--for he is the escort of the\n        Erotes (Loves), well practised in the skipping tracery of the bridal dance.\"\n\nEosphoros-Hesperos, the planet Venus, was the star of the goddesses Aphrodite and Hera and as such was\n        sometimes numbered amongst the Theoi Gamelioi (Gods of Marriage). Seneca includes him in a marriage hymn.\n\nSeneca, Medea 56 ff (trans. Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[A wedding hymn, or epithalamium :] May the high gods who rule over heaven, and thy who rule the\n        sea, with gracious divinity attend on our princes' marriage, amid the people's solemn applause. First to the\n        sceptre-bearing Thunderers [Zeus] let the bull with white-shining hide offer his high-raised neck. Lucina [Hera]\n        let a heifer appease, snow-white, untouched by the yoke; and let her [Aphrodite] . . . be given a tender victim.\n        And do thou [Hymenaeus] . . . hither come . . .
