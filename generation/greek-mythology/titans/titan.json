  "content": "TITAN was the younger Titan-god of the calendar of the seasons. He was a brother of the sun-god Helios.\n\nTitan was probably identified with Helios, who is often simply named Titan, or\n        perhaps Atlas, who was sometimes credited with the invention of the astral\n        calendar.\n\nPresumably HYPERION (he was a brother of Helios) (Pausanias 2.11.5)\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 11. 5 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Having crossed the Asopos River again [near Titane in Sikyonia] and reached the summit of the hill, you\n        come to the place where the natives say that Titan first dwelt. They add that he was the brother of Helios (the\n        Sun), and that after him the place got the name Titane. My own view is that he proved clever at observing the\n        seasons of the year and times when the sun increases and ripens seeds and fruits, and for this reason was held\n        to be the brother of Helios (the Sun).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
