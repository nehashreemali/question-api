Rackham) (Roman encyclopedia C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Rising from the sea at the middle of the coast [of the Atlantic coast of Aithiopia (Africa)] is a mountain\n        of great height which glows with eternal fires--its Greek name is the Chariot of the Gods; and four days' voyage\n        from it is the cape called the Horn of the West, on the confine of Africa, adjacent to the Western Aethiopes\n        [black Africans]. Some authorities also report hills of moderate height in this region, clad with agreeable\n        shady thickets and belonging to Aegipanes and Satyri (Satyrs).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
