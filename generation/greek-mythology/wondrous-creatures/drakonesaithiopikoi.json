Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The land of Aithiopia (Ethiopia)--the place where the gods bathe, celebrated by Homer under the name of\n        Okeanos (Oceanus), is an excellent and desirable neighbour--this land, I say, is the mother of the very largest\n        Drakones (Dragon-Serpents). For, you must know, they attain to a length of one hundred and eighty feet, and they\n        are not called by the name of any species, but people say that they kill elephants, and these Drakones rival the\n        longest-lived animals. Thus far the accounts from Aithiopia.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
