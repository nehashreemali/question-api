  "content": "THE SATYROS LEMNIOS (Lemnian Satyr) was a creature reputed to have consorted with a certain Lemnian woman--the\n        mother of an aquaintance of the Greek writer Philostratos.\n\nPhilostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana 4. 27 (trans. Conybeare) (Greek biography\n          C1st to C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"But we must not disbelieve that Satyroi (Satyrs) both exist and are susceptible to the passion of love;\n        for I [the author Philostratos] knew a youth of my own age in Lemnos whose mother was said to be visited by a\n        Satyros, as he well might to judge by this story; for he was represented as wearing on his back a fawn-skin that\n        exactly fitted him, the front paws of which were drawn around his neck and fastened over his chest. But I must\n        not go further into this subject; but, anyhow, credit is due as much to experience of facts as it is to\n        myself.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
