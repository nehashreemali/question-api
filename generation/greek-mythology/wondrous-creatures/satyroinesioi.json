  "content": "THE SATYROS SATYRIDES was a breed of red-haired, satyr-like monkey or wild-man native to a remote group of\n        African islands. Once when a ship made landfall there, the creatures seized one of the womenfolk and violated\n        her in atrocious ways.\n\nThe Satyrs of the Satyrides were similar to the Libyan Satyrs of the Atlas\n        mountains--both were probably derived from traveller's tales of monkeys and apes.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 23. 6 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Wishing to know better than most people who the Satyroi (Satyrs) are I have inquired from many about this\n        very point. Euphemos the Karian (Carian) said that on a voyage to Italia (Italy) he was driven out of his course\n        by winds and was carried into the outer sea, beyond the course of seamen. He affirmed that there were many\n        uninhabited islands, while in others lived wild men. The sailors did not wish to put in at the latter, because,\n        having put in before, they had some experience of the inhabitants, but on this occasion they had no choice in\n        the matter. The islands were called Satyrides by the sailors, and the inhabitants were red haired, and had upon\n        their flanks tails not much smaller than those of horses. As soon as they caught sight of their visitors, they\n        ran down to the ship without uttering a cry and assaulted the women in the ship. At last the sailors in fear\n        cast a foreign woman on to the island. Her the Satyroi outraged not only in the usual way, but also in a most\n        shocking manner.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
