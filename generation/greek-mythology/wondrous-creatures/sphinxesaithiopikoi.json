In a similar\n        fashion the Onokentauros was likely a bastardised description of the chimpanzee.\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 8. 72 (trans. Rackham) (Roman encyclopedia C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Aethiopia (Ethiopia) produces Lynxes in great numbers, and Sphinxes with brown hair and a pair of udders\n        on the breast, and many other monstrosities.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
