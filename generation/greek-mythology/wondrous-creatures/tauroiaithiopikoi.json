Its thick, red hide was impervious to weapons.\n\nThe bull was probably derived from ancient travellers' accounts of the African buffalo.\n\nAelian, On Animals 17. 45 (trans. Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"It seems that those Aithiopian (Ethiopian) Bulls which they call ‘flesh-eaters’ are the most\n        savage of animals. They are twice the size of Bulls in Greece, and their speed is very great. Their hair is red,\n        their eyes blue-grey, more so than the eyes of lions. In normal times they move their horns as they do their\n        ears, but when fighting they raise them, making them stand strongly up, and so do battle; and once raised in\n        passion owing to some truly wonderful natural cause their horns do not go aslant. No spear, no arrow can wound\n        them: iron, you see, does not penetrate their hide, for the Bull raises its bristles and throws off the weapons\n        showered upon it in vain. And it attacks herds of horses and also wild animals. Accordingly herdsmen who wish to\n        protect their flocks dig deep concealed ditches and by these means ambush the Bulls. And when they fall into\n        these ditches they are choked with rage. Among the Troglodytoi (Troglodytes, Cave-Dwellers) this is judged to be\n        the king of beasts, and rightly so, for it possesses the courage of a lion, the speed of a horse, the strength\n        of a bull, and is stronger than iron.\"\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 8. 74 (trans. Rackham) (Roman encyclopedia C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Aethiopia (Ethiopia) produces . . . many monstrosities : . . . But its fiercest animals are the Forest\n        Bulls (Tauri Silvestres), larger than the bulls of the field, surpassing all in speed, of a tawny\n        colour, with blue eyes, hair turned backward, mouth gaping open to the ears, along with mobile horns; the hide\n        has the hardness of flint, rejecting every wound. They hunt all wild animals, but themselves can only be caught\n        in pits, and when caught always die game.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
