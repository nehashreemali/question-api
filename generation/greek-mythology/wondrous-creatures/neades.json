  "content": "THE NEADES were gigantic animals whose roar could split the earth. They were believed to have inhabited the\n        island of Samos in primeval times.\n\nThe legend perhaps arose from dinosaur fossils found on the island.\n\nAelian, On Animals 17. 28 (trans. Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Euphorion says in his Commentaries [C3rd B.C.] that in primeval times Samos was uninhabited, for\n        there appeared in the island animals of gigantic size, which were savage and dangerous to man to approach, and\n        they were called Neades. Now these animals with their mere roar split the ground. So there is a proverbial\n        saying current in Samos, ‘He roars louder than the Neades.’ And the same writer asserts that huge\n        bones are displayed even to this day.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
