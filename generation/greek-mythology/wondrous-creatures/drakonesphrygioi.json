During the day they stood on the tips of their tails attracting birds with their magical\n        breath and at night they ambushed shepherds returning from the hills with their flocks.\n\nAelian, On Animals 2. 21 (trans. Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"But according to accounts from Phrygia there are Drakones (Dragon-Serpents) in Phrygia too, and these grow\n        to a length of sixty feet [i.e. about 18 metres], and every day in mid-summer creep out of their lairs. And on\n        the banks of the river Rhyndakos (Rhyndacus) while supporting part of their coils on the ground, they raise the\n        rest of their body and, steadily and silently extending their neck, open their mouth and attract birds by their\n        breath, as it were by a spell. And the birds descend, feathers and all, into their stomach, drawn in by the\n        Drakones' breathing. And these singular practices they continue until sundown; next, the Drakones hide and lie\n        in wait for the flocks, and as they return to the sheepfolds from the pasture they fall upon them, and after a\n        terrible slaughter they have frequently killed the herdsmen as well, thus obtaining a generous and abundant\n        feast.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
