  "content": "NYX was the goddess of the night, one of the primordial gods (protogenoi) who emerged as the dawn of\n        creation.\n\nShe was a child of Khaos (Chaos, Air), and coupling with Erebos (Darkness) she produced Aither (Aether, Light)\n        and Hemera (Day). Alone she spawned a brood of dark spirits including the three Fates, Sleep, Death, Strife and\n        Pain.\n\nNyx was an ancient deity usually envisaged as the very substance of the night--a veil of dark mists drawn\n        across the sky to obscure the light of Aither, the shining blue of the heavens. Her opposite number was Hemera\n        (Day) who scattered the mists of night at dawn.\n\nIn ancient art Nyx was depicted as a either a winged goddess or charioteer, sometimes crowned with an aureole\n        of dark mists.\n\n[1.1] KHAOS (Hesiod Theogony 123, Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          31.115)\n        [2.1] PHANES (Orphic Argonautica 12, Orphic Fragment\n          101)\n\n[1.1] AITHER, HEMERA (by Erebos)\n        (Hesiod Theogony 124, Cicero De Natura Deum 3.17)\n        [1.2] HEMERA (by Khronos) (Bacchylides Frag 7)\n        [1.3] EROS, AITHER (Aristophanes\n          Birds 685 & 1190)\n        [1.4] EROS (by Erebos) (Hyginus\n          Preface)\n        [1.5] AITHER, HEMERA, EROS (by Erebos) (Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n        [1.6] EOS-HEMERA (Quintus Smyrnaeus 2.549)\n        [2.1] OURANOS (Orphic Argonautica 12, Orphic Frag Deveni\n          Papyrus)\n        [3.1] THE ASTRA (Orphic Hymn 7)\n\n[1.1] MOROS, KER, THANATOS, HYPNOS, THE ONEIROI, MOMOS, OIZYS, HESPERIDES, THE KERES, THE MOIRAI, NEMESIS, APATE, PHILOTES, GERAS, ERIS (no father) (Hesiod Theogony 221)\n        [1.2] ERIS (Hesiod Works & Days 17)\n        [1.3] HYPNOS, THANATOS (Homer Iliad 14.231, Seneca Hercules Fur. 1068)\n        [1.4] THE NEMESES (Pausanias 7.5.3)\n        [1.5] MOROS (FATUM), GERAS (SENECTUS), THANATOS (MORS), KER (LETUM), SOPHROSYNE (CONTINENTIA), HYPNOS\n          (SOMNUS), ONEIROI (SOMNIA), EROS (AMOR), EPIPHRON, PORPHYRION, EPAPHOS, ERIS\n          (DISCORDIA), OIZYS (MISERIA), HYBRIS\n          (PETULANTIA), NEMESIS, EUPHROSYNE, PHILOTES\n          (AMICITIA), ELEOS (MISERICORDIA), STYX, MOIRAI (PARCAE), HESPERIDES (by Erebos) (Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.6] EROS (AMOR), DOLOS (DOLUS), DEIMOS (METUS), PONOS (LABOR), NEMESIS (INVIDENTIA), MOROS (FATUM), GERAS (SENECTUS), THANATOS (MORS), KERES (TENEBRAE), OIZYS (MISERIA), MOMOS (QUERELLA), PHILOTES (GRATIA), APATE (FRAUS),\n        ?

Homer (Il. xiv. 259, &c.) calls her the subduer of gods and\n        men, and relates that Zeus himself stood in awe of her. In the ancient cosmogonies Night is one of the very\n        first created beings, for she is described as the daughter of Chaos, and the sister of Erebus, by whom she\n        became the mother of Aether and Hemera. (Hes. Theog. 123, &c.) According to the Orphics\n        (Argon. 14) she was the daughter of Eros. She is further said, without any husband, to have given birth\n        to Moros, the Keres, Thanatos, Hypnos, Dreams, Momus, Oizys, the Hesperides, Moerae, Nemesis, and similar\n        beings. (Hes. Theog. 211, &c.; Cic. de Nat. Deor. iii. 17.) In later poets, with whom she\n        is merely the personification of the darkness of night, she is sometimes described as a winged goddess (Eurip.\n        Orest. 176), and sometimes as riding in a chariot, covered with a dark garment and accompanied by the\n        stars in her course. (Eurip. Ion, 1150; Theocrit. ii. in fin.; Orph. Hymn. 2. 7; Virg.\n        Aen. v. 721; Tibull. ii. 1. 87; Val. Flacc. iii. 211.) Her residence was in the darkness of Hades.\n        (Hes. Theog. 748; Eurip. Orest. 175; Virg. Aen. vi. 390.) A statue of Night, the work\n        of Rhoecus, existed at Ephesus (Paus. x. 38. § 3). On the chest of Cypselus she was represented carrying in\n        her arms the gods of Sleep and Death, as two boys (v. 18. § 1).\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 115 ff (trans.
