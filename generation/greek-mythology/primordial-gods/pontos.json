  "content": "PONTOS (Pontus) was the primordial god (protogenos) of the sea. He was the sea itself, not merely its\n        resident deity, who was born from earth at the dawn of creation.\n\nPontos and Gaia (Gaea, the Earth) were parents of the ancient deities known as the Old Men of the Sea. By Thalassa, his watery female counterpart, he was the father of fish and other sea\n        creatures. Poseidon, king of the sea, wed Pontos' eldest granddaughter\n        Amphitrite.\n\nIn Greco-Roman mosaics Pontos is depicted as a giant head with a watery-gray beard and crab-claw horns rising\n        from the sea. However, in most mosaic art, Okeanos (Oceanus) supercedes\n        him as the sea personified.\n\n[1.1] GAIA (no father) (Hesiod Theogony 130)\n        [1.2] AITHER (or OURANOS) & GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] NEREUS, THAUMAS, PHORKYS, KETO, EURYBIA (by Gaia) (Hesiod\n          Theogony 233, Apollodorus 1.10)\n        [1.2] THAUMAS (by Gaia) (Hyginus Preface)\n        [2.1] AIGAIOS (by Gaia) (Eumelus Titanomachia 3)\n        [3.1] THE TELKHINES (by Gaia) (Bacchylides Frag 52)\n        [4.1] THE FISH (by Thalassa) (Hyginus Preface)\n\nPONTUS (Pontos), a personification of the sea, is described in the ancient cosmogony as a son of Gaea, and as\n        the father of Nereus, Thaumas, Phorcys, Ceto, and Eurybia, by his own mother. (Hes. Theog. 132, 233,\n        &c.; Apollod. i. 2. § 6.) Hyginus (Fab. praef. p. 3, ed. Staveren) calls him a son of Aether\n        and Gaea, and also assigns to him somewhat different descendants.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 106 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The holy race of the deathless gods who are for ever, those that were born of Gaia (Gaea, Earth) and\n        starry Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven) and gloomy Nyx (Night) and them that briny Pontos (Pontus, Sea) did rear.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 126 ff : \n        \"Verily at first Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [Air] came to be, but next wide-bosomed Gaia (Gaea, Earth) . . .\n        and dim Tartaros (the Pit) in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros (Love), fairest among the deathless\n        gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them. From\n        Khaos (Chaos) came forth Erebos (Darkness) and black Nyx (Night); but of Nyx (Night) were born Aither (Aether,\n        Light) and Hemera (Day), whom she conceived and bore from union in love with Erebos. And Gaia (Earth) first bore\n        starry Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven), equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure\n        abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she brought forth long Ourea (Mountains) . . . She bore also the\n        fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontos (Pontus, Sea), without sweet union of love.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 233 ff : \n        \"And Pontos (Pontus, Sea) begat Nereus, the eldest of his children, who is true and lies not : and men call\n        him the Old Man because he is trusty and gentle and does not forget the laws of righteousness, but thinks just\n        and kindly thoughts. And yet again he got great Thaumas and proud Phorkys (Phorcys), being mated with Gaia\n        (Gaea, Earth), and fair-cheeked Keto (Ceto) and Eurybia who has a heart of flint within her.\"\n\nEumelus of Corinth or Arctinus of Miletus, Titanomachia Fragment 3 (from\n          Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. i. 1165) (trans.
