She\n        was followed in quick succession by Gaia (Gaea, Earth), Tartaros (the Pit Below) and Eros (Procreation).\n\nKhaos was the lower atmosphere which surrounds the earth--both the invisible air and the gloom of fog and\n        mist. The word khaos means \"gap\" or \"chasm\" being the space between heaven and\n        earth. Khaos was the mother and grandmother of the other misty essences--Erebos (the mists of netherworld\n        darkness), Aither (the ethereal mists of heaven), Nyx (the night) and Hemera (the day), as well as the numerous\n        emotion-driving Daimones (Spirits) which haunted it. She was also a goddess of fate like her daughter Nyx and\n        grand-daughters the Moirai (Moirae).\n\nAs the goddess of the air Khaos was also the mother of birds, just as Gaia (the Earth) was the mother of land\n        animals, and Thalassa (the Sea) was the mother of fish.\n\nLate classical authors redefined Khaos as the chaotic mix of elements which existed in the primordial\n        universe, conflating it with the primal \"Mud\" of the Orphic cosmogony. The modern English word\n        \"chaos\" derives from this.\n\n[1.1] NONE (the first being to emerge at creation) (Hesiod Theogony 116)\n        [2.1] KHRONOS & ANANKE (Orphic Argonautica 12, Orphic Fragment 54)\n        [2.2] KHRONOS (Orphic Rhapsodies 66)\n\n[1.1] EREBOS, NYX (without a mate) (Hesiod Theogony 124)\n        [1.2] EREBOS, NYX, AITHER, HEMERA (Hyginus Preface)\n        [2.1] THE MOIRAI (Quintus Smyrnaeus\n          3.755)\n        [3.1] EROS (Oppian Halieutica 4.10)\n        [4.1] THE BIRDS (by Eros) (Aristophanes Birds 685)\n\nN.B. According to Hesiod's Theogony Gaia, Tartaros and Eros came into being after Khaos. This passage is\n        sometimes misread, making them her offspring.\n\nCHAOS (Chaos), the vacant and infinite space which existed according to the ancient cosmogonies previous to the\n        creation of the world (Hes. Theog. 116), and out of which the gods, men, and all things arose. A\n        different definition of Chaos is given by Ovid (Met. i. 1, &c.), who describes it as the confused\n        mass containing the elements of all things that were formed out of it. According to Hesiod, Chaos was the mother\n        of Erebos and Nyx. Some of the later poets use the word Chaos in the general sense of the airy realms, of\n        darkness, or the lower world.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 116 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or 7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Verily at the first Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [Air] came to be, but next wide-bosomed Gaia (Gaea, Earth),\n        the ever-sure foundations of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympos . . .\n        From Khaos (Chaos) came forth Erebos (Darkness) and black Nyx (Night).\"\n\nAlcman, Fragment 1 (from Scholiast on Aristophanes the Birds 14) (trans. Campbell,\n          Vol. Greek Lyric II) (C7th B.C.) :\n        \"He [Alcman] has identified Poros (the Contriver) with the god called Khaos (Chaos) by Hesiod.\"\n\nAlcman, Fragment 1 :\n        \"Aisa (Aesa, Fate) and Poros (the Contriver) [Poros is Khaos (Chaos), see quote above], those ancient ones,\n        conquered them all [i.e. they were killed in battle].\"\n\nCallimachus, Aetia Fragment 2 (trans. Trypanis) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"When the bevy of Mousai (Muses) met the shepherd Hesiod . . . they told him of the birth of Khaos\n        (Chaos).\"\n\nAristophanes, Birds 685 ff (trans. O'Neill) (Greek comedy C5th to 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"At the beginning there was only Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [Air], Nyx (Night), dark Erebos (Darkness), and\n        deep Tartaros (the Pit). Ge (Gaea, Earth), Aer (Air) [Aither] and Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven) had no existence.\n        Firstly, black-winged Nyx (Night) laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebos (Darkness),\n        and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros (Desire) with his glittering golden\n        wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated [or fertilised] in deep Tartaros (the Pit) with dark\n        Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [Air], winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race [the birds], which was the\n        first to see the light.\"\n\nOrphic Rhapsodies 66 (fragments) (trans. West) (Greek hymns C3rd - C2nd B.C.) :\n        \n        \"This Khronos (Chronos, Unaging Time), of immortal resource, begot Aither (Aether, Light) [upper air] and\n        great Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [lower air], vast this way and that, no limit below it, no base, no place to\n        settle. Then great Khronos fashioned from (or in) divine Aither (Aether) a bright white egg [from which Phanes\n        was born].\"\n\nOrphic Fragment 54 (from Damascius) : \n        \"United with it [Khronos (Chronos), Time] was Ananke (Inevitability), being of the same nature, or\n        Adrastea, incorporeal . . . this is the great Khronos (Unaging Time) that we found in it [the\n        Rhapsodies], the father of Aither (Aether) [upper air] and Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [lower air].\n        Indeed, in this theology too [the Hieronyman Rhapsodies], this Khronos (Time), the serpent has\n        offspring, three in number : moist Aither (Light)--I quote--, unbounded Khaos (Chaos) [Air], and as a third,\n        misty Erebos (Darkness) . . . Among these, he says, Khronos (Time) generated an egg [containing the mix of solid\n        matter--earth, sea and sky].\"\n\nOrphica, Epicuras Fragment (from Epiphanius) : \n        \"And he [Epicurus] says that the world began in the likeness of an egg, and the Wind [the entwined forms of\n        Khronos (Chronos, Time) and Ananke (Inevitability)] encircling the egg serpent-fashion like a wreath or a belt\n        then began to constrict nature. As it tried to squeeze all the matter with greater force, it divided the world\n        into the two hemispheres, and after that the atoms sorted themselves out, the lighter and finer ones in the\n        universe floating above and becoming the Bright Air [Aither (Aether)] and the most rarefied Wind [probably Khaos\n        (Chaos, Air)], while the heaviest and dirtiest have veered down, become the Earth (Ge) [Gaia], both the dry land\n        and the fluid waters [Pontos the Sea].\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 3. 755 (trans. Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Moirai (Moirae, Fates), daughters of holy Khaeos (Chaos).\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"From Caligine (Mist) [was born] Chaos; from Chaos [was born]: Nox (Night) [Nyx], Dies (Day) [Hemera],\n        Erebus, Aether.\"\n\nVirgil, Georgics 4. 345 ff (trans.

Its heavenly counterpart was the shining aither, and\n        beneath and around the edges of earth lay the dark mists of erebos.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 699 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or 7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[The War of the Titanes (Titans) :] [Zeus] came forthwith, hurling his lightning . . . flame unspeakable\n        rose to the bright upper air: the flashing glare of the thunder--stone and lightning blinded their eyes for all\n        that there were strong. Astounding heat seized Khaos (the Chasm) [the Air] : and to see with eyes and to hear\n        the sound with ears it seemed even as if Gaia (Gaea, Earth) and wide Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven) above came\n        together.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 813 :\n        \"And beyond, away from all the gods, live the Titanes (Titans), beyond gloomy Khaos (Chaos) [Air].\"\n\nIbycus, Fragment S223B (from Scholast on Aristophanes, Birds) (trans.

Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Ere land and sea and the all-covering sky were made, in the whole world the countenance of nature was the\n        same, all one, well named Chaos, a raw and undivided mass, naught but a lifeless bulk, with warring seeds of\n        ill-joined elements compressed together. No Titan [Helios the Sun] as yet poured light upon the world, no waxing\n        Phoebe [Selene the Moon] her crescent filled anew, nor in the ambient air yet hung the earth, self-balanced,\n        equipoised, nor Amphitrite's [the Sea's] arms embraced the long far margin of the land. Though there were land\n        and sea and air, the land no foot could tread, no creature swim the sea, the air was lightless; nothing kept its\n        form, all objects were at odds, since in one mass cold essence fought with hot, and moist with dry, and hard\n        with soft and light with things of weight. This strife a God (Deus) [perhaps Khronos (Chronos) or the\n        primordial Eros], with nature's blessing, solved; who severed land from sky and sea from land, and from the\n        denser vapours set apart the ethereal sky; and, each from the blind heap resolved and freed, he fastened in its\n        place appropriate in peace and harmony. The fiery weightless force of heaven's vault flashed up and claimed the\n        topmost citadel; next came the air in lightness and in place; the thicker earth with grosser elements sank\n        burdened by its weight; lowest and last the girdling waters pent the solid globe. So into shape whatever god it\n        was reduced the primal matter and prescribed its several parts. Then first, to make the earth even on every\n        side, he rounded it into a mighty disc, then bade the sea extend and rise under the rushing winds, and gird the\n        shores of the encircled earth.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
