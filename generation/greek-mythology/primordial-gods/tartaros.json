  "content": "TARTAROS (Tartarus) was the primordial god (protogenos) of the stormy pit of Tartaros that lies beneath the\n        foundations of the earth. He was the body of the pit itself rather than an athropomorphic deity.\n\nTartaros was envisaged as the opposite of the sky, an inverted-dome lying beneath the flat earth. Together the\n        Ouranion-dome and Tartarean-pit enclosed the entire cosmos in an egg-shaped or spherical shell.\n\nFor cosmographical descriptions of the Tartarean pit\n        see the Pit of Tartaros.\n\n[1.1] NONE (one of the first to emerge at creation) (Hesiod Theogony 116)\n        [2.1] AITHER (or OURANOS) & GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] TYPHOEUS (by Gaia) (Hesiod Theogony 820)\n        [1.2] TYPHON, EKHIDNA (by Gaia) (Apollodorus 1.39 & 2.4)\n        [1.3] TYPHON, THE GIGANTES (by Gaia) (Hyginus Preface)\n        [2.1] THE TELKHINES (by Nemesis)\n        (Bacchylides Frag 52)\n\nTA′RTARUS (Tartaros), a son of Aether and Ge, and by his mother Ge the father of the Gigantes, Typhoeus\n        and Echidna. (Hygin. Praef. p. 3, &c., Fab. 152 ; Hes. Theog. 821 ; Apollod. ii.\n        1. § 2.) In the Iliad Tartarus is a place far below the earth, as far below Hades as Heaven is above the\n        earth, and closed by iron gates. (Hom. Il. viii. 13 &c., 481; comp. Hes. Theog. 807.)\n        Later poets describe Tartarus as the place in the lower world in which the spirits of wicked men are punished\n        for their crimes, and sometimes they use the name as synonymous with Hades or the lower world in general; and\n        pater Tartarus is used for Pluto. (Val. Flacc. iv. 258.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 116 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Verily at first Khaos (the Chasm) [Air] came to be, but next wide-bosomed Gaia (Gaea, Earth), the\n        ever-sure foundation of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympos, and dim Tartaros (Tartarus,\n        the Pit) in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros (Love).\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 820 ff : \n        \"But when Zeus had driven the Titanes (Titans) from heaven, huge Gaia (Gaea, Earth) bare her youngest child\n        Typhoeus of the love of Tartaros (Tartarus), by the aid of golden Aphrodite.\"\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 52 (from Tzetzes on Hesiod's Theogony) (trans.
