  "content": "EREBOS (Erebus) was the primordial god (protogenos) of darkness and the consort of Nyx (Night). His\n        dark mists encircled the world and filled the deep hollows of the earth. In the evening, Erebos' wife Nyx drew\n        Erebos' darkness across the sky bringing night and his daughter Hemera scattered it at dawn bringing day--the\n        first obscuring Aither (Aether), the heavenly light of the ether, the second revealing it. In the ancient\n        cosmogonies the heavenly ether (aither) and the dark mists of the netherworld (erebos) were\n        regarded as the sources of day and light rather than the sun.\n\nThe name Erebos was also used as a synonym for the netherworld realm of Haides.\n\n[1.1] KHAOS (no father) (Hesiod Theogony 123, Hyginus\n          Preface)\n        [2.1] KHRONOS & ANANKE (Orphic Fragment 54)\n\n[1.1] AITHER, HEMERA (by Nyx) (Hesiod Theogony 124, Cicero De Natura Deum 3.17)\n        [1.2] AITHER (Aristophanes Birds 1189)\n        [1.3] EROS (by Nyx) (Hyginus\n          Preface)\n        [1.4] AITHER, HEMERA, EROS (by Nyx) (Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n\n[1.1] MOROS (FATUM), GERAS (SENECTUS), THANATOS (MORS), KER (LETUM), SOPHROSYNE (CONTINENTIA), HYPNOS\n          (SOMNUS), ONEIROI (SOMNIA), EROS (AMOR), EPIPHRON, PORPHYRION, EPAPHOS, ERIS\n          (DISCORDIA), OIZYS (MISERIA), HYBRIS\n          (PETULANTIA), NEMESIS, EUPHROSYNE, PHILOTES\n          (AMICITIA), ELEOS (MISERICORDIA), STYX, MOIRAI (PARCAE), HESPERIDES (by Nyx) (Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.2] EROS (AMOR), DOLOS (DOLUS), DEIMOS (METUS), PONOS (LABOR), NEMESIS (INVIDENTIA), MOROS (FATUM), GERAS (SENECTUS), THANATOS (MORS), KERES (TENEBRAE), OIZYS (MISERIA), MOMOS (QUERELLA), PHILOTES (GRATIA), APATE (FRAUS),\n        ?

The name signifies darkness, and is therefore applied also to\n        the dark and gloomy space under the earth, through which the shades pass into Hades. (Hom.

Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Verily at first Khaos (Chaos, the Gap) [Air] came to be, but next wide-bosomed Gaia (Gaea, Earth) . . .\n        and dim Tartaros (the Pit) in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros (Love), fairest among the deathless\n        gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them.\n        From Khaos (Chaos) [Air] came forth Erebos (Erebus, Darkness) and black Nyx (Night); but of Nyx (Night) were\n        born (Aether, Bright Upper Air) and Hemera (Day), whom she conceived and bore from union in love with\n        Erebos.\n        And Gaia (Gaea, Earth) first bore starry Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven), equal to herself, to cover her on every\n        side.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"From Caligine (Mist) [was born] : Chaos. From Chaos [was born]: Nox (Night) [Nyx], Dies (Day) [Hemera],\n        Erebus, Aether.\"\n\nCicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 17 (trans. Rackham) (Roman rhetorician C1st B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The parents of Caelus (Sky) [Ouranos (Uranus)], Aether (Upper Air) and Dies (Day) [Hemera] . . . fabled to\n        be the children of Erebus (Darkness) and Nox (Night) [Nyx].\"\n\nAlcman, Fragment 5 (from Scholia) (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric II) (Greek lyric\n          C7th B.C.) :\n        \"‘[First came] Thetis (Creation). After that, ancient Poros (Contriver) [perhaps Khronos (Chronos)]\n        and Tekmor (Tecmor, Ordinance) [perhaps Ananke]’ : Tekmor came into being after Poros . . . thereupon . .\n        . called him Poros (Contriver) since the beginning provided all things; for when the matter began to be set in\n        order, a certain Poros came into being as a beginning. So Alkman (Alcman) represents the matter of all things as\n        confused and unformed.\n        Then he says that one came into being who set all things in order, then that Poros came into being, and that\n        when Poros had passed by Tekmor followed. And Poros is as a beginning, Tekmor like an end. When Thetis\n        (Creation) had come into being, a beginning and end of all things came into being simultaneously, and all things\n        have their nature resembling the matter of bronze, while Thetis has hers resembling that of a craftsman, Poros\n        and Tekmor resembling a beginning and the end.\n        He uses the word ancient for old. ‘And the third, Skotos' (Scotus, Darkness) [Erebos]’ : since\n        neither sun nor moorn had come into being yet, but matter was still undifferentiated. So at the same moment\n        there came into being Poros and Tekmor and Skotos. ‘Amar (Day) [Hemera] and Melana (Moon) [Selene] and\n        third, Skotos (Darkness) as far as Marmarugas (Flashings)’ : days does not mean simply day, but contains\n        the idea of the sun. Previously there was only darkness, and afterwards, when it had been differentiated, light\n        came into being.\"\n\nAristophanes, Birds 685 ff (trans. O'Neill) (Greek comedy C5th to 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"At the beginning there was only Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [Air], Nyx (Night), dark Erebos (Darkness), and\n        deep Tartaros (the Pit). Ge (Gaea, Earth), Aer (Air) [probably Aither] and Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven) had no\n        existence. Firstly, black-winged Nyx (Night) laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebos\n        (Darkness), and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros [the primordial\n        Eros].\"\n\nAristophanes, Birds 1189 ff : \n        \"Aer (Air) [i.e. Aither], the son of Erebos (Erebus), in which the clouds float.\"\n\nOrphica, Theogonies Fragment 54 (from Damascius) (trans. West) (Greek hymns C3rd -\n          C2nd B.C.) :\n        \"Originally there was Hydros (Water), he [Orpheus] says, and Mud, from which Ge (Gaea, the Earth)\n        solidified : he posits these two as first principles, water and earth . . .\n        The one before the two [Thesis, Creation], however, he leaves unexpressed, his very silence being anintimation\n        of its ineffable nature. The third principle [Khronos (Chronos), Time] after the two was engendered by these--Ge\n        (Earth) and Hydros (Water), that is--and was a Serpent (Drakon) with extra heads growing upon it of a bull and a\n        lion, and a god's countenance in the middle; it had wings upon its shoulders, and its name was Khronos (Chronos,\n        Unaging Time) and also Herakles (Heracles). United with it was Ananke (Inevitability, Compulsion), being of the\n        same nature, or Adrastea, incorporeal, her arms extended throughout the universe and touching its extremities. I\n        think this stands for the third principle, occuping the place of essence, only he [Orpheus] made it bisexual [as\n        Phanes] to symbolize the universal generative cause. And I assume that the theology of the [Orphic]\n        Rhapsodies discarded the two first principles (together with the one before the two, that was left\n        unspoken) [i.e., the Orphics discarded the concepts of Thesis, Khronos and Ananke], and began from this third\n        principle [Phanes] after the two, because this was the first that was expressible and acceptable to human ears.\n        For this is the great Khronos (Unaging Time) that we found in it [the Rhapsodies], the father of Aither\n        (Aether, Light) [upper air] and Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [lower air]. Indeed, in this theology too [the\n        Hieronyman Rhapsodies], this Khronos (Time), the serpent has offspring, three in number : moist Aither\n        (Aether, Light)--I quote--, unbounded Khaos (Chaos), and as a third, misty Erebos (Darkness) . . . Among these,\n        he says, Khronos (Chronos, Time) generated an egg--this tradition too making it generated by Khronos, and born\n        ‘among’ these because it is from these that the third Intelligible triad is produced\n        [Protogonos-Phanes]. What is this triad, then? The egg; the dyad of the two natures inside it--male and\n        female--[Ouranos (Uranus) and Gaia (Gaea), Heaven and Earth], and the plurality of the various seeds between;\n        and thirdly an incorporeal god [Phanes] with golden wings on his shoulders, bulls' heads growing upon his\n        flanks, and on his head a monstrous serpent, presenting the appearance of all kinds of animal forms.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"From Chaos and Caligine [were born] : Nox (Night) [Nyx], Dies (Day) [Hemera], Erebus, Aether.\n        From Nox (Night) [Nyx] and Erebus [were born]: Fatum (Fate) [Ker], Senectus (Old Age) [Geras], Mors (Death)\n        [Thanatos], Letum (Dissolution) [Moros], Continentia (Continence), Somnus (Sleep) [Hypnos], Somnia (Dreams)\n        [Oneiroi], Amor [Eros]--that is Lysimeles, Epiphron, Porphyrion, Epaphus, Discordia (Discord), Miseria\n        (Wretchedness), Petulantia (Wantonness), Nemesis, Euphrosyne, Amicitia (Friendship) [Philotes], Misericordia\n        (Compassion), Styx; the three Parcae (Fates) [Moirai], namely Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos; the Hesperides\n        Aegle, Hesperie and Aerica.\"\n\nCicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 17 (trans. Rackham) (Roman rhetorician C1st B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[If Ouranos (Uranus) is a god then] the parents of Caelus [Ouranos], Aether (Upper Air) and Dies (Day)\n        [Hemera], must be held to be gods, and their brothers and sisters, whom the ancient genealogists name Amor\n        (Love) [Eros], Dolus (Guile) [Apate], Metus (Fear) [Phobos], Labor (Toil) [Ponos], Invidentia (Envy) [Nemesis],\n        Fatum (Fate) [Moros], Senectus (Old Age) [Geras], Mors (Death) [Thanatos], Tenebrae (Darkness) [Keres], Miseria\n        (Misery) [Oizys], Querella (Criticism) [Momos], Gratia (Friendship) [Philotes], Fraus (Fraud) [Apate],\n        Pertinacia (Obstinacy), the Parcae (Fates) [the Moirai], the Hesperides, the Somnia (Dreams) [the Oneiroi] : all\n        of these are fabled to be the children of Erebus (Darkness) and Nox (Night) [Nyx].
