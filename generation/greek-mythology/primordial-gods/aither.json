  "content": "AITHER (Aether) was the primordial god (protogenos) of light and the bright, blue ether of the heavens. His\n        mists filled the space between the solid dome of the sky (ouranos) and the\n        transparent mists of the earth-bound air (khaos, aer). In the evening his mother Nyx drew her dark veil\n        across the sky, obscuring the ether and bringing night. In the morn his sister and wife Hemera dispersed night's\n        mist to reveal the shining blue ether of day. In the ancient cosmogonies night and day were regarded as elements\n        separate from the sun.\n\nAither was one of the three \"airs\". The middle air was aer or khaos, a colourless mist which enveloped the mortal world. The lower air was\n        erebos, the mists of darkness, which enveloped the dark places beneath the earth and the realm of the\n        dead. The third was the upper air of aither, the mist of light and blue of the heavenly ether. The\n        aither enveloped the mountain peaks, clouds, stars, sun and moon.\n\nAether's female counterpart was Aithre (Aethra), Titaness of the clear\n        blue sky and mother of the sun and moon.\n\n[1.1] EREBOS & NYX (Hesiod\n          Theogony 124, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n        [1.2] EREBOS (Aristophanes Birds 1189)\n        [2.1] KHRONOS & ANANKE (Orphic Argonautica 12, Orphic Fragment 54)\n        [2.2] KHRONOS (Orphic Rhapsodies 66)\n        [3.1] KHAOS (Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] OURANOS (Alcman Frag 61, Callimachus Frag 498,\n          Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n        [2.1] GAIA, OURANOS, THALASSA (by\n        Hemera) (Hyginus Preface)\n        [3.1] NEPHELAI (Aristophanes Clouds 563)\n\n[1.1] ALGOS (DOLOR), DOLOS (DOLUS), LYSSA (IRA), PENTHOS (LUCTUS), PSEUDOLOGOS (MENDACIUM), HORKOS\n          (JUSIURANDUM), POINE (ULTIO), ?

(INCESTUM), HYSMINE (PUGNA) (by Gaia) (Hyginus Preface)\n\nAETHER (Aithêr), a personified idea of the mythical cosmogonies. According to that of Hyginus (Fab.\n          Pref. p. 1, ed. Staveren), he was, together with Night, Day, and Erebus, begotten by Chaos and Caligo\n        (Darkness). According to that of Hesiod (Theog. 124), Aether was the son of Erebus and his sister\n        Night, and a brother of Day. (Comp. Phornut. De Nat. Deor. 16.) The children of Aether and Day were\n        Land, Heaven, and Sea, and from his connexion with the Earth there sprang all the vices which destroy the human\n        race, and also the Giants and Titans. (Hygin. Fab. Prof. p. 2, &c.) These accounts shew that, in\n        the Greek cosmogonies, Aether was considered as one of the elementary substances out of which the Universe was\n        formed. In the Orphic hymns(4) Aether appears as the soul of the world, from which all life emanates, an idea\n        which was also adopted by some of the early philosophers of Greece. In later times Aether was regarded as the\n        wide space of Heaven, the residence of the gods, and Zeus as the Lord of the Aether, or Aether itself\n        personified. (Pacuv. ap. Cic. de Nat. Deor. ii. 36, 40; Lucret. v. 499; Virg. Aen. xii. 140,\n        Georg. ii. 325.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 124 ff (trans.

Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric II)\n          (Greek lyric C7th B.C.) :\n        \"The father of Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven), as was said already, is called Akmon (Acmon) [probably Aither\n        (Aether)] because heavenly motion is untiring (akamatos); an the sons of Ouranos are Akmonidai\n        (Acmonidae) : the ancients make these two points clear. Alkman (Alcman), they say, tells that the heaven belongs\n        to Akmon.\"\n\nAlcman, Fragment 5 (from Scholia) (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric II) (Greek lyric\n          C7th B.C.) :\n        \"‘[First came] Thetis (Creation).

So\n        at the same moment there came into being Poros and Tekmor and Skotos. ‘Amar (Day) [Hemera] and Melana\n        (Moon) [Selene] and third, Skotos (Darkness) as far as Marmarugas (Flashings) [probably Aither (Light)]’ :\n        days does not mean simply day, but contains the idea of the sun. Previously there was only darkness, and\n        afterwards, when it had been differentiated, light came into being.\"\n\nCallimachus, Fragment 498 (trans.

West) (Greek hymns C3rd -\n          C2nd B.C.) :\n        \"The great Khronos (Chronos, Unaging Time) that we found in it [the Rhapsodies], the father of\n        Aither (Aether, Light) [upper air] and Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [lower air]. Indeed, in this theology too [the\n        Hieronyman Rhapsodies], this Khronos (Time), the serpent has offspring, three in number : moist Aither\n        (Aether, Light)--I quote--, unbounded Khaos (Chaos), and as a third, misty Erebos (Darkness) . . . Among these,\n        he says, Khronos (Chronos, Time) generated an egg--this tradition too making it generated by Khronos, and born\n        ‘among’ these because it is from these that the third Intelligible triad is produced\n        [Protogonos-Phanes]. What is this triad, then? The egg; the dyad of the two natures inside it--male and\n        female--[Ouranos (Uranus) and Gaia (Gaea), Heaven and Earth], and the plurality of the various seeds between;\n        and thirdly an incorporeal god [Phanes] with golden wings on his shoulders, bulls' heads growing upon his\n        flanks, and on his head a monstrous serpent, presenting the appearance of all kinds of animal forms.\"\n\nOrphic Rhapsodies 66 (fragments) : \n        \"This Khronos (Chronos, Unaging Time), of immortal resource, begot Aither (Aether, Light) [upper air] and\n        great Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [lower air], vast this way and that, no limit below it, no base, no place to\n        settle.

As it tried to squeeze all the matter with greater force, it divided the\n        world into the two hemispheres, and after that the atoms sorted themselves out, the lighter and finer ones in\n        the universe floating above and becoming the Bright Air [Aither (Aether)] and the most rarefied Wind [perhaps\n        Khaos (Chaos)], while the heaviest and dirtiest have veered down, become the Earth (Ge) [Gaia], both the dry\n        land and the fluid waters [Pontos and Okeanos (Oceanus)].
