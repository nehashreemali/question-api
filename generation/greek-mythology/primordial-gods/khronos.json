  "content": "KHRONOS (Chronos) was the primordial god of time. In the Orphic cosmogony he emerged self-formed at the dawn of\n        creation. Khronos was envisaged as an incorporeal god, serpentine in form, with three heads--that of a man, a\n        bull, and a lion. He and his consort, the serpentine goddess Ananke (Inevitability),\n        enveloped the primordial world-egg in their coils and split it apart to form the ordered universe of earth, sea\n        and sky. After this act of creation the couple circled the cosmos driving the rotation of heaven and the eternal\n        passage of time.\n\nThe figure of Khronos was essentially a cosmological double of the Titan Kronos (Cronus) (\"Father Time\"). The Orphics sometimes merged\n        Khronos with the creator-god Phanes, and also equated him with the Titan Ophion. His equivalent in the Phoenician cosmogony was probably Olam\n        (Eternal Time) whose name is written Oulomos in Greek transcripts.\n\nKhronos was depicted in Greco-Roman mosaic as Aion (Aeon), eternity personified. He holds a wheel inscribed\n        with the signs of the zodiac and Gaia (Mother Earth) usually reclines at his feet. The poet Nonnus describes\n        Aion as an old man with long, white hair and a beard but mosaic-art presents a youthful figure.\n\n[1.1] HYDROS & GAIA (Orphic\n          Fragments 54 & 57)\n        [2.1] NONE (he emerged at creation) (Nonnus Dionysiaca 7.7 & 12.34)\n\n[1.1] KHAOS, AITHER, PHANES (by Ananke) (Orphic Argonautica 12)\n        [1.2] KHAOS, AITHER, EREBOS (by Ananke) Formed PHANES & WORLD-EGG (Orphic Fragment 54)\n        [1.3] KHAOS, AITHER (Orphic\n          Rhapsodies 66)\n        [1.4] Formed WORLD-EGG out of Aither (containing GAIA & OURANOS) (Orphic Rhapsodies 66, Orphic Frag 54 & 57,\n          Epicuras Frag)\n        [2.1] HEMERA (by Nyx) (Bacchylides\n          Frag 7)\n        [4.1] THE MOIRAI (by Nyx) (Tzetzes on Lycophron)\n        [5.1] THE TWELVE HORAI (Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          12.15)\n\n* The Greek word khronos speaks of an indeterminable portion of time, in contrast to hora, a\n        fixed portion.\n\nAlcman, Fragment 5 (from Scholia) (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric II) (Greek lyric\n          C7th B.C.) :\n        \"‘[First came] Thetis (Creation). After that, ancient Poros (Contriver) [perhaps Khronos (Chronos)]\n        and Tekmor (Tecmor, Ordinance) [perhaps Ananke]’ : Tekmor came into being after Poros . . . thereupon . .\n        . called him Poros (Contriver) since the beginning provided all things; for when the matter began to be set in\n        order, a certain Poros came into being as a beginning. So Alkman (Alcman) represents the matter of all things as\n        confused and unformed.\n        Then he says that one came into being who set all things in order, then that Poros came into being, and that\n        when Poros had passed by Tekmor followed. And Poros is as a beginning, Tekmor like an end. When Thetis\n        (Creation) had come into being, a beginning and end of all things came into being simultaneously, and all things\n        have their nature resembling the matter of bronze, while Thetis has hers resembling that of a craftsman, Poros\n        and Tekmor resembling a beginning and the end.\n        He uses the word ancient for old. ‘And the third, Skotos' (Scotus, Darkness) [Erebos]’ : since\n        neither sun nor moorn had come into being yet, but matter was still undifferentiated. So at the same moment\n        there came into being Poros and Tekmor and Skotos. ‘Amar (Day) [Hemera] and Melana (Moon) [Selene] and\n        third, Skotos (Darkness) as far as Marmarugas (Flashings)’ : days does not mean simply day, but contains\n        the idea of the sun. Previously there was only darkness, and afterwards, when it had been differentiated, light\n        came into being.\"\n\nOrphica, Theogonies Fragment 54 (from Damascius) (trans. West) (Greek hymns C3rd -\n          C2nd B.C.) :\n        \"Originally there was Hydros (Water), he [Orpheus] says, and Mud, from which Ge (Gaea, the Earth)\n        solidified : he posits these two as first principles, water and earth . . .\n        The one before the two [Thesis, Creation], however, he leaves unexpressed, his very silence being anintimation\n        of its ineffable nature. The third principle [Khronos (Chronos), Time] after the two was engendered by these--Ge\n        (Earth) and Hydros (Water), that is--and was a Serpent (Drakon) with extra heads growing upon it of a bull and a\n        lion, and a god's countenance in the middle; it had wings upon its shoulders, and its name was Khronos (Chronos,\n        Unaging Time) and also Herakles (Heracles). United with it was Ananke (Inevitability, Compulsion), being of the\n        same nature, or Adrastea, incorporeal, her arms extended throughout the universe and touching its extremities. I\n        think this stands for the third principle, occuping the place of essence, only he [Orpheus] made it bisexual [as\n        Phanes] to symbolize the universal generative cause. And I assume that the theology of the [Orphic]\n        Rhapsodies discarded the two first principles (together with the one before the two, that was left\n        unspoken) [i.e., the Orphics discarded the concepts of Thesis, Khronos and Ananke], and began from this third\n        principle [Phanes] after the two, because this was the first that was expressible and acceptable to human ears.\n        For this is the great Khronos (Unaging Time) that we found in it [the Rhapsodies], the father of Aither\n        (Aether, Light) [upper air] and Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [lower air]. Indeed, in this theology too [the\n        Hieronyman Rhapsodies], this Khronos (Time), the serpent has offspring, three in number : moist Aither\n        (Aether, Light)--I quote--, unbounded Khaos (Chaos), and as a third, misty Erebos (Darkness) . . . Among these,\n        he says, Khronos (Chronos, Time) generated an egg--this tradition too making it generated by Khronos, and born\n        ‘among’ these because it is from these that the third Intelligible triad is produced\n        [Protogonos-Phanes]. What is this triad, then? The egg; the dyad of the two natures inside it--male and\n        female--[Ouranos (Uranus) and Gaia (Gaea), Heaven and Earth], and the plurality of the various seeds between;\n        and thirdly an incorporeal god [Phanes] with golden wings on his shoulders, bulls' heads growing upon his\n        flanks, and on his head a monstrous serpent, presenting the appearance of all kinds of animal forms . . . And\n        the third god of the third triad this theology too celebrates as Protogonos (First-Born) [Phanes], and it calls\n        him Zeus the order of all and of the whole world, wherefore he is also called Pan (All). So much this second\n        genealogy supplies concerning the Intelligible principles.\"\n\nOrphica, Theogonies Fragment 57 (from Athenogoras) :\n        \"The gods, as they [the Greeks] say, did not exist from the beginning, but each of them was born just as we\n        are born . . . and Orpheus--who was the original inventor of the gods' names and recounted their births and said\n        what they have all done, and who enjoys some credit among them as a true theologian, and is generally followed\n        by Homer, above all about the gods--also making their first genesis from water : ‘Okeanos (Oceanus), who\n        is the genesis of the all.’\n        For Hydros (Water) was according to him the origin of everything, and from Hydros (the Water) mud formed, and\n        from the pair of them a living creature was generated with an extra head growing upon it of a lion, and another\n        of a bull, and in the middle of them a god's countenance; its name was Herakles (Heracles) and Khronos (Chronos,\n        Time). This Herakles generated a huge egg, which, being filled full, by the force of its engenderer was broken\n        in two from friction. Its crown became Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven), and what had sunk downwards, Gaia (Gaea,\n        Earth). There also came forth an incorporeal god [Protogonos-Phanes].\"\n\nOrphica, Rhapsodies Fragment 66 :\n        \"This Khronos (Chronos, Unaging Time), of immortal resource, begot Aither (Aether, Light) [upper air] and\n        great Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [lower air], vast this way and that, no limit below it, no base, no place to\n        settle. Then great Khronos fashioned from (or in) divine Aither (Aether) a bright white egg [from which Phanes\n        was born].\"\n\nOrphica, Epicuras Fragment (from Epiphanius) : \n        \"And he [Epicurus] says that the world began in the likeness of an egg, and the Wind [the entwined forms of\n        Khronos (Chronos, Time) and Ananke (Inevitability)] encircling the egg serpent-fashion like a wreath or a belt\n        then began to constrict nature. As it tried to squeeze all the matter with greater force, it divided the world\n        into the two hemispheres, and after that the atoms sorted themselves out, the lighter and finer ones in the\n        universe floating above and becoming the Bright Air [Aither (Aether)] and the most rarefied Wind [probably Khaos\n        (Chaos, Air)], while the heaviest and dirtiest have veered down, become the Earth (Ge) [Gaia], both the dry land\n        and the fluid waters [Pontos the Sea]. And the atoms move by themselves and through themselves within the\n        revolution of the Sky and the Stars, everything still being driven round by the serpentiform wind [of Khronos\n        and Ananke].\"\n\nOrphica, Argonautica 12 ff (trans. West) (Greek epic C4th to C6th A.D.) :\n        \"Firstly, ancient Khaos's (Chaos') stern Ananke (Inevitability), and Khronos (Chronos, Time), who bred\n        within his boundless coils Aither (Aether, Light) and two-sexed, two-faced, glorious Eros [the primordial Eros],\n        ever-born Nyx's (Night's) father, whom latter men call Phanes, for he first was manifested.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 12 to Heracles (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Self-grown, unwearied, noblest scion of Ge (Gaia, Earth), who didst flash out with firstborn scales, O\n        famous Aion (Aeon, Time).\"\n\nBeyond the Orphic Theogonies, Khronos (Chronos), god of time, and Kronos (Cronus), father of Zeus, are\n        usually identical (cf. Pindar and Cicero below). Nonnus' Aion (Aeon, Eternity), however, is the primordial\n        Orphic god.\n\nPindar, Olympian 2. 17 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"Of things come to pass in justice or unjust, not Khronos (Chronos, Time) the father of all can make the\n        end unaccomplished.\"\n\nPindar, Odes Olympian 10. 50 ff : \n        \"[Herakles (Heracles) founds the Olympic Games :] And he [Herakles] named the Hill of Kronos (Cronus), for\n        long years while Oinomaos (Oenomaus) ruled, a hill nameless and showered with winter's snow. Now in that\n        birthday hour [of the Games] the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) stood by, this new-established rite to consecrate, and\n        Khronos (Chronos, Time), whose proof at last stands the sole judge of truth that shall abide.\"\n        [N.B. the Titan Kronos was worshipped at Olympia on the hill of the same name.]\n\nPindar, Nemean Ode 4. 41 ff :\n        \"For me, whatever share of excellence the throne of Fate endowed, I know full well that Khronos (Chronos,\n        Time), although his foot be slow, shall bring it to the end ordained.\"\n\nPindar, Paean 2 (trans.

For the Father had not yet cut the threads of child-birth and shot\n        forth Bakkhos (Bacchus) [Dionysos] from his pregnant thigh, to give mankind rest from their tribulations; not\n        yet did the libation of wine soak the pathways of the air and make them drunken with sweetsmelling exhalations.\n        The Horai (Horae, Seasons), those daughters of the lichtgang, still joyless, plaited garlands for the gods only\n        of meadow-grass. For Wine was lacking.

Do you not see that Enyo [goddess of war]\n        has made the whole earth mad, mowing season by season her harvest of quick-perishing youth? We can yet see\n        traces of that deluge which you brought upon all nations, when the streams of airy floods billowed in the air\n        and boiled against the neighbouring Moon. Farewell to the life of men, since they perish so soon! I renounce the\n        divine helm at their fate, I will no longer handle the world's cable. Let some other of the Blessed, one better\n        than I am, receive the rudder of life ever renewed; let another have the course of my years--for I am weary of\n        pitying the luckless race of suffering mankind. Is not old age enough, which blights youth, and makes a man go\n        slow with bowed head, when bent and trembling he goes on his way with a foot too many, heavy of knee and leaning\n        upon a staff, the faithful servant of age! Is not fate enough, who often hides in Lethe the young bridegroom,\n        companion of an agemate bride lately wed, and breaks the life-bringing cables of a union that cannot be broken!\n        I know how delightful a marriage is when Athena's hoboy sounds along with the panspipes: nevertheless, what\n        boots it, when the loud sound of the sevenchord harp is heard twanging near the bridal chamber? Lutes cannot\n        comform a heavy heart: but Eros himself stops the dance and throws away the bridal torch, if he sees a wedding\n        without joy.\n        ‘But, some may say, a medicine [Hope] has been planted to make long-suffering mortals forget their\n        troubles, to save their lives. Would that Pandora had never opened the heavenly cover of that jar--she the sweet\n        bane of mankind! Nay, Prometheus himself is the cause of man's misery--Prometheus who cares for poor mortals!\n        Instead of fire which is the beginning of all evil he ought rather to have stolen sweet nectar, which rejoices\n        the heart of the gods, and given that to men, that he might have scattered the sorrows of the world with your\n        own drink. But never mind the cares of tempest-tossed life, just consider your own ceremonials brought to\n        sadness. Are you pleased at the empty vapour of the burnt-offering that strays without libation?’\n        When the ancient had ended, Zeus Allwise for a time turned over his infinite wisdom in thoughtful silence, and\n        gave rein to his mind; one after another the meditations of that creative brain revolved before him; and at last\n        Kronides addressed his divine voice to Aion (Time), and revealed oracles higher than the prophetic centre\n        [Delphoi] :\n        ‘O Father self-begotten [he was not born to any other but emerged at the beginning of the universe],\n        shepherd of the ever-flowing years! Be not angry; the human race waxes and wanes like the moon, and never fails\n        or forgets its season. Leave nectar to the Blessed; and I will give mankind to heal their sorrows delicious\n        wine, another drink like nectar self-distilled, and one suited to mortals. The primeval world will sorrow still,\n        until I be delivered of one child [Dionysos] . . . Yesterday at the nod of my Deo [Demeter], lady of the wide\n        threshing-floors, the earth dug by the iron wooer of corn was delivered of the dry fruit of the sheaf-bearing\n        soil.
