  "content": "OURANOS (Uranus) was the primordial god (protogenos) of the sky. The Greeks imagined the sky as a\n        solid dome of brass, decorated with stars, whose edges descended to rest upon the outermost limits of the flat\n        earth. Ouranos was the literal sky, just as his consort Gaia (Gaea) was the earth.\n\nOuranos and Gaia had twelve sons and six daughters. He locked the eldest of these--the giant Kyklopes\n        (Cyclopes) and Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires)--away inside the belly of Earth. Gaia suffered immense pain and\n        persuaded her Titan sons to rebel. Four of these positioned themselves at the corners of the world, ready to\n        grasp their father as he descended to lie with Earth, while the fifth, Kronos (Cronus), took his place in the\n        centre and there castrated Ouranos with an adamantine sickle. The sky-god's blood fell upon the earth, producing\n        the avenging Erinyes and the Gigantes (Giants).\n\nOuranos prophesied the fall of the Titanes and the punishments they would suffer for their crimes--a prophecy\n        brought to fruition by Zeus who deposed the five brothers and cast them into the pit of Tartaros.\n\nOuranos does not appear in early Greek art but Egyptian depictions of their sky-goddess Nut demonstrate how he\n        was imagined--as a gigantic, star-spangled man with long arms and legs, resting on all fours, with his\n        finger-tips in the far east, his toes in the far west, and his arching body raised to form the dome of the sky.\n        In the Roman era he was often depicted as Aion, god of eternal time, in the form of a\n        man holding the zodiac-wheel, standing above the reclining Gaia (Earth).\n\n[1.1] GAIA (no father) (Hesiod Theogony 126, Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 27.50)\n        [2.1] AITHER & GAIA (Titanomachia Frag 2)\n        [2.2] AKMON (Alcman Frag 61, Callimachus Frag\n          498)\n        [2.3] AITHER & HEMERA (Hyginus\n          Preface, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n        [4.1] NYX (Orphic Fragments)\n        [5.1] Born of the WORLD EGG formed by KHRONOS (Orphic\n          Rhapsodies 66, Orphic Frag 54 & 57, Epicuras Frag)\n\n[1.1] THE TITANES (OKEANOS, KOIOS, KRIOS, HYPERION, IAPETOS, KRONOS), THE TITANIDES (THEIA, RHEIA, THEMIS, MNEMOSYNE, TETHYS), THE KYKLOPES, THE HEKATONKHEIRES\n        (by Gaia) (Hesiod Theogony 135, Diodorus Siculus\n          5.66.1)\n        [1.2] THE TITANES (OKEANOS, KRONOS, TETHYS) (by Gaia) (Aeschylus Prometheus Bound 207)\n        [1.3] THE TITANES (as above), THE\n          TITANIDES (as above plus DIONE), THE KYKLOPES, THE HEKATONKHEIRES\n        (by Gaia) (Apollodorus 1.2)\n        [1.4] THE KYKLOPES, THE\n          HEKATONKHEIRES (by Gaia) (Eumelus Titanomachia Frag\n          1)\n        [1.5] OKEANOS, THEMIS, TARTAROS, PONTOS, THE\n          TITANES, BRIAREUS, GYES,\n        STEROPES, ATLAS, HYPERION, KOIOS, KRONOS, RHEIA, MNEMOSYNE, DIONE, THE ERINYES (by Gaia) ?

Theog. 126, &c.; comp. Cic. De\n          Nat.

(Hes. Theog. 133, &c.)\n        According to Cicero (De Nat. Deor. iii. 22, 23), he also was the father of Mercury (Hermes) by Dia, and\n        of Venus by Hemera. Uranus hated his children, and immediately after their birth, he confined them in Tartarus,\n        in consequence of which he was unmanned and dethroned by Cronos at the instigation of Gaea. (Hes. Theog.\n          180.) Out of the drops of his blood sprang the Gigantes, the Melian nymphs, and according to some,\n        Silenus, and from the foam gathering around his limbs in the sea, sprang Aphrodite (Hes. Theog. 195 ;\n        Apollod. i. 1; Serv. ad Aen. v. 801, ad Virg. Ecl. vi. 13).\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 115 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Verily at first Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [Air] came to be, but next wide-bosomed Gaia (Gaea, Earth) . . .\n        and dim Tartaros (Hell) in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros (Love), fairest among the deathless\n        gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them. From\n        Khaos (Chaos) [Air] came forth Erebos (Erebus, Darkness) and black Nyx (Night); but of Nyx (Night) were born\n        Aither (Aether, Light) and Hemera (Day), whom she conceived and bore from union in love with Erebos. And Gaia\n        (Earth) first bore starry Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven), equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an\n        ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she brought forth long Ourea (Mountains) . . . She bore also\n        the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontos (Pontus, Sea), without sweet union of love.\"\n\nThe lost Titanomachia epic, attributed to Eumelus of Corinth, included a cosmogony. It was probably\n        similar in most respects to Hesiod's, but with a few significant points of divergence--Ouranos (Uranus), Gaia\n        (Gaea) and Pontos, for example, were apparently represented as children of Aither (Aether, Upper Air) and Hemera\n        (Day).\n\nEumelus of Corinth or Arctinus of Miletus, Titanomachia Fragment 2 (from Anecdota\n          Oxon. i.75) (trans.

Among these, he says,\n        Khronos (Chronos, Time) generated an egg--this tradition too making it generated by Khronos, and born\n        ‘among’ these because it is from these that the third Intelligible triad is produced. What is this\n        triad, then? The egg; the dyad of the two natures inside it (male and female) [Ouranos the Heaven and Gaia the\n        Earth], and the plurality of the various seeds between; and thirdly an incorporeal god [Phanes or the primordial\n        Eros] with golden wings on his shoulders . . .

As it tried to squeeze all the matter with greater force, it divided the world into\n        the two hemispheres [Ouranos (Uranus) and Gaia (Gaea), Heaven and Earth].\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 1. 1 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Ere land and sea and the all-covering sky were made, in the whole world the countenance of nature was the\n        same, all one, well named Chaos, a raw and undivided mass, naught but a lifeless bulk, with warring seeds of\n        ill-joined elements compressed together. No Titan [Helios the Sun] as yet poured light upon the world, no waxing\n        Phoebe [Selene the Moon] her crescent filled anew, nor in the ambient air yet hung the earth, self-balanced,\n        equipoised, nor Amphitrite's [the Sea's] arms embraced the long far margin of the land. Though there were land\n        and sea and air, the land no foot could tread, no creature swim the sea, the air was lightless; nothing kept its\n        form, all objects were at odds, since in one mass cold essence fought with hot, and moist with dry, and hard\n        with soft and light with things of weight. This strife a God (Deus) [perhaps Khronos (Chronos) or the\n        primordial Eros], with nature's blessing, solved; who severed land from sky and sea from land, and from the\n        denser vapours set apart the ethereal sky; and, each from the blind heap resolved and freed, he fastened in its\n        place appropriate in peace and harmony. The fiery weightless force of heaven's vault [Ouranos (Uranus)] flashed\n        up and claimed the topmost citadel; next came the air in lightness and in place; the thicker earth with grosser\n        elements sank burdened by its weight; lowest and last the girdling waters pent the solid globe. So into shape\n        whatever god it was reduced the primal matter and prescribed its several parts. Then first, to make the earth\n        even on every side, he rounded it into a mighty disc, then bade the sea extend and rise under the rushing winds,\n        and gird the shores of the encircled earth . . .\n        Scarce had he thus all things in finite bounds divided when the Sidera (Stars) [Astra], in darkness blind long\n        buried, over all the spangled sky began to gleam; and, that no part or place should lack fit forms of life, the\n        firmament he made the home of gods and goddesses and the bright constellations; in the sea he set the shining\n        fish to swim; the land received the beasts, the gusty air the birds.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 5. 9 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :\n        \"After Chaos, when the world acquired three elements and the whole structure shifted to new forms, earth\n        subsided with its weight and dragged the seas [Pontos] down, but lightness lifted the heavens [Ouranos (Uranus)]\n        up high. The sun, too, jumped out, not chained by gravity, and the stars, and you horses of the moon. Terra\n        (Earth) [Gaia] for a long time did not yield to Caelus (Heaven) [Ouranos].

After them was born Kronos (Cronus) the wily,\n        youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire.\n        And again, she bare the Kyklopes (Cyclopes), overbearing in spirit, Brontes, and Steropes and stubborn-hearted\n        Arges.\n        And again, three other sons [the Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires)] were born of Gaia and Ouranos, great and\n        doughty beyond telling, Kottos (Cottus) and Briareos (Briareus) and Gyes. From their shoulders sprang a hundred\n        arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible\n        was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms. For of all the children that were born of Gaia and\n        Ouranos, these were the most terrible, and they were hated by their own father from the first. And he used to\n        hide them all away in a secret place of Gaia (Earth) so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come\n        up into the light: and Ouranos rejoiced in his evil doing.\n        But vast Gaia groaned within, being straitened, and she made the element of grey flint and shaped a great\n        sickle, and told her plan to her dear sons. And she spoke, cheering them, while she was vexed in her dear heart\n        : ‘My children, gotten of a sinful father, if you will obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your\n        father; for he first thought of doing shameful things.’\n        So she said; but fear seized them all, and none of them uttered a word. But great Kronos (Cronus) the wily took\n        courage and answered his dear mother : ‘Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence not our\n        father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful things.’\n        So he said : and vast Gaia rejoiced greatly in spirit, and set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his hands a\n        jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot. And Ouranos came, bringing on night and longing forlove, and\n        he lay about Gaia spreading himself full upon her. Then the son from his ambush stretched forth his left hand\n        and in his right took the great long sickle with jagged teeth, and swiftly lopped off his own father's members\n        and cast them away to fall behind him.\n        And not vainly did they fall from his hand; for all the bloody drops that gushed forth Gaia received, and as the\n        seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes (Furies) and the great Gigantes (Giants) [perhaps the Kouretes\n        (Curetes)] with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphai (Nymphs) whom they call\n        Meliai (Meliae) all over the boundless earth.\n        And so soon as he had cut off the members with flint and cast them from the land into the surging sea, they were\n        swept away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread around them from the immortal flesh, and in it\n        there grew a maiden [Aphrodite] . . . \n        But these sons whom be begot himself great Ouranos used to call Titanes (Titans, Strainers) in reproach, for he\n        said that they strained and did presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come\n        afterwards.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 617 ff : \n        \"But when first their father [Ouranos (Uranus)] was vexed in his heart with [the Hekatonkheires\n        (Hecatoncheires)] Obriareus and Kottos (Cottus) and Gyes, he bound them in cruel bonds . . . and he made them\n        live beneath the wide-pathed earth, where they were afflicted, being set to dwell under the ground, at the end\n        of the earth, at its great borders, in bitter anguish for a long time and with great grief at heart.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 459 ff : \n        \"For he [Kronos (Cronus)] learned from Gaia (Gaea, Earth) and starry Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven) that he was\n        destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was, through the contriving of great Zeus.

But when\n        she was about to bear Zeus, the father of gods and men, then she besought her own dear parents, Gaia and starry\n        Ouranos, to devise some plan with her that the birth of her dear child might be concealed, and that retribution\n        might overtake great, crafty Kronos for his own father and also for the children whom he had swallowed down. And\n        they readily heard and obeyed their dear daughter, and told her all that was destined to happen touching Kronos\n        the king and his stout-hearted son.
