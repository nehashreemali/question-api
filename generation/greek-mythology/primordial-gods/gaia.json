  "content": "GAIA (Gaea) was the goddess of the earth. She was one of the primoridal elemental deities (protogenoi)\n        born at the dawn of creation.\n        Gaia was the great mother of all creation--the heavenly gods were descended from her through her union with Ouranos (Uranus) (Sky), the sea-gods from her union with Pontos (Sea), the Gigantes (Giants) from her\n        mating with Tartaros (the Pit), and mortal creatures born directly from her earthy\n        flesh.\n\nGaia was the chief antagonist of the heavenly gods. First she rebelled against her husband Ouranos (Sky) who\n        had imprisoned several of her giant-sons within her womb. Later when her son Kronos (Cronus) defied her by imprisoning these same sons, she sided with\n        Zeus in his rebellion. Finally she came into conflict with Zeus for she was\n        angered by his binding of her Titan-sons in Tartaros. She birthed a tribe of Gigantes (Giants) and later the\n        monster Typhoeus to overthrow him, but both failed in their attempts.\n\nIn the ancient Greek cosmology earth was conceived of as a flat disk encirced by the river Okeanos (Oceanus),\n        and encompassed above by the solid dome of heaven and below by the great pit (or inverse dome) of Tartaros.\n        Earth supported the seas and mountains upon her breast.\n\nIn Greek vase painting Gaia was depicted as a buxom, matronly woman rising from the earth, inseparable from her\n        native element. In mosaic art, she appears as a full-figured woman, reclining on the earth, often clothed in\n        green, and sometimes accompanied by troops of Karpoi (Carpi, Fruits) and Horai (Horae, Seasons).\n\n[1.1] NONE (the second being to emerge at creation) (Hesiod Theogony 116)\n        [2.1] Emerged from HYDROS (Orphic Rhapsodies 66, Orphic Frag\n          54 & 57, Epicuras Frag) \n        [3.1] AITHER & HEMERA (Hyginus\n          Preface)\n\n[1.1] OURANOS, THE OUREA, PONTOS\n        (without a mate) (Hesiod Theogony 126)\n        [1.2] PONTOS, TARTAROS (by Aither or Ouranos?)

She appears in the character of a divine being\n        as early as the Homeric poems, for we read in the Iliad (iii. 104) that black sheep were sacrificed to her, and\n        that she was invoked by persons taking oaths. (iii. 278, xv. 36, xix. 259, Od. v. 124.) She is further\n        called, in the Homeric poems, the mother of Erechtheus and Tithyus. (Il. ii. 548, Od. vii. 324, xi.\n        576; comp. Apollon. Rhod. i. 762, iii. 716. According to the Theogony of Hesiod (117, 12,5, &c.), she was\n        the first being that sprang front Chaos, sand gave birth to Uranus and Pontus. By Uranus she then became the\n        mother of a series of beings, -- Oceanus, Coeus, Creius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Theia, Rheia, Themis, Mnemosyne,\n        Phoebe, Thetys, Cronos, the Cyclopes, Brontes, Steropes, Arges, Cottus, Briareus, and Gyges. These children of\n        Ge and Uranus were hated by their father, and Ge therefore concealed. them in the bosom of the earth; but she\n        made a large iron sickle, gave it to her sons, and requested them to take vengeance upon their father. Cronos\n        undertook the task, and mutilated Uranus. The drops of blood which fell from him upon the earth (Ge), became the\n        seeds of the Erinnyes, the Gigantes, and the Melian nymphs. Subsequently Ge became, by Pontus, the mother of\n        Nereus, Thaumas, Phorcys, Ceto, and Eurybia. (Hes. Theog. 232, &c.; Apollod. i. 1. § 1,\n        &c.) Besides these, however, various other divinities and monsters sprang from her. As Ge was the source\n        from which arose the vapours producing divine inspiration, she herself also was regarded as an oracular\n        divinity, and it is well known that the oracle of Delphi was believed to have at first been in her possession\n        (Aeschyl. Eum. 2; Paus. x. 5. § 3), and at Olympia, too, she had an oracle in early times. (Paus.\n        v. 14. § 8.) That Ge belonged to the theoi chthinioi, requires no explanation, and hence she is frequently\n        mentioned where they are invoked. (Philostr. Vit. Apoll. vi. 39; Ov. Met. vii. 196.) The\n        surnames and epithets given to Ge have more or less reference to her character as the all-producing and\n        all-nourishing mother (mater omniparens et alma), and hence Servius (ad Aen. iv. 166) classes\n        her together with the divinities presiding over marriage. Her worship appears to have been universal among the\n        Greeks, and she had temples or altars at Athens, Sparta, Delphi, Olympia, Bura, Tegea, Phlyus, and other places.\n        (Thuc. ii. 15; Paus. i. 22. § 3, 24. § 3, 31. § 2, iii. 11. § 8, 12. § 7, v. 14.\n        §8, vii. 25. § 8, viii. 48. § 6.) We have express statements attesting the existence of statues\n        of Ge in Greece, but none have come down to us. At Patrae she was represented in a sitting attitude, in the\n        temple of Demeter (Paus. vii. 21. § 4), and at Athens, too, there was a statue of her. (i. 24. § 3.)\n        Servius (ad Aen. x. 252) remarks that she was represented with a key.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 116 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Verily at first Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) [Air] came to be, but next wide-bosomed Gaia (Gaea, the Earth),\n        the ever-sure foundation of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympos, and dim Tartaros\n        (Tartarus, the Pit) in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros (Love), fairest among the deathless gods,\n        who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them.\n        From Khaos (Chaos, the Chasm) came forth Erebos (Erebus, Darkness) and black Nyx (Night); but of Nyx (Night)\n        were born Aither (Aether, Light) and Hemera (Day), whom she conceived and bore from union in love with\n        Erebos.\n        And Gaia (Gaea, the Earth) first bore starry Ouranos (Uranus, the Heavens), equal to herself, to cover her on\n        every side. And she brought forth long Ourea (Mountains), graceful haunts of the goddess Nymphai (Nymphs) who\n        dwell amongst the glens of the mountains. She bare also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontos\n        (Pontus, the Sea), without sweet union of love.\n        But afterwards she lay with Ouranos (Uranus) and bare [the Titanes (Titans)] deep-swirling Okeanos (Oceanus)\n        [the earth-encircling river], Koios (Coeus) and Krios (Crius) and Hyperion and Iapetos (Iapetus), Theia and\n        Rheia, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoibe (Phoebe) and lovely Tethys. After them was born Kronos\n        (Cronus), the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn IV to Hermes 427 (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"He [Apollon] sang the story of the deathless gods and of dark Gaia (Gaea, Earth), how at the first they\n        came to be.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn XXX to Gaea (trans.

Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Ere land and sea and the all-covering sky were made, in the whole world the countenance of nature was the\n        same, all one, well named Chaos, a raw and undivided mass, naught but a lifeless bulk, with warring seeds of\n        ill-joined elements compressed together. No Titan [Helios the Sun] as yet poured light upon the world, no waxing\n        Phoebe [Selene the Moon] her crescent filled anew, nor in the ambient air yet hung the earth, self-balanced,\n        equipoised, nor Amphitrite's [the Sea's] arms embraced the long far margin of the land. Though there were land\n        and sea and air, the land no foot could tread, no creature swim the sea, the air was lightless; nothing kept its\n        form, all objects were at odds, since in one mass cold essence fought with hot, and moist with dry, and hard\n        with soft and light with things of weight. This strife a God (Deus) [perhaps primordial Eros\n        (Procreation) or Khronos (Chronos, Time)], with nature's blessing, solved; who severed land from sky and sea\n        from land, and from the denser vapours set apart the ethereal sky; and, each from the blind heap resolved and\n        freed, he fastened in its place appropriate in peace and harmony. The fiery weightless force of heaven's vault\n        [Ouranos (Uranus)] flashed up and claimed the topmost citadel; next came the air in lightness and in place; the\n        thicker earth with grosser elements sank burdened by its weight; lowest and last the girdling waters pent the\n        solid globe. So into shape whatever god it was reduced the primal matter and prescribed its several parts. Then\n        first, to make the earth even on every side, he rounded it into a mighty disc, then bade the sea extend and rise\n        under the rushing winds, and gird the shores of the encircled earth . . . Scarce had he thus all things in\n        finite bounds divided when the Sidera (Stars) [Astra], in darkness blind long buried, over all the spangled sky\n        began to gleam; and, that no part or place should lack fit forms of life, the firmament he made the home of gods\n        and goddesses and the bright constellations; in the sea he set the shining fish to swim; the land received the\n        beasts, the gusty air the birds.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti5. 9 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :\n        \"After Chaos, when the world acquired three elements and the whole structure shifted to new forms, earth\n        subsided with its weight and dragged the seas [Pontos] down, but lightness lifted the heavens [Ouranos (Uranus)]\n        up high. The sun, too, jumped out, not chained by gravity, and the stars, and you horses of the moon. Terra\n        (Earth) [Gaia] for a long time did not yield to Caelus (Heaven) [Ouranos].

The third principle after the two was engendered by these--Ge (Gaea, Earth) and Hydros\n        (Water), that is--and was a Serpent (Drakon) with extra heads growing upon it of a bull and a lion, and a god's\n        countenance in the middle; it had wings upon its shoulders, and its name was Khronos (Chronos, Unaging Time) and\n        also Herakles. United with it was Ananke (Inevitability, Compulsion) , being of the same nature, or Adrastea,\n        incorporeal, her arms extended throughout the universe and touching its extremities. I think this stands for the\n        third principle, occuping the place of essence, only he [Orpheus] made it bisexual [as Phanes] to symbolize the\n        universal generative cause. And I assume that the theology of the [Orphic] Rhapsodies discarded the two first\n        principles (together with the one before the two, that was left unspoken) [that is, the Orphics discarded the\n        concepts of Thesis, Khronos (Chronos) and Ananke], and began from this third principle [Phanes] after the two,\n        because this was the first that was expressible and acceptable to human ears. For this is the great Khronos\n        (Unaging Time) that we found in it [the Rhapsodies], the father of Aither (Aether, Light) and Khaos (Chaos, the\n        Chasm) [Air]. Indeed, in this theology too [the Hieronyman], this Khronos (Time), the serpent has offspring,\n        three in number: moist Aither (Light) (I quote), unbounded Khaos (Chaos) [Air], and as a third, misty Erebos\n        (Erebus, Darkness) . . .\n        Among these, he says, Khronos (Time) generated an egg--this tradition too making it generated by Khronos, and\n        born ‘among’ these because it is from these that the third Intelligible triad is produced\n        [Protogonos-Phanes]. What is this triad, then? The egg; the dyad of the two natures inside it (male and female)\n        [Ouranos (Uranus) the Sky and Gaia (Gaea) the Earth], and the plurality of the various seeds between; and\n        thirdly an incorporeal god with golden wings on his shoulders, bulls' heads growing upon his flanks, and on his\n        head a monstrous serpent, presenting the appearance of all kinds of animal forms . . . And the third god of the\n        third triad this theology too celebrates as Protogonos (First-Born) [Phanes], and it calls him Zeus the order of\n        all and of the whole world, wherefore he is also called Pan (All). So much this second genealogy supplies\n        concerning the Intelligible principles.\"\n\nOrphica, Theogonies Fragment 57 (from Athenogoras) : \n        \"The gods, as they [the Greeks] say, did not exist from the beginning, but each of them was born just as we\n        are born.
