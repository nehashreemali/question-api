  "content": "ARISTAIOS (Aristaeus) was the only one of the Gigantes (Giants) to survive their war against the gods. He fled\n        to the island of Sikelia (Sicily) where his mother Gaia (the Earth) transformed him into a dung-beetle.\n\nHe was perhaps identified with the deity Aristaios who was sometimes\n        described as a Titan- or giant-son of Ouranos.\n\nSuidas s.v. Aristaios (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Aristaios (Aristaeus) : One of the Gigantes (Giants), who survived . . . Aristaios, the story goes, was\n        the only Gigante to survive, on the Sikelion (Sicilian) mountain called Aitne (Etna); the fire of heaven did not\n        reach him, and nor did Aitne harm him.\"\n\nSuidas s.v. Aitnaios kantharos (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Aitnaios kantharos (Dung-beetle of Etna) : The big [kind]. Because the mountain [is] also big.\n        They say that Aristaios (Aristaeus) was the only Gigante (Giant) to survive; the fire of heaven did not reach\n        him, nor did Aitna (Etna) harm him.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
