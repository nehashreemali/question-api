  "content": "TITYOS (Tityus) was an Euboian or Phokian giant who assaulted the goddess Leto as she travelling to the shrine\n        of Delphoi (Delphi). Her son Apollon quickly intervened and slew the\n        giant with a volley of arrows and the blade of his golden sword. As further punishment for his crime, Tityos was\n        staked to the ground in the underworld where two vultures were set to feed on his ever-regenerating liver.\n\nTityos' name is probably derived from the Greek word tisis meaning \"he who suffers\n        retribution.\" Alternatively he might be connected with the Tityroi, the flute-playing satyrs of Boiotian lore.\n\n[1.1] GAIA (Homer Odyssey 11.580, Virgil Aeneid\n          6.595, Dionysiaca 4.33)\n        [2.1] ELARE (Hesiod Catalogues Frag 24, Argonautica 1.758, Strabo 9.3.14)\n        [2.2] ZEUS & ELARE (Apollodorus 1.22)\n\nTI′TYUS (Tituos), a son of Gaea, or of Zeus and Elara, the daughter of Orchomenus, was a giant in Euboea,\n        and the father of Europa. (Hom. Od. vii. 324; Apollod. i. 4. § 1; Schol. ad Apollon.\n          Rhod. i. 181, 761; Pind. Pyth. iv. 81.) Instigated by Hera (Hygin. Fab. 55), he made an\n        assault upon Leto or Artemis, when she passed through Panopaeus to Pytho, but was killed by the arrows of\n        Artemis or Apollo, or, according to others, Zeus killed him with a flash of lightning. (Hygin. l.c. ;\n        Schol. ad Apollon. i. 181; Paus. iii. 18. § 9 ; Pind. Pyth. iv. 160; Horat.\n        Carm. iv. 6. § 2.) He was then cast into Tartarus, and there he lay outstretched on the ground,\n        covering nine acres, and two vultures or snakes devoured his liver. (Hygin. l.c. ; Schol. ad Pind.\n          Ol. i. 97 ; Hom. Od. xi. 576, &c.) His gigantic tomb was shown in aftertimes near Panopeus\n        (Paus. x. 4. § 4), and his fall by the arrows of Artemis and Apollo was represented on the throne of Apollo\n        at Amyclae. (Paus. iii. 18. § 9, x. 11. § 1, 29. § 2 ; comp. Strab. ix. p. 422; Virg.\n        Aen. vi. 595; Ov. Met. iv. 457, Epist. ex Pont. i. 2. 41.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Odyssey 7. 324 (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"[King Alkinoos (Alcinous) of the Phaiakes (Phaeacians) speaks :] ‘That [the Greek island of Euboia\n        (Euboea)] is the furthest point of all--so say those of our people who once set eyes on it when they carried\n        yellow-haired Rhadamanthys to visit Tityos (Tityus) son of Gaia (Gaea, the Earth).’\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 11. 576 : \n        \"[Odysseus recalls the shades of the dead he saw in the underworld :] ‘I saw Tityos (Tityus) also,\n        son of the mighty goddess Gaia (Earth); he lay on the ground, his bulk stretched out over nine roods\n        (plethra). Two vultures, one on each side of him, sat and kept plucking at his liver, reaching down to\n        the very bowels; he could not beat them off with his hands. And this was because he had once assaulted a\n        mistress of Zeus himself, the far-famed Leto, as she walked towards Pytho through the lovely spaces of\n        Panopeus.’\"\n        [N.B. The Greek plethron is a length of approximately 30 meters or 100 feet. So the nine\n        plethra giant was 270 meters or 900 feet tall.]\n\nHesiod, Catalogue of Women Frag 25 (from Herodian in Etymologicum Magnum) (trans.\n          Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.) :\n        \"Tityos (Tityus) the son of Elara.\"\n\nPindar, Pythian Ode 4 ep 2 (trans.

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Tityos (Tityus) son of Zeus and Okrhomenos' (Orchomenus') daughter Elare (Elara). After Zeus had seduced\n        Elare, in fear of Hera he hid her beneath the earth, where she gave birth to their enormous son Tityos, and led\n        him forth into the light of day.Tityos saw Leto when she came to Pytho and in a fit of passion tried to embrace\n        her. But she called out to her children, who shot him dead with arrows. He is being punished even in death, for\n        vultures feast on his heart in Hades' realm.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1. 758 ff (trans.

Tityos was lady Elare' son; but he was nursed and born by Mother Gaia (Gaea, the\n        Earth).\"\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis 109 (trans.
