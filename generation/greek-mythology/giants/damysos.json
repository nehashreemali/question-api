  "content": "DAMYSOS (Damysus) was the swiftest of the Gigantes (Giants) who waged war on the gods. The speed of his feet\n        was extracted by the kentauros Kheiron (Chiron) who implanted\n        it in the heels of Akhilleus (Achilles).\n\nHis name was probably derived from the Greek verb damazô or damasô meaning\n        \"to subdue\" or \"conquer.\" Cf. Damasen.\n\nPtolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 6 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190)\n          (trans. Pearse) (Greek mythographer C1st to C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; six were born; when she had Akhilleus\n        (Achilles), Peleus noticed and tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to Kheiron\n        (Chiron). The latter exhumed the body of the Gigante (Giant) Damysos who was buried at Pallene--Damysos was the\n        fastest of all the Gigantes--removed the astragale and incorporated it into Akhilleus' foot using\n        ‘ingredients’. This astragale fell when Akhilleus was pursued by Apollon and it was thus\n        that Akhilleus, fallen, was killed.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
