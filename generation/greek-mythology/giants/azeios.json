  "content": "AZEIOS (Azeus) was an Arkadian giant who fought in the war of the Titanes.\n        He was an ancestor of the kings of Arkadia through his son Lykon (Lycon).\n\nIt is not clear which side he supported in the war although several other Arkadian giants such as Hoplodamos, defender of Rhea, and Anytos, protector\n        of the goddess Despoine, were allies of the gods. His name was probably\n        derived from the Greek word azesios \"drought,\" or from Azania, a region of Arkadia. The local\n        Zeus, surnamed Lykaios, was conversely the god of rain.\n\nAnonymous (perhaps Pamprepius of Panopolis), Fragments (trans. Page, Vol. Select\n          Papyri III, No. 140b) (Greek poetry C4th A.D.) :\n        \"I will lift the veil from your remotest ancestry : Khthon (Chthon) [Gaia, the Earth] teemed of old and\n        bore a son Azeios (Azeus), who grew to manhood amid the mighty battles of the Titanes (Titans). Gigas (the\n        Giant) Azeios encountered a Nymphe with lover's intent, and begot Lykon (Lycon); and hero Lykon begot a fair\n        maiden Deianeira. Now Pelasgos (Pelasgus) of old went up the fair couch of Deianeira when she was growing to\n        womanhood; he was the dear son of Zeus Eleutherios (God of Freedom); and from her bed he got Lykaon (Lycaon),\n        shepherd of the land of Arkadia (Arcadia).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
