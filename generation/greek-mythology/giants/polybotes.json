  "content": "POLYBOTES was one of the Gigantes (Giants) who battled Poseidon in the war against the gods. He was pursued\n        across the sea and crushed beneath the rock of Nisyros near the island of Kos (Cos).\n\nHis name means \"fertile\" from the Greek word polybôtos or, more literally,\n        \"feeding-many\" from the words poly- and bôtos.\n\n[1.1] Blood of OURANOS & GAIA (Apollodorus 1.34)\n        [1.2] TARTAROS & GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n\nPOLYBO′TES (Polubôtês), a giant, who in the contest between the gods and giants was pursued\n        by Poseidon across the sea as far as the island of Cos. There Poseidon tore away a part of the island, which was\n        afterwards called Nisyrion, and throwing it upon the giant buried him under it.
