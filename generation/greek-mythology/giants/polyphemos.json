  "content": "POLYPHEMOS (Polyphemus) was a man-eating kyklops (cyclops) giant--a monster with a single, orb-shaped eye in\n        the middle of his forehead. Odysseus encountered him on his return from Troy and became trapped in the giant's\n        cave. To escape the hero plied him with wine and as he slept plunged a burning stake into his eye. The blinded\n        giant tried to prevent Odysseus' flight by tossing boulders at his ship but, failing that, prayed to his father\n        Poseidon to exact revenge.\n\nPolyphemos also loved the nereid-nymph Galateia and wooed her with\n        music and song. She spurned him for the love of the shepherd Akis\n          (Acis), but when the giant spied the pair together he crushed the boy beneath a stone.\n\n[1.1] POSEIDON & THOOSA\n        (Homer Odyssey 1.70, Apollodorus E7.4)\n        [1.2] POSEIDON (Philostratus Elder 2.18, Ovid\n          Metamorphoses 13.857, Hyginus Fabulae 125, Valerius Flaccus 4.104)\n\n[1.1] GALATOS (by Galateia) (Bacchylides\n          Frag 59)\n\nPOLYPHE′MUS (Poluphêmos). The celebrated Cyclops in the island of Thrinacia, was a son of Poseidon,\n        and the nymph Thoosa. In the Homeric poems the Cyclopes are a gigantic, insolent, and lawless race of shepherds,\n        who lived in the south-western part of Sicily, and devoured human beings. They neglected agriculture, and the\n        fruits of the field were reaped by them without labour. They had no laws or political institutions, and each\n        lived with his wives and children in a cave of a mountain, and ruled over them with arbitrary power. (Hom.\n        Od. vi. 5, ix. 106, &c., 190, &c., 240, &c., x. 200.) Homer does not distinctly state that\n        all of the Cyclopes were one-eyed, but Polyphemus, the principal among them, is described as having only one eye\n        on his forehead. (Od. i. 69, ix. 383, &c.) The Homeric Cyclopes are no longer the servants of Zeus,\n        but they disregard him. (Od. ix. 275; comp. Virg. Aen. vi. 636 ; Callim. Hymn. in\n          Dian. 53.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E7. 3 - 9 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"He [Odysseus] then sailed for the land of the Kyklopes (Cyclopes), and put to shore. He left the other\n        ships at the neighbouring island, took one in to the land of the Kyklopes, and went ashore with twelve\n        companions. Not far from the sea was a cave, which he entered with a flask of wine given him by Maron. It was\n        the cave of a son of Poseidon and a nymphe named Thoosa, an enormous man-eating wild man named Polyphemos\n        (Polyphemus), who had one eye in his forehead. When they had made a fire and sacrificed some kids, they sat down\n        to dine; but the Kyklops (Cyclops) came, and, after driving his flock inside, he barred the entrance with a\n        great rock. When he saw the men, he ate some.\n        Odysseus gave him some of Maron's wine to drink. He drank and demanded more, and after drinking that, asked\n        Odysseus his name. When Odysseus said that he was called Nobody, the Kyklops promised that he would eat Nobody\n        last, after the others: this was his act of friendship in return for the wine. The wine them put him to\n        sleep.\n        Odysseus found a club lying in the cave, which with the help of four comrades he sharpened to a point; he then\n        heated it in the fire and blinded the Kyklops. Polyphemos cried out for help to the neighbouring Kyklopes, who\n        came and asked who was injuring him. When he replied ‘Nobody!’ they assumed he meant no one was\n        hurting him, so they went away again. As the flock went out as usual to forage for food, he opened the cave and\n        stood at the entrance with his arms spread out, and he groped at the sheep with his hands. But Odysseus bound\n        three rams together . . . Hiding himself under the belly of the largest one, he rode out with the flock. Then he\n        untied his comrades from the sheep, drove the flock to the ship, and as they were sailing off he shouted to the\n        Kyklops that it was Odysseus who had escaped through his fingers.\n        The Kyklops had received a prophecy from a seer that he would be blinded by Odysseus, and when he now heard the\n        name, he tore loose rocks which he hurled into the sea, just missing the ship. And from that time forward\n        Poseidon was angry at Odysseus.\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 9. 110 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"[Odysseus tells the tale of his encounter with the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) :] We came to the land of the\n        Kyklopes race, arrogant lawless beings who leave their livelihoods to the deathless gods and never use their own\n        hands to sow or plough; yet with no sowing and no ploughing, the crops all grow for them--wheat and barley and\n        grapes that yield wine from ample clusters, swelled by the showers of Zeus. They have no assemblies to debate\n        in, they have no ancestral ordinances; they live in arching caves on the tops of high hills, and the head of\n        each family heeds no other, but makes his own ordinances for wife and children.\n        Outside the harbour of the country, neither very near it nor very far from it, there is a small well-wooded isle\n        . . . it remains unploughed and unsown perpetually, empty of men, only a home for bleating goats. For the\n        Kyklopes nation possess no red-prowed ships; they have no ship-wrights in their country to build sound vessels\n        to serve their needs, to visit foreign towns and townsfolk as men elsewhere do in their voyages.\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 9.187 - 542 : \n        \"[Odysseus tells the tale of his encounter with the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) :] Then we began to turn our\n        glances to the land of the Kyklopes tribe nearby; we could see smoke and hear voices and the bleating of sheep\n        and goats . . . When we reached the stretch of land I spoke of--it was not far away--there on the shore beside\n        the sea we saw a high cave overarched with bay-trees; in this flocks of sheep and goats were housed at night,\n        and round its mouth had been made a courtyard with high walls of quarried stone and with tall pines and towering\n        oaks. Here was the sleeping-place of a giant who used to pasture his flocks far afield, alone; it was not his\n        way to visit the others of his tribe; he kept aloof, and his mind was set on unrighteousness. A monstrous ogre,\n        unlike a man who had ever tasted bread, he resembled rather some shaggy peak in a mountain-range, standing out\n        clear, away from the rest.\n        Most of my men I ordered to stay by the ship and guard it, but I chose out twelve, the bravest, and sallied\n        forth . . . I had forebodings that the stranger who might face us now would wear brute strength like a garment\n        round him, a savage whose heart had little knowledge of just laws or of ordinances.\n        We came to the cavern soon enough, but we did not find him there himself; he was out on his pasture-land,\n        tending his fat sheep and goats. We went in and looked round at everything. There were flat baskets laden with\n        cheeses; there were pens filled with lambs and kids, though these were divided among themselves--here the\n        firstlings, then the later-born, and the youngest of all apart again. Then, too, there were well-made\n        dairy-vessels, large and small pails, swimming with whey . . . I was eager to see the cavern's master and hoped\n        he would offer me the gifts of a guest, though as things fell out, it was no kind host that my comrades were to\n        meet.\n        Then we lit a fire, and laying hands on some of the cheeses we first offered the gods their portion, then ate\n        our own and sat in the cavern waiting for the owner. At length he returned, guiding his flocks and carrying with\n        him a stout bundle of dry firewood to burn at supper. This, with a crash, he threw down inside, and we in dismay\n        shrank hastily back into a corner. Next, he drove part of his flocks inside--the milking ewes and milking\n        goats--but left the rams and he-goats outside in the fenced yard. Then to fill the doorway he heaved up a huge\n        heavy stone; two-and-twenty good four-wheeled wagons could not shift such a boulder from the ground, but the\n        Kyklops did, and fitted it in its place--a massive towering piece of rock. Then he sat down and began to milk\n        the ewes and the bleating goats, all in due order, and he put the young ones to their mothers. Half the milk he\n        now curdled, gathered the curd and laid it in plaited baskets. The other half he left standing in the vessels,\n        meaning to take and drink it at his supper. Having quickly despatched these tasks of his, he rekindled the fire\n        and spied ourselves.\n        He asked us : ‘Strangers, who are you? What land did you sail from, over the watery paths? Are you bound\n        on some trading errand, or are you random adventurers, roving the seas as pirates do, hazarding life and limb\n        and bringing havoc on men of another stock?’\n        So he spoke, and our hearts all sank; his thundering voice and his monstrous presence cowed us. But I plucked up\n        courage enough to answer : ‘We are Akhaians (Achaeans); we sailed from Troy and were bound for home . . .\n        We have reached your presence, have come to your knees in supplication, to receive, we hope, your friendly\n        favour, to receive perhaps some such present as custom expects from host to guest. Sir, I beg you to reverence\n        the gods. We are suppliants, and Zeus himself is the champion of suppliants and of guests; god of guests is a\n        name of his; guests are august, and Zeus goes with them.’\n        So I spoke. He answered at once and ruthlessly : ‘Stranger, you must be a fool or have come from far\n        afield if you tell me to fear the gods or beware of them. We of the Kyklopes race care nothing for Zeus and for\n        his aegis; we care for none of the gods in heaven, being much stronger ourselves than they are. Dread of the\n        enmity of Zeus would never move me to spare either you or the comrades with you, if I had no mind to it myself.\n        But tell me a thing I wish to know. When you came here, where did you moor your ship? Was it at some far point\n        of the shore or was it near here?’\n        So he spoke to me, feeling his way, but I knew the world and guessed what he was about. So I countered him with\n        crafty words : ‘My ship was shattered by Poseidon . . .’\n        To these words of mine the savage creature made no response he only sprang up, and stretching his hands towards\n        my companions clutched two at once and battered them on the floor like puppies; their brains gushed out and\n        soaked the ground. Then tearing them limb form limb he made his supper of them. He began to eat like a mountain\n        lion, leaving nothing, devouring flesh and entrails and bones and marrow, while we in our tears and helplessness\n        looked on at these monstrous doings and held up imploring hands to Zeus.\n        But when the Kyklops (Cyclops) had filled his great belly with the human flesh that he had devoured and the raw\n        milk he washed it down with he laid himself on the cavern floor with his limbs stretched out among his beasts.\n        Then with courage rising I thought at first to go up to him, to draw the keen sword from my side and stab him in\n        the chest, feeling with my hand for the spot where the midriff enfolds the liver; but second thoughts held me\n        back, because we too should have perished irremediable; never could we with all our hands have pushed away from\n        the lofty doorway the massy stone he had planted there. So with sighs and groans we awaited ethereal Dawn.\n        Dawn comes early, with rosy fingers. When she appeared, the Kyklops rekindled the fire, milked his beasts in\n        accustomed order and put the young ones to their mothers. Having quickly despatched these tasks of his, he\n        clutched another two of my comrades and made his breakfast of them. This over, he drove his flocks out of the\n        cave again, easily moving the massy stone and then putting it back once more as one might put the lid back on a\n        quiver. Whistling loud, he led off his flock to the mountain-side; so I was left there to brood mischief,\n        wondering if I might take vengeance on him and if Athene might grant me glory.\n        After all my thinking, the plan that seemed best was this. Next to the sheep-pen the Kyklops had left a great\n        cudgel of undried olive-wood, wrenched from the tree to carry with him when it was seasoned. As we looked at it,\n        it seemed huge enough to be the mast of some great dark merchant-ship with its twenty oars . . . so long and so\n        thick it loomed before us. I stood over this, and myself and cut off six feet of it; then I laid it in front of\n        my companions and told them to make it smooth; smooth they made it, and again I stood over it and sharpened it\n        to a point, then took it at once and put it in the fierce fire to harden. Then I laid it in a place of safety;\n        there was dung in layers all down the great cave, and I hid the stake under this. I asked the men to cast lots\n        for joining me--who would help me to lift the stake and plunge it into the giant's eye as soon as slumber stole\n        upon him? The men that the lots fell upon were the very ones I should have chosen--four of them, and I made a\n        fifth.\n        Towards nightfall the Kyklops came home again, bringing his fleecy flocks with him. He drove all the beasts into\n        the cave forthwith, leaving none outside in the fenced courtyard--had he some foreboding, or was it a god who\n        directed him? He lifted the massy door-stone and put it in place again; he sat down and began to milk the sheep\n        and the bleating goats, all in accustomed order, and he put the young ones to their mothers. Having quickly\n        despatched these tasks of his, he clutched another two of my comrades and made his meal of them. And at that I\n        came close to the Kyklops and spoke to him, while in my hands I held up an ivy-bowl brimmed with dark wine :\n        ‘Kyklops, look! You have had your fill of man's flesh. Now drain this bowl and judge what wine our ship\n        had in it. I was bringing it for yourself as a libation, hoping you would take pity on me and would help to send\n        me home. But your wild folly is past all bounds. Merciless one, who of all men in all the world will choose to\n        visit you after this? In what you have done you defy whatever is good and right.’\n        Such were my words. He took my present and drank it off and was mightily pleased with wine so fragrant. Then he\n        asked for a second bowlful of it : ‘Give me more in your courtesy and tell me your name here and now--I\n        wish to offer you as my guest a special favour that will delight you. Earth is bounteous, and for my people too\n        it brings forth grapes that thrive on the rain of Zeus and that make good wine, but this is distilled from\n        nectar and ambrosia.’\n        So he spoke, and again I offered the glowing wine; three times I walked up to him with it; three times he\n        witlessly drank it off. When the wine had coiled its way round his understanding, I spoke to him in\n        meek-sounding words : ‘Kyklops, you ask what name I boast of. I will tell you, and then you must grant me\n        as your guest the favour that you have promised me. My name is Noman; Noman is what my mother and father call\n        me; so likewise do all my friends.’\n        To these words of mine the savage creature made quick response : ‘Noman that one shall come last among\n        those I eat; his friends I will eat first; this is to be my favour to you.’\n        With these words he sank down on the floor, then lay on his back with his heavy neck drooping sideways, till\n        sleep the all-conquering overcame him; wine and gobbets of human flesh gushed from his throat as he belched them\n        forth in drunken stupor. Then I drove our stake down into the heap of embers to get red-hot; meanwhile I spoke\n        words of courage to all my comrades, so that none of them should lose heart and shrink from the task. But when\n        the stake, green though it was, was about to catch fire and glowed frighteningly, I drew it towards me out of\n        the fire, while the others took their stand around me. Some god breathed high courage into us. My men took over\n        the keen-pointed olive stake and thrust it into the giant's eye; I myself leaned heavily over from above and\n        twirled the stake round . . . We grasped the stake with its fiery tip and whirled it round in the giant's eye.\n        The blood came gushing out round the red-hot wood; the heat singed eyebrow and eyelid, the eyeball was burned\n        out and the roots of the eye hissed in the fire . . . His eye hissed now with the olive-stake penetrating it. He\n        gave a great hideous roar; the cave re-echoed, and in terror we rushed away. He pulled the blood-stained stake\n        from his eye and with frantic arms tossed it away from him.\n        Then he shouted loud to he Kyklopes kinsmen who lived around him in their caverns among the windy hill-tops.\n        Hearing his cries they hastened towards him from every quarter, stood round his cavern and asked him what ailed\n        him : ‘Polyphemos, what dire affliction has come upon you to make you profane the night with clamour and\n        rob us of our slumbers? Is some human creature driving away your flocks in defiance of you? Is someone\n        threatening death to yourself by craft of by violence?’\n        From inside the cave the giant answered : ‘Friends, it is Noman's craft and no violence that is\n        threatening death to me.’\n        Swiftly their words were borne back to him : ‘If no man is doing you violence--if you are alone--then this\n        is a malady sent by almighty Zeus from which there is no escape; you had best say a prayer to your father, Lord\n        Poseidon.’\n        With these words they left him again, while my own heart laughed within me to think how the name I gave and my\n        ready with had snared him. Racked with anguish, lamenting loudly, the Kyklops groped for the great stone and\n        pushed it from the door-way, then in the doorway he seated himself with outstretched hands, hoping to seize on\n        some of us passing into the open among the sheep--so witless did he take me to be . . . There were big handsome\n        rams there, well-fed, thick-fleeced and with dark wool. Making no noise, I began fastening them together with\n        plaited withies, the same that the lawless monstrous ogre slept on. I took the rams three by three; each middle\n        one carried a man, while the other two walked either side and safeguarded my companions; so there were three\n        beats to each man. As for myself--there was one ram that was finest of all the flock; I seized his back, I\n        curled myself up under his shaggy belly, and there I clung in the rich soft wool, face upwards, desperately\n        holding on and on. In this dismal fashion we waited now for ethereal Dawn.\n        Dawn comes early, with rosy fingers. When she appeared, the rams began running out to pasture, while the\n        unmilked ewes around the pens kept bleating with udders full to bursting. Their master, consumed with hideous\n        pains, felt along the backs of all the rams as they stood still in front of him. The witless giant never found\n        out that men were tied under the fleecy creatures' bellies. Last of them all came my own ram on his way out,\n        burdened both with his own thick wool and with me the schemer. Polyphemos felt him over too and began to talk to\n        him : ‘You that I love best, why are you last of all the flock to come out through the cavern's mouth?\n        Never till now have you come behind the rest : before them all you have marched with stately strides ahead to\n        crop the delicate meadow-flowers, before them all you have reached the rippling streams, before them all you\n        have shown your will to return homewards in the evening; yet now you come last. You are grieving, surely, over\n        your master's eye, which malicious Noman quite put out, with his evil friends, after overmastering my wits with\n        wine; but I swear he has still not escaped destruction. If only your thoughts were like my own, if only you had\n        the gift of words to tell me where he is hiding from my fury! Then he would be hurled to the ground and his\n        brains dashed hither and thither across the cave; then my heart would find some relief from the tribulations he\n        has brought me, unmanly Noman!’\n        So speaking, he let the ram go free outside. As for ourselves, once we had passed a little way beyond cave and\n        courtyard, I first loosed my own hold beneath the ram, then I untied my comrades also. We herded the many sheep\n        in haste--fat plump creatures with long shanks--and drove them on till we reached our vessel . . . \n        But when we were no further away [out at sea] than a man's voice, I called to the Kyklopes and taunted him :\n        ‘Kyklops, your prisoner after all was to prove not quite defenceless--the man whose friends you devoured\n        so brutally in your cave. No, your sins were to find you out. You felt no shame to devour your guests in your\n        own home; hence the requital from Zeus and the other gods.’\n        Rage rose up in him at my words. He wrenched away the top of a towering crag and hurled it in front of our\n        dark-prowed ship. The sea surged up as the rock fell into it; the swell from beyond came washing back at once\n        and the wave carried the ship landwards and drove it towards the strand. But I myself seized a long pole and\n        pushed the ship out and away again, moving my head and signing to my companions urgently to pull at their oars\n        and escape destruction; so they threw themselves forward and rowed hard. But when we were twice as far out on\n        the water as before, I made ready to hail the Kyklops again, though my friends around me, this side and that,\n        used all persuasion to restrain me : ‘Headstrong man, why need you provoke this savage further? The stone\n        he threw out to sea just now dashed the ship back to the shore again, and we thought we were dead men already.\n        Had he heard any sound, any words from us, he would have hurled yet another jagged rock and shattered our heads\n        and the boat's timbers, so vast his reach is.’\n        So they spoke, but my heart was proud and would not be gain-said; I called out again with rage still rankling :\n        ‘Kyklops, if anyone among mortal men should ask who put out your eye in this ugly fashion, say that the\n        one who blinded you was Odysseus the city-sacker, son of Laertes and dweller in Ithaka (Ithaca).’\n        So I spoke. He groaned aloud as he answered me : ‘Ah, it comes home to me at last, that oracle uttered\n        long ago. We once had a prophet in our country, a truly great man called Telemos (Telemus) son of Eurymos,\n        skilled in divining, living among the Kyklopes race as an aged seer. He told me all this as a thing that would\n        later come to pass--that I was to lose my sight at the hands of one Odysseus. But I always thought that the man\n        who came would be tall and handsome, visibly clothed with heroic strength; instead, it has been a puny and\n        strengthless and despicable man who had taken my sight away from me after overpowering me with wine. But come,\n        Odysseus, return to me; let me set before you the presents that befit a guest, and appeal to the mighty\n        Earthshaker [Poseidon] to speed you upon your way, because I am his son, and he declares himself my father. And\n        he alone will heal me, if so he pleases--no other will, of the blessed gods or of mortal men.’\n        So he spoke, but I answered thus : ‘Would that I were assured as firmly that I could rob you of life and\n        being and send you down to Hades' house as I am assured that no one shall heal that eye of yours, not the\n        Earthshaker himself.’\n        So I spoke, and forthwith he prayed to Lord Poseidon, stretching out his hands to the starry sky :\n        ‘Poseidon the raven-haired, Earth-Enfolder: if indeed I am your son, if indeed you declare yourself my\n        father, grant that Odysseus the city-sacker may never return home again; or if he is fated to see his kith and\n        kin and so reach his high-roofed house and his own country, let him come late and come in misery, after the loss\n        of all his comrades, and carried upon an alien ship; and in his own house let him find mischief.’\n        This was his prayer, and the raven-haired god heeded it. Then the Kyklops lifted up a stone (it was much larger\n        than the first); he whirled it and flung it, putting vast strength into the throw; the stone came down a little\n        astern of the dark-prowed vessel, just short of the tip of the steering-oar. The sea surged up as the stone fell\n        into it, but the wave carried the ship forward and drove it on to the shore beyond.\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 1. 68 ff : \n        \"Poseidon the Earth-Sustainer is stubborn still in his anger against Odysseus because of his blinding of\n        Polyphemos (Polyphemus), the Kyklops (Cyclops) whose power is greatest among the Kyklopes race and whose\n        ancestry is more than human; his mother was the nymph Thoosa, child of Phorkys (Phorcys) the lord of the barren\n        sea, and she lay with Poseidon within her arching caverns.

Trypanis) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"How excellent was the charm that Polyphemos discovered for the lover. By Gaia (Gaea, the Earth), the\n        Kyklops (Cyclops) was no fool! The Mousai (Muses), O Phillippos, reduce the swollen wound of love. Surely the\n        poet's skill is sovereign remedy for all ill.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 18 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting in Neapolis (Naples) :] These men harvesting the\n        fields and gathering the grapes, my boy, neither ploughed the land nor planted the vines; but of its own accord\n        the earth sends forth these its fruits for them; they are in truth Kyklopes (Cyclopes), for whom, I know not\n        why, the poets will that the earth shall produce its fruits spontaneously. And the earth has also made a\n        shepherd-folk of them by feeding the blocks, whose milk they regard as both drink and meat. They know neither\n        assembly nor council nor yet houses, but they inhabit the clefts of the mountain.\n        Not to mention the others, Polyphemos son of Poseidon, the fiercest of them, lives here; he has a single eyebrow\n        extending above his single eye and a broad nose astride his upper lip, and he feeds upon men after the manner of\n        savage lions. But at the present time he abstains from such food that he may not appear gluttonous or\n        disagreeable; for he loves Galateia, who is sporting here on the sea, and he watches her from the mountain-side.\n        And though his shepherd's pipe is still under his arm and silent, yet he has a pastoral song to sing that tells\n        how white she is and skittish and sweeter than unripe grapes, and how he is raising for Galateia fawns and\n        bear-cubs. All this he sings beneath an evergreen oak, heeding not where his flocks are feeding nor their number\n        nor even, any longer, where the earth is. He is painted a creature of the mountains, fearful to look at, tossing\n        his hair, which stands erect and is as dense as the foliage of a pine tree, showing a set of jagged teeth in his\n        voracious jaw, shaggy all over--breast and belly and limbs even to the nails. He thinks, because he is in love,\n        that his glance is gentle, but it is wild and stealthy still, like that of wild beasts subdued under the force\n        of necessity.\n        The Nymphe sports on the peaceful sea, driving a team of four dolphins yoked together and working in\n        harmony.\"\n\nAthenaeus, Deipnosophistae 1. 6e - 7a (trans. Gullick) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to\n          C3rd A.D.) :\n        \"[On the origin of the story of Polyphemos and Galateia :] Phainias says that Philoxenos, the poet of\n        Kythera [C5th B.C.] . . . was writing a poem on Galateia [the mistress of the tyrant Dionysios and her namesake\n        the Nereid] . . . . [but] when Philoxenos was detected in the act of seducing the king's mistress Galateia, he\n        was thrown into the quarries. There he wrote his Kyklops, telling the story of what happened to him,\n        and representing Dionysios as Kyklops (Cyclops), the flute-girl as the Nymphe Galateia, and himself as\n        Odysseus.\"\n\nAelian, Historical Miscellany 12. 44 (trans. Wilson) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to 3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The Sicilian quarries were at Epipolai . . .

Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Galatea letting Scylla [i.e. before she was transformed into a monster] comb her hair, heaved a deep sigh\n        and said, ‘My dear, your suitors after all are men and not unkind: you can reject them, as you do,\n        unscathed. But I whom sea-blue Doris bore, whose father's Nereus, who am safe besides among my school of\n        sisters, I could not foil Cyclops' love except in bitter grief.'\n        Tears choked her as she told it. Scylla wiped the tears with sleek white fingers, comforting the goddess :\n        ‘Tell me, darling. Do not hide (you know you trust me) how you were so hurt.’\n        And Nereis [Galateia] answered with these words : ‘Acis was son of Nympha Symaethis and Faunus [Pan] was\n        his father, a great joy to both his parents, and a greater joy to me; for me, and me alone, he loved. He was\n        sixteen, the down upon his cheek scarce yet a beard, and he was beautiful. He was my love, but I was Cyclops'\n        love, who wooed me endlessly and, if you ask whether my hate for him or my love for Acis was stronger in my\n        heart, I could not tell; for both were equal. Oh, how powerful kind Venus [Aphrodite], is thy reign!\n        ‘That savage creature, the forest's terror, whom no wayfarer set eyes upon unscathed, who scorned the gods\n        of great Olympos, now felt pangs of love, burnt with a mighty passion, and forgot his flocks and cares. Now\n        lovelorn Polyphemus cared for his looks, cared earnestly to please; now with a rake he combed his matted hair,\n        and with a sickle trimmed his shaggy beard, and studied his fierce features in a pool and practised to compose\n        them. His wild urge to kill, his fierceness and his lust for blood ceased and in safety ships might come and\n        go.\n        ‘Meanwhile a famous seer had sailed to Sicilian Aetna (Etna), wise Telemus Eurymides (Son of Eurymus),\n        whom no bird could delude, and warned the dreadful giant \"That one eye upon your brow Ulixes soon shall\n        take.\" He answered laughing \"You delude yourself! Of all the stupid prophets! Someone else has taken\n        it already.\" So he mocked the warning truth; then tramped along the shore with giant crushing strides or,\n        tired anon, returned to the dark cave that was his home.\n        ‘There juts into the sea a wedge-shaped point, washed by the ocean waves on either side. Here Cyclops\n        climbed and at the top sat down, his sheep untended trailing after him. Before him at his feet he laid his\n        staff, a pine, fit for the mainmast of a ship, and took his pipe, made of a hundred reeds. His pastoral whistles\n        rang among the cliffs and over the waves; and I behind a rock, hidden and lying in my Acis' arms, heard far away\n        these words and marked them well. \"Fair Galatea, whiter than the snow, taller than alders, flowerier than\n        the meads, brighter than crystal, livelier than a kid, sleeker than shells worn by the ceaseless waves, gladder\n        than the winter's sun and summer's shade, nobler than apples, sweeter than ripe grapes, fairer than lofty\n        planes, clearer than ice, softer than down of swans or creamy cheese, and, would you welcome me, more beautiful\n        than fertile gardens watered by cool streams. Yet, Galatea, fiercer than wild bulls, harder than ancient oak,\n        falser than waves, tougher than willow wands or branching vines, wilder than torrents, firmer than these rocks,\n        prouder than peacocks, crueller than fire, sharper than briars, deafer than the sea, more savage than a bear\n        guarding her cubs, more pitiless than snakes beneath the heel, and--what above all else I'd wrest from\n        you--swifter in flight than ever hind that flees the baying hounds, yes, swifter than the wind and all the\n        racing breezes of the sky. (Though, if you knew, you would repent your flight, condemn you coyness, strive to\n        hold me fast.) Deep in the mountain I have hanging caves of living rock where never summer suns are felt nor\n        winter's cold. Apples I have loading the boughs, and I have golden grapes and purple in my vineyards--all for\n        you. Your hands shall gather luscious strawberries in woodland shade; in autumn you shall pick cherries and\n        plums, not only dusky black, but yellow fat and waxen in the sun, and chestnuts shall be yours, if I am yours,\n        and every tree shall bear its fruit for you. All this fine flock is mine, and many more roam in the dales or\n        shelter in the woods or in my caves are folded; should you chance to ask how many, that I could not tell: a poor\n        man counts his flocks. Nor need you trust my praises; here before your eyes you see their legs can scarce\n        support the bulging udders. And I have younger stock, lambs in warm folds, and kids of equal age in other folds,\n        and snowy milk always, some kept to drink and some the rennet curdles into cheese. No easy gifts or commonplace\n        delights shall be your portion--does and goats and hares, a pair of doves, a gull's nest from the cliff. I found\n        one day among the mountain peaks, for you to play with, twins so much alike you scarce could tell, cubs of a\n        shaggy bear. I found them and I said \"She shall have all these; I'll keep them for my mistress for her own.\n        Now, Galatea, raise your glorious head from the blue sea; spurn not my gifts, but come! For sure I know--I have\n        just seen--myself reflected in a pool, and what I saw was truly pleasing. See how large I am! No bigger body\n        Juppiter [Zeus] himself can boast up in the sky--you always talk of Jove [Zeus] or someone reigning there. My\n        ample hair o'erhangs my grave stern face and like a grove darkens my shoulders; and you must not think me ugly,\n        that my body is so thick with prickly bristles. Trees without their leaves are ugly, and a horse is ugly too\n        without a mane to veil its sorrel neck. Feathers clothe birds and fleeces grace the sheep: so beard and bristles\n        best become a man. Upon my brow I have one single eye, but it is huge, like some vast shield. What then? Does\n        not the mighty sun see from the sky all things on earth? Yet the sun's orb is one. Moreover in your sea my\n        father [Poseidon] reigns; him I give you--my father, yours to be, would you but pity me and hear my prayer. To\n        you alone I yield. I, who despise Jove [Zeus] and his heaven and his thunderbolt, sweet Nereis, you I fear, your\n        anger flames more dreadful than his bolt. Oh, I could bear your scorn more patiently did you but spurn all\n        others, but, if Cyclops you reject, why prefer Acis, Acis' arms to mine? Acis may please himself and please,\n        alas, you Galatea. Give me but the chance, he'll find my strength no smaller than my size. I'll gouge his living\n        guts, I'll rend his limbs and strew them in the fields and in the sea--your sea, so may he be one flesh with\n        you! I burn! The fire you fight is fanned to flame; all Aetne's furnace in my breast I bear, and you, my\n        Galatea, never care!\"\n        ‘Such was his vain lament; then up he rose (I saw it all) as a fierce thwarted bull roams through the\n        woodlands and familiar fields, and, spying in his rage Acis and me, all unaware and fearing no such fate,\n        shouted \"I see you; now I shall make sure that loving fond embrace shall be your last.\" Loud as an\n        angry Cyclops ought to shout he shouted; Aetna shuddered at the din. Then I in panic dived into the sea beside\n        us; Acis had already turned his hero's back and shouted as he fled \"Help, Galatea! Father, mother, help!\n        Admit me to your kingdom for I die.\" Cyclops pursued and hurled a massive rock, torn from the hill, and\n        though its merest tip reached Acis, yet it crushed and smothered him. But I (it was all fate permitted me)\n        caused Acis to assume his ancestral powers [i.e. the youth was transformed into a river.] . . .’\n        So Galatea ended and the group of Nereides dispersed and swam away across the placid waters of the bay.\"\n\nPropertius, Elegies 3. 2 (trans.
