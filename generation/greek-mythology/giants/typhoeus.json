  "content": "TYPHOEUS (Typhon) was a monstrous storm-giant who laid siege to heaven but was defeated by Zeus and imprisoned\n        in the pit of Tartaros. He was the source of devastating storms which\n        issued forth from that dark nether-realm. Later poets describe him as a volcano-giant, trapped beneath the\n        weight of Mount Aitna (Etna) in Sicily. In this guise he was identified with the giant Enkelados (Enceladus).\n\nTyphoeus was a winged giant, said to be so huge that his head brushed the stars. He was man-shaped from the\n        waist up with two coiled serpents in place of legs. He had a hundred serpent-heads for fingers, a filthy, matted\n        beard, pointed ears, and eyes flashing fire.\n        According to some he had two hundred hands consisting of fifty serpent-headed fingers on each hands and a\n        hundred heads proper--one was human, the other ninety-nine bestial (of bulls, boars, serpents, lions and\n        leopards). As a volcano-demon Typhoeus hurled red-hot rocks at heaven and fire boiled forth from his mouth.\n\n[1.1] TARTAROS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 820, Apollodorus 1.39, Hyginus Pref)\n        [1.2] GAIA (Aeschylus Prometheus 353, Aeschylus\n          Seven Against Thebes 516, Antoninus Liberalis 28, Ovid Metamorphoses 5.324, Virgil Georgics 1.276, Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 1.145)\n        [1.3] TARTAROS & TARTARA (Hyginus\n          Faulaeb 152)\n        [2.1] HERA (Homeric Hymns 3.300, Stesichorus Frag\n          239)\n\n[1.1] ORTHOS, KERBEROS, HYDRA, KHIMAIRA (by Ekhidna) (Hesiod Theogony 306)\n        [1.2] KHIMAIRA, NEMEIAN LION, ORTHOS, LADON, KAUKASIAN EAGLE, SPHINX, PHAIA (by Ekhidna) (Apollodorus 2.31 & 2.74 & 2.106 & 2.113 & 2.119 & 3.52 &\n          E1.1)\n        [1.3] KHIMAIRA (by Ekhidna)\n        (Homeric Hymn 3.365)\n        [1.4] KHOLKIAN DRAKON (by Gaia)\n        (Apollonius Rhodius 2.1210)\n        [1.5] KERBEROS, ORTHOS (by Ekhidna) (Quintus Smyrnaeus\n          6.260)\n        [1.6] GORGO, KERBEROS, KHOLKIAN DRAKON, SKYLLA, KHIMAIRA, SPHINX, HYDRA, HESPERIAN DRAKON (by Ekhidna) (Hyginus Pref & Fabulae\n          151)\n        [1.7] THE DRAKONES TROIADES (Quintus\n          Smyrnaeus 12.444)\n        [2.1] THE ANEMOI THUELLAI (Hesiod Theogony\n          869)\n        [2.2] THE HARPYIAI (Valerius Flaccus\n          4.514)\n\nTYPHON or TYPHOEUS (Tuphaôn, Tuphôeus, Tuphôs), a monster of the primitive world, is\n        described sometimes as a destructive hurricane, and sometimes as a fire-breathing giant. According to Homer\n        (Il. ii. 782; comp. Strab. xiii. p. 929) he was concealed in the country of the Arimi in the earth,\n        which was lashed by Zeus with flashes of lightning. In Hesiod Typhaon and Typhoeus are two distinct beings.\n        Typhaon there is a son of Typhoeus (Theog. 869), and a fearful hurricane, who by Echidna became the\n        father of the dog Orthus, Cerberus, the Lernaean hydra, Chimaera, and the Sphynx. (Theog. 306; comp.\n        Apollod. ii. 3. § 1, iii. 5. § 8.) Notwithstanding the confusion of the two beings in later writers,\n        the original meaning of Typhaon was preserved in ordinary life. (Aristoph. Ran. 845; Plin. H.\n          N. ii. 48.) Typhoeus, on the other hand, is described as the youngest son of Tartarus and Gaea, or of\n        Hera alone, because she was indignant at Zeus having given birth to Athena. Typhoeus is described as a monster\n        with a hundred heads, fearful eyes, and terrible voices (Pind. Pyth. i. 31, viii. 21, Ol. iv.\n        12); he wanted to acquire the sovereignty of gods and men, but was subdued, after a fearful struggle, by Zeus,\n        with a thunderbolt. (Hes. Theog. 821, &c.) He begot the winds, whence he is also called the father\n        of the Harpies (Val. Flacc. iv. 428), but the beneficent winds Notus, Boreas, Argestes, and Zephyrus, were not\n        his sons. (Hes. Theog. 869, &c.) Aeschylus and Pindar describe him as living in a Cilician cave.\n        (Pind. Pyth. viii. 21; comp. the different ideas in Apollon. Rhod. ii. 1210, &c., and Herod. iii.\n        5.) He is further said to have at one time been engaged in a struggle with all the immortals, and to have been\n        killed by Zeus with a flash of lightning; he was buried in Tartarus under Mount Aetna, the workshop of\n        Hephaestus. (Ov. Her. xv. 11, Fast. iv. 491; Aeschyl. Prom. 351, &c.; Pind.\n        Pyth. i. 29, &c.) The later poets frequently connect Typhoeus with Egypt, and the gods, it is said,\n        when unable to hold out against him, fled to Egypt, where, from fear, they metamorphosed themselves into\n        animals, with the exception of Zeus and Athena. (Anton. Lib. 28 ; Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 28; Ov.\n        Met. v. 321, &c. ; comp. Apollod. i. 6. § 3; Ov. Fast. ii. 461; Horat. Carm.\n        iii. 4. 53.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 820 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Now after Zeus had driven the Titanes (Titans) out of heaven, gigantic Gaia (Gaea, the Earth), in love\n        with Tartaros (the Pit), by means of golden Aphrodite, bore the youngest of her children, Typhoeus.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 3 to Pythian Apollo 300 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th\n          B.C.) :\n        \"She [Ekhidna (Echidna) the drakaina (she-dragon) of Delphoi (Delphi)] it was who once received from\n        gold-throned Hera and brought up fell, cruel Typhaon to be a plague to men. Once on a time Hera bare him because\n        she was angry with father Zeus, when Kronides (Cronides) bare all-glorious Athene in his head. Thereupon queenly\n        Hera was angry and spoke among the assembled gods : ‘. . . Yes, now I will contrive that a son be born me\n        to be foremost among the undying gods--and that without casting shame on the holy bond of wedlock between you\n        and me. And I will not come to your bed, but will consort with the blessed gods far off from you.’\n        When she had so spoken, she went apart from the gods, being very angry. Then straightway large-eyed queenly Hera\n        prayed, striking the ground flatwise with her hand, and speaking thus : ‘Hear now, I pray, Gaia (Gaea,\n        Earth) and wide Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) above, and you Titanes (Titans) gods who dwell beneath the earth about\n        great Tartaros (the Pit), and from whom are sprung both gods and men! Harken you now to me, one and all, and\n        grant that I may bear a child apart from Zeus, no wit lesser than him in strength--nay, let him be as much\n        stronger than Zeus as all-seeing Zeus than Kronos.’\n        Thus she cried and lashed the earth with her strong hand. Then life-giving Gaia (Earth) was moved: and when Hera\n        saw it she was glad in heart, for she thought her prayer would be fulfilled. And thereafter she never came to\n        the bed of wise Zeus for a full year . . . But when the months and days were fulfilled and the seasons duly came\n        on as the earth moved round, she bare one neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a\n        plague to men. Straightway large-eyed queenly Hera took him and bringing one evil thing to another such, gave\n        him to the Drakaina (Dracaena); and she received him. And this Typhaon used to work great mischief among the\n        famous tribes of men.\"\n\nPindar, Pythian Ode 1. 16 ff (trans.

Then, when Zeus had put him down with his strokes, Typhoeus crashed, crippled, and the gigantic\n        earth groaned beneath him, and the flame from the great lord so thunder-smitten ran out along the darkening and\n        steep forests of the mountains as he was struck, and a great part of the gigantic earth burned in the wonderful\n        wind of his heat, and melted, as tin melts in the heat of the carefully grooved crucible when craftsmen work it,\n        or as iron, though that is the strongest substance, melts under stress of blazing fire in the mountain forests\n        worked by handicraft of Hephaistos (Hephaestus) inside the divine earth.

The symbol-maker who put the design on\n        his shield was no lowly craftsman: the symbol is Typhon, spitting out of his fire-breathing mouth a dark, thick\n        smoke, the darting sister of fire. And the rim of the hollow-bellied shield is fastened all around with snaky\n        braids . . .

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The defeat of the Gigantes (Giants) by the gods angered Ge (Gaea, the Earth) all the more, so she had\n        intercourse with Tartaros and bore Typhon in Kilikia (Cilicia). He was a mixture of man and beast, the largest\n        and strongest of all Ge's children. Down to the thighs he was human in form, so large that he extended beyond\n        all the mountains while his head often touched even the stars. One hand reached to the west, the other to the\n        east, and attached to these were one hundred heads of serpents. Also from the thighs down he had great coils of\n        vipers, which extended to the top of his head and hissed mightily. All of his body was winged, and the hair that\n        flowed in the wind from his head and cheeks was matted and dirty. In his eyes flashed fire. Such were the\n        appearance and the size of Typhon as he hurled red-hot rocks at the sky itself, and set out for it with mixed\n        hisses and shouts, as a great storm of fire boiled forth from his mouth.\n        When the gods saw him rushing toward the sky, they headed for Aigyptos (Egypt) to escape him, and as he pursued\n        them they changed themselves into animal shapes. But Zeus from a distance hurled thunderbolts at Typhon, and\n        when he had drawn closer Zeus tried to strike him down with a sickle made of adamant. Typhon took flight, but\n        Zeus stayed on his heels right up to Mount Kasion (Casium), which lies in Syria. Seeing that he was badly\n        wounded, Zeus fell on him with his hands. But Typhon entwined the god and held him fast in his coils, and\n        grabbing the sickle he cut out the sinews from Zeus' hands and feet. Then, placing Zeus up on his shoulders, he\n        carried him across the sea to Kilikia (Cilicia), where he deposited him in the Korykion (Corycian) cave. He also\n        hid away the sinews there in the skin of a bear, and posted as guard over them the Drakaina (Dracaena) Delphyne,\n        a girl who was half animal. But Hermes and Aigipan (Aegipan) stole back the sinews and succeeded in replanting\n        them in Zeus without being seen. So Zeus, again possessed of his strength, suddenly appeared from the sky in a\n        chariot drawn by winged horses, and with thunderbolts chased Typhon to the mountain called Nysa. There the\n        Moirai (Moirae, Fates) deceived the pursued creature, for he ate some of the ephemeral fruit on Nysa [i.e. the\n        intoxicating grape of Dionysos] after they had persuaded him that he would gain strength from it. Again pursued,\n        he made his way to Thrake (Thrace), where while fighting round Haimos (Haemus) he threw whole mountains at Zeus.\n        But when these were pushed back upon him by the thunderbolt, a great quantity of his blood streamed out on the\n        mountain, which allegedly is why the mountain is called Haimos. Then, as Typhon started to flee again through\n        the Sikelian (Sicilian) Sea, Zeus brought down Sikelia's Mount Aitna (Etna) on him , a great mountain which they\n        say still erupts fire from the thunderbolts thrown by Zeus.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 1206 ff (trans.

And they add that the place is\n        woody and subject to strokes of lightning, and that the Arimoi live there, for after Homer's verse, ‘in\n        the land of the Arimoi where men say is the couch of Typhon,’ they insert the words, ‘in a wooded\n        place, in the fertile land of Hyde.’\n        But others lay the scene of this myth in Kilikia (Cilicia), and some lay it in Syria, and still others in the\n        Pithekoussai (Pithecussae) Islands [small volcanic islands off the coast of Italy], who say that among the\n        Tyrrhenians pithekoi (apes) are called arimoi. Some call Sardeis Hyde, while others call its\n        acropolis Hyde. But the Skepsian thinks that those writers are most plausible who place the Arimoi in the\n        Katakekaumene (Catacecaumene, Burnt Up) country in Mysia. But Pindaros (Pindar) associates the Pithekoussai\n        which lie off the Kymaian (Cumaean) territory, as also the territory in Sikelia (Sicily), with the territory in\n        Kilikia (Cilicia), for he says that Typhon lies beneath Aitna (Mount Etna) : ‘Once he dwelt in a far-famed\n        Kilikian cavern; now, however, his shaggy breast is o'er-pressed by the sea-girt shores above Kymai (Cumae) and\n        by Sikelia (Sicily).’ And again, ‘round about him lies Aitna (Etna) with her haughty fetters,’\n        and again, ‘but it was father Zeus that once amongst the Arimoi, by necessity, alone of the gods, smote\n        monstrous Typhon of the fifty heads.’\n        But some understand that the Syrians are Arimoi, who are now called the Arimaians, and that the Kilikians\n        (Cilicians) in Troy, forced to migrate, settled again in Syria and cut off for themselves what is now called\n        Kilikia.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 12. 7. 19 : \n        \"In fact they make this [the volcanic plains of Lydia] the setting of the mythical story of the Arimoi and\n        of the throes of Typhon, calling it the Katakekaumene (Catacecaumene, the Burnt Up) country. Also, they do not\n        hesitate to suspect that the parts of the country between the Maiandros (Meander) River and the Lydians are all\n        of this nature, as well on account of the number of the lakes and rivers as on account of the numerous hollows\n        in the earth. And the lake between Laodikeia (Laodicea) and Apameia, although like a sea, emits an eflluvium\n        that is filthy and of subterranean origin.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 13. 4. 11 ff : \n        \"The Katakekaumene (Catacecaumene, Burnt Up) country [of Lydia or Mysia], as it is called, which has a\n        length of five hundred stadia and a breadth of four hundred, whether it should be called Mysia or Meïonia\n        (for both names are used); the whole of it is without trees except the vine that produces the Katakekaumenite\n        wine, which in quality is inferior to none of the notable wines. The surface of the plain is covered with ashes,\n        and the mountainous and rocky country is black, as though from conflagration. Now some conjecture that this\n        resulted from thunderbolts and from fiery subterranean outbursts, and they do not hesitate to lay there the\n        scene of the mythical story of Typhon . . . but it is not reasonable to suppose that all that country was burnt\n        all at once by reason of such disturbances, but rather by reason of an earth-born fire, the sources of which\n        have now been exhausted. Three pits are to be seen there, which are called ‘bellows’, and they are\n        forty stadia distant from each other. Above them lie rugged hills, which are reasonably supposed to have been\n        heaped up by the hot masses blown forth from the earth. That such soil should be well adapted to the vine one\n        might assume from the land of Katana (Catana), which was heaped with ashes and now produces excellent wine in\n        great plenty.\"\n\nAccording to some, Typhoeus was buried beneath the Serbonian Bog (now Sabkhat al Bardawil) in Egypt.

Hence, also\n        the myth, according to which Typhon lies beneath this island, and when he turns his body the flames and the\n        waters, and sometimes even small islands containing boiling water, spout forth, But what Pindaros (Pindar) says\n        is more plausible, since he starts with the actual phenomena; for this whole channel, beginning at the Kaumaian\n        (Cumaean) country and extending as far as Sikelia (Sicily), is full of fire, and has caverns deep down in the\n        earth that form a single whole, connecting not only with one another but also with the mainland; and therefore,\n        not only Aitna (Etna) clearly ahs such a character as it is reported by all to have, but also the Liparoi\n        (Liparian) Islands, and the districts around about Dikaiarkheia, Neapolis (Naples), and Baia (Baeae), and the\n        island of Pithekoussai.

The\n        painting, following the accounts given by the poets, goes farther and ascribes a myth to the island. A Gigante\n        (Giant), namely, was once struck down there, and upon his as he struggled in the death agony the island was\n        placed as a bond to hold him down, and he doest not yet yield but from beneath the earth renews the fight and\n        breathes forth this fire as he utters threats.

And\n        you, yourself, my boy, will imagine that you have not been left out of the contest, when you look at the peak of\n        the mountain; for what you see there are thunderbolts which Zeus is hurling at the Gigante, and the giant is\n        already giving up the struggle but still trusts in the earth, but the earth (gê) has grown weary\n        because Poseidon does not permit her to remain in place.
