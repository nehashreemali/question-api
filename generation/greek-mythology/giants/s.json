  "content": "THE GIGANTES were a tribe of a hundred giants born of the earth-goddess Gaia. According to some she was\n        impregnated by the blood of the castrated sky-god Ouranos (Uranus).\n\nAt the urging of Gaia the Gigantes waged war on the gods and were destroyed in the ensuing battle. The most\n        famous of the combatants were Enkelados (Enceladus) who was buried by Athena\n        beneath Mount Etna, Polybotes who was crushed by an island cast by Poseidon,\n        and Porphyrion who was slain by Zeus and Herakles when he attempted to\n        violate the goddess Hera.\n\nThe Giants were depicted as either spear-wielding hoplite warriors in armour or primitives clothed in\n        animal-skins and armed with rocks and flaming brands. In sculpture and mosaic art they were usually depicted\n        with the tails of serpents in place of legs.\n\nThe Gigantes might have represented the primitive tribes of Thrake (Thrace), north of Greece, whose barbarian\n        culture unfavorably contrasted with Greek civilisation. According to some, the Thrakians were born from the\n        blood or ashes of the vanquished giants.\n\nIn southern Italy the thrashing of buried giants was believed to be the source of volcanism and other thermal\n        activity--from the thermal plains of Campania, to the volcanoes of Etna and Vesuvius.\n\n[1.1] Blood of OURANOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 176, Apollodorus\n          1.34)\n        [1.2] GAIA (Bacchylides Frag 15, Diodorus\n          Siculus 4.15.1, Ovid Metamorphoses 1.151)\n        [1.3] TARTAROS & GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] ALKYONEUS, PORPHYRION, ENKELADOS, EPHIALTES, EURYTOS, KLYTIOS, MIMAS, PALLAS, POLYBOTES, HIPPOLYTOS, AIGAION, AGRIOS, THOON (Apollodorus 1.34)\n        [1.2] ENKELADOS, KOIOS, ASTRAIOS, PELOROS, PALLAS, EMPHYTOS, RHOIKOS,\n        AGRIOS, EPHIALTES, EURYTOS, THEOMISES, THEODAMAS, OTOS, TYPHON, POLYBOTES,\n        IAPETOS (Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.3] KOIOS, EURYMEDON (Propertius Elegies 3.9)\n        [1.4] ALKYONEUS, PORPHYRION, ENKELADOS, KHTHONION, PELOREUS, TYPHOEUS (Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 25.85 & 48.6)\n        [1.5] PANKRATES, POLYBOTES, ORANION, EPHIALTES, EUPHORBOS, EUBOIOS (Athenian Black Figure Vase Beazley 10047)\n        [1.6] POLYBOTES, EURYALOS (Athenian Red Figure\n          Vase Beazley 200125)\n        [1.7] HYPERBIOS, EPHIALTES, AGASTHENES, ENKELADOS, POLYBOTES (Athenian Black Figure Vase Beazley\n          14590)\n        [1.8] PORPHYRION, ENKELADOS (Athenian Black Figure Vase Beazley 10148)\n\n[1.1] A RACE OF MEN (born from the blood of the slain Gigantes) (Ovid Metamorphoses\n          1.151)\n\nGIGANTES (Gigantes). In the story about the Gigantes or giants, we must distinguish the early legends from the\n        later ones. According to Homer, they were a gigantic and savage race of men, governed by Eurymedon, and dwelling\n        in the distant west, in the island of Thrinacia; but they were extirpated by Eurymedon on account of their\n        insolence towards the gods. (Hom. Od. vii. 59, 206, x. 120; comp. Paus. viii. 29. § 2.) Homer\n        accordingly looked upon the Gigantes, like the Phaeacians, Cyclopes, and Laestrygones, as a race of\n        Autochthones, whom, with the exception of the Phaeacians, the gods destroyed for their overbearing insolence,\n        but neither he nor Hesiod knows any thing about the contest of the gods with the Gigantes. Hesiod\n        (Theog. 185), however, considers them as divine beings, who sprang from the blood that fell from Uranus\n        upon the earth, so that Ge was their mother. Later poets and mythographers frequently confound them with the\n        Titans (Serv. ad Aen. viii. 698, Georg. i. 166, 278; Hor. Carm. iii. 4. 42), and\n        Hyginus (Praef. Fab. p. l) calls them the sons of Ge (Terra) and Tartarus. Their battle with Zeus and\n        the Olympian gods seems to be only an imitation of the revolt of the Titans against Uranus. Ge, it is said\n        (Apollod. i. 6. § 1, &c.), indignant at the fate of her former children, the Titans, gave birth to the\n        Gigantes, that is, monstrous and unconquerable giants, with fearful countenances and the tails of dragons.\n        (Comp. Ov. Trist. iv. 7, 17.) They were born, according to some, in Phlegrae (i. e. burning fields), in\n        Sicily, Campania, or Arcadia, and, according to others, in the Thracian Pallene. (Apollod., Paus. ll. cc.\n          ; Pind. Nem. i. 67; Strab. pp. 245, 281, 330; Schol. ad Hom. Il. viii. 479.) It is\n        worthy of remark that Homer, as well as later writers, places the Gigantes in volcanic districts, and most\n        authorities in the western parts of Europe. In their native land they made an attack upon heaven, being armed\n        with huge rocks and the trunks of trees. (Ov. Met. i. 151, &c.) Porphyrion and Alcyoneus\n        distinguished themselves above their brethren. The latter of them, who had carried off the oxen of Helios from\n        Erytheia, was immortal so long as he fought in his native land; and the gods were informed that they should not\n        be able to kill one giant unless they were assisted by some mortal in their fight against the monsters. (Comp.\n        Schol. ad Pind. Nem. i. 100; Eratosth. Catast. 11.) Ge, on hearing of this, discovered a herb\n        which would save the giants from being killed by mortal hands; but Zeus forbade Helios and Eos to shine, took\n        himself the herb, and invited Heracles to give his assistance against the giants. Heracles, indeed, killed\n        Alcyoneus, but as the giant fell on the ground, lie came to life again. On the advice of Athena, Heracles\n        dragged him away from his native land, and thus slew him effectually. Porphyrion attacked Heracles and Hera, but\n        was killed by the combined efforts of Zeus and Heracles, the one using a flash of lightning and the other his\n        arrows. (Comp. Pind. Pyth. viii. 19 with the Schol.) The other giants, whose number, according to\n        Hyginus, amounted to twenty-four, were then killed one after another by the gods and Heracles, and some of them\n        were buried by their conquerors under (volcanic) islands. (Eurip. Cycl. 7; Diod. iv. 21; Strab. p. 489;\n        Serv. ad Aen. iii. 578.) The fight of the giants with the gods was represented by Phidias on the inside\n        of the shield of his statue of Athena. (Plin. H. N. xxxvi. 5. 4.) The origin of the story of the\n        Gigantes must probably be sought for in similar physical phenomena in nature, especially volcanic ones, from\n        which arose the stories about the Cyclopes.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nAGRIOS (Agrius) A Gigante clubbed to death by the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) with maces of\n          bronze.\n\nAIGAION (Aegaeon) A Gigante slain by Artemis with her arrows in the war against the\n          gods.\n\nALKYONEUS (Alcyoneus) A King of the Gigantes who\n          was slain by Herakles in their war against the gods.

And not vainly did they fall from his hand; for all the bloody drops that\n        gushed forth Gaia (Gaea, the Earth) received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes\n        (Furies) and the great Gigantes (Giants) with gleaming armour.\" [N.B.

And if one of us comes upon them as he travels alone, then too they\n        have never as yet made concealment, because we are close of kin (egguthen) to themselves, just like\n        those of the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) race or the savage people (phyla) of the Gigantes\n        (Giants).’\"\n        [N.B. Its not clear why Homer describes these three races as \"close of kin.\" Later classical writers,\n        however, explain this passage by saying that the Gigante, Phaeacian-a-nd presumably Kyklops--tribes were born of\n        Earth when she was impregnated by the blood of the castrated sky-god Ouranos.

In these places he indicates that the Gigantes are mortal, and not of divine race, and his words in\n        the following passage are plainer still :--‘Who once was king among the haughty Gigantes; but he destroyed\n        the infatuate folk, and was destroyed himself.’ Folk in the poetry of Homer means the common people.

When Ge (Earth) learned of this, she sought a\n        drug that would prevent their destruction even by mortal hands. But Zeus barred the appearance of Eos (the\n        Dawn), Selene (the Moon), and Helios (the Sun), and chopped up the drug himself before Ge could find it.\n        Then with Athene's help he called for Herakles to be his ally.

Zeus instilled him with a passion\n        for Hera, and when he tore her gown and wanted to rape her, she called for help, whereat Zeus hit him with a\n        thunderbolt and Herakles slew him with an arrow. As for the rest, Apollon sent an arrow into the left eye of\n        Ephialtes, Herakles into the right; Dionysos slew Eurytos with his thyrsos; Hekate got Klytios with fire-brands;\n        and Hephaistos (Hephaestus) killed Mimas by throwing molten iron at him.

There Poseidon ripped off the part of that island called Nisyros and threw it at him.

Or wound him with cutting steel and kill him for me like Zagreus, that one\n        may say, god or mortal, that Gaia in her anger has twice armed her slayers against the breed of Kronides\n        (Cronides)--the older Titanes against the former Dionysos [Zagreus], the younger Gigantes against Dionysos later\n        born.’\n        With these words she excited all the host of the Gigantes, and the battalions of the Gegenees (Earthborn) set\n        forth to war, one bearing a bulwark of Nysa, one who had sliced off with steel the flank of a cloudhigh\n        precipice, each withthese rocks for missiles armed him against Dionysos; one hastened to the conflict bearing\n        the rocky hill of some land with its base in the brine, another with a reef torn from a brinegirt isthmus.\n        Peloreus took up Pelion with hightowering peak as a missile in his innumberable arms, and left the cave Philyre\n        bare : as the rocky roof of his cave was pulled off, old Kheiron (Chiron) quivered and shook, that figure of\n        half a man growing into a comrade horse. But Bakkhos held a bunch of giantsbane vine, and ran at Alkyoneus with\n        the mountain upraised in his hands: he wielded no furious lance, no deadly sword, but he struck with this bunch\n        of tendrils and shore off the multitudinous hands of the Gigantes; the terrible swarms of groundbred serpents\n        were shorn off by those tippling leaves, the Gigantes' heads with those viper tresses were cut off and the\n        severed necks danced in the dust. Tribes innumerable were destroyed; from the slain Gigantes ran everflowing\n        rivers of blood, crimson torrents newly poured coloured the ravines red. The swarms of earthbred snakes ran wild\n        with fear before the tresses of Dionysos viperwreathed.\n        Fire was also a weapon of Bakkhos. He cast a torch in the air to destroy his adversaries : through the high\n        paths ran the Bakkhic flame leaping and curling over itself and shooting down corrosive sparks on the Gigante's\n        limbs; and there was a serpent with a blaze in his threatening mouth, half-burnt and whistling with a\n        firescorched throat, spitting out smoke instead of a spurt of deadly poison.\n        There was infinite tumult. Bakkhos raised himself and lifted his fighting torch over the heads of his\n        adversaries, and roasted the Gigantes' bodies with a great conflagration, an image on earth of the thunderbolt\n        cast by Zeus. The torches blazed: fire was rolling all over the head of Enkelados and making the air hot, but it\n        did not vanquish him--Enkelados bent not his knee in the steam of the earthly fire, since he was reserved for\n        the thunderbolt. Vast Alkyoneus leapt upon Lyaios armed with his Thrakian (Thracian) crags; he lifted over\n        Bakkhos a cloudhigh peak of wintry Haimos (Haemus)--useless against that mark, Dionysos the invulnerable. He\n        there the cliff, but when the rocks touched the fawnskin of Lyaios, they could not tear it, and burst into\n        splinters themselves. Typhoeus towering high had stript the mountains of Emathia (a younger Typhoeus in all\n        parts like the older, who once had lifted many a rugged strip of his mother earth), and cast the rocky missiles\n        at Dionysos. Lord Bakkhos pulled away the sword of one that was gasping on the ground and attacked the Gigantes'\n        heads, cutting the snaky crop of poison-spitting hair; even without weapon he destroyed the selfmarshalled host,\n        fighting furiously, and using the treeclimbing longleaf ivy to strike the Gigantes.\n        Indeed he would have slain all with his manbreaking thyrsos, if he had not retired of his own will out of the\n        fray and left enemies alive for his Father.\"\n\nSuidas s.v.

Whence the proverb, ‘all beneath Mykonos alone,’ applied\n        to those who bring under one title even those things which are by nature separate.\"\n\nAristaios (Aristaeus) apparently fled to Mount Etna in Sicily where he was transformed into a dung-beetle by\n        his mother Gaia (Earth).\n\nSuidas s.v.

Aristaios, the story goes, was\n        the only Gigante to survive, on the Sikelion (Sicilian) mountain called Aitne (Etna); the fire of heaven did not\n        reach him, and nor did Aitne harm him.\"\n\nSuidas s.v.

According to others, it was Typhoeus who was buried beneath the island. The volcanism of\n        Mount Vesuvius on the plain of Phlegra was also said to be caused by the writhings of buried Giants.\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 17 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[From a description of an ancient Greek painting depicting a volcanic island :] The neighbouring island,\n        my boy, we may consider a marvel; for fire smoulders under the whole of it, having worked its way into\n        underground passages and cavities of the island, through which as though ducts the flames break forth and\n        produce terrific torrents from which pour mighty rivers of fire that run in billows to the sea. If one wishes to\n        speculate about such matters, the island provides natural bitumen and sulphur; and when these are mixed by the\n        sea, the island is fanned into flame by many winds, drawing from the sea that which sets the fuel aflame. But\n        the painting, following the accounts given by the poets, goes farther and ascribes a myth to the island. A\n        Gigante (Giant), namely, was once struck down there, and upon his as he struggled in the death agony the island\n        was placed as a bond to hold him down, and he doest not yet yield but from beneath the earth renews the fight\n        and breathes forth this fire as he utters threats. Yonder figure, they say, would represent Typhon in Sikelia\n        (Sicily) [i.e. buried beneath Mount Etna] or Enkelados (Enceladus) here in Italia (Italy) [i.e. buried beneath\n        Mount Vesuvius], Gigantes (Giants) that both continents and island are pressing down, not yet dead indeed but\n        always dying. And you, yourself, my boy, will imagine that you have not been left out of the contest, when you\n        look at the peak of the mountain; for what you see there are thunderbolts which Zeus is hurling at the Gigante,\n        and the Gigante is already giving up the struggle but still trusts in the earth, but the earth\n        (gê) has grown weary because Poseidon does not permit her to remain in place. Poseidon has spread\n        a mist over the contest, so that it resembles what has taken place in the past rather than what is taking place\n        now.\"\n\nPhilostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana 5. 16 (trans. Conybeare) (Greek biography\n          C1st to C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Poetical myths are given by the vulgar of Aitna (Etna) . . . belonging to the class of dramatic stories\n        which fill the mouths of our poets. For they sway that a certain Typho or Enkelados lies bound under the\n        mountain [of Etna], and in his death agony breathes out this fire that we see. . . .\n        There are many other mountains all over the earth that are on fire, and yet we should never be so rash as to\n        assign to them Gigantes (Giants) and gods like Hephaistos (Hephaestus).\"\n\nSee also The Gigantomachia (above) & Gigante Enceladus versus Athena (above).\n\nLycophron, Alexandra 688 ff (trans.
