  "content": "MYLINOS (Mylinus) was a little-known giant of the island of Krete (Crete) slain by the god Zeus.\n\nMylinos is similar to, if not the same as, the Kretan giant Olympos. Both of\n        these appear to be related to Kronos (Cronus) (Time), father of Zeus.\n        His name means \"millstone\" from the Greek word mylinos. The millstone might symbolise the\n        slow revolution of time which grinds down all things, similar to the all-devouring Titan Kronos of standard\n        Greek myth.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 71. 2 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"He [Zeus] slew the Gigantes (Giants) and their followers, Mylinos in Krete (Crete) and Typhon in\n        Phrygia.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
