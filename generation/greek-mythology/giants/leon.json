  "content": "LEON was a leonine Gigante (Giant) slain by Herakles during the war of the giants against the gods. The hero\n        made a cloak of his skin.\n\nA lion-headed Gigante does occur in the ancient Pergamon relief depicting the War of the Giants. However, this\n        myth is really a variant of the tale of the Nemean Lion which was the\n        usual source of Herakles cape.\n\nPtolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 5 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190)\n          (trans. Pearse) (Greek mythographer C1st to C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Herakles did not wear the skin of the Nemean lion, but that of a certain Leon (Lion), one of the Gigantes\n        (Giants) killed by Herakles whom he had challenged to single combat.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
