  "content": "GERYON was a three-bodied, four-winged giant who lived on the island of Erytheia in the westernmost reach of the earth-encircling river Okeanos (Oceanus). He possessed a fabulous herd of cattle whose coats were\n        stained red by the light of the sunset. Herakles was sent to fetch these as one of his twelve labours.\n\nThe hero reached the island by sailing across the Okeanos in a golden cup-boat borrowed from the sun-god Helios. There he encountered and slew the cattle-herder Eurytion, the\n        two-headed guard dog Orthros (Orthus), and finally three-bodied Geryon\n        himself. With this task complete the hero herded the cattle into his boat and led them back to the Greek\n        Peloponnese.\n\nGeryon may have originally been associated with the constellation Orion, his\n        two-headed dog Orthos with the adjacent canines Canis Major and Minor,\n        and his cattle with Taurus the bull. His father's name Khrysaor (\"Golden Sword\") was an appellation of\n        the constellation Orion and most of Herakles other labours are connected with star groups.\n\nThe meaning of his name is unclear. It may be connected with the ancient Greek word gê (earth)\n        or gêryô (singing).\n\n[1.1] KHRYSAOR & KALLIRHOE (Hesiod Theogony 287,\n          Stesichorus Geryoneis Frag, Apollodorus 2.106, Hyginus Pref)\n        [1.2] KHRYSAOR (Ibycus Frag 282A, Diodorus Siculus\n          4.17.1)\n\nGE′RYON or GERY′ONES (Gêruonês), a son of Chrysaor and Calirrhoë, a fabulous king\n        of Hesperia, who is described as a being with three heads, and possessing magnificent oxen in the island of\n        Erytheia. He acts a prominent part in the stories of Heracles. (Apollod. ii. 5. § 10.) The oxen of\n          Geryones in Erytheia. The fetching of these oxen was a subject which was capable of great poetical\n        embellishments, owing to the distant regions into which it carried the hero. The adventure is mentioned by\n        Hesiod, but it is further developed in the later writers, and more especially by the Roman poets, who took a\n        more direct interest in it, as it led the hero to the western parts of the world. The story runs as follows:--\n        Geryones, the monster with three bodies, lived in the fabulous island of Erytheia (the reddish), so called\n        because it lay under the rays of the setting sun in the west. It was originally conceived to be situated off the\n        coast of Epeirus, but afterwards it was identified either with Gades or the Balearian islands, and was at all\n        times believed to be in the distant west. Geryones kept a herd of red oxen, which fed together with those of\n        Hades, and were guarded by the giant Eurytion and the two-headed dog Orthrus. Heracles was commanded by\n        Eurystheus to fetch those oxen of Geryones. He traversed Europe, and, having passed through the countries of\n        several savage nations, he at length arrived in Libya. Diodorus makes Heracles collect a large fleet in Crete,\n        to sail against Chrysaor, the wealthy king of Iberia, and his three sons. On his way he is further said to have\n        killed Antaeus and Busiris, and to have founded Hecatompolis. On the frontiers of Libya and Europe he erected\n        two pillars (Calpe and Abyla) on the two sides of the straits of Gibraltar, which were hence called the pillars\n        of Heracles. As on his journey Heracles was annoyed by the heat of the sun, he shot at Helios, who so much\n        admired his boldness, that he presented him with a golden cup or boat, in which he sailed across the ocean to\n        Erytheia. He there slew Eurytion, his dog, and Geryones, and sailed with his booty to Tartessus, where he\n        returned the golden cup (boat) to Helios.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 979 ff.

He had the bodies of three men joined into one at the\n        belly, but splitting into three again from the flanks and thighs down. He owned crimson-colored cattle, which\n        were herded by Eurytion and protected by Orthos (Orthus), the hound with two heads born of Ekhidna (Echidna) and\n        Typhon. As Herakles proceeded through Europe to these cattle, he killed many wild animals, paid a visit to\n        Libya, and went on to Tartessos (Tartessus) where he set up two steles opposite each other at the borders of\n        Europe and Libya, as commemorative markers of his trip.\n        Then, when Helios (the Sun) made him hot as he proceeded, he aimed his bow at the god and stretched it; Helios\n        was so surprised at his daring that he gave him a golden goblet, in which he crossed Okeanos.\n        When he reached Erytheia he camped on Mount Atlas.
