  "content": "DIONYSOS (Dionysus) was the Olympian god of wine, vegetation, pleasure, festivity, madness and wild frenzy. He\n        was depicted as either an older, bearded god or an effeminate, long-haired youth. His attributes included the\n        thyrsos (a pine-cone tipped staff), a drinking cup and a crown of ivy. He was usually accompanied by a\n        troop of Satyrs and Mainades (wild female devotees).\n\nDionysos was a son of Zeus and the princess Semele of Thebes. During the course of her pregnancy, the god's\n        jealous wife Hera tricked Semele into asking Zeus to appear before her in his full glory. Bound by oath, the god\n        was forced to comply and she was consumed by the heat of his lightning-bolts. Zeus recovered their unborn child\n        from her body, sewed him up in his own thigh, and carried him to term. <<More>>\n\nAfter his birth from the thigh of Zeus, Dionysos was first entrusted to the care of Seilenos (Silenus) and the\n        nymphs of Mount Nysa, and later to his aunt Ino, Semele's sister, and her husband Athamas. Hera was enraged when\n        she learned of the boy's location and drove the couple mad, causing them to kill both their children and\n        themselves. <<More>>\n\nThe Thrakian king Lykourgos (Lycurgus) attacked Dionysos and his companions as they were travelling through his\n        land and drove them into the sea. As punishment, the god inflicted him with madness causing him to murder his\n        wife and son and mutilate himself with an axe. <<More>>\n\nKing Pentheus of Thebes refused to accept the god's divinity and tried to apprehend him. The god retaliated by\n        driving the king's daughters into a crazed frenzy and they tore him apart limb from limb. <<More>>\n\nDionysos instructed the hero Ikarios (Icarius) of Athens in the art of winemaking. However, some shepherds,\n        upon drinking the wine, thought they had been poisoned and killed him. The sorrowful god then set him amongst\n        the stars as the constellation Bootes. <<More>>\n\nAs Dionysos was travelling through the islands of the Aegean Sea he was captured by a band of Tyrrhenian\n        pirates who thought to sell him into slavery. The god infested their ship with phantoms of creeping vines and\n        wild beasts, and in terror the men leapt overboard and were transformed into dolphins. <<More>>\n\nDionysos married princess Ariadne of Krete (Crete) whom he discovered abandoned by Theseus on the island of\n        Naxos. <<More>>\n\nThe god launched a campaign against the Indian nation in the farthest reaches of Asia, leading an army\n        composed of Satyrs, Mainades, and demigods. <<More>>\n\nDionysos journeyed to the underworld to recover his mother Semele and brought her to Olympos where Zeus\n        transformed into the goddess Thyone. <<More>>\n\nMany other myths are detailed over the following pages.\n\nDionysos' most distinctive attribute was the thyrsos, a pine-cone tipped staff. His other attributes\n        included a drinking-cup (kantharos), fruiting grapevines and a panther.\n        The god was usually clothed in a long robe (chiton) and cloak (himation) and crowned with a\n        wreath of ivy-leaves.\n\nBelow are some examples of his attributes as depicted in ancient Greek art:-\n\n1. Pine-cone staff (thyrsos); 2. Thyrsos-staff head; 3. Grapevines; 4. Drinking-cup; 5. Wreath of\n        ivy-leaves.\n\nDionysos' sacred animals were the panther (leopard), tiger, bull and serpent. The god rode on the back of a\n        panther or drove a chariot drawn by a pair of the beasts. \n        His sacred plants were the grapevine, ivy, bindweed (prickly ivy) and pine tree. Devotees of the god wore\n        wreaths of ivy and carried pine-cone tipped staffs.\n\nBelow are examples of the god's animals as depicted in ancient Greek art and photos of his sacred plants:-\n\n1. Panther; 2. Grapevine; 3. Ivy; 4. Bindweed; 5. Pine tree.\n\nThis site contains a total of 14 pages describing the god, including general descriptions, mythology, and cult.\n        The content is outlined in the Index of Dionysus Pages (left column or below).\n\n[1] ZEUS & SEMELE (Hesiod Theogony 940, Homeric Hymn 1 & 7 & 26, Pindar Odes Pythian 3, Bacchylides\n          Frag 19, Apollodorus 3.26, Pausanias 3.24.4, Diodorus Siculus 4.2.1, Hyginus Fabulae 179, Nonnus Dionysiaca,\n          et al)\n        [2] ZEUS & DIONE (Scholiast on Pindar's Pythian 3.177; Hesychius)\n        [3] ZEUS & SELENE (BENDIS?) (Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.21-23)\n\nDionysos was a son of Zeus, King of the Gods, and Semele, a mortal princess of Thebes. The god was known as the\n        \"twice-born\" for his mother was slain by the lightning-bolts of Zeus during the course of her\n        pregancy, but rescued by his father who carried him to term sown up inside his thigh. \n        Dionysos' grandparents were the Titans Kronos (Cronus) and Rheia, King Kadmos (Cadmus) of Thebes and the goddess\n        Harmonia. He was a great-grandson of Ares and Aphrodite (Harmonia's parents) and also a distant descendant of\n        the god Poseidon.\n        The god's half-brothers and sisters included Hermes, Ares, Aphrodite, Athena, Persephone, Apollon and\n        Artemis.\n        He married Ariadne, daughter of King Minos of Krete (Crete), and their sons became kings and princes of the best\n        wine-producing regions in ancient Greece. <<More>>\n\nBelow are two graphics depicting Dionysos' family tree, the first with names transliterated from the Greek and\n        the second with the common English spellings:--\n\nDIONYSOS, the youthful, beautiful, but effeminate god of wine. He is also called both by Greeks and Romans\n        Bacchus (Bakchos), that is, the noisy or riotous god, which was originally a mere epithet or surname of\n        Dionysus, but does not occur till after the time of Herodotus.\n\nAccording to the common tradition, Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Semele, the daughter of Cadmus of Thebes\n        (Hom. Hymn. vi. 56; Eurip. Bacch. init.; Apollod. iii. 4. § 3); whereas others describe\n        him as a son of Zeus by Demeter, Io, Dione, or Arge. (Diod. iii. 62, 74; Schol. ad Pind. Pyth. iii.\n        177; Plut. de Flum. 16.) Diodorus (iii. 67) further mentions a tradition, according to which he was a\n        son of Ammon and Amaltheia, and that Ammon, from fear of Rhea, carried the child to a cave in the neighbourhood\n        of mount Nysa, in a lonely island formed by the river Triton. Ammon there entrusted the child to Nysa, the\n        daughter of Aristaeus, and Athena likewise undertook to protect the boy. Others again represent him as a son of\n        Zeus by Persephone or Iris, or describe him simply as a son of Lethe, or of Indus. (Diod. iv. 4; Plut.\n        Sympos. vii. 5; Philostr. Vit. Apollon. ii. 9.)\n\nThe same diversity of opinions prevails in regard to the native place of the god, which in the common tradition\n        is Thebes, while in others we find India, Libya, Crete, Dracanum in Samos, Naxos, Elis, Eleutherae, or Teos,\n        mentioned as his birthplace. (Hom. Hymn. xxv. 8; Diod. iii. 65, v. 75; Nonnus, Dionys. ix. 6;\n        Theocrit. xxvi. 33.) It is owing to this diversity in the traditions that ancient writers were driven to the\n        supposition that there were originally several divinities which were afterwards identified under the one name of\n        Dionysus. Cicero (de Nat. Deor. iii 23) distinguishes five Dionysi, and Diodorus (iii. 63, &c.)\n        three.\n\nThe common story, which makes Dionysus a son of Semele by Zeus, runs as follows: Hera, jealous of Semele,\n        visited her in the disguise of a friend, or an old woman, and persuaded her to request Zeus to appear to her in\n        the same glory and majesty in which he was accustomed to approach his own wife Hera. When all entreaties to\n        desist from this request were fruitless, Zeus at length complied, and appeared to her in thunder and lightning.\n        Semele was terrified and overpowered by the sight, and being seized by the fire, she gave premature birth to a\n        child. Zeus, or according to others, Hermes (Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1137) saved the child from the flames: it was\n        sewed up in the thigh of Zeus, and thus came to maturity. Various epithets which are given to the god refer to\n        that occurrence, such as purigenês, mêrorraphês, mêrotraphês and\n        ianigena. (Strab. xiii. p. 628; Diod. iv. 5; Eurip. Bacch. 295; Eustath. ad Hom. p.\n        310; Ov. Met. iv. 11.)\n\nAfter the birth of Dionysus, Zeus entrusted him to Hermes, or, according to others, to Persephone or Rhea\n        (Orph. Hymn. xlv. 6; Steph. Byz. s. v. Mastaura), who took the child to Ino and Athamas at Orchomenos,\n        and persuaded them to bring him up as a girl. Hera was now urged on by her jealousy to throw Ino and Athamas\n        into a state of madness, and Zeus, in order to save his child, changed him into a ram, and carried him to the\n        nymphs of mount Nysa, who brought him up in a cave, and were afterwards rewarded for it by Zeus, by being placed\n        as Hyades among the stars. (Hygin. Fab. 182; Theon, ad Arat. Phaen. 177; comp. Hyades.)\n\nThe inhabitants of Brasiae, in Laconia, according to Pausanias (iii. 24. § 3), told a different story\n        about the birth of Dionysus, When Cadmus heard, they said, that Semele was mother of a son by Zeus, he put her\n        and her child into a chest, and threw it into the sea. The chest was carried by the wind and waves to the coast\n        of Brasiae. Semele was found dead, and was solemnly buried, but Dionysus was brought up by Ino, who happened at\n        the time to be at Brasiae. The plain of Brasiae was, for this reason, afterwards called the garden of Dionysus.\n\nThe traditions about the education of Dionysus, as well as about the personages who undertook it, differ as\n        much as those about his parentage and birthplace. Besides the nymphs of mount Nysa in Thrace, the muses, Lydae,\n        Bassarae, Macetae, Mimallones (Eustath. ad Hom. pp. 982, 1816), the nymph Nysa (Diod. iii. 69), and the\n        nymphs Philia, Coronis, and Cleis, in Naxos, whither the child Dionysus was said to have been carried by Zeus\n        (Diod. iv. 52), are named as the beings to whom the care of his infancy was entrusted. Mystis, moreover, is said\n        to have instructed him in the mysteries (Nonn. Dionys. xiii. 140), and Hippa, on mount Tmolus, nursed\n        him (Orph. Hymn. xlvii. 4); Macris, the daughter of Aristaeus, received him from the hands of Hermes,\n        and fed him with honey. (Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1131.) On mount Nysa, Bromie and Bacche too are called his nurses.\n        (Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. vi. 15.)\n\nMount Nysa, from which the god was believed to have derived his name, was not only in Thrace and Libya, but\n        mountains of the same name are found in different parts of the ancient world where he was worshipped, and where\n        he was believed to have introduced the cultivation of the vine. Hermes, however, is mixed up with most of the\n        stories about the infancy of Dionysus, and he was often represented in works of art, in connexion with the\n        infant god. (Comp. Paus. iii. 18. § 7.)\n\nWhen Dionysus had grown up, Hera threw him also into a state of madness, in which he wandered about through\n        many countries of the earth. A tradition in Hyginus (Poet. Astr. ii. 23) makes him go first to the\n        oracle of Dodona, but on his way thither he came to a lake, which prevented his proceeding any further. One of\n        two asses he met there carried him across the water, and the grateful god placed both animals among the stars,\n        and asses henceforth remained sacred to Dionysus.\n\nAccording to the common tradition, Dionysus first wandered through Egypt, where he was hospitably received by\n        king Proteus. He thence proceeded through Syria, where he flayed Damascus alive, for opposing the introduction\n        of the vine, which Dionysus was believed to have discovered (euretês ampelou). He now traversed all Asia.\n        (Strab. xv. p. 687; Eurip. Bacch. 13.) When he arrived at the Euphrates, he built a bridge to cross the\n        river, but a tiger sent to him by Zeus carried him across the river Tigris. (Paus. x. 29; Plut. de\n          Flum. 24.)\n\nThe most famous part of his wanderings in Asia is his expedition to India, which is said to have lasted three,\n        or, according to some, even 52 years. (Diod. iii. 63, iv. 3.) He did not in those distant regions meet with a\n        kindly reception everywhere, for Myrrhanus and Deriades, with his three chiefs Blemys, Orontes, and Oruandes,\n        fought against him. (Steph. Byz. s.v. Blemues, Gazos, Gêreia, Dardai, Eares, Zabioi, Malloi,\n        Pandai, Sibai.) But Dionysus and the host of Pans, Satyrs, and Bacchic women, by whom he was accompanied,\n        conquered his enemies, taught the Indians the cultivation of the vine and of various fruits, and the worship of\n        the gods; he also founded towns among them, gave them laws, and left behind him pillars and monuments in the\n        happy land which he had thus conquered and civilized, and the inhabitants worshipped him as a god. (Comp. Strab.\n        xi. p. 505; Arrian, Ind. 5; Diod. ii. 38; Philostr. Vit. Apollon. ii. 9; Virg. Aen.\n        vi. 805.)\n\nDionysus also visited Phrygia and the goddess Cybele or Rhea, who purified him and taught him the mysteries,\n        which according to Apollodorus (iii. 5. § 1.) took place before he went to India. With the assistance of\n        his companions, he drove the Amazons from Ephesus to Samos, and there killed a great number of them on a spot\n        which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema. (Plut. Quaest. Gr. 56.) According to another legend,\n        he united with the Amazons to fight against Cronus and the Titans, who had expelled Ammon from his dominions.\n        (Diod. iii. 70, &c.) He is even said to have gone to Iberia, which, on leaving, he entrusted to the\n        government of Pan. (Plut. de Flum. 16.)\n\nOn his passage through Thrace he was ill received by Lycurgus, king of the Edones, and leaped into the sea to\n        seek refuge with Thetis, whom he afterwards rewarded for her kind reception with a golden urn, a present of\n        Hephaestus. (Hom. Il. vi. 135, &c., Od. xxiv. 74; Schol. ad Hom. Il. xiii. 91.\n        Comp. Diod. iii. 65.) All the host of Bacchantic women and Satyrs, who had accompanied him, were taken prisoners\n        by Lycurgus, but the women were soon set free again. The country of the Edones thereupon ceased to bear fruit,\n        and Lycurgus became mad and killed his own son, whom he mistook for a vine, or, according to others (Serv.\n        ad Aen. iii. 14) he cut off his own legs in the belief that he was cutting down some vines. When this\n        was done, his madness ceased, but the country still remained barren, and Dionysus declared that it would remain\n        so till Lycurgus died. The Edones, in despair, took their king and put him in chains, and Dionysus had him torn\n        to pieces by horses.\n\nAfter then proceeding through Thrace without meeting with any further resistance, he returned to Thebes, where\n        he compelled the women to quit their houses, and to celebrate Bacchic festivals on mount Cithaeron, or\n        Parnassus. Pentheus, who then ruled at Thebes, endeavoured to check the riotous proceedings, and went out to the\n        mountains to seek the Bacchic women; but his own mother, Agave, in her Bacchic fury, mistook him for an animal,\n        and tore him to pieces. (Theocrit. Id. xxvi.; Eurip. Bacch. 1142; Ov. Met. iii. 714,\n        &c.)\n\nAfter Dionysus had thus proved to the Thebans that he was a god, he went to Argos. As the people there also\n        refused to acknowledge him, he made the women mad to such a degree, that they killed their own babes and\n        devoured their flesh. (Apollod. iii. 5. § 2.) According to another statement, Dionysus with a host of women\n        came from the islands of the Aegean to Argos, but was conquered by Perseus, who slew many of the women. (Paus.\n        ii. 20. § 3, 22. § 1.) Afterwards, however, Dionysus and Perseus became reconciled, and the Argives\n        adopted the worship of the god, and built temples to him. One of these was called the temple of Dionysus\n        Cresius, because the god was believed to have buried on that spot Ariadne, his beloved, who was a Cretan. (Paus.\n        ii. 23. § 7.)\n\nThe last feat of Dionysus was performed on a voyage from Icaria to Naxos. He hired a ship which belonged to\n        Tyrrhenian pirates; but the men, instead of landing at Naxos, passed by and steered towards Asia to sell him\n        there. The god, however, on perceiving this, changed the mast and oars into serpents, and himself into a lion;\n        he filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes, so that the sailors, who were seized with madness, leaped\n        into the sea, where they were metamorphosed into dolphins. (Apollod. iii. 5. § 3; Hom. Hymn. vi.\n        44; Ov. Met. iii. 582, &c.) In all his wanderings and travels the god had rewarded those who had\n        received him kindly and adopted his worship : he gave them vines and wine.\n\nAfter he had thus gradually established his divine nature throughout the world, he led his mother out of Hades,\n        called her Thyone, and rose with her into Olympus. (Apollod. l. c.) The place, where he had come forth\n        with Semele from Hades, was shown by the Troezenians in the temple of Artemis Soteira (Paus. ii. 31. § 2);\n        the Argives, on the other hand, said, that he had emerged with his mother from the Alcyonian lake. (Paus. ii.\n        37. § 5; Clem. Alex. Adm. ad Gr. p. 22.) There is also a mystical story, that the body of Dionysus\n        was cut up and thrown into a cauldron by the Titans, and that he was restored and cured by Rhea or Demeter.\n        (Paus. viii. 37. § 3; Diod. iii. 62; Phurnut. N. D. 28.)\n\nVarious mythological beings are described as the offspring of Dionysus; but among the women, both mortal and\n        immortal, who won his love, none is more famous in ancient history than Ariadne. The extraordinary mixture of\n        traditions which we have here had occasion to notice, and which might still be considerably increased, seems\n        evidently to be made up out of the traditions of different times and countries, referring to analogous\n        divinities, and transferred to the Greek Dionysus.\n\nWe may, however, remark at once, that all traditions which have reference to a mystic worship of Dionysus, are\n        of a comparatively late origin, that is, they belong to the period subsequent to that in which the Homeric poems\n        were composed; for in those poems Dionysus does not appear as one of the great divinities, and the story of his\n        birth by Zeus and the Bacchic orgies are not alluded to in any way : Dionysus is there simply described as the\n        god who teaches man the preparation of wine, whence he is called the \"drunken god \" (mainomenos), and the sober\n        king Lycurgus will not, for this reason, tolerate him in his kingdom. (Hom. Il. vi. 132, &c.,\n        Od. xviii. 406, comp. xi. 325.) As the cultivation of the vine spread in Greece, the worship of\n        Dionysus likewise spread further; the mystic worship was developed by the Orphici, though it probably originated\n        in the transfer of Phrygian and Lydian modes of worship to that of Dionysus. After the time of Alexander's\n        expedition to India, the celebration of the Bacchic festivals assumed more and more their wild and dissolute\n        character.\n\nAs far as the nature and origin of the god Dionysus is concerned, he appears in all traditions as the\n        representative of some power of nature, whereas Apollo is mainly an ethical deity. Dionysus is the productive,\n        overflowing and intoxicating power of nature, which carries man away from his usual quiet and sober mode of\n        living. Wine is the most natural and appropriate symbol of that power, and it is therefore called \"the\n        fruit of Dionysus.\" (Dionusou karpos; Pind. Fragm. 89, ed. Böckh.) Dionysus is, therefore, the god\n        of wine, the inventor and teacher of its cultivation, the giver of joy, and the disperser of grief and sorrow.\n        (Bacchyl. ap. Athen. ii. p. 40; Pind. Fragm. 5; Eurip. Bacch. 772.)\n\nAs the god of wine, he is also both an inspired and an inspiring god, that is, a god who has the power of\n        revealing the future to man by oracles. Thus, it is said, that he had as great a share in the Delphic oracle as\n        Apollo (Eurip. Bacch. 300), and he himself had an oracle in Thrace. (Paus. ix. 30. § 5.) Now, as\n        prophetic power is always combined with the healing art, Dionysus is, like Apollo, called iatpos, or\n        hugiatês (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1624), and at his oracle of Amphicleia, in Phocis, he cured\n        diseases by revealing the remedies to the sufferers in their dreams. (Paus. x. 33. § 5.) Hence he is\n        invoked as a theos sôtêr against raging diseases. (Soph. Oed. Tyr. 210; Lycoph. 206.)\n\nThe notion of his being the cultivator and protector of the vine was easily extended to that of his being the\n        protector of trees in general, which is alluded to in various epithets and surnames given him by the poets of\n        antiquity (Paus. i. 31. § 2, vii. 21. § 2), and he thus comes into close connexion with Demeter.\n        (Paus. vii. 20. § 1; Pind. Isthm. vii. 3; Theocrit. xx. 33; Diod. iii. 64; Ov. Fast. iii.\n        736; Plut. Quaest. Gr. 36.)\n\nThis character is still further developed in the notion of his being the promoter of civilization, a law-giver,\n        and a lover of peace. (Eurip. Bacch. 420; Strab. x. p. 468; Diod. iv. 4.) As the Greek drama had grown\n        out of the dithyrambic choruses at the festivals of Dionysus, he was also regarded as the god of tragic art, and\n        as the protector of theatres. In later times, he was worshipped also as a theos chthonios, which may have arisen\n        from his resemblance to Demeter, or have been the result of an amalgamation of Phrygian and Lydian forms of\n        worship with those of the ancient Greeks. (Paus. viii. 37, § 3; Arnob. adv. Gent. v. 19.)\n\nThe orgiastic worship of Dionysus seems to have been first established in Thrace, and to have thence spread\n        southward to mounts Helicon and Parnassus, to Thebes, Naxos, and throughout Greece, Sicily, and Italy, though\n        some writers derived it from Egypt. (Paus. i. 2. § 4; Diod. i. 97.) Respecting his festivals and the mode\n        of their celebration, and especially the introduction and suppression of his worship at Rome, see Dict. of\n          Ant. s. vv. Agriônia, Anthestêria, Halôa, Aiôra, and Dionysia.\n\nIn the earliest times the Graces, or Charites, were the companions of Dionysus (Pind. Ol. xiii. 20;\n        Plut. Quaest. Gr. 36; Apollon. Rhod. iv. 424), and at Olympia he and the Charites had an altar in\n        common. (Schol. ad Pind. Ol. v. 10 ; Paus. v. 14 in fin.) This circumstance is of great interest, and\n        points out the great change which took place in the course of time in the mode of his worship, for afterwards we\n        find him accompanied in his expeditions and travels by Bacchantic women. called Lenae, Maenades, Thyiades,\n        Mimallones, Clodones, Bassarae or Bassarides, all of whom are represented in works of art as raging with madness\n        or enthusiasm, in vehement motions, their heads thrown backwards, with dishevelled hair, and carrying in their\n        hands thyrsus-staffs (entwined with ivy, and headed with pine-cones), cymbals, swords, or serpents. Sileni,\n        Pans, satyrs, centaurs, and other beings of a like kind, are also the constant companions of the god. (Strab. x.\n        p. 468; Diod. iv. 4. &c.; Catull. 64. 258 ; Athen i. p. 33; Paus. i. 2. § 7.)\n\nThe temples and statues of Dionysus were very numerous in the ancient world. Among the sacrifices which were\n        offered to him in the earliest times, human sacrifices are also mentioned. (Paus. vii. 21. § 1; Porphyr.\n        de Abstin. ii. 55.) Subsequently, however, this barbarous custom was softened down into a symbolic\n        scourging, or animals were substituted for men, as at Potniae. (Paus. viii. 23. § 1, ix. 8. § 1.)\n\nThe animal most commonly sacrificed to Dionysus was a ram. (Virg. Georg. ii. 380, 395; Ov.\n        Fast. i. 357.) Among the things sacred to him, we may notice the vine, ivy, laurel, and asphodel; the\n        dolphin, serpent, tiger, lynx, panther, and ass; but he hated the sight of an owl. (Paus. viii. 39. § 4;\n        Theocrit. xxvi. 4; Plut. Sympos. iii. 5; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 87; Virg. Eclog. v. 30;\n        Hygin. Poët. Astr. ii. 23; Philostr. Imag. ii. 17; Vit. Apollon. iii. 40.)\n\nThe earliest images of the god were mere Hermae with the phallus (Paus. ix. 12. § 3), or his head only was\n        represented. (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1964.) In later works of art he appears in four different\n        forms:--\n        1. As an infant handed over by Hermes to his nurses, or fondled and played with by satyrs and Bacchae.\n        2. As a manly god with a beard, commonly called the Indian Bacchus. He there appears in the character of a wise\n        and dignified oriental monarch; his features are expressive of sublime tranquillity and mildness; his beard is\n        long and soft, and his Lydian robes (bassara) are long and richly folded. His hair sometimes floats down in\n        locks, and is sometimes neatly wound around the head, and a diadem often adorns his forehead.\n        3. The youthful or so-called Theban Bacchus, was carried to ideal beauty by Praxiteles. The form of his body is\n        manly and with strong outlines, but still approaches to the female form by its softness and roundness. The\n        expression of the countenance is languid, and shews a kind of dreamy longing; the head, with a diadem, or a\n        wreath of vine or ivy, leans somewhat on one side; his attitude is never sublime, but easy, like that of a man\n        who is absorbed in sweet thoughts, or slightly intoxicated. He is often seen leaning on his companions, or\n        riding on a panther, ass, tiger, or lion. The finest statue of this kind is in the villa Ludovisi.\n        4. Bacchus with horns, either those of a ram or of a bull. This representation occurs chiefly on coins, but\n        never in statues.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nSeveral ancient poets and writers attempted to arrange the mythology of Dionysos into a tidy chronological\n        narrative. However, these were artificial constructs--the stories were, for the most part, a loose collection of\n        highly localised, unrelated cult myths.\n        The mythographer Apollodorus provides us with the neatest of these narratives. Related myths not mentioned by\n        this author are noted in the link boxes following each sub-section.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 26 - 28 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Zeus fell in love with Semele and slept with her, promising her anything she wanted, and keeping it all\n        from Hera. But Semele was deceived by Hera into asking Zeus to come to her as he came to Hera during their\n        courtship. So Zeus, unable to refuse, arrived in her bridal chamber in a chariot with lightning flashes and\n        thunder, and sent a thunderbolt at her. Semele died of fright, and Zeus grabbed from the fire her six-month\n        aborted baby, which he sewed into his thigh. After Semele's death the remaining daughters of Kadmos (Cadmus)\n        circulated the story that she had slept with a mortal, thereafter accusing Zeus, and because of this had been\n        killed by a thunderbolt. At the proper time Zeus loosened the stitches and gave birth to Dionysos, whom he\n        entrusted to Hermes.\"\n\nFor MYTHS of the birth of Dionysos see:\n        (1) Birth & Death of Dionysus-ZAGREUS (Orphic myth)\n        (2) Birth & Nursing of Dionysus\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 29 - 30 :\n        \"Zeus loosened the stitches and gave birth to Dionysos, whom he entrusted to Hermes. Hermes took him to Ino\n        and Athamas, and persuaded them to bring him up as a girl. Incensed, Hera inflicted madness on them. As for\n        Zeus, he escaped Hera's anger by changing Dionysos into a baby goat. Hermes took him to the Nymphai of Asian\n        Nysa, whom Zeus in later times places among the stars and named the Hyades.\"\n\nFor MYTHS of the birth and nursing of Dionysos see:\n        (1) Birth & Nursing of Dionysus\n        (2) Mt Nysa Birthplace of Dionysus\n        (3) Dionysos Wrath: Lycurgus (Iliad version)\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 31 :\n        \"Dionysos was the discoverer of the grapevine.\"\n\nIn later antiquity the story was developed into a love match between Dionysos and the youth Ampelos\n        \"grape-vine.\"\n\nFor the MYTH of Dionysos discovery of the vine see:\n        (1) Dionysus Loves: Ampelus (boy transformed into the first\n        grape-vine)\n        (2) Dionysus & the Discovery of Wine\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 32 :\n        \"After Hera inflicted madness upon him, he wandered over Aigyptos (Egypt) and Syria.

The story,\n        however, belongs here in the chronology of the Dionysos saga.

His quest to the underworld perhaps also included the recovery of his wife Ariadne, who had been slain by\n        Perseus in the Argive war, in addition to recovering his mother Semele. Death and reincarnation was an important\n        part of the Dionysian cult.\n        The story of the binding of Hera, in which Dionysos led Hephaistos back to Olympos to release the goddess and\n        was offered a seat amongst the twelve Olympians, is curiously absent from Apollodorus.

See Seneca Pseudo-Hymn to Dionysus\n\nThe late Roman-era Greek poet Nonnus wrote an epic poem describing the birth and adventures of Dionysos,\n        centred on his War against the Indians. His account of the wanderings of Dionysos varies from that of\n        Apollodorus, with its focus on stories of the East.

Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Let the people's hymn sound with the praise of Bacchus [Dionysos].\n        Bind your streaming locks with the nodding ivy, and in your soft hands grasp the Nysaean thyrsus! Bright glory\n        of the sky, come hither to the prayers which thine own illustrious Thebes, O Bacchus, offers to thee with\n        suppliant hands. Hither turn with favour thy virginal face; with thy star-bright countenance drive away the\n        clouds, the grim threats of Erebus, and greedy fate. Thee it becomes to circle thy locks with flowers of the\n        springtime, thee to cover thy head with Tyrian turban, or thy smooth brow to wreathe with the ivy's clustering\n        berries; now to fling loose thy lawless-streaming locks, again to bind them in a knot close-drawn; in such guise\n        as when, fearing thy stepdame's [Hera's] wrath, thou didst grow to manhood with false-seeming limbs, a pretended\n        maiden with golden ringlets, with saffron girdle binding thy garments. So thereafter this soft vesture has\n        pleased thee, folds loose hanging and the long-trailing mantle. Seated in thy golden chariot, thy lions with\n        long trappings covered, all the vast coast of the Orient saw thee, both he who drinks of the Ganges and whoever\n        breaks the ice of snowy Araxes.\n        On an unseemly ass old Silenus attends thee, his swollen temples bound with ivy garlands; while thy wanton\n        initiates lead the mystic revels. Along with thee a troop of Bassarids in Edonian dance beat the ground, now on\n        Mount Pangaeus' peak, now on the top of Thracian Pindus; now midst Cadmean dames has come a maenad [Agaue], the\n        impious comrade of Ogygian Bacchus, with sacred fawn-skins girt about her loins, her hand a light thyrsus\n        brandishing. Their hearts maddened by thee, the matrons have set their hair a-flowing; and at length, after the\n        rending of Pentheus' limbs, the Bacchanals, their bodies now freed from the frenzy, looked on their infamous\n        deed as though they knew it not.\n        Cadmean Ino, foster-mother of shining Bacchus, holds the realms of the deep, encircled by bands of Nereids\n        dancing; over the waves of the mighty deep a boy holds sway, new come, the kinsman of Bacchus, no common god,\n        Palaemon.\n        Thee, O boy, a Tyrrhenian band [of pirates] once captured and Nereus allayed the swollen sea; the dark blue\n        waters he changed to meadows. Thence flourish the plane-tree with vernal foliage and the laurel-grove dear to\n        Phoebus; the chatter of birds sounds loud through the branches. Fast-growing ivy clings to the oars, and\n        grape-vines twine at the mast-head. On the prow an Idaean lion roars; at the stern crouches a tiger of Ganges.\n        Then the frightened pirates swim in the sea, and plunged in the water their bodies assume new forms: the\n        robbers' arms first fall away; their breasts smite their bellies and are joined in one; a tiny hand comes down\n        at the side; with curving back they dive into the waves, and with crescent-shaped tail they cleave the sea; and\n        now as curved dolphins they follow the fleeing sails.\n        On its rich stream has Lydian Pactolus borne thee, leading along its burning banks the golden waters; the\n        Massgetan who mingles blood with milk in his goblets has unstrung his vanquished bow and given up his Getan\n        arrows; the realms of axe-wielding Lycurgus have felt the dominion of Bacchus; the fierce lands of the Zalaces\n        have felt it, and those wandering tribes whom neighbouring Boreas smites, and the nations which Maeotis' cold\n        water washes, and they [i.e. the Skythians] on whom the Arcadian constellation looks down from the zenith and\n        the wagons twain. He has subdued the scattered Gelonians; he has wrested their arms form the warrior maidens\n        [i.e. the Amazones]; with downcast face they fell to earth, those Thermodontian hordes, gave up at length their\n        light arrows, and became maenads. Sacred Cithaeron has flowed with the blood of Ophionian slaughter [i.e. of\n        Pentheus]; the Proetides fled to the woods, and Argos, in his stepdame's [Hera's] very presence, paid homage to\n        Bacchus.\n        Naxos, girt by the Aegean sea, gave him in marriage a deserted maiden [Ariadne], compensating her loss with a\n        better husband. Out of the dry rock there gushed Nyctelian liquor [wine]; babbling rivulets divided the grassy\n        meadows; deep the earth drank in the sweet juices, white fountains of snowy milk and Lesbian wine mingled with\n        fragrant thyme. The new-made bride is led to the lofty heavens; Phoebus [Apollon] a stately anthem sings, with\n        his locks flowing down his shoulders, and twin Cupides [Erotes] brandish their torches. Jupiter [Zeus] lays\n        aside his fiery weapons and, when Bacchus comes, abhors his thunderbolt.\n        While the bright stars of the ancient heavens shall run in their courses; while Oceanus shall encircle the\n        imprisoned earth with its waters; while full Luna [Selene the moon] gather again her lost radiance; while\n        Lucifer [Eosphoros, the day sar] shall herald the dawn of the morning and while the lofty Bears [constellations\n        Ursae] shall know naught of caerulean Nereus; so long shall we worship the shining face of beauteous Lyaeus\n        [Dionysos].\"\n\nClassical literature offers only a few, brief descriptions of the physical characteristics of the gods.\n\nHomeric Hymn 7 to Dionysus 1 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th to 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"He [Dionysos] appeared on a jutting headland by the shore of the fruitless sea, seeming like a stripling\n        in the first flush of manhood: his rich, dark hair was waving about him, and on his strong shoulders he wore a\n        purple robe.\"\n\nEuripides, Bacchae 90 ff (trans. Buckley) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        \"[Dionysos] the bull-horned god (theos taurokeros), and he [Zeus] crowned him with crowns of\n        snakes.\"\n\nEuripides, Bacchae 135 ff :\n        \"In the mountains . . . the leader of the dance is Bromios, euhoi! The plain flows with milk, it flows with\n        wine, it flows with the nectar of bees. Bakkheus (Bacchus), raising the flaming torch of pine on his thyrsos,\n        like the smoke of Syrian incense, darts about, arousing the wanderers with his racing and dancing, agitating\n        them with his shouts, casting his rich locks into the air. And among the Mainades (Maenads) cries his voice\n        rings deep.\"\n\nEuripides, Bacchae 230 ff :\n        \"Some stranger [Dionysos] has come . . . fragrant in hair with golden curls, having in his eyes the\n        wine-dark graces of Aphrodite.\"\n\nEuripides, Bacchae 350 ff :\n        \"[Pentheus speaks:] ‘This effeminate stranger [Dionysos].’\"\n\nEuripides, Bacchae 455 ff :\n        \"[Pentheus addresses Dionysos :] ‘Your body is not ill-formed, stranger, for women's purposes . . .\n        For your hair is long, not through wrestling, scattered over your cheeks, full of desire; and you have a white\n        skin from careful preparation, hunting after Aphrodite by your beauty not exposed to strokes of the sun, but\n        beneath the shade.’\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 19. 6 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Amongst the scenes depicted on the chest of Kypselos dedicated at Olympia :] Dionysos is lying down in a\n        cave, a bearded figure holding a golden cup, and clad in a tunic reaching to the feet. Around him are vines,\n        apple-trees and pomegranate-trees.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 15 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"There are countless characteristics of Dionysos for those who wish to represent him in painting or\n        sculpture, by depicting which even approximately the artist has captured the god. For instance, the ivy clusters\n        forming a crown are the clear mark of Dionysos, even if the workmanship is poor; and a horn just springing from\n        the temples reveals Dionysos, and a leopard, though but just visible, is a symbol of the god.\"\n\nCallistratus, Descriptions 6 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd to 4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[From a description of an ancient Greek statue of Kairos (Caerus) :] He resembled Dionysos; for his\n        forehead glistened with graces and his cheeks, reddening to youthful bloom, were radiantly beautiful, conveying\n        to the beholder's eye a delicate blush.\"\n\nCallistratus, Descriptions 8 :\n        \"[Description of an ancient Greek statue of Dionysos by Praxiteles :] On the statue of Dionysos . . . The\n        hands of Praxiteles wrought works of art that were altogether alive. There was a grove, and in it stood Dionysos\n        in the form of a young man, so delicate that the bronze was transformed into flesh, with a body so supple and\n        relaxed that it seemed to consist of some different material instead of bronze : for though it was really\n        bronze, it nevertheless blushed, and though it had no part in life, it sought to show the appearance of life and\n        would yield to the very finger-tip if you touched it, for though it was really compact bronze, it was so\n        softened into flesh by art that it shrank from the contact of the hand. It had the bloom of youth, it was full\n        of daintiness, it melted with desire, as indeed Euripides represented him when he fashioned his image in the\n        Bakkhai. A wreath of ivy encircled his head--since the bronze was in truth ivy, bent as it was into\n        sprays and holding up the curly locks which fell in profusion from his forehead. And it was full of laughter,\n        nay, it wholly passed the bounds of wonder in that the material gave out evidence of joy and the bronze feigned\n        to represent the emotions. A fawn-skin clothed the statue, not such as Dionysos was accustomed to wear, but the\n        bronze was transformed to imitate the pelt; and he stood resting his left hand on a thyrsos, and the thyrsos\n        deceived the beholder's vision; for while it was wrought of bronze it seemed to glisten with the greenness of\n        young growth, as though it were actually transformed into the plant itself. The eye was gleaming with fire, in\n        appearance the eye of a man in a frenzy; for the bronze exhibited the Bakkhic madness and seemed to be divinely\n        inspired, just as, I think, Praxiteles had the power to infuse into the statue also the Bakkhic\n        ecstasy.\"\n        [N.B. Extant statues of this type include the \"Bacchus de Versailles\" in the Louvre and the Dionysus\n        in Madrid.]\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 3. 550 ff (trans.
