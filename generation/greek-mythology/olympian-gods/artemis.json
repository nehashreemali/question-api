  "content": "ARTEMIS was the Olympian goddess of hunting, the wilderness and wild animals. She was also a goddess of\n        childbirth, and the protectress of the girl child up to the age of marriage--her twin brother Apollon was similarly the protector of the boy child. Together the two gods were also\n        bringers of sudden death and disease--Artemis targetted women and girls, Apollon men and boys.\n\nIn ancient art Artemis was usually depicted as a girl or young maiden with a hunting bow and quiver of arrows.\n\nArtemis' mother Leto was hounded throughout her pregnancy by the jealous goddess Hera but eventually found\n        refuge on the floating island of Delos. There she gave birth to Artemis who assisted her mother as midwife with\n        the birth of her younger twin-brother Apollon.<<More>>\n\nKallisto (Callisto) was a handmaiden of the goddess who Zeus seduced by assuming her form. When Artemis\n        discovered the girl was pregnant she transformed her into a bear and exiled her to the wilds. <<More>>\n\nThe handsome giant Orion was a companion of the goddess but her jealous brother Apollon tricked her into\n        killing him with a distant bow-shot. In her grief Artemis placed him amongst the stars as the constellation\n        Orion.<<More>>\n\nWhen the Aloadai (Aloadae) giants tried to storm Olympos, Artemis assumed the form of a doe and raced between\n        them causing the pair to cast their spears, miss, and strike each other dead.<<More>>\n\nThe hunter Aktaion (Actaeon) spied upon the goddess as she was bathing with her nymphs at a spring. Angered,\n        she transformed him into a stag and had him torn apart by his own hounds.<<More>>\n\nThe giant Kalydonian (Calydonian) Boar was sent by Artemis to ravage the lands of King Oineus as punishment for\n        neglecting her in his sacrifices to the gods.<<More>>\n\nAs the Greek fleet was preparing to sail for Troy, King Agamamnon offended Artemis and she becalmed the waters\n        preventing their departure. To appease the goddess the king was forced to sacrifice his own daughter Iphigeneia,\n        but she snatched the girl safely away from the altar and replaced her with a doe.<<More>>\n\nArtemis was a divine ally of the Trojans during the Trojan War. In a clash between the rival factions of gods\n        she confronted Hera, but the Queen of the Gods tore the bow from her hands, beat her about the head, and sent\n        her fleeing back to Olympos in tears. <<More>>\n\nMany other myths are detailed over the following pages.\n\nArtemis' most distinctive attributes were her bow and arrows but she was also sometimes equipped with a quiver,\n        pair of hunting spears, torch, lyre, and/or water-jug.\n        The goddess was clothed in a knee-length girl's dress or a full-length woman's robe (chiton), with a\n        cloak (chlamys, himation), headgear (a crown, tiara, headband, bonnet or animal-pelt cap), and\n        occasionally the pelt of a deer draped across her shoulders. <<More>>\n\nBelow are some examples of her attributes as depicted in ancient Greek art:-\n\n1. Bow & arrows; 2. Quiver; 3. Hunting spears; 4. Torch; 5. Lyre;\n\n6. Crown; 7. Head-band; 8. Bonnet; 9. Animal-pelt cap; 10. Deer-skin cape.\n\nArtemis' sacred animal was the deer. She drove a chariot drawn by a pair of the beasts and was often depicted\n        holding or hunting a deer or with a deer-skin cape draped over her shoulders. <<More>>\n        In myth the most celebrated of her sacred animals was the golden-horned Cerynitian Hind which Herakles was sent\n        to fetch as one of his Twelve Labours. <<More>>\n        The bear was also sacred to Artemis as well as a variety of water- and ground-birds such as partridges, quails\n        and guinea-fowl.\n        Her sacred plants were the cypress-tree and the palm-tree. <<More>>\n\nBelow are examples of the goddess' animal companions as depicted in ancient Greek art:-\n\nThis site contains a total of 15 pages describing the goddess, including general descriptions, mythology, and\n        cult. The content is outlined in the Index of Artemis Pages (left column or below).\n\n[1] ZEUS & LETO (Hesiod Theogony 918, Hesiod Works & Days 770, Homer Iliad 1.9 & 21.495, Homer\n          Odyssey 6.100 & 11.318, Homeric Hymn 27 to Artemis, Orphic Hymn 35, Pindar Nemean Ode 6 & 8, Pindar\n          Processional Song on Delos, Callimachus Hymn to Artemis & Hymn to Delos, Apollodorus 1.21 & 3.46,\n          Pausanias 8.9.1 & 8.53.1. Hyginus Fabulae 9 & 140, et al)\n        [2] DEMETER (Aeschylus, Pausanias 8.37.3)\n\nArtemis was a daughter of Zeus, King of the Gods, and the Titaness Leto and the twin-sister of the god Apollon\n        (Apollo). Her mother was hounded by Zeus' jealous wife Hera throughout her pregnancy and was forced to wander\n        the world in search of safe refuge. She was the first of the twins born and, being a precocious divine child,\n        assisted her mother with the birth of her younger twin brother. <<More>>\n        Artemis was a granddaughter of four of the elder Titans: Kronos (Cronus), Rheia, Koios (Coeus) and Phoibe\n        (Phoebe). She was a half-sister of many of the other Olympian gods including Athena, Ares, Hermes, Dionysos and\n        Persephone.\n        Artemis was a virgin goddess but unlike her sister Athena she was often portrayed as a girl child rather than as\n        an adult woman.\n\nBelow are two graphics depicting Artemis' family tree, the first with names transliterated from the Greek and\n        the second with the common English spellings:-\n\nARTEMIS, one of the great divinities of the Greeks. Her name is usually derived from artemês, uninjured,\n        healthy, vigorous; according to which she would be the goddess who is herself inviolate and vigorous, and also\n        grants strength and health to others. (Plat. Cratyl. p. 406, b. ; Strab. xiv. p. 635; Eustath. ad Hom. pp. 32,\n        577, 1732.) According to the Homeric account and Hesiod (Theog. 918) she was the daughter of Zeus and Leto,\n        whence Aeschylus (Sept. 148) calls her lêtôgeneia. She was the sister of Apollo, and born with him\n        at the same time in the island of Delos. According to a tradition which Pausanias (viii. 37. § 3) found in\n        Aeschylus, Artemis was a daughter of Demeter, and not of Leto, while according to an Egyptian story (Herod. ii.\n        156) she was the daughter of Dionysus and Isis, and Leto was only her nurse. But these and some other legends\n        are only the results of the identification of the Greek Artemis with other local or foreign divinities. The\n        place of her birth is for the same reason not the same in all traditions : some say that it was the grove of\n        Ortygia near Ephesus (Tacit. Annal. iii. 61; Schol. ad Pind. Nem. i. 1), others that it was Crete (Diod. v. 72),\n        and others again, that she was the sister of Apollo, but born somewhat earlier, so that she was able to assist\n        Leto in giving birth to Apollo. (Orph Hymn. 34. 5; Spanheim, ad Callim. p. 476, &c.)\n\nIn the description of the nature and character of this goddess, it is necessary to distinguish between the\n        different points of view from which the Greeks regarded her, and also between the really Greek Artemis and\n        certain foreign divinities, who for some resemblance or another were identified by the Greeks with their own\n        Artemis.\n\n1. Artemis as the sister of Apollo, is a kind of female Apollo, that is, she as a female divinity\n        represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity. This relation between the two is in many other\n        cases described as the relation of husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually\n        described Artemis as the wife of Apollo. (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1197.) In the character of sister of\n        Apollo, Artemis is like her brother armed with a bow, quiver, and arrows, and sends plague and death among men\n        and animals : she is a thea apollousa. Sudden deaths, but more especially those of women, are described as the\n        effect of her arrows. (Hom. Il. vi. 205, 427, &c., xix. 59, xxi. 483, &c.; Od. xi.\n        172, &c., 324, xv. 478, xviii. 202, xx. 61, &c., v. 124, &c.) She also acts sometimes in conjunction\n        with her brother. (Od. xv. 410; Il. xxiv. 606.)\n\nAs Apollo was not only a destructive god, but also averted the evils which it was in his power to inflict, so\n        Artemis was at the same time a thea sôteira; that is, she cured and alleviated the sufferings of mortals.\n        Thus, for instance, she healed Aeneas, when he was wounded and carried into the temple of Apollo. (Il.\n        v. 447.) In the Trojan war she sided, like Apollo, with the Trojans. The man whom she looked graciously upon was\n        prosperous in his fields and flocks, his household was thriving, and he died in old age. (Callim. Hymn. in\n          Dian. 129, &c.)\n\nShe was more especially the protectress of the young, whence the epithets paidotrophos, kourotrophos, and\n        philomeirax (comp. Diod. v. 73); and Aeschylus (Agam. 142) calls her the protectress of young\n        sucking-animals, and of the game ranging through the forests of the mountains. Artemis thus also came to be\n        regarded as the goddess of the flocks and the chase: she is the huntress among the immortals ; she is called the\n        stag-killer (elaphêbolos), the lover of the tumult connected with the chase (keladeinê), and\n        agrotera. (Il. xxi. 511, 485, &c.; Hom. Hymn. in Dian. 10.)\n\nArtemis is moreover, like Apollo, unmarried; she is a maiden divinity never conquered by love. (Soph.\n        Elect. 1220.) The priests and priestesses devoted to her service were bound to live pure and chaste,\n        and trangressions of their vows of chastity were severely punished. (Paus. vii. 19. § 1. viii. 13. §\n        1.) She was worshipped in several places together with her brother; and the worship of both divinities was\n        believed to have come from the Hyperboreans, and Hyperborean maidens brought sacrifices to Delos. (Herod. ii.\n        32, 35.) The laurel was sacred to both divinities, and both were regarded as the founders and protectors of\n        towns and streets. (Paus. i. 38. § 6, iii. 24. § 6, viii. 36, in fin. ; Aeschyl. Sept. 450;\n        Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 34.)\n\nThere are, however, some points also, in which there is no resemblance between Artemis and Apollo : she has\n        nothing to do with music or poetry, nor is there any trace of her having been regarded as an oracular divinity\n        like Apollo. Respecting the real and original character of Artemis as the sister of Apollo, we encounter the\n        same difficulties as those mentioned in the article Apollo, viz. as to whether she was a purely spiritual and\n        ethical divinity, as Müller thinks, or whether she was the representative of some power in physical nature;\n        and the question must be decided here in the same manner as in the case of Apollo.\n\nWhen Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or Helios, nothing was more natural than that his sister\n        should be regarded as Selene or the moon, and accordingly the Greek Artemis is, at least in later times, the\n        goddess of the moon. Buttmann and Hermann consider this idea of Artemis being the moon as the fundamental one\n        from which all the others are derived. But, at any rate, the idea of Artemis being the goddess of the moon, must\n        be confined to Artemis the sister of Apollo, and is not applicable to the Arcadian, Taurian, or Ephesian\n        Artemis.\n\n2. The Arcadian Artemis is a goddess of the nymphs, and was worshipped as such in Arcadia in very\n        early times. Her sanctuaries and temples were more numerous in this country than in any other part of Greece.\n        There was no connexion between the Arcadian Artemis and Apollo, nor are there any traces here of the ethical\n        character which is so prominent in Artemis, the sister of Apollo. These circumstances, together with the fact,\n        that her surnames and epithets in Arcadia are nearly all derived from the mountains, rivers, and lakes, shew\n        that here she was the representative of some part or power of nature. In Arcadia she hunted with her nymphs on\n        Taygetus, Erymanthus, and Maenalus; twenty nymphs accompanied her during the chase, and with sixty others,\n        daughters of Oceanus, she held her dances in the forests of the mountains. Her bow, quiver, and arrows, were\n        made by Hephaestus, and Pan provided her with dogs. Her chariot was drawn by four stags with golden antlers.\n        (Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 13, 81, 90, &c.; Apollod. ii. 5. § 3; Pind. Ol. iii. 51.) Her\n        temples and sanctuaries in Arcadia were usually near lakes or rivers, whence she was called limnêtis or\n        limnaia. (Paus. ii. 7. § 6, iii. 23. § 6, iv. 4. § 2, 31. § 3, viii. 53. § 5.) In the\n        precincts of her sanctuaries there were often sacred wells, as at Corinth. (Paus. ii. 3. § 5, iii. 20.\n        § 7.) As a nymph, Artemis also appears in connexion with river gods, as with Alpheius, and thus it is\n        intelligible why fish were sacred to her. (Diod. v. 3.)\n\n3. The Taurian Artemis. The legends of this goddess are mystical, and her worship was orgiastic and\n        connected, at least in early times, with human sacrifices. According to the Greek legend there was in Tauris a\n        goddess, whom the Greeks for some reason identified with their own Artemis. and to whom all strangers that were\n        thrown on the coast of Tauris, were sacrificed. (Eurip. Iph. Taur. 36.) Iphigeneia and Orestes brought\n        her image from thence, and landed at Brauron in Attica, whence the goddess derived the name of Brauronia. (Paus.\n        i. 23. § 9, 33. § 1, iii. 16, in fin.) The Brauronian Artemis was worshipped at Athens and Sparta, and\n        in the latter place the boys were scourged at her altar in such a manner that it became sprinkled with their\n        blood. This cruel ceremony was believed to have been introduced by Lycurgus, instead of the human sacrifices\n        which had until then been offered to her. (Dict. of Ant. s. v. Braurônia and\n        Diamastigôsis.)\n\nHer name at Sparta was Orthia, with reference to the phallus, or because her statue stood erect. According to\n        another tradition, Orestes and Iphigeneia concealed the image of the Taurian goddess in a bundle of brushwood,\n        and carried it to Aricia in Latium. Iphigeneia, who was at first to have been sacrificed to Artemis, and then\n        became her priestess, was afterwards identified with the goddess (Herod. iv. 103; Paus. i. 43. § 1), who\n        was worshipped in some parts of Greece, as at Hermione, under the name of Iphigeneia. (Paus. ii. 35. § 1.)\n        Some traditions stated, that Artemis made Iphigeneia immortal, in the character of Hecate, the goddess of the\n        moon.\n\nA kindred divinity, if not the same as the Taurian Artemis, is Artemis tauropolos, whose worship was connected\n        with bloody sacrifices, and who produced madness in the minds of men, at least the chorus in the Ajax of\n        Sophocles, describes the madness of Ajax as the work of this divinity. In the legends about the Taurian Artemis,\n        it seems that separate local traditions of Greece are mixed up with the legends of some Asiatic divinity, whose\n        symbol in the heaven was the moon, and on the earth the cow.\n\n4. The Ephesian Artemis was a divinity totally distinct from the Greek goddess of the same name. She\n        seems to have been the personification of the fructifying and all-nourishing powers of nature. It is an opinion\n        almost universally adopted, that she was an ancient Asiatic divinity whose worship the Greeks found established\n        in Ionia, when they settled there, and that, for some resemblance they discovered, they applied to her the name\n        of Artemis. As soon as this identity of the Asiatic goddess with the Greek Artemis was recognised, other\n        features, also originally peculiar to the Greek Artemis, were transferred to her; and thus she is called a\n        daughter of Leto, who gave birth to her in the neighbourhood of Ephesus. Her original character is sufficiently\n        clear from the fact, that her priests were eunuchs, and that her image in the magnificent temple of Ephesus\n        represented her with many breasts (polumastos). The whole figure of the goddess resembled a mummy : her\n        head was surmounted with a mural crown (corona muralis), and the lower part of her body, which ended in\n        a point, like a pyramid upside down, was covered with figures of mystical animals. (Strab. xiv. p. 641; Paus.\n        iv. 31. § 6, vii. 5. § 2., The symbol of this divinity was a bee, and her highpriest bore the name of\n        king (essên). Her worship was said to have been established at Ephesus by the Amazons. (Paus. ii. 7.\n        § 4, viii. 12. § 1; Hesych. and Suid. s. v. essên.)\n\nRespecting some other divinities, or attributes of divinities, which were likewise regarded as identical with\n        Artemis in Greece, see Britomartis, Dictynna, and EileithyiaI. The Romans identified their goddess Diana with\n        the Greek Artemis, and at a comparatively early time they transferred to their own goddess all the peculiar\n        features of the Greek Artemis. The worship of Artemis was universal in all Greece, in Delos, Crete, Sicily, and\n        southern Italy, but more especially in Arcadia and the whole of the Peloponnesus. The sacrifices offered to the\n        Brauronian Artemis consisted of stags and goats; in Thrace dogs were offered to Artemis. Among the animals\n        sacred to the Greek Artemis we may mention the stag, boar, dog, and others; the fir-tree was likewise sacred to\n        her.\n\nIt is impossible to trace the various relations in which Artemis appears to us to one common source, or to one\n        fundamental idea : the very manner in which such a complicated mythus was formed renders the attempt futile, or,\n        to say the least, forced. In the case of Artemis, it is evident, that new elements and features were added in\n        various places to the ancient local mythus; the worship of one divinity is identified with that of another, and\n        the legends of the two are mixed up into one, or those of the one are transferred to the other, whose legends\n        then sink into oblivion.\n\nThe representations of the Greek Artemis in works of art are different accordingly as she is represented either\n        as a huntress, or as the goddess of the moon; yet in either case she appears as a youthful and vigorous\n        divinity, as becomes the sister of Apollo. As the huntress, she is tall, nimble, and has small hips; her\n        forehead is high, her eyes glancing freely about, and her hair tied up behind in such a manner, that some locks\n        float down her neck; her breast is covered, and the legs up to the knees are naked, the rest being covered by\n        the chlamys. Her attributes are the bow, quiver, and arrows, or a spear, stags, and dogs. As the goddess of the\n        moon, she wears a long robe which reaches down to her feet, a veil covers her head, and above her forehead rises\n        the crescent of the moon. In her hand she often appears holding a torch.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomeric Hymn 9 to Artemis (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th to 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Mousa (Muse), sing of Artemis, sister of the far-shooter (hekatos), Parthenos the virgin who\n        delights in arrows (iokheaira), who was fostered with Apollon.

On their cattle plague feeds, on their tilth feeds frost, and the old men cut their hair in\n        mourning over their sons, and their wives either are smitten or die in childbirth, or, if they escape, bear\n        birds whereof none stands on upright ankle.\n        But on whomsoever thou lookest smiling and gracious, for them the tilth bears the corn-ear abundantly, and\n        abundantly prospers the four-footed breed, and abundant waxes their prosperity: neither do they go to the tomb,\n        save when they carry thither the aged. Nor does faction wound their race--faction which ravages even the\n        well-established houses: but brother's wife and husband's sister set their chairs around one board . . . \n        Lady, of that number be whosoever is a true friend of mine, and of that number may I be myself, O Queen. And may\n        song be my study forever. In that song shall be the Marriage of Leto; therein thy name shall often-times be\n        sung; therein shall Apollon be and therein all thy labours, and therein thy hounds and thy bow and thy chariot,\n        which lightly carry thee in thy splendour, when thou drivest to the house of Zeus . . . \n        But when the Nymphai (Nymphs) encircle thee in the dance, near the springs of Aigyptian (Egyptian) Inopos [on\n        the island of Delos] or Pitane [in Aiolia or Lakonia]--for Pitane too is thine--or in Limnai [in Lakonia] or\n        where, goddess, thou camest from Skythia (Scythia) to dwell, in Alai Araphenides [i.e. Brauron in Attika],\n        renouncing the rites of the Tauroi [of Skythia], then may not my kine cleave a four-acred fallow field for a\n        wage at the hand of an alien ploughman; else surely lame and weary of neck would they come to the byre, yea even\n        were they of Stymphaian breed, nine years of age, drawing by the horns; which kine are far the best for cleaving\n        a deep furrow; for the god Helios never passes by that beauteous dance, but stays his car to gaze upon the\n        sight, and the lights of day are lengthened.\n        Which now of islands, what hill finds most favour with thee? What haven? What city? Which of the Nymphai\n        (Nymphs) dost thou love above the rest, and what heroines hast thou taken for thy companions? Say, goddess, thou\n        to me, and I will sing thy saying to others. Of islands, Dolikhe [Ikaria] hath found favour with thee, of cities\n        Perge [in Pamphylia], of hills Taygetos [in Lakedaimonia], the havens of Euripos [in Euboia].\n        And beyond others thou lovest the Nymphe of Gortyn, Britomartis, slayer of stags, the goodly archer . . . Yea\n        and Kyrene (Cyrene) thou madest thy comrade, to whom on a time thyself didst give two hunting dogs, with whom\n        the maiden daughter of Hypseus beside the Iolkian tomb won the prize.And the fair-haired [Prokris (Procris)]\n        wife of Kephalos (Cephalus), son of Deioneus, O Lady, thou madest thy fellow in the chase and fair Antikleia\n        [mother of Odysseus], they say, thou dist love even as thine own eyes. These were the first who wore the gallant\n        bow and arrow-holding quivers on their shoulders; their right shoulders bore the quiver strap, and always the\n        right breast showed bare. Further thou dist greatly commend swift-footed Atalanta, the slayer of boards,\n        daughter of Arkadian Iasios (Arcadian Iasius), and taught her hunting with dogs and good archery . . .\n        Lady of many shrines, of many cities, hail! Khitone (Goddess of the Tunic), sojourner in Miletos; for thee did\n        Neleus [i.e. the founder of Miletos] make his Guide, when he put off with his ships from the land of Kekrops\n        (Cecrops) [i.e. Attika].\n        Khesias (Chesias) (Lady of Khesion) and Imbrasia (Lady of Imbrasos), throned in the highest, to thee in thy\n        shrine did Agamemnon dedicate the rudder of his ship, a charm against ill weather, when thou didst bind the\n        winds for him, what time the Akhaian (Achaean) ships sailed to vex the cities of the Teukroi [i.e. the Trojans],\n        wroth for Rhamnusian Helene.\n        For thee surely Proitos (Proetus) established two shrines, one of Artemis Kore (Core) (Maidenhood) for that thou\n        dist gather for him his maiden daughters, when they were wandering over the Azanian hills; the other he founded\n        in Lousa to Artemis Hemere (the Gentle), because thou tookest from his daughters the spirit of wildness.\n        For thee, too, the Amazones (Amazons), whose mind is set on war, in Ephesos (Ephesus) beside the sea established\n        an image beneath an oak trunk, and Hippo [an Amazon queen] performed a holy rite for thee, and they themselves,\n        O Oupis (Opis) Queen, around the image danced a war-dance--first in shields and armour, and again in a circle\n        arraying a spacious choir. And the loud pipes thereto piped shrill accompaniment, that they might foot the dance\n        together (for not yet did they pierce the bones of the fawn [to create flutes], Athene's handiwork, a bane to\n        the deer). And the echo reached unto Sardis and to the Berekynthian range [in Phrygia]. And they with their feet\n        geat loudly and therewith their quivers rattled. And afterwards around that image was raised a shrine of broad\n        foundations. That it shall dawn behold nothing more divine, naught richer. Easily would it outdo Pytho\n        [Delphoi].\n        Wherefore in this madness insolent Lygdamis threatened that he would lay it waste, and brought against it a host\n        of Kimmerians (Cimmerians) which milk mares, in number as the sand; who have their homes hard by the Straights\n        of the cow, daughter of Inakhos (Inachus). Ah! Foolish among kings, how greatly he sinned! For not destined to\n        return again to Skythia was either he or any other of those whose wagons stood in the Kaytrian plain [of Lydia];\n        for thy shafts are ever more set as a defense before Ephesos. O Mounikhia (Munichia) (Lady of Mounykhia),\n        Limenoskope (Watcher of Harbours), hail, Pheraia (Pheraea) (Lady of Pherai)!\n        Let none disparage Artemis. For Oineus (Oeneus) dishonoured her altar and no pleasant struggles came upon his\n        city.\n        Nor let any contend with her in shooting of stags or in archery. For the son of Atreus [Agamemnon] vaunted him\n        not that he suffered small requital. Neither let any woo the Maiden; for not Otos (Otus), nor Orion wooed her to\n        their own good. Nor let any shun the yearly dance; for not tearless to Hippo [an Amazon queen] was her refusal\n        to dance around the altar.\n        Hail, great queen, and graciously greet my song.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 2 to Prothhyraea (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"To Prothyraia [Artemis], Fumigation from Storax. O venerable Goddess, hear my prayer, for labour pains are\n        thy peculiar care. In thee, when stretched upon the bed of grief, the sex, as in a mirror, view relief. Guard of\n        the race, endued with gentle mind, to helpless youth benevolent and kind; benignant nourisher; great nature's\n        key belongs to no divinity but thee. Thou dwellest with all immanifest to sight, and solemn festivals are thy\n        delight. Thine is the task to loose the virgin's zone and thou in every work art seen and known. With births you\n        sympathise, though pleased to see the numerous offspring of fertility. When racked with labour pangs, and sore\n        distressed the sex invoke thee, as the soul's sure rest; for thou Eileithyia alone canst give relief to pain,\n        which art attempts to ease, but tries in vain. Artemis Eileithyia, venerable power, who bringest relief in\n        labour's dreadful hour; hear, Prothyraia and make the infant race thy constant care.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 36 to Artemis :\n        \"To Artemis, Fumigation from Manna. Hear me, Zeus' daughter, celebrated queen, Bromia and Titanis, of a\n        noble mien: in darts rejoicing, and on all to shine, torch-bearing Goddess, Diktynna (Dictynna) divine. Over\n        births presiding, and thyself a maid, to labour pangs imparting ready aid: dissolver of the zone, and wrinkled\n        care, fierce huntress, glorying in the sylvan war: swift in the course, in dreadful arrows skilled, wandering by\n        night, rejoicing in the field: of manly form, erect, of bounteous mind, illustrious Daimon, nurse of humankind:\n        immortal, earthly, bane of monsters fell, 'tis thine, blest maid, on woody mounts to dwell: foe of the stag,\n        whom woods and dogs delight, in endless youth you flourish fair and bright.
