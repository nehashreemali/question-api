  "content": "PERSEPHONE was the goddess queen of the underworld, wife of the god Haides (Hades).\n        She was also the goddess of spring growth, who was worshipped alongside her mother Demeter in the Eleusinian Mysteries. This agricultural-based cult promised\n        its initiates passage to a blessed afterlife.\n\nPersephone was titled Kore (Core) (the Maiden) as the goddess of spring's bounty. Once upon a time when she\n        was playing in a flowery meadow with her Nymph companions, Kore was seized by Haides and carried off to the\n        underworld as his bride. Her mother Demeter despaired at her dissappearance and searched for her the throughout\n        the world accompanied by the goddess Hekate (Hecate) bearing torches. When she learned\n        that Zeus had conspired in her daughter's abduction she was furious, and\n        refused to let the earth fruit until Persephone was returned. Zeus consented, but because the girl had tasted of\n        the food of Haides--a handful of pomegranate seeds--she was forced to forever spend a part of the year with her\n        husband in the underworld. Her annual return to the earth in spring was marked by the flowering of the meadows\n        and the sudden growth of the new grain. Her return to the underworld in winter, conversely, saw the dying down\n        of plants and the halting of growth.\n\nIn other myths, Persephone appears exclusively as the queen of the underworld, receiving the likes of Herakles\n        and Orpheus at her court.\n\nPersephone was usually depicted as a young goddess holding sheafs of grain and a flaming torch. Sometimes she\n        was shown in the company of her mother Demeter, and the hero Triptolemos, the teacher of agriculture. At other times she\n        appears enthroned beside Haides.\n\n[1] ZEUS & DEMETER\n        (Hesiod Theogony 912, Homeric Hymn 2 to Demeter, Apollodorus 1.29, Pausanias, Ovid\n          Metamorphoses 5.501, Ovid Fasti 4.575, Nonnus Dionysiaca 5.562, et al)\n        [2] ZEUS & STYX (Apollodorus 1.13)\n\n[1] ZAGREUS (by Zeus) (Orphic Hymn 29, Hyginus Fabulae 155, Diodorus Siculus 4.4.1, Nonnus Dionysiaca 6.155,\n          Suidas s.v. Zagreus)\n        [2] MELINOE (by Zeus) (Orphic Hymn 71)\n        [3] THE ERINYES (by Haides) (Orphic Hymns 29 & 70)\n\nPERSE′PHONE (Persephonê), in Latin Proserpina, the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. (Hom.\n        Il. xiv. 326, Od. xi. 216; Hes. Theog. 912, &c. ; Apollod. i. 5. § 1.) Her\n        name is commonly derived from pherein phonon, \"to bring\" or \"cause death,\" and the form Persephone occurs first\n        in Hesiod (Theog. 913; comp. Hom. Hymm. in Cer. 56), the Homeric form being Persephoneia. But\n        besides these forms of the name, we also find Persephassa, Phersephassa, Persephatta, Phersephatta.\n        Pherrephassa, Pherephatta, and Phersephoneia, for which various etymologies have been proposed. The Latin\n        Proserpina, which is probably only a corruption of the Greek, was erroneously derived by the Romans from\n        proserpere, \"to shoot forth.\" (Cic. de Nat. Deor. ii. 26.) Being the infernal goddess of\n        death, she is also called a daughter of Zeus and Styx (Apollod. i. 3. § 1 ); in Arcadia she was worshipped\n        under the name of Despoena, and was called a daughter of Poseidon Hippius and Demeter, and said to have been\n        brought up by the Titan Anytus. (Paus. viii. 37. § 3, 6, 25. § 5.) Homer describes her as the wife of\n        Hades, and the formidable, venerable, and majestic queen of the Shades, who exercises her power, and carries\n        into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead, along with her husband. (Hom. Od. x. 494, xi.\n        226, 385, 634, Il. ix. 457, 569; comp. Apollod. i. 9. § 15.) Hence she is called by later writers\n        Juno Inferna, Auerna, and Stygia (Virg. Aen. vi. 138; Ov. Met. xiv. 114),\n        and the Erinnyes are said to have been daughters of her by Pluto. (Orph. Hymn. 29. 6, 6, 70. 3.) Groves\n        sacred to her are said by Homer to be in the western extremity of the earth, on the frontiers of the lower\n        world, which is itself called the house of Persephone. (Od. x. 491, 509.)\n\nThe story of her being carried off by Pluto, against her will, is not mentioned by Homer, who simply describes\n        her as his wife and queen; and her abduction is first mentioned by Hesiod (Theog. 914). Zeus, it is\n        said, advised Pluto, who was in love with the beautiful Persephone, to carry her off, as her mother, Demeter,\n        was not likely to allow her daughter to go down to Hades. (Comp. Hygin. Fab. 146.) Pluto accordingly\n        carried her off while she was gathering flowers with Artemis and Athena. (Comp. Diod. v. 3.) Demeter, when she\n        found her daughter had disappeared, searched for her all over the earth with torches, until at length she\n        discovered the place of her abode. Her anger at the abduction obliged Zeus to request Pluto to send Persephone\n        (or Cora, i. e. the maiden or daughter) back. Pluto indeed complied with the request, but first gave her a\n        kernel of a pomegranate to eat, whereby she became doomed to the lower world, and an agreement was made that\n        Persephone should spend one third (later writers say one half) of every year in Hades with Pluto, and\n        the remaining two thirds with the gods above. (Apollod. i. 5. 1, &c,; Or. Met. v. 565; comp.\n        Demeter.) The place where Persephone was said to have been carried off, is different in the various local\n        traditions. The Sicilians, among whom her worship was probably introduced by the Corinthian and Megarian\n        colonists, believed that Pluto found her in the meadows near Enna, and that the well Cyane arose on the spot\n        where he descended with her into the lower world. (Diod. v. 3, &c.; comp. Lydus, De Mens. p. 286;\n        Ov. Fast. iv. 422.) The Cretans thought that their own island had been the scene of the rape (Schol.\n        ad Hes. Theog. 913), and the Eleusinians mentioned the Nysaean plain in Boeotia, and said that\n        Persephone had descended with Pluto into the lower world at the entrance of the western Oceanus. Later accounts\n        place the rape in Attica, near Athens (Schol. ad Soph. Oed. Col. 1590) or at Erineos near Eleusis\n        (Paus. i. 38. § 5), or in the neighbourhood of Lerna (ii. 36. § 7 ; respecting other localities see\n        Conon, Narr. 15 ; Orph. Argon. 1192; Spanheim, ad Callim. Hymn. in Cer. 9).\n\nThe story according to which Persephone spent one part of the year in the lower world, and another with the\n        gods above, made her, even with the ancients, the symbol of vegetation which shoots forth in spring, and the\n        power of which withdraws into the earth at other seasons of the year. (Schol. ad Theocrit. iii. 48.)\n        Hence Plutarch identifies her with spring, and Cicero De Nat. Deor. ii. 26) calls her the seed of the\n        fruits of the field. (Comp. Lydus, De Mes. pp. 90, 284; Porphyr. De Ant. Nymph. p. 118. ed.\n        Barnes.) In the mysteries of Eleusis, the return of Cora from the lower world was regarded as the symbol of\n        immortality, and hence she was frequently represented on sarcophagi. In the mystical theories of the Orphics,\n        and what are called the Platonists, Cora is described as the all-pervading goddess of nature, who both produces\n        and destroys every thing (Orph. Hymn. 29. 16), and she is therefore mentioned along, or identified\n        with, other mystic divinities, such as Isis, Rhea, Ge, Hestia, Pandora, Artemis, Hecate. (Tzetz. ad\n          Lyc. 708, 1176; Schol. ad Apollon. Rlod. iii. 467; Schol. ad Theocrit. ii. 12 ; Serv.\n        ad Aen. iv. 609.) This mystic Persephone is further said to have become by Zeus the mother of Dionysus,\n        Iacchus, Zagreus or Sabazius. (Hesych. s. v. Zagreus; Schol. ad Eurip. Or. 952 ; Aristoph.\n        Ran. 326; Diod. iv. 4; Arrian. Exped. Al. ii. 16; Lydus De Mens. p. 198; Cic. de\n          Nat. Deor. iii. 23.) The surnames which are given to her by the poets, refer to her character as\n        queen of the lower world and of the dead, or to her symbolic meaning which we have pointed out above. She was\n        commonly worshipped along with Demeter, and with the same mysteries, as for example, with Demeter Cabeiria in\n        Boeotia. (Paus. ix. 25. § 5.) Her worship further is mentioned at Thebes, which Zeus is said to have given\n        to her as an acknowledgment for a favour she had bestowed on him (Schol. ad Eurip. Phoen. 687): in like\n        manner Sicily was said to have been given to her at her wedding (Pind. Nem. i. 17; Diod. v.2; Schol.\n        ad Theocrit. xv. 14), and two festivals were celebrated in her honour in the island, the one at the\n        time of sowing, and the other at the time of harvest. (Diod. v. 4; Athen. iv. p. 647.) The Eleusinian mysteries\n        belonged to Demeter and Cora in common, and to her alone were dedicated the mysteries celebrated at Athens in\n        the month of Anthesterion. (Comp. Paus. i. 31. § 1, &c.) Temples of Persephone are mentioned at\n        Corinth, Megara, Sparta, and at Locri in the south of Italy. (Paus. iii. 13. § 2; Liv. xxix. 8, 18; Appian,\n        iii. 12.) In works of art Persephone is seen very frequently: she bears the grave and severe character of an\n        infernal Juno, or she appears as a mystical divinity with a sceptre and a little box, but she was mostly\n        represented in the act of being carried off by Pluto.

This was a son born to Zeus in dragonbed by Persephoneia, the consort of the blackrobed king\n        of the underworld [Haides]; when Zeus put on a deceiving shape of many coils, as a gentle drakon twining around\n        her in lovely curves, and ravished the maidenhood of unwedded Persephoneia; though she was hidden when all that\n        dwelt in Olympos were bewitched by this one girl, rivals in love for the marriageable maid, and offered their\n        dowers for an unsmirched bridal. Hermes had not yet gone to the bed of Peitho, and he offered his rod as gift to\n        adorn her chamber. Apollon produced his melodious harp as a marriage-gift. Ares brought spear and cuirass for\n        the wedding, and shield as bride-gift. Lemnian Hephaistos (Hephaestus) held out a curious necklace of many\n        colours, new made and breathing still of the furnace, poor hobbler! For he had already, though unwilling,\n        rejected his former bride Aphrodite, when he spied her rioting with Ares . . .\n        And father Zeus was much more bewitched by Persephoneia. When Zeus spied the virgin beauty of her shape, his eye\n        ran ahead of him to guide all the Erotes (Loves), and could not have enough of Persephone; in his heart storms\n        of unsleeping passion raged without ceasing, and gradually a greater furnace of the Paphian [Aphrodite] was\n        kindled from a small spark; the gaze of lovemaddened Zeus was enslaved by the lovely breast of the goddess. Once\n        she was amusing herself with a resplendent bronze plate, which reflected her face like a judge of beauty; and\n        she confirmed the image of her shape by this free voiceless herald, testing the unreal form in the shadow of the\n        mirror, and smiling at the mimic likeness. Thus Persephone gazed in the selfgraved portrait of her face, and\n        beheld the self-impressed aspect of a false Persephoneia. Once in the scorching steam of thirsty heat, the girl\n        would cease the loomtoilling labours of her shuttle at midday to shun the tread of the parching season, and wipe\n        the running sweat from her face; she loosed the modest bodice which held her breast so tight, and moistened her\n        skin with a refreshing bath, floating in the cool running stream, and left behind her threads fixt on the loom\n        of Pallas [Athena]. But she could not escape the allseeing eye of Zeus. He gazed at the whole body of\n        Persephoneia, uncovered in her bath . . .\n        He--so mighty! The ruler of the universe, the charioteer of heaven, bowed his neck to desire--for all his\n        greatness no thunderbolts, no lightnings helped him against Aphrodite in arms: he left the house of Hera, he\n        refused the bed of Dione, he threw away the love of Deo, he fled from Themis, he deserted Leto - no charm was\n        left for him but only union with Persephoneia.\n        Not the Father alone felt desire; but all that dwelt in Olympos had the same, struck by one bolt, and wooed for\n        a union with Deo's divine daughter. Then Deo lost the brightness of her rosy face, her swelling heart was lashed\n        by sorrows. She untied the fruitful frontlet [a wreath of corn-ears] from her head, and shook loose the long\n        locks of hair over her neck, trembling for her girl; the cheeks of the goddess were moistened with self-running\n        tears, in her sorrow that so many wooers had been stung with one fiery shot for a struggle of rival wooing, by\n        maddening Eros (Love), all contending together for their loves. From all the bounteous mother shrank, but\n        specially she feared Hephaistos to be her daughter's lame bedfellow . . . All that dwelt in Olympos had the\n        same, struck by one bolt [of desire], and wooed for a union with Deo's divine daughter [Persephone] . . .\n        Then Deo [Demeter] lost the brightness of her rosy face, her swelling heart was lashed by sorrows . . . She\n        hastened with quick foot to the house of Astraios (Astraeus) the god of prophecy [or more specifically\n        astrology] . . . She laid her left hand on the knees of the kindly ancient, and with her right touched his\n        deepflowing beard in supplication. She recounted all her daughter's wooers and craved a comfortable oracle; for\n        divinations can steal away anxieties by means of hopes to come. Nor did old Astraios refuse. He learnt the\n        details of the day when her only child was new born, and the exact time and veritable course of the season which\n        gave her birth; then he bent the turning fingers of his hands and measured the moving circle of the\n        ever-recurring number counting from hand to hand in double exchange [reckoning the number of days in the years\n        of her life on his fingers]. He called to a servant, and Asterion lifted a round revolving sphere, the shape of\n        the sky, the image of the universe, and laid it upon the lid of a chest. Here the ancient got to work. He turned\n        it upon its pivot, and directed this gaze round the circle of the Zodiac, scanning in this place and that the\n        planets and fixt stars . . . When he had noticed everything and reckoned the circuit of the stars, he put away\n        the ever-revolving sphere in its roomy box, the sphere with its curious surface; and in answer to the goddess he\n        mouthed out a triple oracle of prophetic sound : ‘Fond mother Demeter, when the rays of the Moon are\n        stolen under a shady cone and her light is gone, guard against a robber-bridegroom for Perephoneia, a secret\n        ravisher of your unsmirched girl, if the threads of the Moirai (Fates) can be persuaded. You will see before\n        marriage a false and secret bedfellow come unforeseen, a half-monster cunning-minded: since I perceive the\n        western point Ares the wife-stealer [the planet Mars] walking with the Paphian [the planet Venus], and I notice\n        the Drakon (Draco) is rising beside them both . . . ’\n        This said, he let the oracular voice sleep in his mouth. But when Demeter Sicklebearer heard the hope of coming\n        fruits, and how one uninvited and unbetrothed was to ravish her beloved maiden girl, she groaned and smiled at\n        once, and hastening by the paths of high heaven with despondent step. Then beside the drakon-manger she balanced\n        the curved yoke over the two necks of the monsters, and fastened the untamed crawlers with the yokestrap,\n        pressing their jaws about the crooktooth bit. So goldenbrown Deo in that grim car conveyed her girl hidden in a\n        black veil of cloud. Boreas (the North-Wind) roared like thunder against the passage of the wagon, but she\n        whistled him down with her monster-driving whip, guiding the light wings of the quick drakons as they sped\n        horselike along the course of the wind, through the sky and round the back-reaching cape of the Libyan Ocean . .\n        .\n        Looking for a stony harbourage, she alighted among the Pelorian cliffs of Threepeak Sikelia (Sicily) near the\n        Adriatic shores, where the restless briny flood is driven towards the west and bends round like a sickle,\n        bringing the current in a curve to southwest from the north. And in the place where that River [Anapos] had\n        often bathed the maiden Kyane (Cyane) . . . she saw a neighbouring grotto like a lofty hall crowned and\n        concealed by a roof of stone, which nature had completed with a rocky gateway and a loom of stone [stalactites]\n        tended by the neighbouring Nymphai (Nymphs).\n        The goddess passed through the dark hall, and concealed her daughter well-secured in this hollow rock. Then she\n        loosed the drakones (dragons) from the winged car; one she placed by the jutting rock on the right of the door,\n        one on the left beside the stone-pointed barrier of the entry, to protect Persephoneia unseen. There also she\n        left Kalligeneia, her own fond nurse, with her baskets, and all that cleverhand Pallas [Athena] gives to make\n        womankind sweat over their wool-spinning. Then she left her rounded chariot for the Nymphai to watch, in their\n        lonely home among the rocks, and cut the air with her feet.\n        The girl busied herself in carding fleeces of wool under the sharp teeth of the iron comb. She packed the wool\n        on the distaff, and twirling spindle with many a twist and jerk ran round and around in dancing step, as the\n        threads were spun and drawn through the fingers. She fixed the first threads of the warp which begins the cloth,\n        and gave them a turn round the beam, moving from end to end to and fro with unresting feet. She wove away,\n        plying the rod and pulling the bobbin along through the threads, while she sang over the cloth to her cousin\n        Athena the clever webster.\n        Ah, maiden Persephoneia! You could not find how to escape your mating! No, a drakon was your mate, when Zeus\n        changed his face and came, rolling in many a loving coil through the dark to the corner of the maiden's chamber,\n        and shaking his hairy chaps : he lulled to sleep as he crept the eyes of those creatures of his own shape who\n        guarded the door. He licked the girl's form gently with wooing lips. By this marriage with the heavenly drakon,\n        the womb of Persephone swelled with living fruit, and she bore Zagreus the horned baby, who by himself climbed\n        upon the heavenly throne of Zeus and brandished lightning in his little hand, and newly born, lifted and carried\n        thunderbolts in his tender fingers.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 31. 28 ff : \n        \"[Hera manipulates Persephone into sending an Erinys to plague Dionysos with madness :] ‘He [Zeus]\n        rescued Semele's son [Dionysos] from the flaming fire, he saved Bakkhos (Bacchus) from the thunderbolt, while\n        still a baby brat . . .

Is it [the hound Kerberos] his willing uncle's [Haides']\n        gift, or his spoil, he brings? . . .\n        There appears the palace of greedy Dis [Haides]. Here the savage Stygian dog frightens the shades . . . At last\n        the dog, vanquished [by the club of Herakles] ceases his threatenings and, spent with struggle, lowers all his\n        heads and yields all wardship of his cavern. Both rulers [Haides and Persephone] shiver on their throne, and bid\n        lead the dog away. Me [Theseus] also they give as boon to Alcides' [Herakles'] prayer.\"\n\nFor MORE information on Herakles and the Hound of Haides see KERBEROS\n\nHaides and Persephone inflicted Thebes with a deadly plague, probably as punishment for King Kreon's (Creon's)\n        refusal to allow the burial of the dead warriors of the army of the Seven Against Thebes. When the maiden\n        Koronides (Coronides) sacrificed themselves to appease the gods, they were pitied and transformed into a pair of\n        comets.\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 25 (trans. Celoria) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"When plague seized Aonia [the land of Thebes in Boiotia] and many died, there were sent officers to\n        consult Apollon's oracle at Gortyne. The god replied that they should make an appeal to the two gods of the\n        underworld [Haides and Persephone]. He said that they would cease from their anger if two willing maidens were\n        sacrificed to the two. Of course not one of the maidens in the city complied with the oracle until a\n        servant-woman reported the answer to the daughters of Orion [the two Koronides]. They were at work at their loom\n        and, as soon as they heard about this, they willingly accepted death on behalf of their fellow citizens before\n        the plague epidemic had smitten them too. They cries out three times to the gods of the underworld saying that\n        they were willing sacrifices. They thrust their bodkins into themselves at their shoulders and gashed open their\n        throats. And they both fell down into the earth. Persephone and Hades took pity on the maidens and made their\n        bodies disappear, sending them instead up out of the earth as heavenly bodies. When they appeared, they were\n        borne up into the sky. And men called them comets.\"\n\nFor MORE information on these maidens see THE\n          KORONIDES\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 16 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Meropes of Cos] had a wife, Ethemea, of the race of Nymphae, who was stuck with the arrows of Diana\n        [Artemis] when she ceased worshipping her. At last she was snatched away alive by Proserpina [Persephone] to the\n        Land of the Dead.\"\n\nAphrodite sent Psykhe (Psyche) on a quest to the underworld to fetch the beauty-cream of Persephone, as one of\n        her many harsh trials.\n\nApuleius, The Golden Ass 6. 16 ff (trans. Walsh) (Roman novel C2nd A.D.) :\n        \n        \"[Aphrodite commands Psykhe (Psyche) to perform a labour :] ‘You will have to undertake one further\n        task for me, my girl. Take this box’ (she handled it over) ‘and make straight for Hades, for the\n        funereal dwelling of Orcus [Haides] himself. Give the box to Proserpina [Persephone], and say : \"Venus\n        [Aphrodite] asks you to send her a small supply of your beauty-preparation, enough for just one day, because she\n        has been tending her sick son, and has used hers all up by rubbing it on him.\" Make your way back with it\n        as early as you can, because I need it to doll myself up so as to attend the Deities' Theatre.’ . . .\n        [A talking tower advises Psykhe on how to reach Persephone in the Underworld :] ‘He [Kerberos (Cerberus)]\n        keeps constant guard before the very threshold and the dark hall of Proserpina [Persephone], protecting that\n        deserted abode of Dis [Haides]. You must disarm him by offering him a cake as his spoils. Then you can easily\n        pass him, and gain immediate access to Proserpina herself. She will welcome you in genial and kindly fashion,\n        and she will try to induce you to sit on a cushioned seat beside her and enjoy a rich repast. But you must\n        settle on the ground, ask for course bread, and eat it. Then you must tell her why you have come. When you have\n        obtained what she gives you, you must make your way back, using the remaining cake to neutralize the dog's\n        savagery. Then you must give the greedy mariner the one coin which you have held back, and once again across the\n        river you must retrace your earlier steps and return to the harmony of heaven's stars. Of all these injunctions\n        I urge you particularly to observe this: do not seek to open or to pry into the box that you will carry, nor be\n        in any way inquisitive about the treasure of divine beauty hidden within it.’ . . .\n        [She followed the tower's instructions and] fed the cake to the dog to quell his fearsome rage, and gained\n        access to the house of Proserpina [Persephone]. Psyche declined the soft cushion and the rich food offered by\n        her hostess; she perched on the ground at her feet, and was content with plain bread. She then reported her\n        mission from Venus [Aphrodite]. The box was at once filled and closed out of her sight, and Psyche took it. She\n        quietened the dog's barking by disarming it with the second cake, offered her remaining coin to the ferryman,\n        and quite animatedly hastened out of Hades. But once she was back in the light of this world and had reverently\n        hailed it, her mind was dominated by rash curiosity, in spite of her eagerness to see the end of her service.\n        She said : ‘How stupid I am to be carrying this beauty-lotion fit for deities, and not take a single drop\n        of it for myself, for with this at any rate I can be pleasing to my beautiful lover.’\n        The words were scarcely out of her mouth when she opened the box. But inside there was no beauty-lotion or\n        anything other than the sleep of Hades, a truly Stygian sleep. As soon as the lid was removed and it was laid\n        bare, it attacked her and pervaded all her limbs in a thick cloud. It laid hold of her, so that she fell\n        prostrate on the path where she had stood. She lay there motionless, no more animate than a corpse at rest . . .\n        [Eros found her and] carefully wiping the sleep from her, he restored it to its former lodging in the box.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Argonautica Orphica 1192, Lydus De Mens 90 & &198\n          & 284 & 286, Scholiast on Hesiod's Theogony 913, Scholiast on Sophocles Oedipus at Colonus 1590,\n          Orphica Argonautica 1192, Scholiast on Theocritus 2.12 & 3.48 & 15.14, Hesychius 'Zagreus', Tzetzes on\n          Lycophron 708 & 1176, Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius 3.467, Servius on Aeneid 4.609, Scoliast on\n          Euripides Orestes 952, Arrian Exped.
