  "content": "MAKARIA (Macaria) was the goddess of a \"blessed\" death, a minion of her father Haides. She was\n        perhaps a more merciful counterpart of the death-god Thanatos or else\n        connected with the passage of souls to the Islands of the Blessed (Nesoi Makarioi).\n\nSuidas s.v. Makariai (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Makaria (Macaria, Blessed). Death. A daughter of Haides. And a proverb : ‘Go to blessedness,’\n        instead of go to misery and utter destruction. Or ‘Go to blessedness’ is said by euphemism. Since\n        even the dead are called ‘blessed ones.’\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
