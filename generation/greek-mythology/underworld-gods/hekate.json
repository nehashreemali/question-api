  "content": "HEKATE (Hecate) was the goddess of magic, witchcraft, the night, moon, ghosts and necromancy. She was the only\n        child of the Titanes Perses and Asteria from whom she received her power over heaven, earth, and sea.\n\nHekate assisted Demeter in her search for Persephone, guiding her through the night with flaming torches. After the\n        mother-daughter reunion became she Persephone's minister and companion in Haides.\n\nThree metamorphosis myths describe the origins of her animal familiars: the black she-dog and the polecat (a\n        mustelid house pet kept by the ancients to hunt vermin). The dog was the Trojan Queen Hekabe (Hecuba) who leapt\n        into the sea after the fall of Troy and was transformed by the goddess. The polecat was either the witch Gale,\n        turned as punishment for her incontinence, or Galinthias, midwife of Alkmene (Alcmena), who was transformed by\n        the enraged goddess Eileithyia but adopted by the sympathetic Hekate.\n\nHekate was usually depicted in Greek vase painting as a woman holding twin torches. Sometimes she was dressed\n        in a knee-length maiden's skirt and hunting boots, much like Artemis. In statuary Hekate was often depicted in\n        triple form as a goddess of crossroads.\n\nHer name means \"worker from afar\" from the Greek word hekatos. The masculine form of the\n        name, Hekatos, was a common epithet of the god Apollon.\n\nHekate was identified with a number of other goddesses including Artemis, Selene (the Moon), Despoine, the sea-goddess Krataeis\n        (Crataeis), the goddess of the Taurian Khersonese in Skythia, the Kolkhian (Colchian) nymph Perseis, the heroine Iphigeneia, the Thracian goddesses Bendis and Kotys (Cotys), the Euboian\n        nymph Maira (the Dog-Star), the Eleusinian nymph Daeira and the Boiotian nymph Herkyna (Hercyna).\n\n[1.1] PERSES & ASTERIA\n        (Hesiod Theogony 404, Apollodorus 1.8)\n        [1.2] PERSES (Homeric Hymn 2 to Demeter 24,\n          Orphic Hymn 1, Lycophron 1174, Apollonius Rhodius 3.1036, Diodorus Siculus 4.45.1, Ovid Metamorphoses 7.74,\n          Seneca Medea 812)\n        [2.1] ZEUS & ASTERIA\n        (Schol. on Apoll.

(Apollod. i. 2. § 4; Apollon.\n        Rhod. iii. 478.) Others describe her as a daughter of Zeus and Demeter, and state that she was sent out by her\n        father in search of Persephone (Schol. ad Tleocrit. ii. 12); others again make her a daughter of Zeus\n        either by Pheraea or by Hera (Tzetz. ad Lyc. 1175; Schol. ad Theocrit. ii. 36) ; and others,\n        lastly, say that she was a daughter of Leto or Tartarus. (Procl. in Plat. Cratyl. p. 112 ; Orph.\n        Argon. 975.) Homer does not mention her. According to the most genuine traditions, she appears to have\n        been an ancient Thracian divinity, and a Titan, who, from the time of the Titans, ruled in heaven, on the earth,\n        and in the sea, who bestowed on mortals wealth, victory, wisdom, good luck to sailors and hunters, and\n        prosperity to youth and to the flocks of cattle; but all these blessings might at the same time be withheld by\n        her, if mortals did not deserve them. She was the only one among the Titans who retained this power under the\n        rule of Zeus, and she was honoured by all the immortal gods.\n\nShe also assisted the gods in their war with the Gigantes, and slew Clytius. (Hes. Theog. 411-452;\n        Apollod. i. 6. § 2.) This extensive power possessed by Hecate was probably the reason that subsequently she\n        was confounded and identified with several other divinities, and at length became a mystic goddess, to whom\n        mysteries were celebrated in Samothrace (Lycoph. 77; Schol. ad Aristoph. Pac. 277) and in Aegina.\n        (Paus. ii. 30. § 2; comp. Plut. de Flum. 5.) For being as it were the queen of all nature, we find\n        her identitied with Demeter, Rhea (Cybele or Brimo); being a huntress and the protector of youth, she is the\n        same as Artemis (Curotrophos); and as a goddess of the moon, she is regarded as the mystic Persephone. (Hom.\n        Hymn. in Cer. 25, with the commentat.; Paus. i. 43, § 1.) She was further connected with the\n        worship of other mystic divinities, such as the Cabeiri and Curetes (Schol. ad Theocrit. ii. 12; Strab.\n        x. p. 472), and also with Apollo and the Muses. (Athen. xiv. p. 645; Strab. x. p. 468.) The ground-work of the\n        above-mentioned confusions and identifications, especially with Demeter and Persephone, is contained in the\n        Homeric hymn to Demeter; for, according to this hymn, she was, besides Helios, the only divinity who, from her\n        cave, observed the abduction of Persephone. With a torch in her hand, she accompanied Demeter in the search\n        after Persephone; and when the latter was found, Hecate remained with her as her attendant and companion. She\n        thus becomes a deity of the lower world; but this notion does not occur till the time of the Greek tragedians,\n        though it is generally current among the later writers. She is described in this capacity as a mighty and\n        formidable divinity, ruling over the souls of the departed ; she is the goddess of purifications and expiations,\n        and is accompanied by Stygian dogs. (Orph. Lith. 48; Schol. ad Theocr l. c. ; Apollon. Rhod.\n        iii. 1211; Lycoph. 1175; Horat. Sat. i. 8. 35; Virg. Aen. vi. 257.) By Phorcos she became the\n        mother of Scylla. (Apollon. Rhod. iv. 829 ; comp. Hom. Od. xii. 124.) There is another very important\n        feature which arose out of the notion of her being an infernal divinity, namely, she was regarded as a spectral\n        being, who at night sent from the lower world all kinds of demons and terrible phantoms, who taught sorcery and\n        witchcraft, who dwelt at places where two roads crossed each other, on tombs, and near the blood of murdered\n        persons. She herself too wanders about with the souls of the dead, and her approach is announced by the whining\n        and howling of dogs. (Apollon. Rhod. iii. 529, 861, iv. 829; Theocrit. l. c. ; Ov. Heroid.\n        xii. 168, Met. xiv. 405; Stat. Theb. iv. 428 ; Virg. Aen. iv. 609; Orph.\n        Lith. 45, 47; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1197, 1887; Diod. iv. 45.) A number of epithets given her by\n        the poets contain allusions to these features of the popular belief, or to her form. She is described as of\n        terrible appearance, either with three bodies or three heads, the one of a horse, the second of a dog, and the\n        third of a lion. (Orph. Argon. 975, &c.; Eustath. ad Hom. pp. 1467, 1714.) In works of art\n        she was some-times represented as a single being, but sometimes also as a three-headed monster. (Paus. ii. 28.\n        § 8. 30. § 2.) Besides Samothrace and Aegina, we find express mention of her worship at Argos (Paus.\n        ii. 30. § 2.) and at Athens, where she had a sanctuary under the name of Epipurgidia, on the acropolis, not\n        far from the temple of Nice. (Paus. ii. 30. § 2.) Small statues or symbolical representations of Hecate\n        (hekataia) were very numerous, especially at Athens, where they stood before or in houses, and on spots where\n        two roads crossed each other; and it would seem that people consulted such Hecataea as oracles. (Aristoph.\n        Vesp. 816, Lysistr. 64; Eurip. Med. 396; Porphyr. de Abstin. ii. 16; Hesych.\n        s. v. Hekataia). At the close of every month dishes with food were set out for her and other averters\n        of evil at the points where two roads crossed each other; and this food was consumed by poor people. (Aristoph.\n        Plot. 596 ; Plut. Synmpos. vii. 6.) The sacrifices offered to her consisted of dogs, honey,\n        and black female lambs. (Plut Quaest. Rom. 49; Schol. ad Theocrit. ii. 12 ; Apollon. Rhod.\n        iii. 1032.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 404 ff (trans.

But no one, either of the\n        deathless gods or mortal men, heard her voice, nor yet the olive-trees bearing rich fruit: only tender-hearted\n        Hekate (Hecate), bright-coiffed, the daughter of Persaios (Persaeus), heard the girl from her cave, and the lord\n        Helios (the Sun) . . . \n        Then for nine days queenly Deo [Demeter] wandered over the earth with flaming torches in her hands, so grieved\n        that she never tasted ambrosia and the sweet draught of nectar (nektaros), nor sprinkled her body with\n        water. But when the tenth enlightening dawn had come, Hekate, with a torch in her hands, met her, and spoke to\n        her and told her news:\n        ‘Queenly Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of good gifts, what god of heaven or what mortal man has\n        rapt away Persephone and pierced with sorrow your dear heart?

On the\n        bank of the river there is a temple of Herkyna, in which is a maiden holding a goose in her arms. In the cave\n        are the sources of the river and images standing, and serpents are coiled around their sceptres.

May the goddess be gracious to me :\n        fables and their telling I leave to others.\"\n\nOdysseus received Queen Hekabe (Hecuba) as his captive following the fall of Troy. During the voyage back to\n        Greece she murdered a Thracian king and was stoned by the locals. The gods then transformed her into a black\n        dog, and she became the animal familiar of the goddess Hekate.\n        In this myth the queen was clearly identified with Bendis, the Thrakian Hekate, who was offered dogs in\n        sacrifice.\n\nLycophron, Alexandra 1174 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"The maiden daughter of Perseus, Brimo [Hekate] Trimorphos (Three-formed), shall make thee [Queen Hekabe\n        (Hecuba) of Troy] her attendant [after her transformed into a dog], terrifying with thy baying in the night all\n        mortals who worship not with torches the images of Zerynthia [Hekate] queen of Strymon [in Thrake], appeasing\n        the goddess of Pherai with sacrifice. And the island spur of Pakhynos (Pachynus) [in Sicily] shall hold thine\n        [Hekabe's] awful cenotaph, piled by the hands of thy master [Odysseus], prompted by dreams when thou hast gotten\n        the rites of death in front of the streams of Heloros. He [Odysseus] shall pour on the shore offerings for thee,\n        unhappy one, fearing the anger of the three-necked goddess [Hekate], for that he shall hurl the first stone at\n        thy [Hekabe's] stoning and begin the dark sacrifice to Haides.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 111 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"When Ulysses [Odysseus] was taking into servitude Hecuba, Priam's wife . . . she threw herself into the\n        Hellespont, and is said to have been changed into a dog. the place is called Cyneus (of the Dog) from\n        this.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 14. 430 & 561 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to\n          C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Troy fell and Priam too. His ill-starred wife [Hekabe (Hecuba)] lost, after all besides her human shape;\n        her weird new barking terrified the breeze on foreign shores where the long Hellespont contracts in narrows . .\n        . There lie across the strait from Phrygia, where Ilium was, the provinces of Thrace, where Polymestor had his\n        wealthy palace. To him in secret Praim gave in charge his young son Polydorus to be reared . . . When Troy;s\n        fair fortune fell, that wicked king took his sharp sword and slit his charge's throat . . .\n        Upon the beach cast up she [Hekabe] saw her Polydorus' corpse and the huge wounds the Thracian knives had made .\n        . . Hecuba, rage linked with grief, oblviious of her years . . . made her way to Polymestor, author of that foul\n        murder, and sought an audience . . .\n        She attacked the king and dug her fingers in his eyes, his treacherous eyes, and gouged his eyeballs out . . .\n        Incensed to see their king's calamity, the Thracians started to attack the queen with sticks and stones, but she\n        snaped at the stones, snarling, and when her lips were set to grame words and she tried to speak, she barked.\n        The place remains today, named from what happened there [Kynossema (Cynossema) or Dog's Barrow]. Then still\n        remembering her ancient ills, she howled in sorrow through the land of Thrace. That fate of hers stirred pity in\n        the hearts of friend and foe, Trojans and Greeks alike, and all the gods as well--all: Juno [Hera] too, Jove's\n        wife and sister, did herself declare the tragic end of Hecuba unfair.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 7.362 ff : \n        \"Past the tomb of Paris [in the Troad] buried in the shallow sand; the meadowlands that Maera terrified\n        with monstrous barks [N.B.
