  "content": "THE ERINYES (Furies) were three goddesses of vengeance and retribution who punished men for crimes against the\n        natural order. They were particularly concerned with homicide, unfilial conduct, offenses against the gods, and\n        perjury. A victim seeking justice could call down the curse of the Erinys upon the criminal. The most powerful\n        of these was the curse of the parent upon the child--for the Erinyes were born of just such a crime, being\n        sprung from the blood of Ouranos (Uranus), when he was castrated by his\n        son Kronos (Cronus).\n\nThe wrath of the Erinyes manifested itself in a number of ways. The most severe of these was the tormenting\n        madness inflicted upon a patricide or matricide. Murderers might suffer illness or disease; and a nation\n        harbouring such a criminal, could suffer dearth, and with it hunger and disease. The wrath of the Erinyes could\n        only be placated with the rite ritual purification and the completion of some task assigned for atonement.\n\nThe goddesses were also servants of Haides and Persephone in the underworld where they oversaw the torture of criminals consigned\n        to the Dungeons of the Damned.\n\nThe Erinyes were similar to if not the same as the Poinai (Poenae)\n        (Retaliations), Arai (Arae) (Curses), Praxidikai (Praxidicae) (Exacters of Justice) and Maniai (Maniae) (Madnesses).\n\nThey were depicted as ugly, winged women with hair, arms and waists entwined with poisonous serpents. The\n        sisters wielded whips and were clothed either in the long black robes of mourners, or the short-length skirts\n        and boots of huntress- maidens.\n\n[1.1] GAIA by the blood of OURANOS (Hesiod Theogony 176, Bacchylides Frag\n          52)\n        [2.1] NYX (Aeschyluls Eumenides 321, Lycophron\n          432, Virgil Aeneid 6.250, Ovid Metamorphoses 4.453)\n        [3.1] HAIDES & PERSEPHONE (Orphic Hymns 29 & 70)\n        [3.2] HAIDES (Statius Thebaid 12.557 & 11.47)\n        [4.1] POINE (Valerius Flaccus 1.730)\n\n[1.1] TISIPHONE, MEGAIRA, ALEKTO (Bacchylides Frag 52, Orphic Hymn 69, Apollodorus\n          1.3, et al)\n        [2.1] TILPHOUSIA (Quintus Smyrnaeus 8.39, Pausanias 8.25.3)\n\n[1.1] HIPPOI AREIOI x4 (Erinys Tilphousia by Boreas) (Quintus Smyrnaeus 8.239)\n        [2.1] DRAKON AREION (Erinys Telphousia by Ares)\n\n* NB The Erinyes were usually described as three maiden goddesses. The Erinys Telphousia was usually a by-name\n        for the wrathful Demeter, and these horses are echoes of Areion (of Ares), the equine son of Demeter Erinys and\n        Poseidon.\n\nEUME′NIDES (Eumenides), also called ERINNYES, and by the Romans FURIAE or DIRAE, were originally nothing\n        but a personification of curses pronounced upon a guilty criminal. The name Erinnys, which is the more ancient\n        one, was derived by the Greeks from the erinô or ereunaô, I hunt up or persecute,\n        or from the Arcadian word erinuô, I am angry; so that the Erinnyes were either the angry\n        goddesses, or the goddesses who hunt up or search after the criminal. (Aeschyl. Eum. 499; Pind.\n        Ol. ii. 45; Cic. de Nat. Deor. iii. 18.) The name Eumenides, which signifies \"the\n        well-meaning,\" or \"soothed goddesses,\" is a mere euphemism, because people dreaded to call these fearful\n        goddesses by their real name, and it was said to have been first given them after the acquittal of Orestes by\n        the court of the Areiopagus, when tile anger of the Erinnyes had become soothed. (Soph. Oed. Col. 128;\n        Schol. ad Oed. Col. 42; Suid. s. v. Eumenides.) It was by a similar euphemism that at Athens\n        the Erinnyes were called semnai theai, or the venerable goddesses. (Paus. i. 28 § 6) Servius (ad\n          Aen. iv. 609) makes a distinction, according to which they bore the name Dirae, when they were conceived\n        as being in heaven by the throne of Zeus, Furiae, when conceived as being on earth, and Eumenides, as beings of\n        the lower world; but this seems to be a purely arbitrary distinction.\n\nIn the sense of curse or curses, the word Erinnys or Erinnyes is often used in the Homeric\n        poems (Il. ix. 454, xxi. 412, Od. xi. 280), and Aeschylus (Choeph. 406) calls the\n        Eumenides Arai that is, curses. According to the Homeric notion, the Erinnyes, whom the poet conceives as\n        distinct beings, are reckoned among those who inhabit Erebos, srwhere they rest until some curse pronounced upon\n        a criminal calls them to life and activity. (Il. ix 571, Od. xv. 234.) The crimes which they\n        punish are disobedience towards parents, violation of the respect due to old age, perjury, murder, violation of\n        the law of hospitality, and improper conduct towards suppliants. (Hom. Il. ix. 454, xv. 204, xix. 259,\n        Od. ii. 136, xvii. 475.) The notion which is the foundation of the belief in the Eumenides seems to be,\n        that a parent's curse takes from him upon whom it is pronounced all peace of mind, destroys the happiness of his\n        family. and prevents his being blessed with children. (Herod. iv. 149; Aeschyl. Eum. 835.) As the\n        Eumenides not only punished crimes after death, but during life on earth, they were conceived also as goddesses\n        of fate, who, together with Zeus and the Moerae or Parcae, led such men as were doomed to suffer into misery and\n        misfortunes. (Hom. Il. xix. 87, Od. xv. 234.) In the same capacity they also prevented man\n        from obtaining too much knowledge of the future. (Il. xix. 418.) Homer does not mention any particular\n        names of the Erinnyes, nor does he seem to know of any definite number. Hesiod, who is likewise silent upon\n        these points, calls the Erinyes the daughters of Ge, who conceived them in the drops of blood that fell upon her\n        from the body of Uranus. (Theog. 185; comp. Apollod. i. 1. § 4.) Epimenides called them the\n        daughters of Cronos and Euonyme, and sisters of the Moerae (Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 406; Schol. ad Soph.\n          Oed. Col. 42); Aeschylus (Eum. 321) calls them the daughters of Night; and Sophocles (Oed.\n          Col. 40, 106) of Scotos (Darkness) and Ge. (Comp. some other genealogies in Hygin Fab. p. 1;\n        Serv. ad Aen. vii. 327; Orph. Hymn. 69. 2.) The Greek tragedians, with whom, as in the\n        Eumenides of Aeschylus, the number of these goddesses is not limited to a few (Dyer, in the Class.\n          Museum, vol. i. pp. 281-298; comp. Eurip. Iphig. Taur. 970; Virg. Aen. iv. 469), no\n        particular name of any one Erinnys is yet mentioned, but they appear in the same capacity, and as the avengers\n        of the same crimes, as before. They are sometimes identified with the Poenae, though their sphere of action is\n        wider than that of the Poenae. From their hunting up and persecuting the cursed criminal, Aeschylus\n        (Eum. 231, Choeph. 1055) calls them kunes or kungetides. No prayer, no sacrifice, and no tears\n        can moove them, or protect the object of their persecution (Aesch. Agam. 69, Eum. 384); and\n        when they fear lest the criminal should escape them, they call in the assistance of Dicé, with whom they\n        are closely connected, the maintenance of strict justice being their only object. (Aesch. Eum. 511,\n        786; Orph. Argon. 350; Plut. de Eail. 11.) The Erinnyes were more ancient divinities than the Olympian\n        gods, and were therefore not under the rule of Zeus, though they honoured and esteemed him (Eum. 918,\n        1002); and they dwelt in the deep darkness of Tartarus, dreaded by gods and men. Their appearance is described\n        by Aeschylus as Gorgo-like, their bodies covered with black, serpents twined in their hair, and blood dripping\n        from their eyes; Euripides and other later poets describe them as winged beings. (Orest. 317,\n        Iphig. Taur. 290; Virg. Aen. xii. 848; Orph. Hymn. 68. 5.) The appearance they have\n        in Aeschylus was more or less retained by the poets of later times; but they gradually assumed the character of\n        goddesses who punished crimes after death, and seldom appeared on earth. On the stage, however, and in works of\n        art, their fearful appearrance was greatly softened down, for they were represented as maidens of a grave and\n        solemn mien, in the richly adorned attire of huntresses, with a band of serpents around their heads, and\n        serpents or torches in their hands. With later writers, though not always, the number of Eumenides is limited to\n        three, and their names are Tisiphone, Alecto, and Megaera. (Orph. Hymn. 68; Tzetz. ad Lycoph.\n        406; Virg. Aen. xii. 845.) At Athens there were statues of only two. (Schol. ad Oed. Col. 42.)\n        The sacrifices which were offered to them consisted of black sheep and nephalia, i. e. a drink of honey\n        mixed with water. (Schol. l. c.; Paus. ii. 11. § 4; Aeschyl. Eum. 107.) Among the things\n        sacred to them we hear of white turtledoves, and the narcissus. (Aelian, H. A. x. 33; Eustath. ad\n          Hom. p. 87.) They were worshipped at Athens, where they had a sanctuary and a grotto near the Areiopagus\n        : their statues, however, had nothing formidable (Paus. i. 28. § 6), and a festival Eumenideia was there\n        celebrated in their honour. Another sanctuary, with a grove which no one was allowed to enter, existed at\n        Colonus. (Soph. Oed. Col. 37.) Under the name of Maniai, they were worshipped at Megalopolis. (Paus.\n        viii. 34. § 1.) They were also worshipped on the Asopus and at Ceryneia. (Paus. ii. 11. § 4, vii. 25.\n        § 4.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 176 ff (trans.

And not vainly did they fall from his hand; for all the bloody\n        drops that gushed forth Gaia (Gaea, Earth) received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes,\n        and the great Gigantes (Giants) [probably the Kouretes (Curetes)] with gleaming armour, holding long spears in\n        their hands and the Nymphai (Nymphs) whom they call Meliai (Meliae) [probably the nurses of Zeus] all over the\n        boundless earth.\"\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 52 (from Tzetzes on Hesiod's Theogony) (trans.

Forthwith she broke through the massive earth, and stood beneath the stars: the Manes\n        (Ghosts) rejoice, and as the nether darkness grows less thick, so wanes the light above.

His eyes grew bloodshot as he stared about under vagrant impulses; inside his\n        wagging head the flimsy brains rolled about behind his brows . . . The blasts of the Eumenides [Erinyes] had\n        carried away the troubles of mortal life, and his tongue was laden with the cries of madness. When he moved his\n        face about he saw as his forehead turned a false transformed shape of the unseen Megaira. So the madman shook\n        with a distracted spasm, and tried to tear the whip of snakes from the grim hand of the reason-destroying\n        goddess; he bared his sword in the face of the Avenger [Alekto], and tried to cut the viper-curls of\n        Tisiphone.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 32. 100 ff :\n        \"The Erinys of many shapes . . . loudly cracking her snaky whip; she shook her head, and a deadly hiss\n        issued from her quivering serpent-hair, terrible, and fountains of poison drenched the rocky wilderness . . .

Showers of poison-drops were shot upon the head of Bromios and big fat sparks; ever in his ears\n        was the whistling sound of the hellish whip which robbed him of his senses.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 44. 198 ff :\n        \"The Eumenides [Erinyes] assailed the palace of Pentheus. One leapt out of the gloomy pit swinging her\n        Tartarean whip of vipers; she drew a stream from Kokytos (Cocytus) and water from Styx, and drenched Agaue's\n        (Agave's) rooms with the infernal drops as if with a prophecy of tears and groaning for Thebes; and the deity\n        brought that Attic knife from Attika, which long before murdered Itylos, when his mother Prokne (Procne) with\n        heart like a lioness, helped by murderous Philomele, cut with steel the throat of the beloved child of her womb,\n        and served up his own son for cannibal Tereus to eat. This knife, the channel of bloodshed, the Erinys held, and\n        scratching up the dust with her pernicious fingernails she buried the Attic blade among the hillgrown roots of a\n        tall fir, among the Mainades (Maenads), where Pentheus was to die headless. She brought the blood of Gorgon\n        Medousa (Medusa), scraped off into a shell fresh when she was newly slain, and smeared the tree with the crimson\n        Libyan drops. This is what the mad Erinys did in the mountains.\"\n\nWhen the dead first arrive in Haides they appear before the three Judges, and then handed over to the Erinyes,\n        who purified the good of their sins and let them pass, but dragged those adudged to be wicked off to the\n        Tartarean dungeon of the damned. The Erinyes were also the jailors of this prison house, who oversaw the\n        tortures inflicted upon the criminals.\n\nPlato, Phaedo 107d ff (trans. Lamb) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"When it arrives at the place where the other souls are, the soul which is impure and has done wrong, by\n        committing wicked murders or other deeds akin to those and the works of kindred souls, is avoided and shunned by\n        all, and no one is willing to be its companion or its guide, but it wanders about alone in utter bewilderment,\n        during certain fixed times, after which it is carried by necessity to its fitting habitation [i.e. by the\n        Erinyes to Tartaros]. But the soul that has passed through life in purity and righteousness, finds gods for\n        companions and guides, and goes to dwell in its proper dwelling [i.e. Elysion (Elysium)].\"\n\nPlato, Phaedo 112e :\n        \"Now when the dead have come to the place where each is led by his genius (daimon) [i.e. by\n        Plato's equivalent of Hermes, Guide of the Dead], first they are judged and sentenced [i.e. by the Judges of the\n        Dead], as they have lived well and piously, or not. And those who are found to have lived neither well nor ill,\n        go to the Akheron (Acheron) and, embarking upon vessels provided for them [i.e. the equivalent of Kharon's\n        (Charon's) skiff], arrive in them at the lake; there they dwell and are purified [i.e. by the equivalent of the\n        Erinyes], and if they have done any wrong they are absolved by paying the penalty for their wrong doings [i.e.\n        in Haides], and for their good deeds they receive rewards [i.e. in Elysion (Elysium)], each according to his\n        merits. But those who appear to be incurable, on account of the greatness of their wrongdoings, because they\n        have committed many great deeds of sacrilege, or wicked and abominable murders, or any other such crimes, are\n        cast by their fitting destiny into Tartaros, whence they never emerge. Those, however, who are curable, but are\n        found to have committed great sin--who have, for example, in a moment of passion done some act of violence\n        against father or mother and have lived in repentance the rest of their lives, or who have slain some other\n        person under similar conditions--these must needs be thrown into Tartaros, and when they have been there a year\n        the wave casts them out, the homicides by way of Kokytos (Cocytus), those who have outraged their parents by way\n        of Pyriphlegethon. And when they have been brought by the current to the Akherousian (Acherusian) lake, they\n        shout and cry out, calling to those whom they have slain or outraged, begging and beseeching them to be gracious\n        and to let them come out into the lake; and if they prevail they come out and cease from their ills, but if not,\n        they are borne away again to Tartaros and thence back into the rivers, and this goes on until they prevail upon\n        those whom they have wronged; for this is the penalty imposed upon them by the judges.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 5. 520 ff (trans.
