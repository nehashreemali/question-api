  "content": "AMPHIARAOS (Amphiaraus) was a hero of the war of the Seven Against Thebes who was swallowed up by the earth and\n        transformed into an oracular demigod or daimon (spirit). His oracle at Oropos in Boiotia was one of the most\n        revered in ancient Greece. Amphiaraos' name perhaps means \"Pray-Around\" from the Greek words\n        araomai and amphis.\n\nAmphiaraos' mortal life is not described on this page, only the story of his apotheosis and oracle.\n\n[1.1] OIKLES (Pindar Nemea Str5, Aeschylus Seven 609, Apollodorus 1.68, Pausanias\n          6.17.6, Statius Thebaid, et al)\n        [1.2] APOLLON (or OIKLES) & HYPERMNESTRA (Hyginus Fabulae 70)\n\n[1.1] ALKMAION, AMPHILOKHOS (by Eriphyle) (Apollodorus 1.86, Statius Thebaid, et\n          al)\n        [1.2] ALKMAION, AMPHILOKHOS, EURYDIKE, DEMONASSA, ALKMENE (by Eriphyle) (Pausanias\n          5.17.7)\n\nAMPHIARA′US, (Amphiaraos), a son of Oicles and Hypermnestra, the daughter of Thestius. (Hom. Od.\n        xv. 244; Apollod. i. 8. § 2; Hygin. Fab. 73; Paus. ii. 21. § 2.) On his father's side he was\n        descended from the famous seer Melampus. (Paus. vi. 17. § 4.) Some traditions represented him as ason of\n        Apollo by Hypermnestra, which, however, is merely a poetical expression to describe him as a seer and prophet.\n        (Hygin. Fab. 70.) Amphiaraus is renowned in ancient story as a brave hero : he is mentioned among the\n        hunters of the Calydonian boar, which he is said to have deprived of one eye, and also as one of the Argonauts.\n        (Apollod. i. 8. § 2, 9. § 16.) For a time he reigned at Argos in common with Adrastus ; but, in a feud\n        which broke out between them, Adrastus took to flight. Afterwards, however, he became reconciled with\n        Amplliaraus, and gave him his sister Eriphyle in marriage, by whom Amphiaraus became the father of Alcmaeon,\n        Amphilochus, Eurydice, and Demonassa. On marrying Eriphyle, Amphiaraus had sworn, that he would abide by the\n        decision of Eriphyle on any point in which he should differ in opinion from Adrastus. When, therefore, the\n        latter called upon him to join the expedition of the Seven against Thebes, Amphiaraus, although he foresaw its\n        unfortunate issue and at first refused to take any part in it, was nevertheless persuaded by his wife to join\n        his friends, for Eriphyle had been enticed to induce her husband by the necklace of Harmonia which Polyneices\n        had given her. Amphiaraus on leaving Argos enjoined his sons to avenge his death on their heartless mother.\n        (Apollod. iii. 6. § 2; Hygin. Fab. 73; Diod. iv. 65; Hom Od. xv. 247, &c.) On their\n        way to Thebes the heroes instituted the Nemean games, and Amphiaraus won the victory in the chariot-race and in\n        throwing the discus. (Apollod. iii. 6. § 4.) During the war against Thebes, Amphiaraus fought bravely\n        (Pind. Ol. vi. 26, &c.), but still he could not suppress his anger at the whole undertaking, and\n        when Tydeus, whom he regarded as the originator of the expedition, was severely wounded by Melanippus, and\n        Athena was hastening to render him immortal, Amphiaraus cut off the head of Melanippus, who had in the mean time\n        been slain, and gave Tydeus his brains to drink, and Athena, struck with horror at the sight, withdrew.\n        (Apollod. iii. 6. § 8.) When Adrastus and Amphiaraus were the only heroes who survived, the latter was\n        pursued by Periclymenus, and fled towards the river Ismenius. Here the earth opened before he was overtaken by\n        his enemy, and swallowed up Amphiaraus together with his chariot, but Zeus made him immortal. (Pind.\n        Nem. ix. 57, Ol. vi. 21, &c.; Plut. Parall. 6; Cic. de Divin. i. 40.)\n        Henceforth Amphiaraus was worshipped as a hero, first at Oropus and afterwards in all Greece. (Paus. i. 34.\n        § 2; Liv. xlv. 27.) He had a sanctuary at Argos (Paus. ii. 23. § 2), a statue at Athens (i. 8. §\n        3), and a heroum at Sparta. (Müller, Orchom. pp. 146, 486.) The departure of Amphiaraus from his\n        home when he went to Thebes, was represented on the chest of Cypselus. (Paus. v. 17. § 4.).\n\nThe prophetic power, which Amphiaraus was believed to possess, was accounted for by his descent from Melampus\n        or Apollo, though there was also a local tradition at Phlius, according to which he had acquired them in a night\n        which he spent in the prophetic house (oikos mantikos) of Phlius. (Paus. ii. 13. § 6; comp. i. 34. §\n        3.) He was, like all seers, a favourite of Zeus and Apollo. (Hom. Od. xv. 245.) It should be remarked\n        here, that Virgil (Aen. vii. 671) mentions three Greek heroes as contemporaries of Aeneas, viz.\n        Tiburtus, Catillus, and Coras, the first of whom was believed to be the founder of Tibur, and is described by\n        Pliny (H. N. xvi. 87) as a son of Amphiaraus.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPindar, Nemean Ode 9. 16 ff (trans.

In\n        front of the house stands Eriphyle with the necklace, and by her are her daughters Eurydike and Demonassa, and\n        the boy Alkmaion (Alcmaeon) naked. Asius in his poem makes out Alkmena (Alcmena) also to be a daughter of\n        Amphiaraos and Eriphyle. Baton is driving the chariot of Amphiaraos, holding the reins in one hand and a spear\n        in the other.

But when Amphiaraos (Amphiaruas) witnessed this [i.e. he was a seer and so privy to\n        the will of the gods] because of his hatred of Tydeus for inciting the Argives to march against Thebes in\n        defiance of his judgement, he lopped off the head of Melanippos and gave it to Tydeus--who had killed Melanippos\n        even though he was himself wounded--and gave it to Tydeus. Tydeus cracked open the skull and gulped down its\n        contents. When Athena saw him do this, in revulsion she begrudged him her beneficence and kept it from him.\n        Amphiaraos then escaped to the river Ismenos [in the rout of the armies of the Seven Against Thebes], where,\n        just before Periklymenos (Periclymenus) could hit him in the back, Zeus separated the earth with a thunderbolt\n        and Amphiaraos disappeared inside, with this chariot and his driver Baton (or Elaton, according to some). And\n        Zeus made him immortal [In this account it appears that Zeus, following Athene's petition, decreed that one of\n        the Seven Against Thebes would become immortal. Athene intended to bestow the boon upon Tydeus, but Amphiaraos\n        caused her to recoil from him [and so acquired the decreed immortality for himself].\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 9. 2. 11 (trans.

His horses are white, the whirling of his chariot wheels\n        shows urgent haste, the panting breath of the horses issues from every nostril, the earth is bespattered with\n        foam, the horses' manes are all awry, and fine dust settling on their bodies wet with sweat makes them less\n        beautiful but more true to life. Amphiaraos otherwise is in full armour, but he has left off his helmet, thus\n        dedicating his head to Apollon, for his look is holy and oracular.\n        The painting depicts also [the town of] Oropos (Oropus) as a youth among bright-eyed women, Thalattai (the\n        Seas), and it depicts also the place used by Amphiaraos for meditation, a cleft holy and divine. Aletheia\n        (Truth) clad all in white is there and the gate of dreams (pylê oneirôn)--for those who\n        consult the oracle must sleep--and Oneiros (the god of dreams) himself is depicted in relaxed attitude, wearing\n        a white garment over a black one, I think representing his nocturnal and diurnal work. And in his hands he\n        carries a horn, showing that he brings up his dreams through the gate of truth.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 68 (trans.

Already I hear the flow of rapid Styx, and the dark rivers of Dis [Haides] and the triple baying of his\n        noxious sentinel [Kerberos (Cerberus)] . . . ’\n        Sad at heart Apollo leapt down and turned to hide his tears : then verily groaned the chariot and the horses,\n        thus left desolate . . . \n        And now little by little the earth began to shudder to its rending, and the surface to rock, and the dust to\n        rise in thicker clouds, already an infernal bellowing fills the plain . . . Whether the earth, labouring with\n        imprisoned blasts, expelled the pent-up fury of the raging wind, or whether hidden waters ate away and wore down\n        and sapped the crumbling soil, or the fabric of the rolling sky flung that way its weight, or Neptunus'\n        [Poseidon's] trident moved all the ocean and flung too vast a sea upon the shore, or whether that uproar was a\n        tribute to the seer, or earth threatened the brothers--lo! in a gaping chasm the ground yawns sheer and deep,\n        and stars and shades feel mutual terror. Him [Amphiaraus] the huge abyss engulfs, and swallows the horses as\n        they try to leap across it; he drops neither reins nor weapons, but, just as he was, drove his unshaken chariot\n        down to Tartarus [Haides], and as he sank looked back at the heavens and groaned to see the plain meet above\n        him, until a fainter shock joined once more the parted fields and shut out the daylight from Avernus.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 8. 1 ff : \n        \"When on a sudden the prophet [Amphiaraus swallowed alive by the earth] fell among the pallid Manes\n        (Shades), and burst into the homes of death and the mysteries of the deep-sunken realm, and affrighted the Manes\n        (Ghosts) with his armed corpse, all were filled with horror and marvelled at the weapons and horses and the body\n        still undecayed upon the Stygian shores : for no fires had whelmed his limbs, nor came he charred from the\n        gloomy urn, but hot with the sweat of war, and gory drops and the dust of the rent plain beflecked his shield.\n        Not yet had the Eumenis [Erinys] met and purified him with branch of yew, not had Proserpine [Persephone] marked\n        him on the dusky door-post as admitted to the company of the dead; nay his presence surprised the very distaff\n        of the Fatae (Fates) [Moirai], and not till in terror beheld the augur did the Parcae [Moirai] break the thread.\n        At the noise of his coming the care-free Elysian folk gazed round about them, and they whom in the remoter gulf\n        a deeper night and a blind region of denser Shades o'erwhelms. Then sluggish meres and scorched lakes resound\n        with groaning, and the pale furrower [Kharon (Charon)] of the ghost-bearing stream cries out that a new chasm\n        has cloven Tartarus [Haides] to its depths and Manes (Spirits) have been let in across a river not his own . . .\n        \n        But he [Haides], when the frame of the world above was loosened and filled him with unwonted fears, quaked at\n        the appearing stars, and thus did he speak, offended by the gladsome light : ‘What ruin of the upper world\n        hath thrust the hateful light of day into Avernus? Who hath burst our gloom and told the silent folk of life?\n        Whence comes this threat? . . . ’\n        ‘But what shall be thy [Amphiaraus'] doom,’ he cries, ‘who rushest headlong through the empty\n        realm on a path forbidden?’ As he threatens, the other draws nigh, on foot now and shadowy to view, his\n        armour growing faint, yet in his lifeless face abides the dignity of augurship inviolate, and on his brow\n        remains the fillet dim to behold, and in his hand is a branch of dying olive. ‘If it be lawful and right\n        for holy Manes (Shades) to make utterence here, O thou to all men the great Finisher, but to me, who once knew\n        causes and beginnings, Creator also! remit, I pray, thy threatenings and thy fevered heart, nor deem worthy of\n        thy wrath one who is but a man and fears thy laws; 'tis for no Herculean plunder--such wars are not for me--,\n        nor for a forbidden bride--believe these emblems--that I dare to enter Lethe: let not Cerberus flee into his\n        cave, nor Proserpine [Persephone] shudder at my chariot. I, once the best beloved of augurs at Apollo's shrines,\n        call empty Chaos to bear witness--for what power to receive an oath has Apollo here?--for no crime do I suffer\n        this unwonted fate, nor have I deserved to be thus torn from the kindly light of day; the urn of the Dictean\n        judge [Minos] doth know it, and Minos can discern the truth. Sold by the treachery of my wife [Eriphyle] for\n        wicked gold, I joined the Argive host, not unwitting--hence this crowd of new-slain ghosts thou seest, and the\n        victims also of this right hand; in a sudden convulsion of the earth--my mind still shrinks in horror--thy\n        darkness swallowed me up from the midst of thousands. What were my feelings, while I made my way on and on\n        through the hollow womb of earth, and while I was whirled along, suspended in shrouding mist? Ah, woe is me!\n        Nought of me is left to my country of my friends, nor in the power of Thebes; no more shall I behold the roofs\n        of Lerna, nor shall I return in ashes to my stricken sire. With no pomp of tome or pyre or kinsmen's tears, to\n        thee am I come with all my funeral train, nor likely to venture aught with yonder steeds; content am I to\n        receive my Shade [i.e. Amphiaraus was not dead but rather dropped into Haides alive], nor remember my tripods\n        any more. For what avails thee the use of prescient augury, when the Parcae (Fates) [Moirai] spin thy commands?\n        Nay, be thou softened, and prove more merciful than the gods. If ever my accursed wife come hither, reserve for\n        her thy deadly torments: she is more worthy of thy wrath, O righteous lord!’ He accepts his prayer, and is\n        indignant that he yields . . . \n        Meanwhile his chariot, garlanded with sacred wool and victorious bay, and feared but of late for noble feats of\n        arms, is sought in the clear light of day in vain, though by none vanquished and by none put to flight : the\n        troops fall back, and the ground is suspected by all, and the soldiers avoid the traces of the dangerous field;\n        that ill-omened spot of ravenous destruction lies idle, shunned from awe of the hellish abyss.\n        While Adrastus in a different quarter is encouraging his men, Palaemon flies to him with tidings, scarce\n        trusting what he has seen, and cries in terror--for it chanced that he stood nigh the falling seer, and paled\n        poor wretch! to see the chasm open : ‘Turn prince and flee . . . the impious earth sucks in our chariots\n        and our weapons and men of war; lo! even the field where we stand seems to flee away. With my own eyes I saw the\n        road to deepest night, and the firm soil rent, and him, alas!

Godley) (Greek historian C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Kroisos (Croesus) [historical king of Lydia] . . . determined, if he could, to forestall the increase of\n        the Persian power before they became great. Having thus determined, he at once made inquiries of the Greek and\n        Libyan oracles, sending messengers separately to Delphoi (Delphi), to Abai in Phokia, and to Dodona, while\n        others were despatched to Amphiaraos (Amphiaraus) and Trophonios, and others to Brankhidae in the Milesian\n        country. These are the Greek oracles to which Kroisos sent for divination: and he told others to go inquire of\n        Ammon in Libya. His intent in sending was to test the knowledge of the oracles, so that, if they were found to\n        know the truth, he might send again and ask if he should undertake an expedition against the Persians . . . \n        As to the reply which the Lydians received from the oracle of Amphiaraos [which they consulted as well as the\n        Pythian] when they had followed the due custom of the temple, I cannot say what it was, for nothing is recorded\n        of it, except that Kroisos believed that from this oracle too he had obtained a true answer . . . \n        [Kroisos sent gifts in thanks to both oracles] to Amphiaraos, of whose courage and fate he had heard, he\n        dedicated a shield made entirely of gold and a spear all of solid gold, point and shaft alike. Both of these\n        were until my time at Thebes, in the Theban temple of Ismenian Apollon . . . \n        When the Lydians came to the places where they were sent, they presented the offerings, and inquired of the\n        oracles, in these words : ‘Kroisos, king of Lydia and other nations, believing that here are the only true\n        places of divination among men, endows you with such gifts as your wisdom deserves. And now he asks you whether\n        he is to send an army against the Persians, and whether he is to add an army of allies.’ Such was their\n        inquiry; and the judgment given to Kroisos by each of the two oracles was the same: namely, that if he should\n        send an army against the Persians he would destroy a great empire. And they advised him to discover the\n        mightiest of the Greeks and make them his friends.\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 1. 51. 1 : \n        \"To Amphiaraos, of whose courage and fate he [the historic Lydian king Kroisos (Croesus)] had heard, he\n        dedicated a shield made entirely of gold and a spear all of solid gold, point and shaft alike. Both of these\n        were until my time at Thebes, in the Theban temple of Apollon Ismenios.\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 8. 134. 1 ff : \n        \"He [the Greek general Mardonios, during the Persian War] sent a man of Europos called Mys to visit the\n        places of divination, charging him to inquire of all the oracles which he could test. What it was that he\n        desired to learn from the oracles when he gave this charge, I cannot say, for no one tells of it. I suppose that\n        he sent to inquire concerning his present business, and that alone.\n        This man Mys [historical figure] is known to have gone to Lebadea and to have bribed a man of the country to go\n        down into the cave of Trophonios . . . and moreover he bribed one who was no Theban but a stranger to lie down\n        to sleep in the shrine of Amphiaraos. No Theban may seek a prophecy there, for Amphiaraos bade them by an oracle\n        to choose which of the two they wanted [out of the oracles of Ismeian Apollon and Amphiaraos] and forgo the\n        other, and take him either for their prophet or for their ally.

Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"About twelve stades from the city [Oropos (Oropus) in Boiotia] is a sanctuary of Amphiaraos. Legend says\n        that when Amphiaraos was exiled from Thebes the earth opened and swallowed both him and his chariot. Only they\n        say that the incident did not happen here, the place called Harma (the Chariot) being on the road from Thebes to\n        Khalkis (Chalcis). The divinity of Amphiaraos was first established among the Oropians, from whom afterwards all\n        the Greeks received the cult. I can enumerate other men also born at this time who are worshipped among the\n        Greeks as gods; some even have cities dedicated to them, such as Eleus in Khersonnesos (Chersonese) dedicated to\n        Protesilaos, and Lebadea of the Boiotians dedicated to Trophonios.\n        The Oropians have both a temple and a white marble statue of Amphiaraos. The altar shows parts. One part is to\n        Herakles, Zeus, and Apollon Healer, another is given up to heroes and to wives of heroes, the third is to Hestia\n        and Hermes and Amphiaraos and the children of Amphilokhos (Amphilochus). But Alkmaion (Alcmaeon), because of his\n        treatment of Eriphyle, is honored neither in the temple of Amphiaraus nor yet with Amphilokhos. The fourth\n        portion of the altar is to Aphrodite and Panakea (All-Curing), and further to Iaso (Healer), Hygeia (Health) and\n        Athena Healer. The fifth is dedicated to the Nymphai (Nymphs) and to Pan, and to the rivers Akheloios (Achelous)\n        and Kephisos (Cephisus). The Athenians too have an altar to Amphilokhos [son of Amphiaraos] in the city, and\n        there is at Mallos in Kilikia (Cilicia) an oracle of his which is the most trustworthy of my day. The Oropians\n        have near the temple a spring, which they call the Spring of Amphiaraos; they neither sacrifice into it nor are\n        wont to use it for purifications or for lustral water. But when a man has been cured of a disease through a\n        response the custom is to throw silver and coined gold into the spring, for by this way they say that Amphiaraos\n        rose up after he had become a god. Iophon the Knossian, a guide, produced responses in hexameter verse, saying\n        that Amphiaraos gave them to the Argives who were sent against Thebes. These verses unrestrainedly appealed to\n        popular taste. Except those whom they say Apollon inspired of old none of the seers uttered oracles, but they\n        were good at explaining dreams and interpreting the flights of birds and the entrails of victims. My opinion is\n        that Amphiaraos devoted him self most to the exposition of dreams. It is manifest that, when his divinity was\n        established, it was a dream oracle that he set up. One who has come to consult Amphiaraos is wont first to\n        purify himself. The mode of purification is to sacrifice to the god, and they sacrifice not only to him but also\n        to all those whose names are on the altar. And when all these things have been first done, they sacrifice a ram,\n        and, spreading the skin under them, go to sleep and await enlightenment in a dream.\"\n\nPlutarch, Life of Aristides 19. 1 (trans.

Mardonios was slain by a man of Sparta named Arimnestos, who crushed his\n        head with a stone, even as was foretold him by the oracle in the shrine of Amphiaraos. Thither he had sent a\n        Lydian man, and a Karian besides to the oracle of Trophonios. This latter the prophet actually addressed in the\n        Karian tongue; but the Lydian, on lying down in the precinct of Amphiaraos, dreamed that an attendant of the god\n        stood by his side and bade him be gone, and on his refusal, hurled a great stone upon his head, insomuch that he\n        died from the blow (so ran the man's dream). These things are so reported.\"\n\nAthenaeus, Deipnosophistae 46c - d (trans.

Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[From a description of an ancient Greek painting of Amphiaraos swallowed by the chasm :] Amphiaraos\n        otherwise is in full armour, but he has left off his helmet, thus dedicating his head to Apollon, for his look\n        is holy and oracular. The painting depicts also [the town of] Oropos as a youth among bright-eyed women,\n        Thalattai (the Seas), and it depicts also the place used by Amphiaraos for meditation, a cleft holy and divine.\n        Aletheia (Truth) clad all in white is there and the gate of dreams (pylê oneirôn)--for\n        those who consult the oracle must sleep--and Oneiros (God of Dreams) himself is depicted in relaxed attitude,\n        wearing a white garment over a black one, I think representing his nocturnal and diurnal work.

And that\n        the gods also are of this opinion, and that they commit the faculty of oracular response to souls which are\n        sober, I will clearly show. There was, O king, a seer among the Greeks called Amphiaraos.’\n        ‘I know,’ said the other; ‘for you allude, I imagine, to the son of Oikles (Oicles), who was\n        swallowed up alive by the earth on his way back from Thebes.’\n        ‘This man, O king,’ said Apollonios, ‘still divines in Attika (Attica), inducing dreams in\n        those who consult him, and the priests take a man who wishes to consult him, and they prevent his eating for one\n        day, and from drinking wine for three, in order that he may imbibe the oracles with his soul in a condition of\n        utter transparence.
