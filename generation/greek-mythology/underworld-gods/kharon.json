  "content": "KHARON (Charon) was the Ferryman of the Dead, an underworld daimon (spirit) in the service of King Haides. Hermes Psykhopompos (Guide of the Dead)\n        gathered the shades of the dead from the upper world and led them down to the shores of the Akherousian (Acherusian) mere in the underworld where Kharon transported them\n        across the waters to Haides in his skiff. His fee was a single obolos coin which was placed in the\n        mouth of a corpse upon burial. Those who had not received proper burial were unable to pay the fee and were left\n        to wander the earthly side of the Akheron (Acheron), haunting the world as ghosts.\n\nKharon was depicted in ancient Greek art as an ugly, bearded man with a crooked nose, wearing a conical hat\n        and tunic. He was shown standing in his skiff holding a pole, about to receive a shade from Hermes Psykhopompos\n        (Psychopomp).\n\nThe Etruscans of central Italy identified him with one of their own underworld daimones who was named Charun\n        after the Greek figure. He was depicted as a more repulsive creature with blue-grey skin, a tusked mouth, hooked\n        nose and sometimes serpent-draped arms. His attribute was a large, double-headed mallet.\n\nImage right Perseus Project, July 2000\n        : \"Charon, the ferryman, prepares to ferry a soul across the Acheron to Hades. He wears a red tunic\n        (exomis) and conical hat (pilos). In one hand he holds an oar, and with the other he steadies himself\n        on the stern of his boat. On the right is his passenger, a woman wearing a black chiton. Between the two figures\n        are the tall reeds of the river.\"\n\nCHARON (Charôn), a son of Erebos, the aged and dirty ferryman in the lower world, who conveyed in his\n        boat the shades of the dead--though only of those whose bodies were buried--across the rivers of the lower\n        world. (Virg. Aen. vi. 295, &c.; Senec. Herc. fur. 764.) For this service he was paid by\n        each shade with an obolus or danace, which coin was placed in the mouth of every dead body previous to its\n        burial. This notion of Charon seems to be of late origin, for it does not occur in any of the early poets of\n        Greece. (Paus. x. 28. § 1; Juven. iii. 267; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1666.) Charon was represented in\n        the Lesche of Delphi by Polygnotus.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPindar, Fragment 143 (trans.

And those who are found to have lived neither well nor ill,\n        go to the Akheron (Acheron) and, embarking upon vessels provided for them [i.e. the equivalent of Kharon's\n        (Charon's) skiff], arrive in them at the lake; there they dwell and are purified [i.e. by the equivalent of the\n        Erinyes], and if they have done any wrong they are absolved by paying the penalty for their wrong\n        doings, and for their good deeds they receive rewards, each according to his merits.\"\n\nCallimachus, Iambi Fragment 1 (from Oxyrhynchus Papyri 7) (trans.

Page, Vol. Select Papyri III, No. 125) (Greek lyric\n          C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Blessed was Midas, thrice-blessed was Kinyras (Cinyras) [i.e. mythical kings famed for their wealth] : but\n        what man went to Haides with more than one penny piece (obolos) [i.e. to pay the ferryman Kharon]?\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 8. 6. 12 (trans.

Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The other part of the picture [of a painting of the Underworld by Polygnotos (Polygnotus) at Delphoi], the\n        one on the left, shows Odysseus, who has descended into what is called Haides to inquire of the soul of\n        Teiresias (Tiresias) about his safe return home. The objects depicted are as follow. There is water like a\n        river, clearly intended for Akheron (Acheron), with reeds growing in it; the forms of the fishes appear so dim\n        that you will take them to be shadows rather than fish. On the river is a boat, with the ferryman at the\n        oars.\n        Polygnotos followed, I think, the poem called the Minyas. For in this poem occur lines referring to Theseus and\n        Peirithous (Pirithous):--‘Then the boat on which embark the dead, that the old ferryman, Kharon (Charon),\n        used to steer, they found not within its moorings.’\n        For this reason then Polygnotos too painted Kharon as a man well stricken in years.\n        Those on board the boat are not altogether distinguished. Tellis appears as a youth in years, and Kleoboia\n        (Cleoboea) as still a maiden, holding on her knees a chest such as they are wont to make for Demeter [in the\n        Mysteries]. All I heard about Tellis was that Arkhilokhos (Archilochus) the poet was his grandson, while as for\n        Kleoboia, they say that she was the first to bring the Orgia (Mysteries) of Demeter to Thasos from Paros.\n        On the bank of Akheron there is a notable group under the boat of Kharon, consisting of a man who had been\n        undutiful to his father and is now being throttled by him. For the men of old held their parents in the greatest\n        respect, as we may infer, among other instances, from those in Katana called the Pious . . . \n        Near to the man in Polygnotos' picture who maltreated his father and for this drinks his cup of woe in Haides,\n        is a man who paid the penalty for sacrilege. The woman who is punishing him is skilled in poisonous and other\n        drugs.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 10. 72 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"He [the bard Orpheus] longed, he begged, in vain to be allowed to cross the stream of Styx a second time\n        [to bring back his beloved Eurydike (Eurydice)]. The ferryman [Kharon (Charon)] repulsed him. Even so for seven\n        days he sat upon the bank, unkempt and fasting, anguish, grief and tears his nourishment, and cursed Erebus'\n        cruelty.\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 6. 299 (trans. Day-Lewis) (Roman epic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"[The Sibylla (Sibyl) guides Aeneas through the Underworld :] From here [the path to the underworld] is the\n        road that leads to the dismal waters of Acheron. Here a whirlpool boils with mud and immense swirlings of water,\n        spouting up the slimy sand of Cocytos.\n        A dreadful ferryman looks after the river crossing, Charon : appalling filthy he is, with a bush of unkempt\n        white beard upon his chin, with eyes like jets of fire; and a dirty cloak draggles down, knotted about his\n        shoulders. He poles the boat, he looks after the sails, he is all the crew of that rust-coloured wherry which\n        takes the dead across--an ancient now, but a god's old age is green and sappy.\n        This way come fast and streaming up the bank the whole throng: matrons and men were there, and there were\n        great-hearted heroes finished with earthly life, boys and unmarried maidens, young men laid on the pyre before\n        their parents' eyes; multitudinous as the leaves that fall in a forest at the first frost of autumn . . . So\n        they all stood, each begging to be ferried across first, their hands stretched out in longing for the shore\n        beyond the river. But the surly ferryman embarks now this, now that group, while others he keeps away at a\n        distance from the shingle. Aeneas, being astonished and moved by the great stir, said:--‘Tell me, O Sibyl,\n        what means this mustering at the river? What purpose have these souls? By what distinction are some turned back,\n        while others sweep over the wan water?’\n        To which the long-lived Sibyl uttered this brief reply:--‘O son of Anchises' loins and true-born offspring\n        of heaven, what you see is the mere of Cocytos, the Stygian marsh, by whose mystery even the gods, having sworn,\n        are afraid to be forsworn. All this crowd you see are the helpless ones. the unburied: that ferryman is Charon:\n        the ones he conveys have had burial. None may be taken across from bank of that harsh-voiced river until his\n        bones are laid to rest. Otherwise, he must haunt this place for a hundred years before he's allowed to revisit\n        the longed-for stream at last.’\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 6. 383 ff : \n        \"[Aeneas and the Sibyl] drew near the river. Now when the ferryman [Kharon (Charon)], from out on the Styx,\n        espied them threading the soundless wood and making fast for the bank, he hailed them, aggressively shouting at\n        them before they could speak:--‘Whoever you are that approaches my river, carrying a weapon, halt there!\n        Keep your distance, and tell me why you are come! This is the land of ghosts, of sleep and somnolent night: the\n        living are not permitted to use the Stygian ferry. Not with impunity did I take Hercules, when he came, upon\n        this water, not Theseus, nor Peirithous, though their stock was divine and their powers were irresistible.\n        Hercules wished to drag off on a leach the watch-dog of Hades, even from our monarch's throne, and dragged it\n        away trembling: the others essayed to kidnap our queen from her lord's bedchamber.’\n        The priestess of Apollo [the Sibyl] answered him shortly, thus:--‘There is no duplicity here, so set your\n        mind at rest; these weapons offer no violence: the huge watch-dog [Kerberos (Cerberus)] in his kennel may go on\n        barking for ever and scaring the bloodlesss dead, Proserpine [Persephone] keep her uncle's house, unthreatened\n        in chastity. Trojan Aeneas, renowned for war and a duteous heart, comes down to meet his father in the shades of\n        the Underworld. If you are quite unmoved by the spectacle of such great faith this you must\n        recognize--’\n        And there she disclosed the golden bough which was hid in her robe. His angry mood calms down. No more is said.\n        Charon is struck with awe to see after so long that magic gift, the bough fate-given; he turns his sombre boat\n        and poles it towards the bank. Then, displacing the souls who were seated along its benches and clearing the\n        gangways, to make room for the big frame of Aeneas, he takes him on board. The ramshackle craft creaked under\n        his weight and let in through its seams great swashes of muddy water. At last, getting the Sibyl and the hero\n        safe across, he landed them amidst wan reeds on a dreary mud flat. Huge Cerberus, [was] monstrously couched in\n        the cave confronting them.\"\n\nVirgil, Georgics 4. 471 ff (trans. Fairclough) (Roman bucolic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"Now, as he [Orpheus returning from the underworld] retraced his steps, he had avoided all mischance, and\n        the regained Eurydice was nearing the upper world, following behind . . . He halted, and on the very verge of\n        light, unmindful, alas, and vanquished in purpose, on Eurydice, now regained looked back! In that instant all\n        his toil was split like water, the ruthless tyrant's [Haides'] pact was broken . . . and straightway from his\n        sight vanished afar and saw him not again . . . nor did [Kharon (Charon)] the ferryman of Orcus suffer him again\n        to pass the barrier of the marsh. What could he do? Whither turn, twice robbed of his wife? With what tears move\n        Hell? To what deities address his prayers?

But for you, may the ferryman convey to the\n        place whither he gives passage to the shades of the righteous the body no longer tenanted by your soul.\"\n\nPropertius, Elegies 4. 7 ff : \n        \"Two abodes have been appointed along the foul river [Akheron (Acheron)], and the whole host rows this way\n        or that [in the boat of Kharon (Charon)].

This stream an old man [Kharon (Charon)] tends, clad in foul garb and to the sight\n        abhorrent, and ferries over the quaking shades. His beard hangs down unkempt; a knot ties his robe's misshapen\n        folds; haggard his sunken cheeks; himself his own boatman, with a long pole he directs his craft. Now, having\n        discharged his load, he is turning his boat towards the bank, seeking the ghosts again; Alcides [Herakles]\n        demands passage, while the crowd draws back.

And\n        sometimes the sick give heed also to their own dreams, but still they use those other men, as priests, to\n        initiate them into the mysteries and to counsel them. To all others the place is forbidden and deadly. A\n        festival is celebrated every year at Akharaka (Acharaca); and at that time in particular those who celebrate the\n        festival can see and hear concerning all these things; and at the festival, too, about noon, the boys and young\n        men of the gymnasium, nude and anointed with oil, take up a bull and with haste carry him up into the cave; and,\n        when let loose, the bull goes forward a short distance, falls, and breathes out his life.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 14. 1. 11 : \n        \"One comes to a village [in Karia (Caria)], the Karian Thymbria, near which is Aornon, a sacred cave, which\n        is called Kharonion (Charonium), since it emits deadly vapors.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Juvenal 3.267, Eustathius on Homer 1666.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
