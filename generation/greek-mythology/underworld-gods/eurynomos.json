  "content": "EURYNOMOS (Eurynomus) was a flesh-devouring daimon (spirit) of the underworld who stripped the flesh from the\n        rotting corpses of the dead. He was depicted as a man with black-blue skin seated on a vulture's skin.\n        Eurynomos was associated with carrion-feeders such as vultures and meat-flies. His name means\n        \"Wide-Ruling\" from the Greek words eury- and nomos.\n\nPresumably EREBOS & NYX,\n        though nowhere stated\n\nEURY′NOMUS (Eurunomos), a daemon of the lower world, concerning whom there was a tradition at Delphi,\n        according to which, he devoured the flesh of dead human bodies, and left nothing but the bones. Polygnotus\n        represented him in the Lesche at Delphi, of a dark-blue complexion, showing his teeth, and sitting on the skin\n        of a vulture. (Paus. x. 28. § 4.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 10. 28. 7 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Depicted in a painting of the Underworld by Polygnotos C5th B.C. at Delphoi (Delphi) :] Eurynomos, said\n        by the Delphian guides to be one of the daimones (daemons) of Haides, who eats off all the flesh of the corpses,\n        leaving only their bones. But Homer's Odyssey, the poem called the Minyad, and the\n        Returns, although they tell of Haides and its horrors, know of no Daimon called Eurynomos. However, I\n        will describe what he is like and his attitude in the painting. He is of a colour between blue and black, like\n        that of meat flies; he is showing his teeth and is seated, and under him is spread a vulture's skin.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
