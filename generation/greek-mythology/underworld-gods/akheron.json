The daimon Kharon (Charon) ferried the souls of the dead across its dark waters in his skiff.\n\n[1.1] ASKALAPHOS (by Gorgyra) (Apollodorus 1.33)\n        [1.2] ASKALAPHOS (by Orphne) (Ovid Metamorphoses 5.539)\n\nACHERON (Acherôn). In ancient geography there occur several rivers of this name, all of which were, at\n        least at one time, believed to be connected with the lower world. The river first looked upon in this light was\n        the Acheron in Thesprotia, in Epirus, a country which appeared to the earliest Greeks as the end of the world in\n        the west, and the locality of the river led them to the belief that it was the entrance into the lower world.\n        When subsequently Epirus and the countries beyond the sea became better known, the Acheron or the entrance to\n        the lower world was transferred to other more distant parts, and at last the Acheron was placed in the lower\n        world itself. Thus we find in the Homeric poems (Od. x. 513; comp. Paus. i. 17, § 5) the Acheron\n        described as a river of Hades, into which the Pyriphlegeton and Cocytus are said to flow. Virgil (Aen.\n        vi. 297, with the note of Servius) describes it as the principal river of Tartarus, from which the Styx and\n        Cocytus sprang. According to later traditions, Acheron had been a son of Helios and Gaea or Demeter, and was\n        changed into the river bearing his name in the lower world, because he had refreshed the Titans with drink\n        during their contest with Zeus. They further state that Ascalaphus was a son of Acheron and Orphne or Gorgyra.\n        (Natal. Com. iii. 1.) In late writers the name Acheron is used in a general sense to designate the whole of the\n        lower world. (Virg. Aen. vii. 312; Cic. post redit. in Senat. 10; C. Nepos, Dion,\n        10.) The Etruscans too were acquainted with the worship of Acheron (Acheruns) from very early times, as we must\n        infer from their Acheruntici libri, which among various other things treated on the deification of the souls,\n        and on the sacrifices (Acheruntia sacra) by which this was to be effected. (Müller,\n        Etrusker, ii. 27, &c.) The description of the Acheron and the lower world in general in Plato's\n        Phaedo (p. 112) is very peculiar, and not very easy to understand.\n\nACHERU′SIA (Acherousia limnê or Acherousis), a name given by the ancients to several lakes or\n        swamps, which, like the various rivers of the name of Acheron, were at some time believed to be connected\n        with the lower world, until at last the Acherusia came to be considered to be in the lower\n        world itself. The lake to which this belief seems to have been first attached was the Acherusia in Thesprotia,\n        through which the river Acheron flowed. (Thuc. i. 46; Strab. vii. p. 324.) Other lakes or swamps of the same\n        name, and believed to be in connexion with the lower world, were near Hermione in Argolis (Paus. ii. 35. §\n        7), near Heraclea in Bithynia (Xen. Anab. vi. 2. § 2; Diod. xiv. 31), between Cumae and cape\n        Misenum in Campania (Plin. H. N. iii. 5; Strab. v. p. 243), and lastly in Egypt, near Memphis. (Diod.\n        i. 96.)\n\nCATAE′BATES ( Kataibatês), occurs as a surname of several gods.Of Acheron, being the first river to\n        which the shades descended in the lower world. Of Hermes, who conducted the shades into Hades. (Schol. ad\n          Aristoph. Pac. 649.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 33 (trans.

Fowler) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"[The] streams are many and great and of all sorts, but among the many are four streams, the greatest and\n        outermost of which is that called Okeanos (Oceanus), which flows round in a circle, and opposite this, flowing\n        in the opposite direction, is Akheron (Acheron), which flows through various desert places and, passing\n        under the earth, comes to the Akherousian (Acherusian) Lake. To this lake the souls of most of the dead go and,\n        after remaining there the appointed time, which is for some longer and for others shorter, are sent back to be\n        born again into living beings. The third river flows out between these two, and near the place whence it issues\n        it falls into a vast region burning with a great fire and makes a lake larger than our Mediterranean sea,\n        boiling with water and mud. Thence it flows in a circle, turbid and muddy, and comes in its winding course,\n        among other places, to the edge of the Akherousian lake, but does not mingle with its water. Then, after winding\n        about many times underground, it flows into Tartaros at a lower level. This is the river which is called\n        Pyriphlegethon, and the streams of lava which spout up at various places on earth are offshoots from it.\n        Opposite this the fourth river issues, it is said, first into a wild and awful place, which is all of a dark\n        blue color, like lapis lazuli. This is called the Stygios (Stygian River), and the lake which it forms by\n        flowing in is the Styx. And when the river has flowed in here and has received fearful powers into its waters,\n        it passes under the earth and, circling round in the direction opposed to that of Pyriphlegethon, it meets it\n        coming from the other way in the Akherousian Lake. And the water of this river also mingles with no other water,\n        but this also passes round in a circle and falls into Tartaros opposite Pyriphlegethon. And the name of this\n        river, as the Poets say, is Kokytos (Coytus). Such is the nature of these things.\n        Now when the dead have come to the place where each is led by his genius (daimon) [i.e. by Plato's\n        equivalent of Hermes Guide of the Dead], first they are judged and sentenced [i.e. by the Judges of the Dead],\n        as they have lived well and piously, or not. And those who are found to have lived neither well nor ill, go to\n        the Akheron and, embarking upon vessels provided for them [i.e. the equivalent of Kharon's (Charon's) skiff],\n        arrive in them at the lake; there they dwell and are purified [i.e. by the equivalent of the Erinyes], and if\n        they have done any wrong they are absolved by paying the penalty for their wrong doings, and for their good\n        deeds they receive rewards, each according to his merits . . .\n        Those who are curable, but are found to have committed great sin--who have, for example, in a moment of passion\n        done some act of violence against father or mother and have lived in repentance the rest of their lives, or\n        who have slain some other person under similar conditions--these must needs be thrown into Tartaros, and when\n        they have been there a year the wave casts them out, the homicides by way of Kokytos, those who have outraged\n        their parents by way of Pyriphlegethon. And when they have been brought by the current to the Akherousian Lake,\n        they shout and cry out, calling to those whom they have slain or outraged, begging and beseeching them to be\n        gracious and to let them come out into the lake; and if they prevail they come out and cease from their ills,\n        but if not, they are borne away again to Tartaros and thence back into the rivers, and this goes on until they\n        prevail upon those whom they have wronged; for this is the penalty imposed upon them by the judges.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 352 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The coast of the Mariandyni [on the south shore of the Black Sea]. Here there is path that leads down to\n        Hades' realm, and rising high above it, the promontory of Akherusias (Acherusias), where the swirling waters of\n        Akheron (Acheron) gush up from the very bowels of the rock and pour down to the sea by way of a deep\n        ravine.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 726 : \n        \"They [the Argonauts] made harbour at dawn by the Cape Akherousias (Acherusias) [on the Black Sea coast of\n        Maryiandynia].

Beneath it at sea\n        level lies a solid platform of smooth rock on which rollers break and roar, while high up on the very summit\n        plane trees spread out their branches.

Here is the Cavern\n        of Haides with its overhanging trees and rocks, from the chill depths of which an icy breath comes up and each\n        morning covers everything with sparkling rime that melts under the midday sun.

And if\n        they prevail, then they come forth and cease from their troubles; but if not, they are carried back again into\n        Tartaros and from thence into the rivers unceasingly, until they obtain mercy from those whom they have wronged:\n        for that is the sentence inflicted upon them by their judges.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 10. 28. 1 ff (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The other part of the picture [of the Underworld in a painting at Delphoi by the C5th B.C. artist\n        Polygnotos], the one on the left, shows Odysseus, who has descended into what is called Haides to inquire of the\n        soul of Teiresias (Tiresias) about his safe return home. The objects depicted are as follow. There is water like\n        a river, clearly intended for Akheron (Acheron), with reeds growing in it; the forms of the fishes appear so dim\n        that you will take them to be shadows rather than fish. On the river is a boat, with the ferryman at the\n        oars.\n        Polygnotos followed, I think, the poem called the Minyas. For in this poem occur lines referring to Theseus and\n        Peirithous :--‘Then the boat on which embark the dead, that the old ferryman, Kharon (Charon), used to\n        steer, they found not within its moorings.’\n        For this reason then Polygnotos too painted Kharon as a man well stricken in years.\n        Those on board the boat are not altogether distinguished. Tellis appears as a youth in years, and Kleoboia as\n        still a maiden, holding on her knees a chest such as they are wont to make for Demeter [in the Mysteries]. All I\n        heard about Tellis was that Arkhilokhos (Archilochus) the poet was his grandson, while as for Kleoboia\n        (Cleoboea), they say that she was the first to bring the Orgia (Mysteries) of Demeter to Thasos from Paros.\n        On the bank of Akheron there is a notable group under the boat of Kharon, consisting of a man who had been\n        undutiful to his father and is now being throttled by him. For the men of old held their parents in the greatest\n        respect, as we may infer, among other instances, from those in Katana (Catana) called the Pious . . .\n        Near to the man in Polygnotos' picture who maltreated his father and for this drinks his cup of woe in Haides,\n        is a man who paid the penalty for sacrilege.

Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"I will pass even to Akheron (Acheron) the River of Pain of my own free will, and with rapture even amid\n        the many lamentations of all-forgetting Lethe, I will tell the dead of my fate, to awaken pity and envy alike in\n        merciless Persephoneia.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 17. 300 ff : \n        \"You will have river-water enough when you drink the fatal water of Akheron (Acheron). Your belly swells\n        already with the bitter water of a murdering stream, and teems quick with Fate; but taste of Kokytos (Cocytus),\n        and drink Lethe if you like, that you may forget Ares and the bloody steel.\"\n\nSuidas s.v. Akherousia (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Akherousia (Acherusia) : A lake in Haides, which the dying cross over, giving to the ferryman [Kharon\n        (Charon)] the coin which is called a danake.\"\n\nSuidas s.v.

Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Akheron (Acheron) : A river in Haides mentioned in myth; [the name comes] from akhe rhein\n        (flowing in misery or pain).

And a dirge, kokytos, is an imitation of a voice of those mourning.\"\n\nThe region of Thesprotia in north-eastern Greece had a river named Akheron (Acheron) which was closely\n        identified with the underworld stream. Near the river was a chthonic shrine of the gods Haides and Persephone.\n\nThucydides, The Peloponnesian War 1. 46. 1 (trans. Crawley) (Greek historian C5th\n          B.C.) : \n        \"The territory of Thesprotis [in Greece], above which, at some distance from the sea, lies the city of\n        Ephyre, in the Elean district. By this city the Akherousian (Acherusian) lake pours its waters into the sea. It\n        gets its name from the river Akheron (Acheron), which flows through Thesprotis, and falls into the lake.\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 5. 92. 1 (trans. Godley) (Greek historian C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Periander [tyrant of Ambracia C6th B.C.] sent messengers to the Nekyomanteion (Necyomantium) (Oracle of\n        the Dead) on the river Akheron (Acheron) in Thesprotia to enquire concerning a deposit that a friend had left,\n        but [the ghost of his dead wife] Melissa, in an apparition [at the oracle], said that she would tell him\n        nothing.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 6. 1. 5 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Strabo describes two eathly rivers named Akheron (Acheron), one in Thesprotia, Greece, the other in\n        Bruttium, Italy :] Akheron and Pandosia; for places which bore these names were pointed out to him in\n        Thesprotia, but he came to his end here in Brettium. Now the fortress has three summits (Pandosia), and the\n        River Akheron flows past it.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 17. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"They say he [Theseus] was kept a prisoner until Herakles restored him to the light of day, but the most\n        plausible account I have heard is this. Theseus invaded Thesprotia to carry off the wife of the Thesprotian\n        king, and in this way lost the greater part of his army, and both he and Peirithoos (Pirithous) (he too was\n        taking part in the expedition, being eager for the marriage) were taken captive. The Thesprotian king kept them\n        prisoners at Kikhyros (Cichyrus).\n        Among the sights of Thesprotia are a sanctuary of Zeus at Dodona and an oak sacred to the god. Near Kikhyros is\n        a lake called Akherousia (Acherusia), and a river called Akheron (Acheron). There is also Kokytos (Cocytus), a\n        most unlovely stream. I believe it was because Homer had seen these places that he made bold to describe in his\n        poems the regions of Haides, and gave to the rivers there the names of those in Thesprotia.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 14. 2 :\n        \"The Eleans are wont to use for the sacrifices to Zeus the wood of the white poplar and of no other tree,\n        preferring the white poplar, I think, simply and solely because Herakles brought it into Greece from Thesprotia.\n        And it is my opinion that when Herakles sacrificed to Zeus at Olympia he himself burned the thigh bones of the\n        victims upon wood of the white poplar. Herakles found the white poplar growing on the banks of the Akheron\n        (Acheron), the river in Thesprotia, and for this reason Homer calls it Akherois (Acherois). So from the first\n        down to the present all rivers have not been equally suited for the growth of plants and trees. Tamarisks grow\n        best and in the greatest numbers by the Maiandros (Meander) . . . So it is no wonder that the white poplar grew\n        first by the Akheron.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
