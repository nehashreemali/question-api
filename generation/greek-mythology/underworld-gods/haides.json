  "content": "HAIDES (Hades) was the king of the underworld and god of the dead. He presided over funeral rites and defended\n        the right of the dead to due burial. Haides was also the god of the hidden wealth of the earth, from the fertile\n        soil with nourished the seed-grain, to the mined wealth of gold, silver and other metals.\n\nHaides was devoured by Kronos (Cronus) as soon as he was born, along\n        with four of his siblings. Zeus later caused the Titan to disgorge them, and\n        together they drove the Titan gods from heaven and locked them away in the\n        pit of Tartaros. When the three victorious brothers then drew lots for the division of the cosmos, Haides\n        received the third portion, the dark dismal realm of the underworld, as his domain.\n\nHaides desired a bride and petitioned his brother Zeus to grant him one of his daughters. The god offered him\n        Persephone, the daughter of Demeter. However, knowing that the goddess would\n        resist the marriage, he assented to the forceful abduction of the girl. When Demeter learned of this, she was furious and caused a great dearth to fall\n        upon the earth until her daughter was returned. Zeus was forced to concede lest mankind perish, and the girl was\n        fetched forth from the underworld. However, since she had tasted of the pomegranate seed, she was forced to\n        return to him for a portion of each year.\n\nHaides was depicted as a dark-bearded, regal god. He was depicted as either Aidoneus, enthroned in the\n        underworld, holding a bird-tipped sceptre, or as Plouton (Pluton), the giver of wealth, pouring fertility from a\n        cornucopia. The Romans named him Dis, or Pluto, the Latin form of his Greek title Plouton, \"the Lord of\n        Riches.\"\n\n[1.1] KRONOS & RHEA (Hesiod Theogony 453, Homer Iliad 15.187, Apollodorus 1.4, Diodorus Siculus 5.68.1,\n          Hyginus Pref)\n\n[1.1] THE ERINYES (by Persephone) (Orphic Hymns 29.6 70.3)\n        [1.2] THE ERINYES (Statius Thebaid 12.557 &\n          11.47)\n        [2.1] ZAGREUS (Aeschylus Frag 124)\n        [3.1] MELINOE (by Persephone) (Orphic Hymn 71)\n        [4.1] MAKARIA (Suidas s.v. Makaria)\n\nHADES or PLUTON (Haidês, Ploutôn or poetically Aïdês, Aidôneus and Ploutens), the\n        god of the lower world. Plato (Cratyl. p. 403) observes that people preferred calling him Pluton (the\n        giver of wealth) to pronouncing the dreaded name of Hades or Aides. Hence we find that in ordinary life and in\n        the mysteries the name Pluton became generally established, while the poets preferred the ancient name Aides or\n        the form Pluteus. The etymology of Hades is uncertain: some derive it from a-idein, whence it would\n        signify \"the god who makes invisible,\" and others from hadô or chadô; so that\n        Hades would mean \"the allembracer,\" or \"all-receiver.\" The Roman poets use the names Dis, Orcus, and Tartarus as\n        synonymous with Pluton, for the god of the lower world.\n\nHades is a son of Cronus and Rhea, and a brother of Zeus and Poseidon. He was married to Persephone, the\n        daughter of Demeter. In the division of the world among the three brothers, Hades obtained \"the darkness of\n        night,\" the abode of the shades, over which he rules. (Apollod. i. 1. § 5, 2. § 1.) Hence he is called\n        the infernal Zeus (Zeus katachthonios), or the king of the shades (anae enerôn, Hom. Il. ix. 457,\n        xx. 61. xv. 187, &c.). As, however, the earth and Olympus belonged to the three brothers in common, he might\n        ascend Olympus, as he did at the time when he was wounded by Heracles. (Il. v. 395; comp. Paus. vi. 25.\n        § 3; Apollod. ii. 7. § 3; Pind. Ol. ix. 31.) But when Hades was in his own kingdom, he was\n        quite unaware of what was going on either on earth or in Olympus (Il. xx. 61, &c.), and it was only\n        the oaths and curses of men that reached his ears, as they reached those of the Erinnyes. He possessed a helmet\n        which rendered the wearer invisible (Il. v. 845), and later traditions stated that this helmet was\n        given him as a present by the Cyclopes after their delivery from Tartarus. (Apollod. i. 2. § 1.) Ancient\n        story mentions both gods and men who were honoured by Hades with the temporary use of this helmet. (Apollod. i.\n        6. § 2, ii. 4. § 2.) His character is described as fierce and inexorable, whence of all the gods he\n        was most hated by mortals. (Il. ix. 158.) He kept the gates of the lower world closed (whence he is\n        called Pulartês, Il. viii. 367; comp. Paus. v. 20. § 1.; Orph. Hymn. 17. 4), that\n        no shade might be able to escape or return to the region of light. When mortals invoked him, they struck the\n        earth with their hands (Il. ix. 567), and the sacrifices which were offered to him and Persephone\n        consisted of black male and female sheep, and the person who offered the sacrifice had to turn away his face.\n        (Od. x. 527; Serv. ad Virg. Georg. ii. 380.)\n\nThe ensign of his power was a staff, with which, like Hermes, he drove the shades into the lower world (Pind.\n        Ol. ix. 35), where he had his palace and shared his throne with his consort Persephone. When he carried\n        off Persephone from the upper world, he rode in a golden chariot drawn by four black immortal horses. (Orph.\n        Argon. 1192, Hymn. 17. 14; Ov. Met. v. 404; Hom. Hymn. in Cer. 19; Claudian,\n        Rapt. Proserp. i. in fin.) Besides these horses he was also believed to have herds of oxen in the lower\n        world and in the island of Erytheia, which were attended to by Menoetius. (Apollod. ii. 5. §§ 10, 12.)\n        Like the other gods, he was not a faithful husband; the Furies are called his daughters (Serv. ad Aen.\n        i. 86); the nymph Mintho, whom he loved, was metamorphosed by Persephone into the plant called mint (Strab.\n        viii. p. 344; Ov. Met. x. 728), and the nymph Leuce, with whom he was likewise in love, was changed by\n        him after her death into a white poplar, and transferred to Elysium. (Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. vii. 61.)\n        Being the king of the lower world, Pluton is the giver of all the blessings that come from the earth: he is the\n        possessor and giver of all the metals contained in the earth, and hence his name Pluton. (Hes. Op. et\n          Dies, 435; Aeschyl. Prom. 805; Strab. iii. p. 147; Lucian, Tim. 21.) He bears several\n        surnames referring to his ultimately assembling all mortals in his kingdom, and bringing them to rest and peace;\n        such as Polydegmon, Polydectes, Clymenus, Pankoitês, &c. (Hom. Hymn. in Cer. 9; Aeschyl.\n        Prom. 153 ; Soph. Antig. 811; Paus. ii. 35. § 7.) Hades was worshipped throughout Greece\n        and Italy. In Elis he had a sacred enclosure and a temple, which was opened only once in every year (Paus. vi.\n        25. § 3) ; and we further know that lie had temples at Pylos Triphyliacus, near Mount Menthe, between\n        Tralles and Nysa, at Athens in the grove of the Erinnyes, and at Olympia. (Strab. iii. p. 344, xiv. p. 649 Paus.\n        i. 28. § 6, v. 20. § 1.) We possess few representations of this divinity, but in those which still\n        exist, he resembles his brothers Zeus and Poseidon, except that his hair falls down his forehead, and that the\n        majesty of his appearance is dark and gloomy. His ordinary attributes are the key of Hades and Cerberus.\n\nIn Homer Aides is invariably the name of the god; but in later times it was transferred to his house, his abode\n        or kingdom, so that it became a name for the lower world itself. We cannot enter here into a description of the\n        conceptions which the ancients formed of the lower world, for this discussion belongs to mythical geography.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 453 ff (trans.

After ten years of fighting Ge (Gaea,\n        Earth) prophesied a victory for Zeus if he were to secure the prisoners down in Tartaros as his allies. He\n        thereupon slew their jail-keeper Kampe (Campe), and freed them from their bonds. In return the Kyklopes\n        (Cyclopes) gave Zeus thunder, lightning, and a thunderbolt, as well as a helmet for Plouton (Pluton) [Haides]\n        and a trident for Poseidon. Armed with these the three gods overpowered the Titanes, confined them in Tartaros,\n        and put the Hekatonkheires (Hecatoncheires) in charge of guarding them.

Lamb) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"Sokrates (Socrates) : Give ear then, as they say, to a right fine story, which you will regard as a fable,\n        I fancy, but I as an actual account; for what I am about to tell you I mean to offer as the truth. By Homer's\n        account, Zeus, Poseidon, and Plouton (Pluton) [Haides] divided the sovereignty amongst them when they took it\n        over from their father [Kronos (Cronus)]. Now in the time of Kronos there was a law concerning mankind, and it\n        holds to this very day amongst the gods, that every man who has passed a just and holy life departs after his\n        decease to the Isles of the Blest (Nesoi Makaron), and dwells in all happiness apart from ill; but\n        whoever has lived unjustly and impiously goes to the dungeon of requital and penance which, you know, they call\n        Tartaros. Of these men there were judges in Kronos' time, and still of late in the reign of Zeus--living men to\n        judge the living upon the day when each was to breathe his last; and thus the cases were being decided amiss. So\n        Plouton [Haides] and the overseers from the Isles of the Blest came before Zeus with the report that they found\n        men passing over to either abode undeserving. Then spake Zeus : ‘Nay,’ said he, ‘I will put a\n        stop to these proceedings. The cases are now indeed judged ill and it is because they who are on trial are tried\n        in their clothing, for they are tried alive. Now many,’ said he, ‘who have wicked souls are clad in\n        fair bodies and ancestry and wealth, and at their judgement appear many witnesses to testify that their lives\n        have been just. Now, the judges are confounded not only by their evidence but at the same time by being clothed\n        themselves while they sit in judgement, having their own soul muffled in the veil of eyes and ears and the whole\n        body. Thus all these are a hindrance to them, their own habiliments no less than those of the judged. Well,\n        first of all,’ he said, ‘we must put a stop to their foreknowledge of their death; for this they at\n        present foreknow. However, Prometheus has already been given the word to stop this in them. Next they must be\n        stripped bare of all those things before they are tried; for they must stand their trial dead. Their judge also\n        must be naked, dead, beholding with very soul the very soul of each immediately upon his death, bereft of all\n        his kin and having left behind on earth all that fine array, to the end that the judgement may be just. Now I,\n        knowing all this before you, have appointed sons of my own to be judges; two from Asia, Minos and Rhadamanthys,\n        and one from Europe, Aiakos (Aeacus). These, when their life is ended, shall give judgement in the meadow at the\n        dividing of the road, whence are the two ways leading, one to the Isles of the Blest (Nesoi Makaron),\n        and the other to Tartaros. And those who come from Asia shall Rhadamanthys try, and those from Europe, Aiakos;\n        and to Minos I will give the privilege of the final decision, if the other two be in any doubt; that the\n        judgement upon this journey of mankind may be supremely just.’\"\n\nHaides was usually regarded as an infertile god, for a god of the dead should, by his very nature, be incapable\n        of siring children.\n\nIn Orphic myth, it is heavenly Zeus rather than Haides who impregnates Persephone, sometimes in the guise of\n        an earthly dragon, sometimes in the form of her own husband.\n\nThe three goddesses of earthly wrath were sometimes represented as daughters of Haides. The usual account,\n        however, describes them as earth-born.\n\nOrphic Hymn 70 to the Eumenides (trans.

Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"When Jove [Zeus] saw that they [Theseus and Peirithous] had such audacity [kidnapping Helene] as to expose\n        themselves to danger, he bade them in a dream both go and ask Pluto on Pirithous' part for Proserpina\n        [Persephone] in marriage. When they had descended to the Land of the Dead through the peninsula Taenarus, and\n        had informed Pluto [Haides] why they had come, they were stretched out and tortured for a long time by the\n        Furies. When Hercules came to lead out the three-headed dog, they begged his promise of protection. He obtained\n        the favor from Pluto, and brought them out unharmed.\"\n\nOvid, Heroides 2. 67 ff (trans. Showerman) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"With record of his [Theseus'] deeds. When men shall have read of . . . the knocking at the gloomy palace\n        of the darksome god.\"\n\nSeneca, Phaedra 93 ff (trans. Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Through the deep shades of the pool which none recrosses is he [Theseus] faring, this brave recruit of a\n        madcap suitor [Peirithoos (Pirithous)], that from the very throne of the infernal king [Haides] he may rob and\n        bear away his wife [Persephone]. He hurries on, a partner in mad folly; him nor fear nor shame held back. And\n        there in the depths of Acherontis [i.e. the underworld] he seeks adultery and an unlawful bed.\"\n\nSeneca, Phaedra 147 ff :\n        \"Suppose that Theseus is indeed held fast [in the underworld], hidden away in Lethean depths, and must\n        suffer Stygia [i.e. the underworld] eternally.\"\n\nSeneca, Phaedra 222 ff :\n        \"Trust not in Dis [Haides].

Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Must I [Haides] so oft endure the profanation of Chaos by living strangers?

Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"It was believed that he [Asklepios (Asclepius)] had brought back to life many who had died. Consequently,\n        the myth goes on to say, Haides brought accusation against Asklepios, charging him before Zeus of acting to the\n        detriment of his own province, for, he said, the number of the dead was steadily diminishing, now that men were\n        being healed by Asklepios. So Zeus, in indignation, slew Asklepios with his thunderbolt.\"\n\nAesop, Fables 133 (from Chambry & Babrius, Fabulae Aesopeae 75) (trans. Gibbs)\n          (Greek fable C6th B.C.) :\n        \"[This fable by Aesop contains an allusion to the story of Asklepios (Asclepius) :] There was once a doctor\n        who knew nothing about medicine. One of his patients was feeling quite weak, but everyone insisted, ‘Don't\n        give up, you will get well; your illness is the sort that lasts for a while, but then you will feel\n        better.’\n        The doctor, however, marched in and declared : ‘I'm not going to play games with you or tell you lies: you\n        need to take care of all your affairs, because you are going to die; you are not going to last more than another\n        day.’\n        Having said this, the doctor did not even bother to come back again. After a while the patient recovered from\n        his illness and was venturing out of doors, although he was not yet fully steady on his feet. When the doctor\n        ran into the patient, he greeted him, and asked how all the people down in Haides were doing. The patient said,\n        ‘They are taking it easy, drinking the water of Lethe. But Persephone and the mighty god Plouton (Pluton)\n        [Haides] were just now threatening terrible things against all the doctors, since they keep the sick people from\n        dying. Every single doctor was denounced, and they were ready to put you at the top of the list. This scared me,\n        so I immediately stepped forward and grasped their royal sceptres as I solemnly swore that this was simply a\n        ridiculous accusation, since you are not really a doctor at all.’ \"\n\nFor MORE information on the medicine-god see ASKLEPIOS\n\nHaides and Persephone inflicted Thebes with a deadly plague, probably as punishment for King Kreon's (Creon's)\n        refusal to allow the burial of the dead warriors of the army of the Seven Against Thebes. When the maiden\n        Koronides (Coronides) sacrificed themselves to appease the gods, they were pitied and transformed into a pair of\n        comets.\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 25 (trans. Celoria) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"When plague seized Aonia [Boeotia] and many died, there were sent officers to consult Apollon's oracle at\n        Gortyne. The god replied that they should make an appeal to the two gods of the underworld [Haides and\n        Persephone]. He said that they would cease from their anger if two willing maidens were sacrificed to the\n        two.\n        Of course not one of the maidens in the city complied with the oracle until a servant-woman reported the answer\n        to the daughters of Orion [the two Koronides (Coronides)]. They were at work at their loom and, as soon as they\n        heard about this, they willingly accepted death on behalf of their fellow citizens before the plague epidemic\n        had smitten them too. They cried out three times to the gods of the underworld saying that they were willing\n        sacrifices. They thrust their bodkins into themselves at their shoulders and gashed open their throats.\n        And they both fell down into the earth. Persephone and Hades took pity on the maidens and made their bodies\n        disappear, sending them instead up out of the earth as heavenly bodies. When they appeared, they were borne up\n        into the sky. And men called them comets.\"\n\nFor MORE information on these maidens see THE\n          KORONIDES\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Argonautica Orphica 1192, et. al.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
