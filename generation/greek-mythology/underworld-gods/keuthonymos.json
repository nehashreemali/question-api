  "content": "KEUTHONYMOS (Ceuthonymus) was a mysterious god or spirit (daimon) of the underworld.\n\nHis name means either \"Named in the Depths\" or \"Hidden Name\" from the Greek words\n        keuthos \"depths\" or \"hidden\" and nymos \"name\". Homer uses the\n        word keuthos in the Iliad to describe the realm of Haides--hypo keuthesi gaiês,\n        \"lying in the depths of the earth\"--and by Hesiod in the Theogony for the subterranean home\n        of the monster Ekhidna.\n\nKeuthonymos, father of Menoites, was perhaps the same as Iapetos,\n        father of Menoitios. Iapetos was a Titan of the Tartarean pit and his son Menoites a Titan blasted into Erebos\n        by Zeus.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 125 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The keeper of Haides' cattle Menoites (Menoetes), son of Keuthonymos (Ceuthonymus).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
