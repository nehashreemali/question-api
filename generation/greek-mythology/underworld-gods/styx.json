  "content": "STYX was the goddess of the underworld River Styx and the eldest of the Okeanides (Oceanids). She was also the spirit (daimon) personification of hatred (stygos). Styx\n        was a firm ally of Zeus in the Titan Wars, who brought her children Nike (Victory), Zelos (Rivalry), Bia (Force)\n        and Kratos (Cratus, Strength) to stand beside the god in battle. Zeus rewarded her by making her stream the\n        agent of oaths which bound the gods.\n\nThe River Styx was also a corrosive Arkadian (Arcadian) stream which allegedly flowed forth from the\n        underworld.\n\nStyx was sometimes identified with several other chthonian goddesses, including Demeter Erinys the wrathful earth, the oath-protecting Eumenides, and Nyx the darkness of night.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Theogony 361, 385; Apollodorus 1.8, Callimachus Hymn to Zeus)\n        [1.2] OKEANOS (Homeric Hymn 2.415,\n          Epimdenides Frag)\n        [2.1] EREBOS & NYX (Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] NIKE, KRATOS, ZELOS, BIA (by Pallas) (Theogony 384; Apollodorus\n          1.9)\n        [1.2] NIKE, KRATOS, ZELOS, BIA, SKYLLA, FOUNTAINS, LAKES (by Pallas)\n        (Hyginus Preface)\n        [2.1] PERSEPHONE (by Zeus) (Apollodorus 1.13)\n        [3.1] EKHIDNA (by Peiras) (Epimenides\n          Frag; Pausanias 8.18.2)\n\nSTYX (Stux), connected with the verb stugeô, to hate or abhor, is the name of the principal\n        river in the nether world, around which it flows seven times. (Hom. Il. ii. 755, viii. 369. xiv. 271;\n        Virg. Georg. iv. 480, Aen. vi. 439.) Styx is described as a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys\n        (Hes. Theog. 361 ; Apollod. i. 2. § 2; Callim. Hymn. in Jov. 36), and as a nymph she\n        dwelt at the entrance of Hades, in a lofty grotto which was supported by silver columns. (Hes. Theog.\n          778.) As a river Styx is described as a branch of Oceanus, flowing from its tenth source (789), and the\n        river Cocytus again is a branch of the Styx. (Hom. Od. x. 511.) By Pallas Styx became the mother of\n        Zelus (zeal), Nice (victory), Bia (strength), and Cratos (power). She was the first of all the immortals that\n        took her children to Zeus, to assist him against the Titans; and, in return for this, her children were allowed\n        for ever to live with Zeus, and Styx herself became the divinity by whom the most solemn oaths were sworn. (Hes.\n        Theog. 383 ; Hom. Od. v. 185, xv. 37; Apollod. i. 2. § 5; Apollon. Rhod. ii. 191; Virg.\n        Aen. vi. 324, xii. 816; Ov. Met. iii. 290; Sil. Ital. xiii. 568.) When one of the gods was to\n        take an oath by Styx, Iris fetched a cup full of water from the Styx, and the god, while taking the oath, poured\n        out the water. (Hes. Theog 775.) Zeus became by her the father of Persephone (Apollod. i. 3. § 1),\n        and Peiras the father of Echidna.

For this was the will\n        of Styx, the Okeanis (Oceanid), never-perishing, on the day when Olympios [Zeus] . . . summoned all the immortal\n        gods to tall Olympos and said that any god who fought on his side with the Titanes should never be beated out of\n        his privilege, but each should maintain the position he had had before among the immortals, he said, too, that\n        the god who under Kronos (Cronus) had gone without position or privilege should under him be raised to these,\n        according to justice. And Styx the imperishable was first to come to Olympos bringing her children, as her own\n        father [Okeanos] had advised her.

But no I shall try you out in earnest, to see if you are indeed endowed\n        with brave spirit and unique circumspection. Do you see that lofty mountain-peak, perched above a dizzily high\n        cliff, from where the livid waters of a dark spring come tumbling down, and when enclosed in the basin of he\n        neighbouring valley, water the marshes of the Styx and feed the hoarse streams of the Cocytus? I want you to\n        hurry and bring me back in this small jug some icy water drawn from the stream's highest point, where it gushes\n        out from within.’\n        Handing Psyche a vessel shaped from crystal, she backed this instruction with still harsher threats.\n        Psyche made for the topmost peak with swift and eager step, for she was determined there at least to put an end\n        to her intolerable existence. But the moment she neared the vicinity of the specified mountain-range, she became\n        aware of the lethal difficulty posed by her daunting task. A rock of huge size towered above her, hard to\n        negotiate and treacherous because of its rugged surface. From its stony jaws it belched forth repulsive waters\n        which issued directly from a vertical cleft [this Arkadian stream of Styx was similarly described by the Greek\n        geographer Pausanias]. The stream glided downward, and being concealed in the course of the narrow channel which\n        it had carved out, it made its hidden way into a neighbouring valley. From the hollow rocks on the right and\n        left fierce snakes crept out, extending their long necks, their eyes unblinkingly watchful and maintaining\n        unceasing vigil. The waters themselves formed an additional defence, for they had the power of speech, and from\n        time to time would cry out ‘Clear off!’ or ‘Watch what you're doing!’, or ‘What's\n        your game? Lookout!’, or ‘Cut and run!’, or ‘You won't make it!’ The hopelessness\n        of the situation turned Psyche to stone. She was physically present, but her senses deserted her. She was\n        utterly downcast by the weight of inescapable danger; she could not even summon the ultimate consolation of\n        tears.\n        But the privations of this innocent soul did not escape the steady gaze of benevolent Providentia (Providence).\n        Suddenly highest Jupiter's [Zeus'] royal bird appeared with both wings outstretched . . . before the girl's\n        gaze, and broke into speech : ‘You are in all respects an ingenuous soul without experience in things such\n        as this, so how can you hope to be able to steal the merest drop from this most sacred and unfriendly stream, or\n        even apply your hand to it? Rumour at any rate, as you know, has it that these Stygian waters are an object of\n        fear to the gods and to Jupiter [Zeus] himself, that just as you mortals swear by the gods' divine power, so\n        those gods frequently swear by the majesty of the Styx. So here, hand me that jug of yours.’ At once he\n        grabbed it, and hastened to fill it with water. Balancing the weight of his drooping wings, he used them as oars\n        on right and left to steer a course between the serpents' jaws with their menacing teeth and the triple-forked\n        darting of their tongues. He gathered some water in the face of its reluctance and its warning to him to depart\n        before he suffered harm; he falsely claimed the Venus had ordered him to collect it, and that he was acting in\n        her service, which made it a little easier for him to approach.\n        So Psyche joyously took the filled jug and hastened to return it to Venus.\"\n\nLike the Arkadian stream of Styx, the Thessalian river Titaressos (Titaressus) was said to be broken from the\n        waters of the netherworld river.\n\nHomer, Iliad 2. 751 ff (trans.
