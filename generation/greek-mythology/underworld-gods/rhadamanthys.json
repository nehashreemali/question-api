They\n        were originally mortal men, sons of the god Zeus, who were granted their station in death as a reward for\n        establishing law and order on earth.\n\nIndividually, Aiakos was guardian of the keys of Haides and judge of the men of Europe, Rhadamanthys the lord\n        of Elysion (Elysium) and judge of the men of Asia, and Minos the judge of the third and final vote. According to\n        some Triptolemos was a fourth judge who presided over the\n        souls of Initiates of the Mysteries.\n\nThe name Aiakos was derived from the Greek words aiaktos and aiazô, \"wailing\"\n        and \"lamentation.\" The etymology of the other names is obscure.\n\nThe mortal lives of the three judges is not detailed on this page only their role in the afterlife.\n\nZEUS & AIGINA (Hesiod Catalogues Frag 53, Pindar Isthmian 8, Pindar Nemean 7, Corinna Frag 654,\n          Bacchylides Frag 9, Apollodorus 3.156, Pausanias 2.29.2, Diodorus Siculus 4.72.1, Antoninus Liberalis 38,\n          Hyginus Fabulae 52, Ovid Metamorphoses 13.25, Nonnus Dionysiaca 13.201)\n\nZEUS & EUROPA (Hesiod Catalogues Frag\n          19, Aeschylus Frag 50 & various other sources)\n\nRHADAMANTHUS (Rhadamanthos), a son of Zeus and Europa, and brother of king Minos of Crete (Hom. Il.\n        xiv. 322), or, according to others, a son of Hephaestus (Paus. viii. 53. § 2). From fear of his brother he\n        fled to Ocaleia in Boeotia, and there married Alcmene. In consequence of his justice throughout life, he became,\n        after his death, one of the judges in the lower world, and took up his abode in Elysium. (Apollod. iii. 1.\n        § 2, ii. 4. § 11; Hom. Od. iv. 564, vii. 323; Pind. Ol. ii. 137.)\n\nAE′ACUS (Aiakos), a son of Zeus and Aegina, a daughter of the river-god Asopus. He was born in the island\n        of Oenone or Oenopia, whither Aegina had been carried by Zeus to secure her from the anger of her parents, and\n        whence this island was afterwards called Aegina. (Apollod. iii. 12. § 6; Hygin. Fab. 52; Paus. ii.\n        29. § 2; comp. Nonn. Dionys. vi. 212; Ov. Met. vi. 113, vii. 472, &c.). After his death Aeacus\n        became one of the three judges in Hades (Ov. Met. xiii. 25; Hor. Carm. ii. 13. 22), and\n        according to Plato (Gorg. p. 523; compare Apolog. p. 41; Isocrat. Evag. 5) especially\n        for the shades of Europeans. In works of art he was represented bearing a sceptre and the keys of Hades.\n        (Apollod. iii. 12. § 6; Pind.

There he sat, and around him the others sat or stood in the\n        ample-gated house of Haides, seeking from this master of justice the firm sentences of the law.’\"\n\nPindar, Olympian Ode 2. 55 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"When they [men] die hearts that were void of mercy pay the due penalty, and of this world's sins a judge\n        below the earth holds trial, and of dread necessity declares the word of doom. But the good, through the nights\n        alike, and through the days unending, beneath the sun's bright ray, tax no the soil with the strength of their\n        hands, nor the broad sea for a poor living, but enjoy a life that knows no toil; with men honoured of heaven,\n        who kept their sworn word gladly, spending an age free from all tears. But the unjust endure pain that no eye\n        can bear to see. But those who had good courage, three times on either side of death, to keep their hearts\n        untarnished of all wrong, these travel along the road of Zeus to Kronos' (Cronus') tower. There round the\n        Islands of the Blest, the winds of Okeanos (Oceanus) play, and golden blossoms burn, some nursed upon the\n        waters, others on land on glorious trees; and woven on their hands are wreaths enchained and flowering crowns,\n        under the just decrees of Rhadamanthys, who has his seat at the right hand of the great father [Kronos\n        (Cronus)], Rhea's husband, goddess who holds the throne highest of all.\"\n\nPlato, Gorgias 523a and 524b ff (trans. Lamb) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Now in the time of Kronos (Cronus) there was a law concerning mankind, and it holds to this very day\n        amongst the gods, that every man who has passed a just and holy life departs after his decease to the Isles of\n        the Blest (Nesoi Makaron), and dwells in all happiness apart from ill; but whoever has lived unjustly\n        and impiously goes to the dungeon of requital and penance which, you know, they call Tartaros. Of these men\n        there were judges in Kronos' (Cronus') time, and still of late in the reign of Zeus--living men to judge the\n        living upon the day when each was to breathe his last; and thus the cases were being decided amiss. So Plouton\n        (Pluton) [Haides] and the overseers from the Isles of the Blest came before Zeus with the report that they found\n        men passing over to either abode undeserving. Then spake Zeus : ‘Nay,’ said he, ‘I will put a\n        stop to these proceedings. The cases are now indeed judged ill and it is because they who are on trial are tried\n        in their clothing, for they are tried alive. Now many,’ said he, ‘who have wicked souls are clad in\n        fair bodies and ancestry and wealth, and at their judgement appear many witnesses to testify that their lives\n        have been just. Now, the judges are confounded not only by their evidence but at the same time by being clothed\n        themselves while they sit in judgement, having their own soul muffled in the veil of eyes and ears and the whole\n        body. Thus all these are a hindrance to them, their own habiliments no less than those of the judged. Well,\n        first of all,’ he said, ‘we must put a stop to their foreknowledge of their death; for this they at\n        present foreknow. However, Prometheus has already been given the word to stop this in them. Next they must be\n        stripped bare of all those things before they are tried; for they must stand their trial dead. Their judge also\n        must be naked, dead, beholding with very soul the very soul of each immediately upon his death, bereft of all\n        his kin and having left behind on earth all that fine array, to the end that the judgement may be just. Now I,\n        knowing all this before you, have appointed sons of my own to be judges; two from Asia, Minos and Rhadamanthys,\n        and one from Europe, Aiakos (Aeacus). These, when their life is ended, shall give judgement in the meadow at the\n        dividing of the road, whence are the two ways leading, one to the Isles of the Blest (Nesoi Makaron),\n        and the other to Tartaros. And those who come from Asia shall Rhadamanthys try, and those from Europe, Aiakos;\n        and to Minos I will give the privilege of the final decision, if the other two be in any doubt; that the\n        judgement upon this journey of mankind may be supremely just . . .’\n        When a man's soul is stripped bare of the body, all its natural gifts, and the experiences added to that soul as\n        the result of his various pursuits, are manifest in it. So when they have arrived in presence of their judge,\n        they of Asia before Rhadamanthys, these Rhadamanthys sets before him and surveys the soul of each, not knowing\n        whose it is; nay, often when he has laid hold of the Great King or some other prince or potentate, he perceives\n        the utter unhealthiness of his soul, striped all over with the scourge, and a mass of wounds, the work of\n        perjuries and injustice; where every act has left its smirch upon his soul, where all is awry through falsehood\n        and imposture, and nothing straight because of a nurture that knew not truth : or, as the result of an unbridled\n        course of fastidiousness, insolence, and incontinence, he finds the soul full fraught with disproportion and\n        ugliness. Beholding this he sends it away in dishonor straight to the place of custody, where on its arrival it\n        is to endure the sufferings that are fitting. And it is fitting that every one under punishment rightly\n        inflicted on him by another should either be made better and profit thereby, or serve as an example to the rest,\n        that others seeing the sufferings he endures may in fear amend themselves. Those who are benefited by the\n        punishment they get from gods and men are they who have committed remediable offences; but still it is through\n        bitter throes of pain that they receive their benefit both here and in Haides (the Netherworld); for in no other\n        way can there be riddance of iniquity. But of those who have done extreme wrong and, as a result of such crimes,\n        have become incurable, of those are the examples made; no longer are they profited at all themselves, since they\n        are incurable, but others are profited who behold them undergoing for their transgressions the greatest,\n        sharpest, and most fearful sufferings evermore, actually hung up as examples there in the infernal dungeon, a\n        spectacle and a lesson to such of the wrongdoers as arrive from time to time . . . \n        So, as I was saying, whenever the judge Rhadamanthys has to deal with such a one, he knows nothing else of him\n        at all, neither who he is nor of what descent, but only that he is a wicked person and on perceiving this he\n        sends him away to Tartaros, first setting a mark on him to show whether he deems it a curable or an incurable\n        case; and when the man arrives there he suffers what is fitting. Sometimes, when he discerns another soul that\n        has lived a holy life in company with truth, a private man's or any others . . . he is struck with admiration\n        and sends it off to the Isles of the Blest (Nesoi Makaron). And exactly the same is the procedure of\n        Aiakos (Aeacus) : each of these two holds a rod in his hand as he gives judgement; but Minos sits as supervisor,\n        distinguished by the golden scepter that he holds, as Odysseus in Homer tells how he saw him--‘Holding a\n        golden scepter, speaking dooms to the dead.’\n        Now for my part, Kallikles (Callicles), I am convinced by these accounts, and I consider how I may be able to\n        show my judge that my soul is in the best of health . . . When you go before your judge, [Aiakos] the son of\n        Aigina (Aegina), and he grips you and drags you up, you will gape and feel dizzy there no less than I do here,\n        and some one perhaps will give you, yes, a degrading box on the ear, and will treat you with every kind of\n        contumely. Possibly, however, you regard this as an old wife's tale, and despise it.\"\n\nPlato, Phaedo 107c ff :\n        \"It is said that after death, the tutelary genius (daimon) of each person, to whom he had been\n        allotted in life, leads him to a place where the dead are gathered together [i.e. the Daimon guide is\n        Plato's equivalent of Hermes guide of the dead]; then they are judged [i.e. by the Judges of the Dead] and\n        depart to the other world with the guide whose task it is to conduct thither those who come from this world; and\n        when they have there received their due and remained through the time appointed, another guide brings them back\n        after many long periods of time [i.e. they are reincarnated into another body]. And the journey is not as\n        Telephos says in the play of Aiskhylos (Aeschylus); for he says a simple path leads to Haides (the Lower World),\n        but I think the path is neither simple nor single, for if it were, there would be no need of guides, since no\n        one could miss the way to any place if there were only one road. But really there seem to be many forks of the\n        road and many windings; this I infer from the rites and ceremonies practiced here on earth [i.e. the Mystery\n        cults]. Now the orderly and wise soul follows its guide and understands its circumstances; but the soul that is\n        desirous of the body, as I said before, flits about it, and in the visible world for a long time [i.e. as a\n        haunting ghost], and after much resistance and many sufferings is led away with violence and with difficulty by\n        its appointed genius (daimon). And when it arrives at the place where the other souls are, the soul\n        which is impure and has done wrong, by committing wicked murders or other deeds akin to those and the works of\n        kindred souls, is avoided and shunned by all, and no one is willing to be its companion or its guide, but it\n        wanders about alone in utter bewilderment, during certain fixed times, after which it is carried by necessity to\n        its fitting habitation [i.e. gloomy Haides]. But the soul that has passed through life in purity and\n        righteousness, finds gods for companions and guides, and goes to dwell in its proper dwelling [i.e.\n        Elysium].\"\n\nPlato, Phaedo 112e ff (trans. Fowler) : \n        \"Now when the dead have come to the place where each is led by his genius (daimon) [i.e. by\n        Plato's equivalent of Hermes guide of the dead], first they are judged and sentenced [i.e. by the Judges of the\n        Dead], as they have lived well and piously, or not. And those who are found to have lived neither well nor ill,\n        go to the Akheron and, embarking upon vessels provided for them [i.e. the equivalent of Kharon's (Charon's)\n        skiff], arrive in them at the lake; there they dwell and are purified [i.e. by the equivalent of the Erinyes],\n        and if they have done any wrong they are absolved by paying the penalty for their wrong doings, and for their\n        good deeds they receive rewards, each according to his merits.\n        Now when the dead have come to the place where each is led by his genius (daimon), first they are\n        judged and sentenced [i.e. by the Judges of the Dead], as they have lived well and piously, or not. And those\n        who are found to have lived neither well nor ill, go to the Akheron (Acheron) and, embarking upon vessels\n        provided for them [i.e. the equivalent of Kharon's skiff], arrive in them at the lake; there they dwell and are\n        purified [i.e. by the equivalent of the Erinyes], and if they have done any wrong they are absolved by paying\n        the penalty for their wrong doings [i.e. in Haides], and for their good deeds they receive rewards [i.e. Elysion\n        (Elysium)], each according to his merits. But those who appear to be incurable, on account of the greatness of\n        their wrongdoings, because they have committed many great deeds of sacrilege, or wicked and abominable murders,\n        or any other such crimes, are cast by their fitting destiny into Tartaros, whence they never emerge. Those,\n        however, who are curable, but are found to have committed great sin--who have, for example, in a moment of\n        passion done some act of violence against father or mother and have lived in repentance the rest of their lives,\n        or who have slain some other person under similar conditions--these must needs be thrown into Tartaros, and when\n        they have been there a year the wave casts them out, the homicides by way of Kokytos (Cocytus), those who have\n        outraged their parents by way of Pyriphlegethon. And when they have been brought by the current to the\n        Akherousian (Acherusian) Lake, they shout and cry out, calling to those whom they have slain or outraged,\n        begging and beseeching them to be gracious and to let them come out into the lake; and if they prevail they come\n        out and cease from their ills, but if not, they are borne away again to Tartaros and thence back into the\n        rivers, and this goes on until they prevail upon those whom they have wronged; for this is the penalty imposed\n        upon them by the judges.\n        But those who are found to have excelled in holy living are freed from these regions within the earth and are\n        released as from prisons; they mount upward into their pure abode and dwell upon the earth [i.e. the Islands of\n        the Blessed, the higher Elysium]. And of these, all who have duly purified themselves by philosophy live\n        henceforth altogether without bodies, and pass to still more beautiful abodes which it is not easy to describe,\n        nor have we now time enough.\"\n\nPlato, Minos 318d (trans. Lamb) :\n        \"Sokrates (Socrates) : Then do you know who were their good kings? Minos and Rhadamanthys, the sons of Zeus\n        and Europa; those laws were theirs.\n        Companion : Rhadamanthys, they do say, Sokrates, was a just man; but Minos was a savage sort of person, harsh\n        and unjust . . . And in the Ghost-Raising in the Odyssey he has described Minos as judging with a\n        golden scepter in his hand, but not Rhadamanthys: Rhadamanthys he has neither described here as judging nor\n        anywhere as consorting with Zeus; wherefore I say that Minos above all persons has been eulogized by Homer. For\n        to have been the son of Zeus, and to have been the only one who was educated by Zeus, is praise unsurpassable .\n        . .\n        Rhadamanthys was a good man indeed, for he had been educated by Minos; he had, however, been educated, not in\n        the whole of the kingly art, but in one subsidiary to the kingly, enough for presiding in law courts; so that he\n        was spoken of as a good judge.\"\n\nPlato, Apology 41a (trans. Fowler) : \n        \"Sokrates (Socrates) : For if a man when he reaches the other world, after leaving behind these who claim\n        to be judges, shall find those who are really judges who are said to sit in judgment there, Minos and\n        Rhadamanthys, and Aiakos (Aeacus) and Triptolemos, and all the other demigods who were just men in their lives,\n        would the change of habitation be undesirable?\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 6 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Rhadamanthys was a lawmaker for the islanders, but thereafter fled to Boiotia and married Alkmene\n        (Alcmena); since crossing over he is a judge along with Minos in Haides realm.\"\n\nPlutarch, Life of Theseus 16. 1 (trans.

And yet they say that Minos was a king and lawgiver, and that Rhadamanthys was a\n        judge under him, and a guardian of the principles of justice defined by him.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 79. 2 (trans.

In\n        yonder court they pass to Cretan Minos' presence, in that to Rhadamanthus', here [Aiakos (Aeacus)] the father of\n        Thetis' spouse gives audience. What each has done, he suffers; upon its author the crime comes back, and the\n        guilty soul is crushed by its own form of guilt. I have seen bloody chiefs immured in prison; the insolent\n        tyrant's back torn by plebeian hands. He who reigns mildly and, though lord of life, keeps guiltless hands, who\n        mercifully and without bloodshed rules his realm, checking his own spirit, he shall traverse long stretches of\n        happy life and at last gain the skies, or else in bliss reach Elysium's joyful land and sit in judgment there.\n        Abstain from human blood, all ye who rule : with heavier punishment your sins are judged.\"\n\nSeneca, Troades 344 ff :\n        \"Achilles who by right of lineage extends throughout the realm of the immortals and claims the universe:\n        the sea through Thetis, through Aeacus [his grandfather] the shades [i.e. as a judge of the dead], the heavens\n        through Jove [Zeus his great-grandfather].\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 8. 21 ff (trans.

Hard by, Minos with his dread brother\n        [Rhadamanthys] in kindly mood counsels a milder justice, and restrains the bloodthirsty king [Haides]; [the\n        River-Gods] Cocytus and Phelgethon, swollen with tears and fire, aid in the judgement, and Styx accuses the gods\n        of perjury.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 8. 70 : \n        \"The urn of the Dictean judge [Minos] doth know it, and Minos can discern the truth.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 11. 570 ff : \n        \"This way with me to the Manes (Shades)!

I wonder how the natives here are wont to\n        knock at doors.\n        Xanthias : No dawdling: taste the door. You've got, remember, the lion-hide and pride of Herackes.\n        Dionysos (knocking) : Boy! boy!\n        (The door opens. Aiakos [one of the judges of the dead] appears.)\n        Aiakos (Aeacus) : Who's there?\n        Dionysos : I, Herakles the strong! [Dionysos is disguised as Herakles.]\n        Aiakos : O, you most shameless desperate ruffian, you O, villain, villain, arrant vilest villain! Who seized our\n        Kerberos (Cerberus) by the throat, and fled, and ran, and rushed, and bolted, haling of the dog, my charge! But\n        now I've got thee fast. So close the Styx's inky-hearted rock, the blood-bedabbled peak of Akheron (Acheron)\n        shall hem thee in: the hell-hounds of Kokytos (Cocytus) prowl round thee; whilst Ekhidna (Echidna) with her\n        hundred-heads shall rive thy heart-strings: the Tartesian Lamprey prey on thy lungs: and those Tithrasian\n        Gorgones mangle and tear thy kidneys, mauling them, entrails and all, into one bloody mash.

Now then, put down the traps, and mind you speak the truth,\n        young fellow.\n        Dionysos (in agony) : Man' don't torture me! I am a god. You'll blame yourself hereafter if you touch me.\n        Aiakos : Hillo!

All the more reason you should flog him well. For if he is a god, he won't perceive\n        it.\n        Dionysos : Well, but you say that you're a god yourself. So why not you be flogged as well as I?\n        Xanthias : A fair proposal. And be this the test, whichever of us two you first behold flinching or crying\n        out-he's not the god.\n        Aiakos : Upon my word you're quite the gentleman, you're all for right and justice. Strip then, both.\n        Xanthias : How can you test us fairly?\n        Aiakos : Easily. I'll give you blow for blow.\n        [Aiakos whips them both, but is still unsure which is the god] . . . \n        Aiakos : No, by Demeter, still I can't find out which is the god, but come ye both indoors; my lord himself\n        [Haides] and Persephassa (Persephone) there, being gods themselves, will soon find out the truth.\n        Dionysos : Right! right! I only wish you had thought of that before you gave me those tremendous whacks.\n        (Exeunt Dionysos, Xanthias, Aiakos, and Attendants)\n        . . . (Enter Aiakos, Xanthias and two Attendants) . . . \n        Xanthias : Phoibos Apollon! clap your hand in mine, kiss and be kissed: and prithee tell me this, tell me by\n        Zeus, our rascaldom's own god, what's all that noise within [the house of Haides]? What means this hubbub and\n        row?\n        Aiakos : That's [the ghosts of the tragic poets] Aiskhylos (Aeschylus) and Euripides.\n        Xanthias : Eh?\n        Aiakos : Wonderful, wonderful things are going on. The dead are rioting, taking different sides.\n        Xanthias : Why, what's the matter?\n        Aiakos : There's a custom here with all the crafts, the good and noble crafts, that the chief master of art in\n        each shall have his dinner in the assembly hall, and sit by Plouton's [Haide's] side.\n        Xanthias : I understand.\n        Aiakos : Until another comes, more wise than he in the same art: then must the first give way.\n        Xanthias : And how has this disturbed our Aiskhylos (Aeschylus)?\n        Aiakos : 'Twas he that occupied the tragic chair, as, in his craft, the noblest.\n        Xanthias : Who does now?\n        Aiakos : But when Euripides came down, he kept flourishing off before the highwaymen, thieves, burglars,\n        parricides-these form our mob in Hades-till with listening to his twists and turns, and pleas and counterpleas,\n        they went mad on the man, and hailed him first and wisest: elate with this, he claimed the tragic chair where\n        Aiskhylos was seated.\n        Xanthias : Wasn't he pelted?\n        Aiakos : Not he: the populace clamoured out to try which of the twain was wiser in his art . . . \n        Xanthias : And what does Plouton (Pluton) [Haides] now propose to do?\n        Aiakos : He means to hold a tournament, and bring their tragedies to the proof.\n        Xanthias : But Sophokles, how came not he to claim the tragic chair?\n        Aiakos : Claim it? Not he! When he came down, he kissed with reverence Aiskhylos, and clasped his hand, and\n        yielded willingly the chair to him. But now he's going, says Kleidemides, to sit third-man: and then if\n        Aiskhylos win, he'll stay content: if not, for his art's sake, he'll fight to the death against Euripides . . .\n        \n        (Here apparently there is a complete change of scene, to the Hall of Plouton, with himself sitting on his\n        throne, [ready to judge the competition] and Dionysos, Aiskhylos, and the foreground.).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
