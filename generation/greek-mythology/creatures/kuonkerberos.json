  "content": "KERBEROS (Cerberus) was the gigantic, three-headed hound of Haides which\n        guarded the gates of the underworld and prevented the escape of the shades of the dead.\n\nKerberos was depicted as a three-headed dog with a serpent's tail, mane of snakes, and a lion's claws.\n        According to some he had fifty heads although this count may have included the serpents of his mane.\n\nHerakles (Heracles) was sent to fetch Kerberos as one of his twelve labours, a task which he accomplished with\n        the aid of the goddess Persephone.\n\nKerberos' name perhaps means \"Death-Daemon of the Dark\" from the ancient Greek words\n        kêr and erebos.\n\n[1.1] TYPHOEUS & EKHIDNA (Hesiod Theogony 310, Quintus Smyrnaeus 6.260, Hyginus Pref & Fab 30)\n        [1.2] EKHIDNA (Bacchylides Frag 5, Ovid\n          Metamorphoses 7.412)\n\nCE′RBERUS (Kerberos), the many-headed dog that guarded the entrance of Hades, is mentioned as early as\n        the Homeric poems, but simply as \"the dog,\" and without the name of Cerberus. (Il. viii. 368,\n        Od. xi. 623.) Hesiod, who is the first that gives his name and origin, calls him (Theog. 311)\n        fifty-headed and a son of Typhaon and Echidna. Later writers describe him as a monster with only three heads,\n        with the tail of a serpent and a mane consisting of the heads of various snakes. (Apollod. ii. 5. § 12;\n        Eurip. Here. fur. 24, 611; Virg. Aen. vi. 417; Ov. Met. iv. 449.) Some poets again\n        call him many-headed or hundred-headed. (Horat. Carm. ii. 13. 34; Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 678;\n        Senec. Here. fur. 784.) The place where Cerberus kept watch was according to some at the mouth of the\n        Acheron, and according to others at the gates of Hades, into which he admitted the shades, but never let them\n        out again.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Iliad 8. 366 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"If in the wiliness of my heart I [Athene] had had thoughts like his, when Herakles (Heracles) was sent\n        down to Haides of the Gates, to hale back from Erebos (the Dark) the hound of the grisly death god (Haides\n          Stygeros), never would he have got clear of the steep-dripping water Styx.\"\n        [N.B.

He found Kerberos at the gates of\n        Akheron (Acheron), and there, pressed inside his armour and totally covered by the lion's skin, he threw his\n        arms round its head and hung on, despite bites from the serpent-tail, until he convinced the beast with his\n        choke-hold. Then, with it in tow, he made his ascent through Troizenos (Troezen). After showing Kerberos to\n        Eurystheus, he took it back to Haides' realm.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 122 :\n        \"As a twelfth labour Herakles was to fetch Kerberos (Cerberus) from Haides' realm.

Still, he came alive to Tiryns out of Haides, the last of twelve\n        labours, for the pleasure of malignant Eurystheus; and at the crossways of Mideia, rich in barley, trembling\n        women with their children looked upon him.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 6. 260 ff (trans.

Late poets gave the name Kerberos,\n        and though in other respects they made him resemble a dog, they say that he had three heads.

When [Herakles] the son of Jove stood closer, within his\n        cave the dog crouches hesitant and feels a touch of fear. Then suddenly, with deep bayings, he terrifies the\n        silent places; the snakes hiss threateningly along all his shoulders. The clamour of his dreadful voice, issuing\n        from triple throats, fills even the blessed shades with dread. Then from his left arm the hero looses the\n        fierce-grinning jaws, thrusts out before him the Cleonaean head and, beneath that huge shield crouching, plies\n        his mighty club with victorious right hand. Now here, now there, with unremitting blows he whirls it, redoubling\n        the strokes. At last the dog, vanquished ceases his threatenings and, spent with struggle, lowers all his heads\n        and yields all wardship of his cavern. Both rulers [Haides and Persephone] shiver on their throne, and bid lead\n        the dog away. Me also [Theseus trapped in Haides] they give as boon to Alcides' prayer.\n        ‘Then, stroking the monster's sullen necks, he binds him with chains of adamant. Forgetful of himself, the\n        watchful guardian of the dusky realm droops his ears, trembling and willing to be led, owns his master, and with\n        muzzle lowered follows after, beating both his sides with snaky tail. But when he came to the Taenarian borders,\n        and the strange gleam of unknown light smote on his eyes, though conquered he regained his courage and in frenzy\n        shook his ponderous chains. Almost he bore his conqueror away, back dragging him, forward bent, and forced him\n        to give ground. Then even to my aid Alcides [Herakles] looked, and with our twofold strength we drew the dog\n        along, mad with rage and attempting fruitless war, and brought him out to earth. But when he saw the bright\n        light of day and viewed the clear spaces of the shining sky, black night rose over him and he turned his gaze to\n        ground, closed tight his eyes and shut out the hated light; backward he turned his face and with all his necks\n        sought the earth; then in the shadow of Hercules he hid his head.’\"\n\nSeneca, Hercules Furens 984 ff : \n        \"Cruel Tisiphone [one of the Erinyes (Furies)] . . . since the dog [Kerberos (Cerberus)] was stolen away\n        [by Herakles] has blocked the empty gate [of Haides] with her outstretched torch.\"\n\nSeneca, Hercules Furens 1107 ff : \n        \"Fierce Cerberus, crouching in his lowest cave, his necks still bound with chains.\"\n\nSeneca, Oedipus 160 ff : \n        \"[Drought and pestilence ravage the city of Thebes :] They have burst the bars of abysmal Erebus, the\n        throng of sisters with Tartarean torch [i.e. the Erinyes, (Furies)] . . . Dark Mors (Death) [Thanatos], death\n        opens wide his greedy, gaping jaws and unfolds all his wings . . . Nay more, they say that the dog [Kerberos\n        (Cerberus)] has burst his chains of Taenarian iron, and is wandering through our fields; that the earth has\n        rumbled; that ghosts go stealing through the groves, larger than mortal forms.\"\n\nSeneca, Oedipus 559 ff : \n        \"[The Theban seer Teiresias (Tiresias) performs the rites of necromancy :] Then he summons the spirits of\n        the dead, and thee who rulest the spirits [Haides], and him [Kerberos (Cerberus)] who blocks the entrance to the\n        Lethaean stream; o'er and o'er and o'er he repeats a magic rune, and fiercely, with frenzied lips, he chants a\n        charm which either appeases or compels the flitting ghosts . . . the whole place was shaken and the ground was\n        stricken from below . . . blind Chaos is burst open, and for the tribes of Dis [Haides] a way is given to the\n        upper world . . . in mad rage three-headed Cerberus shook his heavy chains.\"\n\nSeneca, Phaedra 222 ff : \n        \"Trust not in Dis [Haides].

But you are not permitted to touch that either, for all these and many\n        other distractions are part of the ambush which Venus [Aphrodite] will set to induce you to release one of the\n        cakes from your hands. Do not imaging that the loss of a mere barley cake is a trivial matter, for if you\n        relinquish either of them, the daylight of this world above will be totally denied you. Posted there is\n        [Kerberos (Cerberus)] a massive hound with a huge, triple-formed head. This monstrous, fearsome brute confronts\n        the dead with thunderous barking, though his menaces are futile since he can do them no harm. He keeps constant\n        guard before the very threshold and the dark hall of Proserpina [Persephone], protecting that deserted abode of\n        Dis [Haides]. You must disarm him by offering him a cake as his spoils. Then you can easily pass him, and gain\n        immediate access to Proserpina herself . . . When you have obtained what she gives you, you must make your way\n        back, using the remaining cake to neutralize the dog's savagery.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Euripides Heracles 25 & 611.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
