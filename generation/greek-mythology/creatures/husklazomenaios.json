  "content": "THE HUS KLAZOMENAIOS (Clazomenean Sow) was a giant winged boar which terrorized the Greek town of Klazomenai\n        (Clazomenae) in Ionia, Asia Minor.\n\nAelian, On Animals 12. 38 (trans. Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"I have heard that on Klazomenai (Clazomenae) [an island west of Smyrna] there was a sow with wings, and it\n        ravaged the territory of Klazomenai. And Artemon records this in his Annals of Klazomenai. That is why\n        there is a spot named and celebrated as ‘The Place of the Winged Sow,’ and it is famous. But if\n        anyone regards this as myth, let him do so.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
