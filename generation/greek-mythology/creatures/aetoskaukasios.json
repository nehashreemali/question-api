Prometheus was put in chains, and fastened to a pillar, where an eagle sent by Zeus consumed\n        in the daytime his liver, which, in every succeeding night, was restored again. Prometheus was thus exposed to\n        perpetual torture, but Heracles killed the eagle and delivered the sufferer, with the consent of Zeus, who thus\n        had an opportunity of allowing his son to gain immortal fame (Hes. Theog. 521, &c., Op. et\n          Dies, 47, &c. ; Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 15; Apollod. ii. 5. § 11).\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 507 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Ready-witted Prometheus he [Zeus] bound with inextricable bonds, cruel chains, and drove a shaft through\n        his middle, and set on him a long-winged eagle, which used to eat his immortal liver; but by night the liver\n        grew as much again everyway as the long-winged bird devoured in the whole day. That bird Herakles (Heracles),\n        the valiant son of shapely-ankled Alkmene (Alcmena), slew; and delivered the son of Iapetos from the cruel\n        plague, and released him from his affliction--not without the will of Olympian Zeus who reigns on high, that the\n        glory of Herakles the Theban-born might be yet greater than it was before over the plenteous earth.\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 115 ff (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[Prometheus speaks after being chained to a crag in the Kaukasos (Caucasus) mountains :] ‘Ha!\n        Behold! What murmur, what scent wings to me, its source invisible, heavenly or human, or both? . . . Ha! What's\n        this? What may be this rustling stir of birds I hear again nearby? The air whirs with the light rush of wings.\n        Whatever approaches causes me alarm [i.e. he thinks it is the sound of the Eagle which will be sent to feed on\n        his liver].’\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 1021 ff : \n        \"[Hermes addresses Prometheus after his chaining :] ‘The winged hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle,\n        coming an unbidden banqueter the whole day long, with savage appetite shall tear your body piecemeal into great\n        rents and feast his fill upon your liver until it is black with gnawing.’\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Unbound (lost play) :\n        In Aeschylus' lost play Prometheus Unbound the Titan Prometheus is freed from his bonds by\n        Herakles who slays the tormenting Eagle with an arrow.\n\nAeschylus, Fragment 107 Prometheus Unbound (from Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 2. 10.\n          23-25) (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        \"[Prometheus laments :] ‘Behold me fettered, clamped to these rough rocks . . . Thus hath\n        Zeus, the son of Kronos (Cronus), fastened me, and to the will of Zeus hath Hephaistos (Hephaestus) lent his\n        hand. With cruel art hath he riven my limbs by driving in these bolts. Ah, unhappy that I am! By his skill\n        transfixed, I tenant this stronghold of the Erinyes (Furies). And now, each third woeful day, with dreadful\n        swoop, the minister of Zeus with his hooked talons rends me asunder by his cruel repast. Then, crammed and\n        glutted to the full on my fat liver, the utters a prodigious scream and, soaring aloft, with winged tail fawns\n        upon my gore. But when my gnawed liver swells, renewed in growth, greedily doth he return anew to his fell\n        repast. Thus do I feed this guardian of my awful torture, who mutilates me living with never-ending pain. For\n        fettered, as ye see, by the bonds of Zeus, I have no power to drive from my vitals the accursed bird. Thus,\n        robbed of self-defence, I endure woes fraught with torment : longing for death, I look around for an ending of\n        my misery; but by the doom of Zeus I am thrust far from death. And this my ancient dolorous agony, intensified\n        by the dreadful centuries, is fastened upon my body, from which there fall, melted by the blazing sun, drops\n        that unceasingly pour upon the rocks of Kaukasos (Caucasus).’\"\n\nAeschylus, Fragment 113 Prometheus Unbound (from Plutarch, On Love 14. 757E) :\n        \"[Herakles prays as he takes aim with his bow against the eagle tormenting Prometheus :] ‘May\n        Hunter Apollon speed my arrow straight!’\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 45 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"He [Zeus] ordered Hephaistos (Hephaestus) to rivet the body of Prometheus to Mount Kaukasos (Caucasus), a\n        Skythian (Scythian) mountain, where he was kept fastened and bound for many years. Each day an Eagle would fly\n        to him and munch on the lobes of his liver, which would then grow back at night.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 120 :\n        \"When he [Herakles] reached the mainland on the other side he killed with an arrow the Eagle on the\n        Kaukasos (Caucasus), the product of Ekhidna (Echidna) and Typhon that had been eating the liver of\n        Prometheus.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 1238 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And now the last recess of the Black Sea opened up and they [the Argonauts] caught sight of the high crags\n        of the Kaukasos (Caucasus), where Prometheus stood chained by every limb to the hard rock with fetters of\n        bronze, and fed an Eagle on his liver. The bird kept eagerly returning to its feed. They saw it in the afternoon\n        flying high above the ship with a strident whirr. It was near the clouds, yet it made all their canvas quiver to\n        its wings as it beat by. For its form was not that of an ordinary bird : the long quill-feathers of each wing\n        rose and fell like a bank of polished oars. Soon after the Eagle had passed, they heard Prometheus shriek in\n        agony as it pecked at his liver. The air rang with his screams till at length they saw the flesh-devouring bird\n        fly back from the mountain by the same way as it came.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 844 ff : \n        \"It [a magical herb] first appeared in a plant that sprang from the blood-like ichor of Prometheus in his\n        torment, which the flesh-eating Eagle had dropped on the spurs of Kaukasos (Caucasus).\"\n\nCallimachus, Fragment 551 (trans. Trypanis) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"And him [the Eagle] who devoured the liver of the protector of mankind [Prometheus].\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 15. 2 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"And Zeus, when Prometheus had taken fire and given it to men, put him in chains and set an eagle at his\n        side which devoured his liver. But when Herakles saw him suffering such punishment because of the benefit which\n        he had conferred upon men, he killed the eagle with an arrow.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 11. 6 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \" [Amongst the objects dedicated in the temple of Zeus at Olympia :] At Olympia there are screens\n        constructed like walls which keep people out. Of these screens . . . parts show pictures by Panainos (Panaenus).\n        Among them is . . . Prometheus still held by his chains, though Herakles has been raised up to him. For among\n        the stories told about Herakles is one that he killed the eagle which tormented Prometheus in the Kaukasos\n        (Caucasus), and set free Prometheus himself from his chains.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 5. 334 ff (trans. Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Prometheus] endured all pangs he merited, when, deep-burrowing, the Eagle tare his liver aye\n        renewed!\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 6. 269 ff : \n        \"Herakles, rending Prometheos' (Prometheus') chains, and hurling them this way and that with fragments of\n        the rock whereinto they were riveted, set free the mighty Titan. Arrow-smitten lay the Eagle of the Torment\n        there beside.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 10. 190 ff : \n        \"[Amongst the scenes depicted on the quiver of Herakles :] There was the Titan Iapetos' great son\n        [Prometheus] hung from the beetling crag of Kaukasos (Caucasus) in bonds of adamant, and the Eagle tare his\n        liver unconsumed--he seemed to groan!\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 31 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"The shining Eagle which was eating out the heart of Prometheus he [Herakles] killed with his arrows.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 54 :\n        \"Hercules was sent to kill the Eagle which was eating out Prometheus' heart. When it was killed, Prometheus\n        after thirty thousand years was freed from Mount Caucasus.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 144 :\n        \"Mercurius [Hermes], at Jove's [Zeus'] command, bound him [Prometheus] with iron spikes to a cliff on Mount\n        Caucasus, and set an Eagle to eat out his heart; as much as it devoured in the day, so much grew again at night.\n        After 30,000 years Hercules killed this eagle and freed Prometheus.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 15 :\n        \"[Constellation] Arrow. This arrow, they say, is one of the weapons of Hercules, with which he is said to\n        have killed the Eagle which ate the liver of Prometheus . . .\n        Prometheus he [Zeus] bound with an iron chain to a mountain in Scythia named Caucasus for thirty thousand years,\n        as Aeschylus, writer of tragedies, says. Then, too, he sent an Eagle to him to eat out his liver which was\n        constantly renewed at night. Some have said that this eagle was born from Typhon and Echidna, other from Terra\n        (Earth) [Gaia] and Tartarus, but many point out it was made by the hands of Vulcanus [Hephaistos (Hephaestus)]\n        and given life by Jove [Zeus] . . . But to come back to the beginning of the inquiry and the death of the eagle.\n        Hercules, when sent by Eurystheus for the apples of the Hesperides, out of ignorance of the way came to\n        Prometheus, who was bound on Mount Caucasus, as we have shown above. When victor, he returned to Prometheus to\n        tell him that that Draco (Dragon) we have mentioned was slain, and to thank him for his kindness since he had\n        pointed out the way. Straightway he gave what honour he could to the one that deserved it, for he killed the\n        eagle and since it was slain, men began, when victims were sacrificed, to offer livers on the altars of the gods\n        to satisfy them in place of the liver of Prometheus.\"\n\nVirgil, Georgics 6. 41 ff (trans.
