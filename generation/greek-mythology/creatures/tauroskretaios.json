  "content": "THE TAUROS KRETAIOS (Cretan Bull) was a handsome bull sent forth from the sea by Poseidon. Queen Pasiphae of Krete lusted after the animal and coupled\n        with it by hiding inside a wooden cow crafted by the artificer Daidalos (Daedalus). She later gave birth to the\n        Minotauros (Minotaur), a man with the head of a bull.\n\nHerakles was commanded to fetch the Kretan Bull as one of his Twelve Labours. Upon completion of this task he\n        set the creature free and it eventually found its way to the Athenian town of Marathon where it laid waste to\n        the countryside. There it was finally destroyed by the hero Theseus.\n\nThe gods placed the bull among the stars as the Constellation\n        Taurus, along with the Hydra, Nemean Lion and\n        other creatures from the labours of Herakles.\n\nMINOTAUROS (by Pasiphae) (Apollodorus 3.8, Callimachus Hymn 4.311, Diodorus Siculus 4.77.1, Philostratus Elder\n          1.16, Hyginus Fab. 40, Ovid Met. 8.130, Virgil Aeneid 6.24; Seneca Phaedra 112, Suidas)\n\nCRETAN BULL. According to Acusilaus, this bull was the same as the one which had carried Europa across the sea;\n        according to others, he had been sent out of the sea by Poseidon, that Minos might sacrifice him to the god of\n        the sea. But Minos was so charmed with the beauty of the animal, that he kept it, and sacrificed another in its\n        stead. Poseidon punished Minos, by making the fine bull mad, and causing it to make great havoc in the island.\n        Heracles was ordered by Eurystheus to catch the bull, and Minos, of course, willingly allowed him to do so.\n        Heracles accomplished the task, and brought the bull home on his shoulders, but he then set the animal free\n        again. The bull now roamed about through Greece, and at last came to Marathon, where we meet it again in the\n        stories of Theseus. (Apollod. ii. 5. § 7; Paus. i. 27. § 9, v. 10. § 2; Hygin. Fab. 30;\n        Diod. iv. 13, &c.; Serv. ad Aen. viii. 294.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 26 (trans.

((lacuna)) to Eupalamos' son\n        Daidalos (Daedalus), most skilled of carpenters, she told her unspeakable sickness [i.e. lust for a bull]; she\n        made him swear a binding oath and ordered him to build a wooden cow, so that she might join her body to that of\n        the mighty bull, hiding from Minos . . ((lacuna)) the union she shared.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 8 - 11 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Asterios (Asterius) [King of Krete (Crete)] died childless. Minos aspired to the throne, but was rebuffed.\n        He claimed, however, that he had received the sovereignty from the gods, and to prove it he said that whatever\n        he prayed for would come about. So while sacrificing to Poseidon, he prayed for a bull to appear from the depths\n        of the sea, and promised to sacrifice it upon its appearance. And Poseidon did send up to him a splendid bull.\n        Thus Minos received the rule, but he sent the bull to his herds and sacrificed another. Poseidon was angry that\n        the bull was not sacrificed, and turned it wild. He also devised that Pasiphae should develop a lust for it. In\n        her passion for the bull she took on as her accomplice an architect named Daidalos (Daedalus) . . .\n        He built a woden cow on wheels, took it, hollowed it out in the inside, skinned a real cow, and sewed the\n        contraption into the skin, and then, after placing Pasiphae inside, set it in a meadow where the bull normally\n        grazed. The bull came up and had intercourse with it, as if with a real cow.\n        Pasiphae gave birth to Asterios, who was called Minotauros (Minotaur). He had the face of a bull, but was\n        otherwise human. Minos, following certain oracular instructions, kept him confined and under guard in the\n        labyrinth. This labyrinth, which Daidalos built, was a cage with convoluted flextions that disorders\n        debouchment.”\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 13. 4 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The next Labour which Herakles undertook was to bring back from Krete the bull of which, they say,\n        Pasiphae had been enamoured.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 77. 1 : \n        \"Now according to the myth which was handed down to us Pasiphae, the wife of Minos, became enamoured of the\n        bull, and Daidalos (Daedalus), by fashioning a contrivance in the shape of a cow, assisted Pasiphae to gratify\n        her passion.\n        In explanation of this the myths offer the following account: before this time it had been the custom of Minos\n        annually to dedicate to Poseidon the fairest bull born in his herds and to sacrifice it to the god; but at the\n        time in question there was born a bull of extraordinary beauty and he sacrificed another from among those which\n        were inferior, whereupon Poseidon becoming angry at Minos, caused his wife Pasiphae to become enamoured of the\n        bull. And by means of the ingenuity of Daidalos Pasiphae had intercourse with the bull and gave birth to the\n        Minotauros, famed in the myth.\n        This creature, they say, was of double form, the upper parts of the body as far as the shoulders being those of\n        a bull and the remaining parts those of a man. As a place in which to keep this monstrous thing Daidalos, the\n        story goes, built a labyrinth, the passage-ways of which were so winding that those unfamiliar with them had\n        difficulty in making their way out; in this labyrinth the Minotauros (Minotaur) was maintained and here it\n        devoured the seven youths and seven maidens which were sent to it from Athens, as we have already related.\n        But Daidalos, they say, on learning that Minos had made threats against him because he had fashioned the cow,\n        became fearful of the king and departed from Krete (Crete).\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 16 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] Pasiphae is in love with\n        the bull and begs Daidalos (Daedalus) to devise some lure for the creature; and he is fashioning a hollow cow\n        like a cow of the herd to which the bull is accustomed. What their union brought forth is shown by the form of\n        the Minotauros (Minotaur), strangely composite in its nature. Their union is not depicted here, but this is the\n        workshop of Daidalos . . . He sits before the framework of the cow and he uses Erotes (Love-Gods) as his\n        assistants in the device so as to connect with it something of Aphrodite [i.e. of desire] . . . \n        Pasiphae outside the workshop in the cattlefold gazes on the bull, thinking to draw him to her by her beauty and\n        by her robe, which is divinely resplendent and more beautiful than any rainbow. She has a helpless look--for she\n        knows what the creature is that she loves--and she is eager to embrace it, but takes no notice of her and gazes\n        at its own cow. The bull is depicting with proud mien, the leader of the herd, with splendid horns, white,\n        already experienced in love, its dewlap low and its neck massive, and it gazes fondly at the cow; but the cow in\n        the herd, ranging free and all white but for a black head, disdains the bull. For its purpose suggests a leap,\n        as of a girl who avoids the importunity of a lover.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 40 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Pasiphae, daughter of Sol [Helios] and wife of Minos, for several years did not make offerings to the\n        goddess Venus [Aphrodite]. Because of this Venus [Aphrodite] inspired in her an unnatural love for a bull. At\n        the time when Daedalus came there as an exile, he asked her to help him. For her he made a wooden heifer, and\n        put in it the hide of a real heifer, and in this she lay with the bull. From this intercourse she bore the\n        Minotaur, with bull's head but human body. Then Daedalus made for the Minotaur a labyrinth with an\n        undiscoverable exit in which it was confined.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 8. 130 ff (trans.

Though he himself should\n        return, mighty in Attic cunning, who shut our monster [the Minotaur] in the dark labyrinth, he could afford no\n        help to my calamity.
