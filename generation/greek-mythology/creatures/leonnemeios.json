  "content": "THE LEON NEMEIOS (Nemean Lion) was a large lion whose hide was impervious to weapons,. It plagued the district\n        of Nemea in the Argolis.\n        King Eurystheus commanded Herakles (Heracles) to destroy the beast as the first of his twelve Labours. The hero\n        cornered the lion in its cave and seizing it by the neck wrestled it to death. He then skinned its hide to make\n        a lion-skin cape, one of his most distinctive attributes. Hera afterwards placed the lion amongst the stars as\n        the constellation Leo.\n\n[1] ORTHROS & KHIMAIRA\n          (Hesiod Theogony 327)\n          [2] TYPHOEUS (Apollodorus 2.74)\n          [3] SELENE (Aelian On Animals 12.7, Hyginus\n            Fabulae 30, Seneca Hercules Furens 83)\n\nNEMEAN LION. The mountain valley of Nemea, between Cleonae and Phlius, was inhabited by a lion, the offspring\n        of Typhon (or Orthrus) and Echidna. (Hes. Theog. 327; Apollod. ii. 5. § 1; comp. Aelian, H.\n          A. xii. 7, Serv. ad Aen. viii. 295.) Eurystheus ordered Heracles to bring him the skin of this\n        monster. When Heracles arrived at Cleonae, he was hospitably received by a poor man called Molorchus. This man\n        was on the point of offering up a sacrifice, but Heracles persuaded him to delay it for thirty days until he\n        should return from his fight with the lion, in order that then they might together offer sacrifices to Zeus\n        Soter; but Heracles added, that if he himself should not return, the man should offer a sacrifice to him as a\n        hero. The thirty days passed away, and as Heracles did not return, Molorchus made preparations for the heroic\n        sacrifice; but at that moment Heracles arrived in triumph over the monster, which was slain, and both sacrificed\n        to Zeus Soter. Heracles, after having in vain used his club and arrows against the lion, had blocked up one of\n        the entrances to the den, and entering by the other, he strangled the animal with his own hands. According to\n        Theocritus (xxv. 251, &c.), the contest did not take place in the den, but in the open air, and Heracles is\n        said to have lost a finger in the struggle. (Ptolem. Heph. 2.) He returned to Eurystheus carrying the dead lion\n        on his shoulders; and Eurystheus, frightened at tile gigantic strength of the hero, took to flight, and ordered\n        him in future to deliver the account of his exploits outside the gates of the town.

There he preyed upon the tribes of the indwelling people, and was as\n        a king over Tretos and Apesas and Nemeia. Nevertheless, the force of strong Herakles (Heracles) subdued\n        him.\"\n\nPindar, Isthmian Ode 6. 46 ff (trans.

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"First he [Herakles] was assigned to fetch the skin of the Nemeian lion, an invulnerable animal sired by\n        Typhon . . . He then went to Nemea, found the lion, and shot it first with arrows. But when he knew for sure it\n        was invulnerable, he picked up his club and started after it. It escaped into a double-mouthed cave, but\n        Herakles blocked up one of the mouths, and ran in after the creature through the other. He encircled its neck\n        with his arm, and by squeezing choked it to death. He then draped it over his shoulders and took it back to\n        Kleonai (Cleonae).\"\n\nCallimachus, Aetia Fragment 55 (trans. Trypanis) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"The quick-tempered consort of Zeus [Hera] unloosed him [the Nemean Lion] to ruin Argos, though her\n        allotted portion, and as a hard labour to the unlawful offspring of Zeus.\"\n\nCallimachus, Fragment 108 (from Scholiast on Pindar's Nemean Ode 10. 1) :\n        \n        \"[The Nemean Lion] to whom [Hera] the wrathful spouse of Zeus gave Argos to keep, albeit it was her own\n        possession, to the end that it might be a stern labour for [Herakles] the bastard offspring of Zeus.\"\n\nTheocritus, Idylls 25. 132 ff (trans. Rist) (Greek bucolic C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"[Phyleus addresses Herakles (Heracles) :] ‘There came hither from Argos . . . a man of Akhaia\n        (Achaea), from Helix beside the sea, who said . . . that an Argive slew, as he was witness, a beast, a monstrous\n        lion, dread scourge of the countryside, which laired in a cave by the grove of Nemean Zeus . . . I've a\n        suspicion no other of the Akhaians dared this thing but you, and the lion's skin that drapes your sides\n        proclaims, with certainty, the mighty deed of your hands . . . Tell how this beast of bane you slew with your\n        bare hands and how it came to the well-watered country of Nemea. So great a monster I warrant you would not find\n        in all Apis, even should you wish, for none it supports of such size, but only bears and boars’\n        [Herakles replies :] ‘I can tell you each circumstance surrounding this monster as it befell -since you\n        have wished to hear--save where it came from; for that could none of the Argives, though many, plainly declare.\n        We only guessed that one of the holy immortals, wroth with the sons of Phoroneus, loosed this scourge; for like\n        a river bursting on all its valley-dwellers, the lion laid pitiless waste, and most of all to the Bembinaians\n        who, neighbours to his range, suffered beyond enduring. This was the first labour Eurystheus laid upon me to\n        fulfil. He bade me kill the fearsome beast, and I set out taking my supple bow and hollow quiver filled with\n        arrows: in the other hand, my stout staff . . . So when I reached the lion's terrain, I took my bow and fitted\n        the string to its curved horns and straight set it about the sorrow-dealing arrows. I was casting my eyes about,\n        spying out the baneful monster and hoping to get my sights on him before he on me. and the cursed breed of\n        wolves . . .\n        ‘It was midday and yet could I not observe his tracks nor hear his roar; nor was any man to be seen with\n        his oxen or labouring, through all the sown plough land, of whom I might inquire. Pale fear held all in their\n        homesteads. In truth, I never checked my feet; I searched the thick-leaved mountainside until I saw him, and\n        straight made trial of my strength. For late in the day he would go to his cave, having gorged on meat and\n        blood; around his squalid mane and glaring face and breast was spattered the carnage; his tongue licked his\n        chops. I had hidden myself in the shade of some bushes on a woodland path, waiting until he should come. As he\n        passed, swiftly I loosed an arrow at his left flank--in vain! The weapon held not its course through the ridged\n        flesh, but rebounded and fell on the green sward. Though astonished, he quickly reared his bloody head from the\n        ground, spying all about with searching eyes and snarling showed his wicked teeth.\n        ‘Vexed that my first had idle scaped my hand, I sent a second dart from the string; it struck him full in\n        the chest, the very seat of the lungs; even so the pain-dealing arrow failed to pierce below the hide but fell\n        in front of his paws, equally useless. A dreadful loathing seized me as the third time I prepared to draw and\n        the eyes of the monstrous beast, as they rolled round, sighted me. He lashed his long tail about his lions and\n        his mind ran upon battle; his throat swelled all with spleen; with ire bristled his tawny mane; his spine bent\n        like a bow as he gathered his length below his flanks and midriff . . . so the terrible lion arched himself and\n        sprang from far upon me, raging to taste my flesh. I held in one hand my darts and the cloak from my shoulders,\n        folded; with the other I swung my seasoned club about my ears and smashed it down on his head, but split the\n        wild olive, rugged as it was, asunder on the invincible brute's maned skull. Before he could come at me, he\n        fell, dropping down on the ground and stood on trembling feet swaying his head, for darkness swam about his eyes\n        swaying his head, for darkness swam about his eyes at the stunning shock to the brain's core.\n        ‘Seeing him witless with whelming pain, before he could turn and breath again, I was quick to advance and\n        seize him by the scruff of his iron neck, having thrown my bow to the ground with my broidered quiver. Then I\n        throttled him mightily with my stout hands, reaching round from behind lest he lacerate my flesh with his claws.\n        I set solidly my heels on his hind feet and pressed them down to the ground--my knees took care of his\n        sides--until I raised his body up breathless in my arms and stretched it out. Sire Haides received his life. My\n        next perplexity was to draw the shaggy hide from the dead beast's limbs: a very taxing labour, for to attempt it\n        I had neither knife of iron nor stone nor other means. Then a god put into my head to slit the lion's skin with\n        the lion's own claws; with these I soon had it off and wrapped it around my frame to serve as a shield against\n        the cut and thrust of the battle-rout. And there, my friend, you have that tale of the fate that befell the lion\n        of Nemea, that was once the cause of many a sorrow to flocks and to men.’\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 11. 3 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The first Labour which he [Herakles] undertook was the slaying of the Lion in Nemea. This was a beast of\n        enormous size, which could not be wounded by iron, or bronze or stone and required the compulsion of the human\n        hand for his subduing. It passed the larger part of its time between Mykenai and Nemea, in the neighbourhood of\n        a mountain which was called Tretos (Perforated) from a peculiarity which it possessed; for it had a cleft at its\n        base which extended clean through it and in which the beast was accustomed to lurk. Herakles (Heracles) came to\n        the region and attacked the lion, and when the beast retreated into the cleft, after closing up the other\n        opening the followed in after it and grappled with it, and winding his arms about its neck choked it to death.\n        The skin of the lion he put about himself, and since he could cover his whole body with it because of its great\n        size, he had in it a protection against the perils that were to follow.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 11. 5 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Amongst the paintings dedicated in the temple of Zeus at Olympia is :] Herakles' exploit against the\n        Nemean Lion.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 25. 7 :\n        \"[Amongst the offerings dedicated at Olympia :] Are two nude statues of Herakles as a boy.
