  "content": "THE DRAKON MAIONIOS (Lydian Dragon) was a giant serpent which ravaged the Anatolian kingdom of Lydia (Maionia).\n        It was slain by Herakles in the service of Queen Omphale. The hero's victory was afterwards memorialised amongst\n        the stars as the constellation Ophiochus.\n\nThe story was probably derived from the local Lydian tale of Damasen and the Drakon.\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 14 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Others point out that he [the constellation Opiuchus] is Hercules, killing in Lydia near the river Sagaris\n        a Dracon (Dragon-Serpent) which kept destroying many men and stripping the river banks of grain. In return for\n        this deed, Omphale, the queen of that region, sent him back to Argos loaded with gifts, and because of his\n        bravery he was placed by Jove [Zeus] among the constellations.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
