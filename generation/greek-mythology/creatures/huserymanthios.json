  "content": "THE HUS ERYMANTHIOS (Erymanthian Boar) was a gigantic boar which ravaged the farmlands of Psophis in western\n        Arkadia (Arcadia). Herakles (Heracles) was sent to capture it as one of his Twelve Labours. After chasing the\n        boar through the deep winter snows of Mount Erymanthos, he netted it and brought it back alive to Eurystheus.\n        The king, terrified at the sight of the deadly beast, leapt into a buried pithos jar for safety.\n\nThe boar may have once been assigned a Constellation like the\n        other beasts of Herakles' Twelve Labours.\n\nNowhere stated, perhaps related to the Kalydonian Boar\n\nERYMANTHIAN BOAR. This animal, which Heracles was ordered to bring alive, had descended from mount Erymanthus\n        (according to others, from mount Lampe,) into Psophis. Heracles chased him through the deep snow, and having\n        thus worn him out, he caught him in a net, and carried him to Mycenae. (Apollod. ii. 5. § 4; Diod. iv. 12.)\n        Other traditions place the hunt of the Erymanthian boar in Thessaly, and some even in Phrygia. (Eurip. Herc.\n          Fur. 368; Hygin. Fab. 30.) It must be observed that this and subsequent labours of Heracles are\n        connected with other subordinate ones, called Parerga, and the first of these parerga is the fight of Heracles\n        with the Centaurs.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 83 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        “For his [Herakles’ (Heracles')] fourth labor Eurystheus told him to bring back alive the\n        Erymanthian boar. This animal would set out from the mountain called Erymanthos (Erymanthus), and abuse the land\n        of Psophis. As Herakles was travelling through Pholoe, he stopped with kentauros (centaur) named Pholos (Pholus)\n        . . . [Pholos entertained Herakles but the other Kentauroi (Centaurs) stormed his encampment and were slain by\n        Herakles.]\n        When Herakles returned to Pholoe, he found Pholos dead [having dropped one of Herakles poisonous arrows on his\n        own foot], so he buried him and proceeded to find the boar. By shouting he routed it from a clump of trees,\n        forced it into heavy snow until it weakened, then snared it with a noose and took it back to Mykenai.\"\n\nSophocles, Trachinae 1097 (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) : \n        \"You [Herakles] tamed the beast in Erymanthia.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 6. 220 ff (trans.
