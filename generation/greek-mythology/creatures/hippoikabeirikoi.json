  "content": "THE HIPPOI KABEIRIKOI (Horses of the Cabeiri) were four horse-shaped, bronze automotones crafted by the god\n        Hephaistos (Hephaestus) to draw the adamantine chariot of his Kabeiroi\n        sons.\n\nForged by HEPHAISTOS (Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          29.193)\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 29. 193 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"[The Kabeiroi (Cabeiri)] rode in a car of adamant; a pair of colts beat the dust with rattling hooves of\n        brass, and they sent out a dry whinnying from their throats. These father Hephaistos *Hephaestus) had made with\n        his inimitable art, breathing defiant fire between their teeth, like the pair of brazenfooted bulls which he\n        made for Aietes the redoubtable ruler of the Kolkhians (Colchians), with hot collars and burning pole. Eurymedon\n        [one of the Kabeiroi] drove and guided the fiery mouths of the ironfoot steeds with a fiery bridle.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
