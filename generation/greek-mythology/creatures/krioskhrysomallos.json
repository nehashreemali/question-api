It was sent by the\n        cloud-nymphe Nephele to rescue her children Phrixos (Phrixus) and Helle when they were about to be sacrificed to\n        the gods. The ram carried Phrixos all the way to Kolkhis (Colchis) at the far end the Black Sea and then\n        instructed the boy to sacrifice him to the gods and lay his fleece in the grove of Ares. Khrysomallos was\n        afterwards placed amongst the stars as the constellation Aries\n        and his shining fleece became the goal of the quest of Iason (Jason) and the Argonauts.\n\nPOSEIDON & THEOPHANE (Hyginus\n          Fabulae 188, Ovid Metamorphoses 6.118)\n\nCHRYSOMALLUS. In consequence of the intrigues of Phrixus' stepmother, Ino (others state that he offered\n        himself), he was to be sacrificed to Zeus; but his mother Nephele removed him and Helle, and the two then rode\n        away on the ram with the golden fleece, the gift of Hermes, through the air. According to Hyginus (Fab.\n        3), Phrixus and Helle were thrown by Dionysus into a state of madness, and while wandering about in a forest,\n        they were removed by Nephele. Between Sigeum and the Chersonesus, Helle fell into the sea which was afterwards\n        called after her the Hellespont; but Phrixus arrived in Colchis, in the kingdom of Aeetes, who gave him his\n        daughter Chalciope in marriage (comp. Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. ii. 1123, 1149). Phrixus sacriticed the\n        rain which had carried him, to Zeus Phyxius or Laphystius (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. ii. 653; Paus. i.\n        24. § 2), and gave its skin to Aeetes, who fastened it to an oak tree in the grove of Ares.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 188 (trans.

When many suitors sought her from her\n        father, Neptunus [Poseidon] carried her off and took her to the island of Crumissa. When the suitors knew she\n        was staying there, they secured a ship and hastened to Crumissa. To deceive them, Neptunus changed Theophane\n        into a very beautiful ewe, himself into a ram, and the citizens of Curmissa into cattle. When the suitors came\n        there and found no human beings, they began to slaughter the herds and use them for food. Neptunus saw that the\n        men who had been changed to cattle were being destroyed, and changed the suitors into wolves. He himself, in ram\n        form, lay with Theophane, and from this union was born the Golden-fleeced Ram (Aries Chrysomallus)\n        which carried Phrixus to Colchis, and whose fleece, hung in the grove of Mars [Ares], Jason took away.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 6. 118 ff (trans.

When\n        Athamas heard this and was pressured by the joint efforts of the inhabitants, he had Phrixos placed on the\n        altar. But Nephele seized both him and her daughter, and gave them a golden-fleeced ram which she had received\n        from Hermes, by which they were borne through the sky over and across the land and the sea. But as they reached\n        teh sea that lies between Sigeion (Sigeum) and the Kherronesos (Cherronese), Helle slipped into the depths; from\n        her death there the sea was called the Hellespontos (Hellespont) after her. Phrixos proceeded on to the\n        Kholkians (Colchians), who were ruled by Aeetes, the son of Helios and Perseis, and brother of Kirke (Circe) and\n        Minos' wife Pasiphae. Aeetes received him and gave him Khalkiope (Chalciope), one of his daughters. Phrixos\n        sacrificed the golden-fleeced ram to Zeus Phyxios, but gave its fleece to Aeetes, who nailed it to an oak tree\n        in a grove of Ares.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1. 255 ff (trans.

Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"Phrixos (Phrixus), the son of Athamas, the myths relate, because of his stepmother's plots against him,\n        took his sister Helle and fled with her from Greece. While they were making the passage from Europe to Asia, as\n        a kind of Providence of the gods directed, on the back of a Ram (krios), whose fleece was of gold\n        (khrysomallos), the maiden fell into the sea, which was named after her Hellespontos (Hellespont), but\n        Phrixos continued on into the Pontos and was carried to Kholkis, where, as some oracle had commanded, he\n        sacrificed the ram and hung up its fleece as a dedicatory offering in the temple of Ares. After this, while\n        Aeetes was king of Kolkhis (Colchis), an oracle became known, to the effect that he was to come to the end of\n        his life whenever strangers should land there and carry of the golden fleece. For this reason and because of his\n        own cruelty as well, Aeetes ordained that strangers should be offered up in sacrifice, in order that, the report\n        of the cruelty of the Kolkhoi (Colchians) having been spread abroad to every part of the world, no stranger\n        should have the courage to set foot on the land. He also threw a wall about the precinct and stationed there\n        many guardians, these being men of the Tauric Chersonese, and it is because of these guards that the Greeks\n        invented monstrous myths. For instance, the report was spread abroad that there were fire-breathing Tauroi\n        (Bulls) round about the precinct and that a sleepless Drakon (Dragon) guarded the fleece . . . \n        Also the account of Phrixos underwent a similar working into a myth. For, as some men say, he made his voyage\n        upon a ship which bore the head of a ram upon its bow, and Helle, being troubled with sea-sickness, while\n        leaning far over the side of the boat for this reason, fell into the sea . . .\n        Phrixos and his attendant (Krios) were taken captive [by Aeetes] . . . The attendant whose name was Krios (Ram),\n        was sacrificed to the gods, and when his body had been flayed the skin was nailed up on the temple, in keeping\n        with a certain custom. And when later an oracle was delivered to Aeetes to the effect that he was to die\n        whenever strangers would sail to his land and carry off the skin of Krios, the king, they say, built a wall\n        about the precinct and stationed a guard over it; furthermore, he gilded the skin in order that by reason of its\n        brilliant appearance the soldiers should consider it worthy of the most careful guarding.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 15 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"In Kolkhis (Colchis) is preserved a golden fleece, the fleece of the ancient ram that ferried Helle with\n        Phrixos (Phrixus) across the sky, as the story goes.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 3 (trans.

She bade her children to mount it, and journey to Colchis to King Aeetes, son of Sol [Helios], and\n        there sacrifice the ram to Mars [Ares]. This they were said to have done, but when they had mounted, and the ram\n        had carried them over the sea, Helle fell from the ram; from this sea was called Hellespont. Phrixus, however,\n        was carried to Colchis, where, as his mother had bidden, he sacrificed the ram, and placed its gilded fleece in\n        the temple of Mars--the very fleece which, guarded by a dragon, it is said Jason, son of Aeson and Alcimede,\n        came to secure.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 20 (trans.

Hesiod and Pherecydes [mythographer C5th B.C.] say that it had a fleece of gold; about his we shall\n        speak at greater length elsewhere. Many have said that Helle fell into the Hellespont, [and] was embraced by\n        Neptune [Poseidon] . . . Phrixus, on coming safely to Aeetes, sacrificed the ram to Jove [Zeus], and hung the\n        fleece up in the temple. The image of the ram itself, put among the constellations by Nubes [Nephele], marks the\n        time of year when grain is sown, because Ino earlier sowed it parched--the chief reason for the flight.\n        Eratosthenes [Greek poet C3rd BC] says that the ram itself removed its golden fleece, and gave it Phrixus as a\n        memorial, and then came of its own accord to the stars; for this reason it seems somewhat dim, as we said before\n        . . .\n        Stirred by this report [i.e. the false accusation that Phrixus attacked his wife], Cretheus, as was fitting for\n        one who deeply loved his wife and was king, persuaded Athamas to put Phrixus to death. However, Nubes\n        intervened, and rescuing Phrixus and Helle his sister, put them on the ram, and bade them flee as far as they\n        could through the Hellespont Helle fell off and paid the debt to nature, and the Hellespont was nemd from her\n        name. Phrixus came to the Colchians, and, as we have said, hung up the fleece of the slain ram in a\n        temple.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 3. 853 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The seeds were burnt by the wicked stepmother's [Ino's] trick and no customary grain had sprouted.

People, time and Ino compelled a stubborn king to endure\n        the unspeakable orders.

Their mother [Nephele the cloud-nymphe] sees them as she hangs upon the air, and hammers her\n        naked breast in shock. She dives into the Dracon-born city [Thebes], enveloped in clouds, and snatches her\n        children away.
