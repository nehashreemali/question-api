  "content": "EKHIDNA ARGIA (Argive Echidna) was a Drakaina (She-Dragon) with the upper body of a woman and the tail of a\n        serpent who murdered travellers throughout the lands of Argos and Arkadia. She was eventually slain by the\n        hundred-eyed giant Argos Panoptes. Ekhidna's parents were\n        Peiras, a son of the king of Argos, and Styx, the nymphe of a poisonous Arkadian stream.\n\nThe Argive Ekhidna was sometimes identified with the Ekhidna of Arimoi,\n        wife of the giant Typhoeus and the mother of monsters. She was also related to the Argive Drakaina Poine.\n\n[1] PEIRAS & STYX (Epimenides Frag,\n          Pausanias 8.17.6)\n        [2] TARTAROS & GAIA (Apollodorus 2.4)\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 4 (trans.

He got the rule and named\n        the Peloponnesos Argos after himself. He married Euadne (Evadne), the daughter of Strymon and Neaera, and sired\n        Ekbasos (Ecbasus), Peiras, Epidauros, and Kriasos (Criasus). The son of Ekbasos was Agenor, and his son was\n        Argos surnamed Panoptes. This man had eyes all over his body . . . It is also said that he waited until Ekhidna\n        (Echidna) fell asleep, and then killed her. She was a daughter of Tartaros and Ge (Gaea), who would kidnap\n        travellers passing by.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 17. 6 (trans.
