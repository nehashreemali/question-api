  "content": "THE DRAKON GIGANTOMAKHIOS (Dragon of the Giant-War) was a huge serpent thrown at the goddess Athena by the\n        giants. She caught it up and impaled it upon the pole of heaven to form the constellation Draco.\n\nDraco was usually identified as the Hesperian dragon, guardian of the golden\n        apples of the Hesperides.\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 3 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Constellation Serpent . . . Some also say this Draco (Dragon) was thrown at Minerva [Athene] by the\n        Gigantes, when she fought them. Minerva [Athena], however, snatched its twisted form and threw it to the stars,\n        and fixed it at the very pole of heaven. And so to this day it appears with twisted body, as if recently\n        transported to the stars.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
