  "content": "THE KOURAI KHRYSEAI (Golden Maidens) were woman-shaped, gold automotones crafted by the divine smith Hephaistos\n        (Hephaestus) as attendants for his palace.\n\nForged by HEPHAISTOS (Homer Iliad\n          18.416)\n\nHomer, Iliad 18. 416 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"[Hephaistos (Hephaestus) left his bellows] took up a heavy stick in his hand, and went to the doorway\n        limping. And in support of their master moved his attendants. These are golden, and in appearance like living\n        young women. There is intelligence in their hearts, and there is speech in them and strength, and from the\n        immortal gods they have learned how to do things. These stirred nimbly in support of their master.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
