  "content": "AMALTHEIA (Amalthea) was the she-goat nurse of the god Zeus who nourished him with milk in a cave on Mount\n        Dikte (Dicte) in Krete (Crete). When the god reached maturity he created his thunder-shield (the aigis)\n        from her hide and the horn of plenty (cornucopia or keras amaltheias) from her crown. According to some\n        Amaltheia was a nymphe rather than a goat.\n\nAmaltheia was placed amongst the stars as the constellation\n        Capra--the stellar group surrounding Capella on the arm (ôlenê) of the Auriga the\n        Charioteer. The \"goat on the arm\" no doubt represented the stormy aigis-shield of Zeus which in\n        classical art was sometimes depicted as a tasselled hide slung across his arm. The rising of Capella marked the\n        onset of stormy weather for the Greeks. The word aigis means both \"stormy weather\" and\n        \"goat-skin\" in ancient Greek which explains the close connection between the two in myth.\n\n[1.1] KOURETE HAIMONIOS (Apollodorus 2.148,\n          Hyginus Astronomica 2.13)\n        [1.2] KOURETE OLENOS (Hyginus Astronomica\n          2.13)\n        [2.1] HELIOS (Hyginus Astronomica 2.13)\n\nAMALTHEIA (Amaltheia). The nurse of the infant Zeus after his birth in Crete. The ancients themselves appear to\n        have been as uncertain about the etymology of the name as about the real nature of Amaltheia. Hesychius derives\n        it from the verb amaltheuein, to nourish or to enrich ; others from amalthaktos, i. c. firm or hard;\n        and others again from amalê and theia, according to which it would signify the divine goat, or the tender\n        goddess. The common derivation is from amelgein, to milk or suck. According to some traditions Amaltheia is the\n        goat who suckled the infant Jove (Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 13; Arat. Phaen. 163; Callim.\n        Hymn. in Jov. 49), and who was afterwards rewarded for this service by being placed among the stars.\n        (Comp. Apollod. i. 1. § 6.) According to another set of traditions Amaltheia was a nymph, and daughter of\n        Oceanus, Helios, Haemonius, or of the Cretan king Melisseus (Schol. ad Hom. II. xxi. 194; Eratosth.\n        Catast. 13; Apollod. ii. 7. § 5; Lactant. Instit. i. 22; Hygin. l. c., and\n        Fab. 139, where he calls the nymph Adamanteia),and is said to have fed Zeus with the milk of a goat.\n        When this goat once broke off one of her horns, the nymph Amaltheia filled it with fresh herbs and fruit and\n        gave it to Zeus, who transplaced it together with the goat among the stars. (Ovid, Fast. v. 115,\n        &c.) According to other accounts Zeus himself broke off one of the horns of the goat Amaltheia, gave it to\n        the daughters of Melisseus, and endowed it with such powers that whenever the possessor wished, it would\n        instantaneously become filled with whatever might be desired. (Apollod. l. c.; Schol. ad Callim. l.\n          c.) This is the story about the origin of the celebrated horn of Amaltheia, commonly called the horn of\n        plenty or cornucopia, which plays such a prominent part in the stories of Greece, and which was used in later\n        times as the symbol of plenty in general. (Strab. x. p. 458, iii. p. 151; Diod. iv. 35.) Diodorus (iii. 68)\n        gives an account of Amaltheia, which differs from all the other traditions. According to him the Libyan king\n        Ammon married Amaltheia, a maiden of extraordinary beauty, and gave her a very fertile tract of land which had\n        the form of a bull's horn, and received from its queen the name of the horn of Amaltheia. This account, however,\n        is only one of the many specimens of a rationalistic interpretation of the ancient mythus. The horn appears to\n        be one of the most ancient and simplest vessels for drinking, and thus we find the story of Amaltheia giving\n        Zeus to drink from a horn represented in an ancient work of art still extant. (Galeria Giustiniani, ii. p. 61.)\n        The horn of plenty was frequently given as an attribute to the representations of Tyche or Fortuna.

By the will of Rhea a Golden Dog (Kuon Khryseos) guarded the goat.\n        After Zeus drove out the Titanes and deprived Kronos (Cronus) of power, he changed the goat into an immortal,\n        there is a representation of her among the stars to this day.

Juno [Hera], however, took Jove\n        to the island of Crete, and Amalthea, the child's nurse, hung him in a cradle from a tree, so that he could be\n        found neither in heaven nor on earth nor in the sea. And lest the cries of the baby be heard, she summoned\n        youths and gave them small brazen shields and spears, and bade them go around the tree making a noise. In Greek\n        they are called Curetes.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 13 :\n        \"On his [the constellation Auriga's] arm the goat [constellation] Capra stands, and in his left hand the\n        [constellation] Kids seem to be placed. They tell this story about him. A certain Olenus, son of Vulcanus\n        [Hephaistos (Hephaestus)], had two daughters, the nymphae (nymphs) Aex and Helice, who were nurses of Jove\n        [Zeus]. Others have said that certain cities were named from them--Olenus in Aulis, Helice in the Peloponnesus\n        (Peloponnese), and Aex in Haemonia--about which Homer writes in the second book of the Iliad.\n        But Parmeniscus say that a certain Melisseus was king in Crete, and to his daughters Jove [Zeus] was brought to\n        nurse. Since they did not have milk, they furnished him a she-goat, Amalthea by name, who is said to have reared\n        him. She often bore twin kids, and at the very time that Jove was brought to her to nurse, had borne a pair. And\n        so because of the kindness of the mother, the kids, too were placed among the constellations. Cleostratus of\n        Tenedos [astronomer C5th B.C.] is said to have first pointed out these kids among the stars.\n        But Musaeus says Jove [Zeus] was nursed by Themis and the nympha Amalthea, to whom he was given by Ops [Rhea],\n        his mother. Now Amalthea had as a pet a certain goat which is said to have nursed Jove.\n        Some have called Aex [a Gorgon] the daughter of Sol [Helios], who surpassed many in beauty of body, but in\n        contrast to this beauty, had a most horrible face. Terrified by it, the Titanes begged Terra (Earth) [Gaia] to\n        hide her body, and Terra is said to have hidden her in a cave in the island of Crete. Later she became nurse of\n        Jove [Zeus], as we have said before. But when Jupiter [Zeus], confident in his youth, was preparing for war\n        against the Titanes, oracular reply was given to him that if he wished to win, he should carry on the war\n        protected with the skin of a goat, aigos, and the head of the Gorgon. The Greeks call this the aegis.\n        When this was done, as we have shown above, Jupiter, overcoming the Titanes, gained possession of the kingdom.\n        Covering the remaining bones of the goat with a skin, he gave life to them and memorialised them, picturing them\n        with stars. Afterwards he gave to Minerva [Athena] the aegis with which he had been protected.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 5. 111 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"On the first night I can see the star that serviced Jupiter's [Zeus'] cradle. The rainy sign of Olenian\n        Capella is born. Heaven is her reward for giving milk. Naiad Amalthea, famous on Cretan Ida, hid Jupiter, it is\n        said, in the forest. She possessed the lovely mother of two young goats, a glorious sight among Dicte's flocks,\n        with soaring horns curled round her back and an udder suitable for the nurse of Jupiter. She gave the god milk,\n        but snapped her horn on a tree and was severed from half her loveliness. The Nympha picked the horn up, ringed\n        it with fresh herbs, and took it fruit-filled to Jupiter's lips. When he controlled the sky and sat on his\n        father's throne and nothing surpasses unconquered Jove, he made stars of the nurse and the nurse's fruitful\n        horn, which bears even now its mistress' name.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 3. 439 ff :\n        \"A she-goat stands there [in the shrine of young Jove at Rome], too : the Cretan Nymphae (Nymphs), they\n        say, fed Jove [Zeus] and the goat gave the infant milk.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 27. 290 ff (trans.
