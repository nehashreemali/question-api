  "content": "PEGASOS (Pegasus) was an immortal, winged horse which sprang from the neck of the beheaded Gorgon Medousa\n        (Medusa).\n        It was tamed by Bellerophon who rode it into battle against the\n        fire-breathing monster known as the Khimaira (Chimera). Later the hero attempted to\n        fly to heaven but Zeus caused the horse to buck throwing him back down to earth in disgrace. Pegasos winged his\n        way on to Olympos where he became the thunderbolt-bearer of Zeus.\n\nPegasos was commemorated amongst the stars as the constellation of the same name. Its rising marks the arrival of\n        spring and, in Greece, of seasonal thunderstorms.\n\nPegasos' name means either \"of the spring\" from the Greek word pêgê, or\n        \"sprung forth\" from the word pêgazô. The first alludes to the steed's connection\n        with various springs, and the latter to its birth from the Gorgon's neck.\n\n[1.1] POSEIDON & MEDOUSA (Hesiod Theogony 278, Apollodorus 2.32\n          & 2.42, Hyginus Fabulae 151 & Astronomica 2.18, Ovid Metamorphoses 4.781 & 6.119)\n        [1.2] MEDOUSA (Pindar Olympian Ode, Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 24.270)\n\nPE′GASUS (Pêgasos). The famous winged horse, whose origin is thus related. When Perseus struck off\n        the head of Medusa, with whom Poseidon had had intercourse in the form of a horse or a bird, there sprang forth\n        from her Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus. The latter obtained the name Pegasus because he was believed to have\n        made his appearance near the sources (pêgai) of Oceanus. Pegasus rose up to the seats of the immortals,\n        and afterwards lived in the palace of Zeus, for whom he carried thunder and lightning (IIes. Theog.\n        281, &c.; Apollod. ii. 3. § 2, 4. § 2 ; Schol. ad Aristoph. Pac. 722; comp. Ov.\n        Met. iv. 781, &c. vi. 119). According to this view, which is apparently the most ancient, Pegasus\n        was the thundering horse of Zeus; but later writers describe him as the horse of Eos (Schol. ad Hom.\n          Il. vi. 155; Tzetz. ad Lyc. 17), and place him among the stars as the heavenly horse (Arat.\n        Phaen. 205, &c.; Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 18 Ov. Fast. iii. 457, &c.).\n\nPegasus also acts a prominent part in the fight of Bellerophon against the Chimaera (Hes. Theog. 325;\n        Apollod. ii. 3. § 2). After Bellerophon had tried and suffered much to obtain possession of Pegasus for his\n        fight against the Chimaera, he consuited the soothsayer Polyidus at Corinth. The latter advised him to spend a\n        night in the temple of Athena, and, as Bellerophon was sleeping, the goddess appeared to him in a dream,\n        commanding him to sacrifice to Poseidon, and gave him a golden bridle. When he awoke he found the bridle,\n        offered the sacrifice, and caught Pegasus, who was drinking at the well Peirene (Pind. Ol. xiii. 90,\n        &c. with the Schol.; Strab. viii. p. 379). According to some Athena herself tamed and bridled Pegasus, and\n        surrendered him to Bellerophon (Paus. ii. 4. § 1), or Bellerophon received Pegasus from his own father\n        Poseidon (Schol. ad Hom. Il. vi. 155). After he had conquered the Chimaera (Pindar says that he also\n        conquered the Amazons and the Solymi, Ol. xiii. 125), he endeavoured to rise up to heaven with his\n        winged horse, but fell down upon the earth, either from fear or from giddiness, or being thrown off by Pegasus,\n        who was rendered furious by a gad-fly which Zeus had sent. But Pegasus continued his flight (Hygin. Poet.\n          Astr. ii. 18 ; Pind. Isthm. vii. 6; Tzetz. ad Lyc. 17; Eustath. ad Hom. p.\n        636). Whether Hesiod considered Pegasus as a winged horse, cannot be inferred with certainty from the word\n        apoptamenose; but Pindar, Euripides, and the other later writers, expressly mention his wings.\n\nPegasus lastly was also regarded as the horse of the Muses, and in this capacity he is more celebrated in\n        modern times than he ever was in antiquity ; for with the ancients he had no connection with the Muses, except\n        that by his hoof he called forth the inspiring well Hippocrene. The story about this well runs as follows. When\n        the nine Muses engaged in a contest with the nine daughters of Pierus on Mount Helicon, all became darkness when\n        the daughters of Pierus began to sing ; whereas during the song of the Muses, heaven, the sea, and all the\n        rivers stood still to listen, and Helicon rose heavenward with delight, until Pegasus, on the advice of\n        Poseidon, stopped its rising by kicking it with his hoof (Anton. Lib. 9); and from this kick there arose\n        Hippocrene, the inspiring well of the Muses, on Mount Helicon, which, for this reason, Persius (Prol.\n        1) calls fons caballinus (Ov. Met. v. 256). Others again relate that Pegasus caused the well\n        to gush forth because he was thirsty; and in other parts of Greece also similar wells were believed to have been\n        called forth by Pegasus, such as Hippocrene, at Troezene, and Peirene, near Corinth (Paus. ii. 31. § 12;\n        Stat. Theb iv. 60). Pegasus is often seen represented in ancient works of art and on coins along with\n        Athena and Bellerophon.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 280 ff (trans.

Till Pallas [Athena], goddess maid, brought him the bridle and golden\n        headband, and behold a dream was truth. ‘Sleep not, Aiolid king,’ said she, ‘but take this\n        charm of steeds, and offer the Horse-Tamer [Poseidon], your sire, a snow-white bull, and show to him this\n        bridle.’\n        Such words, as he lay slumbering in the dark, it seemed the maiden of the shadowy aegis spoke unto him, and he\n        leapt to his feet and seized the magic bit, that lay beside him on the ground; and went with joy to find the\n        prophet of his country's people the son of Korianos (Corianus). And he made known to him the whole issue of this\n        strange matter--how that he had lain the whole night through upon the goddess' altar, as the seer had foretold\n        him, and how the child of Zeus whose sword is lightning, in her own hands brought him the golden charm that\n        tames the savage spirit. And the prophet bade him obey at once the magic vision, and to Poseidon, the\n        earth-holder, to sacrifice the strong-limbed bull. Then too that he should build an altar with all speed to\n        Athene, queen of steeds. Yet the gods' power can lightly bring to pass such things as will deny both the sworn\n        word and all the hopes of men. Thus with all zeal mighty Bellerophon seized the winged steed, setting between\n        his jaws the soothing charm, and mounting him, in his bronze panoply played him in sport, to try his pace. And\n        once, with him, he smote the Amazones (Amazons), from the chill bosom of the lonely air, that archered host of\n        women-kind; and felled Khimaira (Chimera) breathing fire, and slew the Solymoi (Solymi).

As it glided above the clouds and beneath the stars, the sky was its earth and wings were its feet. It had\n        only just protested its strange bridling [by Bellerophon], when its light hoof dug Aonia's spring [the\n        Hippokrene (Hippocrene)].

Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"Pegasos flying on high quickly cut the air on his long wings.\"\n\nPegasoi or winged horses (hippoi pteretoi) were often depicted in ancient art drawing the chariots of\n        the gods, especially those of the sun-god Helios and moon-goddes Selene. In myth the hero Pelops was given a\n        chariot drawn by winged horses by the god Poseidon. A species of winged horse is also described in Greek\n        legend--animals believed to be indigenous to the mysterious land of Aithiopia (Ethiopia)--see Pegasoi Aithiopikoi.\n\nPlato, Critias (trans.

The horses have golden wings, and a man is giving armour to one of the women. I\n        conjecture that this scene refers to the death of Patroklos (Patroclus); the women in the chariots, I take it,\n        are Nereides, and Thetis is receiving the armour from Hephaistos (Hephaestus).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
