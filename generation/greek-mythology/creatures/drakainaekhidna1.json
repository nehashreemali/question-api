  "content": "EKHIDNA (Echidna) was a monstrous she-dragon (drakaina) with the head and breast of a woman and the\n        tail of a coiling serpent. She probably represented the corruptions of the earth--rot, slime, fetid waters,\n        illness and disease.\n\nEkhidna was sometimes equated with Python \"the Rotting One\", a\n        dragon born of the fetid slime left behind by the great Deluge. Others name her the Tartarean lamprey, and place\n        in her to the dark, swampy pit of Tartaros beneath the earth. Hesiod, makes her a daughter of monstrous\n        sea-gods, and presumably associates her with rotting sea-scum and fetid salt-marshes.\n\nEkhidna was the consort of Typhoeus--a monstrous, multi-headed\n        storm-giant who challenged Zeus to the throne of heaven. Together they spawned a host of terrible monsters to\n        plague the earth including the Khimaira (Chimera), Kerberos (Cerberus), the Hydra, Sphinx and the Drakon\n        Hesperios (Hesperian Dragon).\n\nFour other closely related she-dragons were the Argive Ekhidna and Poine (Poena), the Tartarean Kampe (Campe), and\n        the Phokian Sybaris.\n\nIn the image right Ekhidna is equated with Python and Apollon, seated on the omphalos stone, slays\n        her with his arrows--the motif perhaps represents the healing god (Paian) destroying the daemon bringer of\n        plague.\n\n[1.1] PHORKYS & KETO (Hesiod Theogony 2.95)\n        [1.2] TARTAROS & GAIA (Apollodorus 2.4)\n\n[1.1] ORTHOS, KERBEROS, HYDRA, KHIMAIRA (by Typhoeus) (Hesiod Theogony 306)\n        [1.2] ORTHOS, KHIMAIRA, DRAKON HESPERIOS, KAUKASIAN EAGLE, SPHINX, \n          KROMMYON SOW (by Typhon) (Apollodorus\n          2.106, 2.32, 2.113, 2.120, 3.52, E1.1)\n        [1.3] GORGO, KERBEROS, DRAKON HESPERIOS, HYDRA, DRAKON KHOLKIKOS, SKYLLA, SPHINX, KHIMAIRA (by Typhon) (Hyginus Pref & Fabulae 151 &\n          Astr. 2.15)\n        [1.4] KHIMAIRA (by Typhon) (Homeric Hymn 3.356)\n        [1.5] SPHINX (by Typhon) (Lasus Frag 706a)\n        [1.6] KERBEROS (Bacchylides Frag 5)\n        [1.7] ORTHOS, KERBEROS (by Typhon) (Quintus Smyrnaeus 6.249,\n          6.260)\n        [1.8] KERBEROS, HYDRA (Ovid Metamorphoses 7.412 & 9.69)\n        [2.1] EKHIDNADES (Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          18.274)\n\nECHIDNA (Echidna), a daughter of Tartarus and Ge (Apollod. ii. 1. § 2), or of Chrysaor and Callirrhoë\n        (Hesiod. Theog. 295), and according to others again, of Peiras and Styx. (Paus. viii. 18. § 1.)\n        Echidna was a monster, half maiden and half serpent, with black eyes, fearful and bloodthirsty. She was the\n        destruction of man, and became by Typhon the mother of the Chimaera, of the many-headed dog Orthus, of the\n        hundred-headed dragon who guarded the apples of the Hesperides, of the Colchian dragon, of the Sphinx, Cerberus,\n        Scylla, Gorgon, the Lernaean Hydra, of the eagle which consumed the liver of Prometheus, and of the Nemean lion.\n        (Hes. Theog. 307, &c.; Apollod. ii. 3. § 1, 5. §§ 10, 11, iii. 5. § 8; Hygin.\n        Fab. Praef. p. 3, and Fab. 151.) She was killed in her sleep by Argus Panoptes. (Apollod. ii.\n        1. § 2.) According to Hesiod she lived with Typhon in a cave in the country of the Arimi, whereas the\n        Greeks on the Euxine conceived her to have lived in Scythia.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 295 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"But she [Keto (Ceto)] bore [to Phorkys (Phorcys)] another unmanageable monster like nothing human nor like\n        the immortal gods either, in a hollow cave. This was the divine and haughty Ekhidna (Echidna), and half of her\n        is a Nymphe with a fair face and eyes glancing, but the other half is a monstrous serpent (ophis),\n        terrible, enormous and squirming and voracious, there in earth's secret places. For there she has her cave on\n        the underside of a hollow rock, far from the immortal gods, and far from all mortals. There the gods ordained\n        her a fabulous home to live in which she keeps underground among the Arimoi, grisly Ekhidna, a Nymphe who never\n        dies, and all her days she is ageless.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 2. 780 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"Zeus who delights in thunder were angry, as when he batters the earth about Typhoeus, in the land of the\n        Arimoi [Arimaspians], where they say Typhoeus lies prostrate.\" [N.B. This is the same underground home\n        given to Ekhidna (Echidna) by Hesiod, above.]\n\nN.B. Both Homer and Hesiod mention that Typhoeus and Ekhidna were imprisoned beneath the stormy land of the\n        Arimoi--a semi-mythical Skythian (Scythian) tribe also called Arimaspoi (Arimaspians) or Kimmaroi\n        (Cimmerians)--who dwelt at the ends of the earth in eternal gloom. In other words, the pair resided in Tartaros.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 4 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"She [Ekhidna (Echidna)] was a daughter of Tartaros and Ge (Gaea).\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 306 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Men say that Typhaon [Typhoeus] the terrible, outrageous and lawless, was joined in love to her [Ekhidna\n        (Echidna)], the maid with glancing eyes. So she conceived and brought forth fierce offspring; first she bare\n        Orthos (Orthus) the hound of Geryones (Geryon), and then again she bare a second, a monster not to be overcome\n        and that may not be described, Kerberos (Cerberus) who eats raw flesh, the brazen-voiced hound of Haides,\n        fifty-headed, relentless and strong. And again she bore a third, the evil-minded Hydra of Lerna, whom the\n        goddess, white-armed Hera nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty Herakles . . . She was the\n        mother of Khimaira (Chimera) who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift-footed and strong, who\n        had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing\n        forth a fearful blast of blazing fire. Her did Pegasos (Pegasus) and noble Bellerophontes slay.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 3 to Apollo 356 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Straightway large-eyed queenly Hera took him [her child the monster Typhaon (Typhoeus)] and bringing one\n        evil thing to another such, gave him to the Drakaina (Dracaena) [Ekhidna-Python]; and she received him. And this\n        Typhaon used to work great mischief among the famous tribes of men.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 3 to Apollo 362 ff : \n        \"Phoibos (Phoebus) Apollon boasted over her [Python-Ekhidna] ‘. . .

Then, placing Zeus up on his\n        shoulders he carried him across the sea to Kilikia (Cilicia), where he deposited him in the Korykrian (Corycian)\n        cave. He also hid away the sinews there in the skin of a bear, and posted as guard over them the drakaina\n        (dracaena) Delphyne--a girl who was half animal. But Hermes and Aegipan stole back the sinews.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 31 :\n        \"It [the Khimaira (Chimera)] was allegedly reared by Amisodaros, as Homer also states, and according to\n        Hesiod its parents were Typhon and Ekhidna (Echidna).\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 52 :\n        \"While he [Kreon (Creon)] was king, quite a scourge held Thebes in suppression, for Hera sent upon them the\n        Sphinx, whose parents were Ekhidna (Echidna) and Typhon.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 113 :\n        \"An immortal serpent [the Drakon Hesperios (Hesperian Dragon)] guarded them [the golden apples], the child\n        of Typhon and Ekhidna (Echidna), with one hundred heads which spoke with voices of various types.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 120 :\n        \"When he [Herakles] reached the mainland on the other side he killed with an arrow the Eagle on the\n        Kaukasos (Caucasus), the product of Ekhidna (Echidna) and Typhon that had been eating the liver of\n        Prometheus.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E1. 1 :\n        \"Theseus slew the sow at Krommyon (Crommyon) called Phaia (Phaea) after the old woman who kept it.

And this Typhaon used\n        to work great mischief among the famous tribes of men. Whosoever met the Drakaina, the day of doom would sweep\n        him away, until the lord Apollon, who deals death from afar, shot a strong arrow at her. Then she, rent with\n        bitter pangs, lay drawing great gasps for breath and rolling about that place. An awful noise swelled up\n        unspeakable as she writhed continually this way and that amid the wood : and so she left her life, breathing it\n        forth in blood. Then Phoibos (Phoebus) Apollon boasted over her : ‘Now rot here upon the soil that feeds\n        man! You at least shall live no more to be a fell bane to men who eat the fruit of the all-nourishing earth, and\n        who will bring hither perfect hecatombs.

And the holy strength of Helios made her\n        rot away there; wherefore the place is now called Pytho (the Rotting), and men call the lord Apollon by another\n        name, Pythian; because on that spot the power of piercing Helios made the monster rot away.\"\n\nAristophanes, Frogs 475 ff (trans.
