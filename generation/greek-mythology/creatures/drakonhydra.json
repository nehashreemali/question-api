So with the help of Iolaos (Iolaus), he applied burning brands to the\n        severed stumps, cauterizing the wounds and preventing the regeneration. In the battle he also crushed a giant crab beneath his heel which had come to assist the Hydra.\n        The Hydra and the Crab were afterwards placed amongst the stars by Hera as\n        the Constellations Hydra and Cancer.\n\n[1.1] TYPHOEUS & EKHIDNA (Hesiod Theogony 313, Hyginus Pref & Fab 30 & 151)\n        [1.2] EKHIDNA (Ovid Metamorphoses 9.69)\n\nHYDRA. This monster, like the lion, was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna, and was brought up by Hera. It\n        ravaged the country of Lernae near Argos, and dwelt in a swamp near the well of Amymone: it was formidable by\n        its nine heads, the middle of which was immortal. Heracles, with burning arrows, hunted up the monster, and with\n        his club or a sickle he cut off its heads; but in the place of the head he cut off, two new ones grew forth each\n        time, and a gigantic crab came to the assistance of the hydra, and wounded Heracles. However, with the\n        assistance of his faithful servant Iolaus, he burned away the heads of the hydra, and buried the ninth or\n        immortal one under a huge rock. Having thus conquered the monster, he poisoned his arrows with its bile, whence\n        the wounds inflicted by them became incurable. Eurystheus declared the victory unlawful, as Heracles had won it\n        with the aid of Iolaus. (Hes. Theog. 313, &c.; Apollod. ii. 5. § 2; Diod. iv. 11; Eurip.\n        Herc.

[and a] crab . . . from the sea--freshly, I fancy, arrived on shore; and, when the hero was so bothered with\n        its leftward barks and bites, he summoned his nephew Iolaus to the rescue, and he brought him effective\n        relief.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 77 - 80 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"For his second labour Herakles was instructed to slay the Lernaian (Lernaean) Hydra. The beast was\n        nurtured in the marshes of Lerna, from where she would go out onto the flatland to raid flocks and ruin the\n        land. The Hydra was of enormous size, with eight mortal heads, and a ninth one in the middle that was immortal.\n        With Iolaos (Iolaus) driving, Herakles rode a chariot to Lerna, and there, stopping the horses, he found the\n        Hydra on a ridge beside the springs of Amymone where she nested. By throwing flaming spears at her he forced her\n        to emerge, and as she did he was able to catch hold. But she hung on to him by wrapping herself round one of his\n        feet, and he was unable to help matters by striking her with his club, for as soon as one head was pounded off\n        two others would grow in its place. Then a giant crab came along to help the Hydra, and bit Herakles on the\n        foot. For this he killed the crab, and called on his own behalf to Iolaos for help. Iolaos made some torches by\n        setting fire to a portion of the adjoining woods, and, by using these to burn the buddings of the heads, he kept\n        them from growing. When he had overcome this problem, Herakles lopped off the immortal head, which he buried and\n        covered with a heavy boulder at the side of the road that runs through Lerna to Elaios (Elaeus). He cut up the\n        Hydra's body and dipped his arrows in its venom.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 8. 6. 2 (trans.

Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        ”At the source of the Amymone [near Lerna, Argolis] grows a plane tree, beneath which, they say, the Hydra\n        (Water-snake) grew. I am ready to believe that this beast was superior in size to other water-snakes, and that\n        its poison had something in it so deadly that Herakles treated the points of his arrows with its gall. It had,\n        however, in my opinion, one head and not several. It was Peisander of Kamiros (Camirus) who, in order that the\n        beat might appear more frightful and his poetry might be more remarkable, represented the Hydra with its many\n        heads.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 18. 10 - 16 :\n        \"[Amongst the images depicted on the throne of Apollon at Amyklai (Amyclae) near Sparta :] On the left\n        stand Ekhidna (Echidna) and Typhos [Typhoeus], on the right Tritones . . .

And when\n        one head was cut off, the place where it was severed put forth two others; for this reason it was considered to\n        be invincible, and with good reason, since the part of it which was subdued sent forth a two-fold assistance in\n        its place. Against a thing so difficult to manage as this Herakles devised an ingenious scheme and commanded\n        Iolaos (Iolaus) to sear with a burning brand the part which had been severed, in order to check the flow of the\n        blood. So when he had subdued the animal by this means he dipped the heads of his arrows in the venom, in order\n        that when the missile should be shot the wound which the point made might be incurable.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 6. 212 ff (trans.

Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Why, he [Herakles] bears as weapons what he once fought and overcame; he goes armed by lion [i.e. the skin\n        of the Nemeian lion] and by Hydra [i.e. his arrows dipped in its venom].\"\n\nSeneca, Hercules Furens 1194 ff : \n        \"[Herakles' mourns his young sons who he slew in a fit of madness with venom-tainted arrows :] ‘What\n        of that shaft, still dripping with the blood of boys? It has been dipped in Hydra's gore--ah, now my own weapons\n        do I recognize. No need to ask the hand that used them!

Then the [shades of the] monsters he had conquered are in a panic, the fierce Centaurs and the\n        Lapithae whom too much wine had inflamed to war; and, seeking the farthest fens of the Stygian swamp, Lerna's\n        labour [i.e. the Hydra] plunges deep his fertile heads.\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 3. 224 (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The Titan] Coeus in the lowest pit [of Tartaros] burst the adamantine bonds and trailing Jove's [Zeus'[\n        fettering chains . . . conceives a hope of scaling heaven, yet though he repass the rivers and the gloom the\n        hound of the Furiai [Kerberos (Cerberus)] and the sprawling Hydra's crest [a second guardian of the underworld]\n        repel him.\"\n\nStatius, Silvae 2. 1. 228 ff (trans.
