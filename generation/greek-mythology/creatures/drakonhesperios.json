  "content": "THE DRAKON HESPERION (Hesperian Dragon) was a hundred-headed serpent named Ladon tasked with guarding the\n        golden apples of the Hesperides and tormenting the heavens-bearing Titan Atlas. The creature was slain by\n        Herakles when he was sent to recover the golden apples as one of his twelve labours. It was afterwards placed\n        amongst the stars by the gods as the Constellation Draco\n        encircling the north pole.\n\nIn Hesiod, the parents and siblings of Ladon represent the various dangers of the sea. Therefore, the\n        hundred-headed serpent, whose name means \"Strong Flow\", might have represented dangerous sea currents.\n\n[1] PHORKYS & KETO (Hesiod Theogony 333)\n          [2] TYPHOEUS & EKHIDNA (Apollodorus 2.113, Hyginus Fabulae 151)\n\nLADON (Ladôn). The dragon, who was believed to guard the apples of the Hesperides. He is said to have\n        been able to assume various tones of voice, and to have been the offspring of Typhon and Echidna; but he is also\n        called a son of Ge, or of Phorcys and Ceto. He had been appointed to watch in the gardens of the Hesperides by\n        Juno, and never slept; but he was slain by Heracles; and the image of the fight was placed by Zeus among the\n        stars.

But now the snake, struck down by Herakles, lay by the trunk of the\n        apple-tree. Only the tip of his tail was still twitching; from the head down, his dark spine showed not a sign\n        of life. His blood had been poisoned by arrows steeped in the gall of the Lernaian Hydra, and flies perished in\n        the festering wounds . . .\n        [The Hesperis Aigle (Hesperid Aegle) addresses the Argonauts :] ‘There was a man here yesterday, an evil\n        man, who killed the watching snake, stole our golden apples, and is gone.

Now towards the one he stretches the end of his tail, but with the coil he intercepts the Lesser Bear.\n        The tip of his tail ends by the head of Helike (Helice), but in the coil Kynosoura (Cynosura) has her head. For\n        his coil circles past her very head and comes near her feet, but again, turning back, runs upward. Not one lone\n        star shines on his head, but on his brows are tow stars lit, and two in his eyes, and one beneath is set upon\n        the chin-point of the dread monster. Aslant is his head, and he seems most like as if he were nodding to the tip\n        of the tail of Helike; his mouth and right temple straight confront the end of her tail. That head wheels near\n        where the limits of setting and rising blend.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 6. 19. 8 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Wooden images dedicated at the sanctuary of Olympia :] The third of the treasuries . . . showing the\n        heavens upheld by Atlas, and also Herakles and the apple-tree of the Hesperides, with the Drakon (Dragon) coiled\n        round the apple-tree. These too are of cedar-wood, and are works of Theokles (Theocles), son of Hegylos. The\n        inscription on the heavens says that his son helped him to make it. The Hesperides--they were removed by the\n        Eleans--were even in my time in the Heraion (Heraeum, Temple of Hera); the treasury was made for the\n        Epidamnians.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 26. 2 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"[The following is a late Greek rationalisation of the Hesperides myth, in which the drakon becomes a\n        shepherd named Drakon, and the golden apples (mela) are instead a flock of golden sheep (mela)\n        :] The last Labour which Herakles undertook was the bringing back of the golden apples of the Hesperides, and so\n        he again sailed to Libya. With regard to these apples there is disagreement among the writers of myths, and some\n        say that there were golden apples in certain gardens of the Hesperides in Libya, where they were guarded without\n        ceasing by a most formidable Drakon, whereas others assert that the Hesperides possessed flocks of sheep which\n        excelled in beauty and . . . the sheep had a peculiar colour like gold that they got this designation, and the\n        Drakon (Dragon) was the name of the shepherd of the sheep, a man who excelled in strength of body and courage,\n        who guarded the sheep and slew any who might dare try to carry them off. But with regards to such matters it\n        will be every man's privilege to form such opinions as accord with his own belief. At any rate Herakles slew the\n        guardian of the apples [Drakon].\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 6. 256 ff (trans. Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Depicted on the shield of Eurypylos, the son of Herakles :] There were the Golden Apples wrought, that\n        gleamed in the Hesperides' garden undefiled : all round the fearful Drakon's (Dragon's) dead coils lay, and\n        shrank the Maids [Hesperides] aghast from Zeus' bold son.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 17 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"This creature [the drakon (dragon)] is said to be devoted to gold and whatever golden thing it sees\n        it loves and cherishes; thus the fleece in Kolkhis (Colchis) and the apples of the Hesperides, since they seemed\n        to be of gold, two drakones (dragon-serpents) that never slept guarded and claimed as their own.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 21 :\n        \"Herakles has already secured the golden apples . . . and has won renown for his exploit among the\n        Hesperides--to overcome them was not such an amazing feat for Herakles, but rather the drakon\n        (dragon-serpent).\"\n\nPtolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 5 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190)\n          (trans. Pearse) (Greek mythographer C1st to C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"The Drakon (Dragon) which guarded the golden apples was the brother of the Nemean lion.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"From Typhon and Echidna [was born] . . . Hesperian Dragon (Draco Hesperidum).\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 30 :\n        \"The huge Draco (Dragon), Typhon's son, which used to guard the golden apples of the Hesperides, he\n        [Herakles] killed near Mount Atlas, and brought the apples to King Eurystheus.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 151 :\n        \"From Typhon the giant and Echidna were born . . . the Draco which guarded the apples of the Hesperides\n        across Oceanus.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 3 :\n        \"Constellation Serpent. This huge serpent is pointed out as lying between the two Bears. He is said to have\n        guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides, and after Hercules killed him, to have been put by Juno [Hera]\n        among the stars, because at her instigation Hercules set out for him. He is considered the usual watchman of the\n        Gardens of Juno. Pherecydes [C5th B.C. mythographer] says that when Jupiter [Zeus] wed Juno, Terra (Earth)\n        [Gaia] came, bearing branches with golden applies, and Juno, in admiration, asked Terra to plant them in her\n        gardens near distant Mount Atlas. When Atlas' daughters kept picking the apples from the trees, Juno is said to\n        have placed this guardian there. Proof of this will be the form of Hercules above the dragon, as Eratosthenes\n        [C3rd B.C. poet] shows, so that anyone may know that for this reason in particular it is called the Draco.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 6 :\n        \"The Kneeler [constellation \"Hercules\"]. Eratosthenes [C3rd BC] says he is Hercules, placed above\n        the Draco (Dragon) we have already mentioned, and prepared to fight, with his left hand holding his lion skin,\n        and his right the club. He is trying to kill the dragon of the Hesperides, which, it is thought, never was\n        overcome by sleep or closed its eyes, thus offering more proof it was placed there as a guard. Panyassis [Greek\n        epic poet C5th B.C.] in the Heraclea says of the sign that Jupiter [Zeus], in admiration of their struggle,\n        placed it among the stars; for the Draco has its head erect, and Hercules, resting on his right knee, tires to\n        crush the right side of its head with his left foot. His right hand is up and striking, his left extended with\n        the lion skin, and he appears to be fighting with all his strength.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 4. 642 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The giant [Atlas] recalled the oracle which Themis Parnasia had given : ‘Atlas, a time shall come\n        when from your tree the gold shall be despoiled, and of that spoil a son of Jove [Zeus] shall boast.’ In\n        fear he had walled his orchards all around with massive ramparts and for guardian set an enormous Draco\n        (Dragon); and drove off all strangers from the borders of his realm.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 9. 190 ff : \n        \"Your [Herakles] valour secured . . . the apples guarded by the Unsleeping Dragon (Draco\n          Insomnis).\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 4. 480 (trans.
