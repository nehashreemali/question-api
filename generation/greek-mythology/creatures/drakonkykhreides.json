  "content": "THE DRAKON KYKHREIDES (Dragon Cychreides) was a giant serpent which terrorised the island of Salamis. According\n        to some it was slain by King Kykhreus (Cychreus). In other accounts the king raised the beast and it was instead\n        driven from the island by the hero Eurylokhos (Eurylochus). The serpent then swam across the sea to Eleusis\n        where it became a familiar of the goddess Demeter.\n\nCYCHREUS or CENCHREUS (Kuchreus), a son of Poseidon and Salamis, became king of the island of Salamis, which\n        was called after him Cychreia, and which he delivered from a dragon. He was subsequently honoured as a hero, and\n        had a sanctuary in Salamis. (Apollod. iii. 12. § 7; Diod. iv. 72.) According to other traditions, Cychreus\n        himself was called a dragon on account of his savage nature, and was expelled from Salamis by Eurylochus; but he\n        was received by Demeter at Eleusis, and appointed a priest to her temple. (Steph. Byz. s. v.\n        Kuchreios.) Others again said that Cychreus had brought up a dragon, which was expelled by Eurylochus. (Strab.\n        ix. p. 393.) There was a tradition that, while the battle of Salamis was going on, a dragon appeared in one of\n        the Athenian ships, and that an oracle declared this dragon to be Cychreus. (Paus. i. 36. § 1; comp. Tzetz.\n        ad Lycoph. 110, 175; Plut. Thes. 10, Solon. 9.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 161 (trans.
