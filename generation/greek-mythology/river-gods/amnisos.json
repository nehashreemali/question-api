  "content": "AMNISOS (Amnisus) was a river-god of the island of Krete (Crete) in the Greek Aegean.\n\nThe Amnisos River had its headwaters on the slopes of Mount Ida in central Krete. It flowed north, issuing into\n        the Aegean Sea near the town of Knossos (Cnossus). The stream was also known as the Kairatos (Caeratus). Other\n        personified Aegean island rivers included the Inopos of Delos, and Imbrasos of Samos.\n\n[1] THE AMNISIADES (Callimachus Hymn\n          to Artemis)\n        [2] Perhaps KNOSSIA\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 879 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Artemis, standing in her golden chariot after she has bathed in the gently water of Parthenios or the\n        streams of Amnisos (Amnisus), and driving off with her fast-trotting deer over the hills and far away to some\n        rich-scented sacrifice. Attendant Nymphai (Nymphs) have gathered at the source of Amnisos or flocked in from the\n        glens and upland springs to follow her; and fawning beasts whimper in homage and tremble as she passes by.\"\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis 12 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[The young Artemis addresses her father Zeus :] `And give me sixty Okeanines (daughters of Okeanos) for my\n        choir--all nine years old, all maidens yet ungirdled; and give me for handmaidens twenty Nymphai Amnisides\n        (Nymphs of the Amnisos) who shall tend well my buskins, and, when I shoot no more at lynx or stag, shall tend my\n        swift hounds.\"\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis 40 ff :\n        \"And the maiden [Artemis] fared unto the white moutain of Krete (Crete) leafy with woods; thence unto\n        Okeanos (Oceanus); and she chose many Nymphai (Nymphs) all nine years old, all maidens yet ungirdled. And the\n        River Kairatos (Caeratus) [Amnisos] was glad exceedingly.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
