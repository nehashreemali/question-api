  "content": "EUROTAS was a river-god of Lakedaimonia (Lacedaemonia) in the Peloponnese, southern Greece. He was an early\n        king of the region and possessed a mortal, rather than typical river-god, genealogy.\n\nThe River Eurotas had its headwaters in the Taygetos Mountains and flowed south through the heart of Lakonia,\n        past the city of Sparta, to reach the Mediterranean Sea near Helos on the Lakonian Gulf. The most important\n        neighbouring rivers personified by the Greeks were the Inakhos (Inachus) of\n        Argos to the north-east and the Alpheios (Alpheus) of Arkadia and Elis to the\n        north-west.\n\n[1.1] LELEX & KLEOKHAREIA (Apollodorus 3.116)\n        [2.1] MYLES (Pausanias 3.1.2)\n\n[1.1] PITANE (Pindar Olympian 6)\n        [2.1] SPARTE (Apollodorus 3.116)\n        [2.2] SPARTE, TIASA (Pausanias 3.18.6 & 8.25.2)\n        [3.1] Perhaps BATEIA, PERIBOIA, THERO\n\nEURO′TAS (Eurôtas), a son of Myles and grandson of Lelex. He was the father of Sparte, the wife of\n        Lacedaemon, and is said to have carried the waters, stagnating in the plain of Lacedaemon, into the sea by means\n        of a canal, and to have called the river which arose therefrom after his own name, Eurotas. (Paus. iii. 1.\n        § 2.) Apollodorus (iii. 10. § 3) calls him a son of Lelex by the nymph Cleochareia, and in Stephanus\n        of Byzantium (s. v. Taügeton) his mother is called Taygete.
