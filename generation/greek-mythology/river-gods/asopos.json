  "content": "ASOPOS (Asopus) was a River-God of Sikyonia in the Peloponnesos and Boiotia in central Greece. His twenty\n        beautiful daughters were abducted by gods and became the Naiad-nymphs of the springs of a host of Boiotian,\n        Korinthian, Sikyonian, Argive and island towns. When Asopos tried to recover his stolen daughter Aigina (Aegina)\n        from Zeus, the god drove him back with a thunderbolt.\n\nAsopos presided over two rivers.\n        The first of these had its headwaters on the Sikyonian border with Arkadia and Argos. It flowed north past the\n        towns of Phlios and Sikyon to empty into the Korinthian gulf.\n        The second river, which was probably believed to receive its waters from the first, arose on Mount Kithairon\n        (Cithaeron) on the other side of Gulf. This flowed east through southern Boiotia, into the Aegean Sea opposite\n        the island of Euboia. The most important neighbouring rivers of Sikyonian Asopos were the Inakhos (Inachus) of Argos to the south, Kephisos (Cephisus) of Attika to the east, and Elisson of Akhaia to the west. To the north of the Boiotian river lay the river\n        Ismenos of Thebes.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Apollodorus 3.156, Diodorus Siculus 4.72.1)\n        [2.1] ZEUS & EURYNOME\n        (Apollodorus 3.156)\n        [3.1] POSEIDON & PERO (Acusilaus Frag, Apollodorus\n          3.156)\n        [3.2] POSEIDON & KELOUSE (Pausanias 2.12.4)\n\n[1.1] ANTIOPE (Homer Odyssey 11.261)\n        [1.2] AIGINA (Pindar Paean 6, Antoninus\n          Liberalus 38, Hyginus Fab 52, Nonnus Dionysiaca 13.201)\n        [1.3] AIGINA, THEBE (Pindar Isthmian 8)\n        [1.3] THEBE (by Metope) (Pindar Olympian 6)\n        [1.4] AIGINA, EUBOIA, KORKYRA, PLATAIA, SALAMIS, SINOPE, TANAGRA, THEBE, THESPIA \n        (by Metope) (Corinna Frag 654)\n        [1.5] AIGINA, KLEONE, KORKYRA, PEIRENE, SINOPE, THEBE (Bacchylides Frag 9)\n        [1.6] ISMENOS, PELEGON, AIGINA, ISMENE, SALAMIS, 17 other\n        DAUGHTERS (by Metope) (Apollodorus 2.5,\n          3.156)\n        [1.7] AIGINA, OEROE, THEBE (Herodotus 5.80.1 &\n          9.51.1)\n        [1.8] AIGINA, HARPINA, KLEONE, KORKYRA, NEMEA, OEROE, PLATAIA, SALAMIS, TANAGRA, THEBE, THESPIA (Pausanias 1.35.2, 2.15.1, 2.29.2,\n          2.15.3, 2.5.1, 5.22.6, 9.1.1, 9.20.1, 9.26.6, 9.3.4)\n        [1.9] KORKYRA, SINOPE (Apollonius Rhodius 2.944, 4.567)\n        [1.10] ISMENOS, PELASGOS, AIGINA,\n        ASOPIS, HARPINE, KHALKIS,\n        KLEONE, KORKYRA,  ORNIA, PEIRENE, SALAMIS, SINOPE, TANAGRA, THEBE, THESPEIA (by Metope) (Diodorus Siculus 4.72.1)\n        [1.11] AIGINA, HYPSEUS (Statius Thebaid\n          7.315)\n        [2.1] Perhaps ANTHEDON, KLONIE, LANGIA, SYLLIS\n\nASO′PUS (Asôpos), the god of the river Asopus, was a son of Oceanus and Tethys, or according to\n        others, of Poseidon and Pero, of Zeus and Eurynome, or lastly of Poseidon and Cegluse. (Apollod. iii. 12. §\n        6; Paus. ii. 5. § 2, 12. § 5.) He was married to Metope, the daughter of the river god Ladon, by whom\n        he had two sons and twelve, or, according to others, twenty daughters. Their names differ in the various\n        accounts. (Apollod. l. c. ; Diod. iv. 72; Schol. ad Pind. Ol. vi. 144, Isthm. viii.\n        37; Paus. ix. 1. § 2; Herod. ix. 51; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 278.) Several of these daughters of\n        Asopus were carried off by gods, which is commonly believed to indicate the colonies established by the people\n        inhabiting the banks of the Asopus, who also transferred the name of Asopus to other rivers in the countries\n        where they settled. Aegina was one of the daughters of Asopus, and Pindar mentions a river of this name in\n        Aegina. (Nem. iii. 4, with the Schol.) In Greece there were two rivers of this name, the one in Achaia\n        in Peloponnesus, and the other in Boeotia, and the legends of the two are frequently confounded or mixed up with\n        each other. Hence arose the different accounts about the descent of Asopus, and the difference in the names of\n        his daughters. But as these names have, in most cases, reference to geographical circumstances, it is not\n        difficult to perceive to which of the two river gods this or that particular daughter originally belonged. The\n        more celebrated of the two is that of Peloponnesus. When Zeus had carried off his daughter Aegina, and Asopus\n        had searched after her everywhere, he was at last informed by Sisyphus of Corinth, that Zeus was the guilty\n        party. Asopus now revolted against Zeus, and wanted to fight with him, but Zeus struck him with his thunderbolt\n        and confined him to his original bed. Pieces of charcoal which were found in the bed of the river in later\n        times, were believed to have been produced by the lightning of Zeus. (Paus. ii. 5. § 1, &c.; Apollod.\n        iii. 12. § 6.) According to Pausanias (ii. 12. § 5) the Peloponnesian Asopus was a man who, in the\n        reign of Aras, discovered the river which was subsequently called by his name.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 72. 1 (trans.
