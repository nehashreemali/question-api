The most important neighbouring\n        rivers were the Kephisos (Cephisus) to the north, and Euenos (Evenus) to the west.\n\n[1.1] Perhaps NYMPHAI KORYKIAI (Aeschylus Eumenides 20)\n        [1.2] NYMPHAI KORYKIAI (Apollonius\n          Rhodius 2.710)\n\nAeschylus, Eumenides 20 ff (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        \"[The Pythia prophetess of the oracle at Delphoi invokes the gods :] ‘These are the gods I place in\n        the beginning of my prayer [Gaia, Themis, Phoibe and Apollon] . . . and I worship [also] the Nymphai (Nymphs)\n        where the Korykian (Corycian) rock is hollow, the delight of birds and haunt of gods.
