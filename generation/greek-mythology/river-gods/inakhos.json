  "content": "NAKHOS (Inachus) was a River-God of Argolis in the Peloponnesos, southern Greece. When the gods Poseidon and\n        Hera contested for dominion over Argos, Inakhos was appointed arbiter and decided in Hera's favour. In\n        retalation Poseidon dried up his stream.\n\nThe Inakhos River flowed south through western Argos, emptying into the Argolic Gulf between the towns of Argos\n        and Tiryns. Its stream ran dry in mid-summer. Three other Argive streams were personified:the stream Erasinos and two small tributaries of the Inakhos, the Asterion and Kephisos (Cephisus). The most\n        important neighbouring rivers were the Asopos in Sikyonia to the north, the Ladon of Arkadia to the west, and Eurotas of\n        Lakedaimonia to the south-west.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS (Apollodorus 2.1, Hyginus\n          Preface)\n\n[1.1] MYKENE (Great Eoiae Frag, Pausanias\n          2.16.4)\n        [2.1] PHORONEUS, AEGIALEUS (by Melia) (Apollodorus 2.1)\n        [2.2] IO (Aeschylus Prometheus Bound 589, Apollodorus\n          2.5, Callimachus Hymn 3.24, Nicaenetus Lyrcus Frag, Apollonius Rhodius Caunus Frag, Parthenius Love Romances\n          1, Pausanias 1.25.1, Herodotus 1.1.2, Diodorus Siculus 5.60.4, Aelian On Animals 11.10, Virgil Aeneid 7.791,\n          Ovid Metamorphoses 1.590, Ovid Heroides 14.105, Propertius 1.3 & 2.33A, Valerius Flaccus 4.345, Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 3.257 & 32.65, Suidas s.v.

By a\n        Melian nymph, a daughter of Oceanus, or, according to others, by his sister Argeia, he became the father of\n        Phoroneus and Aegialeus, to whom others add Io, Argos Panoptes, and Phegeus or Pegeus. (Apollod. ii. 1.\n        §§ 1, 3; Hygin. Fab. 143, 145; Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 177; Schol. ad Eurip. Or.\n        920, 1239; Ov. Met. i. 583, &c., 640, &c., Amor. iii. 6, 25; Serv. ad Virg.\n          Georg. iii. 153.) Inachus is the most ancient god or hero of Argos. The river Inachus is said to have\n        received its name from the fact of Inachus throwing himself into it, at the time when Zeus, enraged at the\n        reproaches which Inachus made on account of the treatment of Io, sent a fury to pursue him. (Plut. de\n          Fluv. 18.) The river had before borne the name of Carmanor or Haliacmon; and as Inachus was the first\n        ruler and priest at Argos, the country is frequently called the land of Inachus. (Eurip. Or. 932;\n        Dionys. i. 25; Hygin. Fab. 143.) In the dispute between Poseidon and Hera about the possession of\n        Argos, Inachus decided in favour of Hera, and hence it was said that Poseidon deprived him and the two other\n        judges, Asterion and Cephissus, of their water, so that they became dry except in rainy seasons. (Paus. ii. 15.\n        § 4, &c.; comp. Apollod. ii. 1. § 4.) The ancients themselves made several attempts to explain the\n        stories about Inachus: sometimes they looked upon him as a native of Argos, who after the flood of Deucalion led\n        the Argives from the mountains into the plains, and confined the waters within their proper channels; and\n        sometimes they regarded him as an immigrant who had come across the sea as the leader of an Egyptian or Libyan\n        colony, and had united the Pelasgians, whom he found scattered on the banks of the Inachus.

They decided that it belonged to Hera, and so Poseidon made their waters disappear. For this reason\n        neither Inakhos nor either of the other rivers I have mentioned provides any water except after rain. In summer\n        their streams are dry except those at Lerna.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 22. 4 :\n        \"Poseidon inundated the greater part of the country [of Argos] because Inakhos (Inachus) and his assessors\n        decided that the land belonged to Hera and not to him.

Zeus is inflamed by passion's dart for you and is eager\n        to unite with you in love. Do not, my child, spurn the bed of Zeus . . .’ By such dreams was I, to my\n        distress, beset night after night, until at last I gained courage to tell my father [Inakhos] of the dreams that\n        haunted me. And he sent many a messenger to Pytho and Dodona so that he might discover what deed or word of his\n        would find favor with the gods. But they returned with report of oracles, riddling, obscure, and darkly worded.\n        Then at last there came an unmistakable utterance to Inakhos, charging and commanding him clearly that he must\n        thrust me forth from home and native land to roam at large to the remotest confines of the earth; and, if he\n        would not, a fiery thunderbolt would come from Zeus that would utterly destroy his whole race. Yielding\n        obedience to such prophetic utterances of Loxias [Apollon], he [Inakhos] drove me away and barred me from his\n        house, against his will and mine; but the constraint of Zeus forced him to act by necessity. Immediately my form\n        and mind were distorted [i.e. she was transformed into a cow], and with horns, as you see, upon my\n        forehead.\"\n\nParthenius, Love Romances 1 (trans.

One of these was Lyrkos\n        (Lyrcus) the son of Phoroneus, who covered a vast deal of land and sea without finding the girl, and finally\n        renounced the toilsome quest: but he was too much afraid of Inakhos to return to Argos and went instead to\n        Kaunos (Caunus) [in Asia Minor].\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 60. 4 (trans.

And Kyrnos,\n        after having wandered over many of the inhabited parts of the world without being able to find her, put ashore\n        in Karia (Caria) on the Kherronesos (Chersonese) [and settled there].\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 1. 583 & 639 ff (trans.

He cannot tell whether\n        she lives or dwells among the shades, and finding her nowhere thinks she must be nowhere and fear feeds fear\n        when knowledge fails. Io returning from her father's stream had caught Juppiter's [Zeus'] eye . . . [Hera\n        interrupted their rendeavouz, and so Zeus disguised Io in the form of a cow.

Old Inachus picked grass and held it out; she licked her\n        father's hand, cow-kissed his palms; her tears rolled down; if only words would come, she'd speak her name, tell\n        all, implore their aid.

I, knowing naught, made ready for your marriage, hoped for a son-in-law and\n        grandchildren. But now the herd must find your husband, find your child. For me death cannot end my owes. Sad\n        bane to be a god! The gates of death are shut; my grief endures for evermore.’ As they thus grieved,\n        Argus, star-eyed, drove off daughter from father, hurrying her away to distant pastures.\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 4. 374 ff (trans.
