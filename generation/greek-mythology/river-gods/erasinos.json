  "content": "ERASINOS (Erasinus) was a river-god of Arkadia and Argos in the Peloponnese, southern Greece.\n\nThe Erasinos stream arose near Lake Stymphalos in Arkadia and flowed south through Argolis to empty into the\n        Argolic Gulf near the town of Lerna. The most important neighbouring river was the Inakhos (Inachus).\n\nBYZE, MELITE, MOIRA, ANKHIROE\n        (Antoninus Liberalis 40)\n\nAeschylus, Suppliant Women 1019 ff (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Lords of the city [of Argos] both those who guard the town and those who dwell about Erasinos' ancient\n        stream.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 24. 6 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[In Argolis :] On the right of the road a mountain called Khaon (Chaon). At its foot grow cultivated\n        trees, and here the water of the Erasinos rises to the surface. Up to this point it flows from Stymphalos in\n        Arkadia (Arcadia), . . . At the places where the Erasinos gushes forth from the mountain they sacrifice to\n        Dionysos and to Pan.\"\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 40 (trans. Celoria) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Britomartis] arrived in Argos from Phoinikia (Phoenicia), entering into the company of the daughters of\n        Erasinos (Erasinus), Byze, Melite, Maira (Maera), Ankhirhoe (Anchirhoe).\"\n\nAelian, Historical Miscellany 2. 33 (trans. Wilson) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to 3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The nature of rivers, and their streams, are visible to us. But men who honour them, and have statues made\n        of them, in some cases set up anthropomorphic statues, while others give them bovine form. A likeness to cattle\n        is attributed by the Stymphalians to Erasinos (Erasinus) and Metope.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 15. 275 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"So Erasinus' stream, engulfed to glide in secret eddies underground [i.e. from Arcadia], returns a lordly\n        river in the Argive fields.\" [Cf. Pausanias 2.24.6 above.]\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
