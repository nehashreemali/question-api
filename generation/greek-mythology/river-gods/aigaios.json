  "content": "AIGAIOS (Aegaeus) was a river-god of Skherie (Scheria), the mythical island home of the Phaiakes (Phaeacians).\n\nThe Phaiakian island was sometimes identified as Black Korkyra (Corcyra).\n\nMELITE, THE AIGAIIDES\n        (Argonautica 4.538 & 4.1141)\n\nHomer, Odyssey 5. 452 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"[After Odysseus' raft was destroyed in a storm, he was carried by the waves to the isle of the Phaiakes\n        (Phaeacians) :] And when in his swimming he [Odysseus] came abreast of a flowing river, where he thought the\n        ground best to land on, being clear of rocks and sheltered from winds besides, he hailed the outflowing stream\n        as a god and prayed to him in his heart thus : ‘Hear me, Lord, whosoever you may be. I find in you an\n        answer to all my prayers, as I seek a refuge from the sea and from the threatenings of Poseidon. Do not even the\n        Deathless Ones owe compassion to a mortal who comes to them as a wanderer and a suppliant? Such a man am I,\n        approaching your stream, approaching your knees, after much distress. Have pity upon me, Lord; a suppliant is\n        what I claim to be.’\n        So he prayed, and the god forthwith checked his stream and held back his waves; he stilled the waters before\n        Odysseus and brought him safe to the river's mouth.\" [N.B. This river is presumably the Aigaios.]\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 1141 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[At the wedding of Jason and Medea on the island of the Phaiakes (Phaeacians) :] Nymphai (Nymphs) gathered\n        flowers for them . . . Some of these Nymphai were daughters of the River Aigaios (Aegaeus).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
