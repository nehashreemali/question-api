The major neighbouring rivers were the Nestos to the east and Axios to the west. The small Brykhon stream\n        west of the Strymon was also personified.\n\n[1] OKEANOS & TETHYS (Hesiod Theogony 337, Hyginus\n          Preface)\n\n[1] RHESOS (by Euterpe or Kalliope) (Apollodorus 1.18)\n        [2] EUADNE (by Neaira)\n        (Apollodorus 2.3)\n        [3] TEREINE (Antoninus Liberalis\n          21)\n        [4] RHODOPE (Other references)\n\nSTRYMON (Strumôn),a son of Oceanus and Tethys, was a river god of Thrace, and is called a king of Thrace.\n        (Hes.
