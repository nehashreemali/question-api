  "content": "KAYSTROS (Cayster) was a river-god of Lydia in Anatolia (modern Turkey).\n\nThe River Kaystros had its headwaters on Mount Tmolos and flowed into the Aegean Sea near the town of Ephesos\n        on the Lydian border with Karia (Caria). The next major rivers were the Meles\n        and Hermos to the north, and Maiandros\n          (Meander) to the south.\n\nStrabo, Geography 14. 1. 44 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"And not far from Leimon [in Karia (Caria)] is . . . a hero-temple of Kaystros (Cayster) and a certain\n        Asios (Asius), and the Kaystros River that streams forth near by.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 7. 2. 8 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Ephesos (Ephesus), who is thought to have been a son of the river Kaystros (Cayster), and from Ephesos the\n        city received its name.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 11 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Swans scattered about, breathing sweet notes, will hymn the youth [i.e. Phaethon who was cast from the\n        chariot of the sun]; and flocks of swans rising aloft will sing the story to [the Rivers] Kaÿstros\n        (Cayster) and Istros (Ister); nor will any place fail to hear the strange story.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
