  "content": "HEBROS was a river-god of Kikonia (Ciconia) in eastern Thrake (modern day northern Greece, southern Bulgaria).\n\nThe River Hebros had its headwaters on Mount Rhodope in northern Thrake and emptied into the Aegean Sea near\n        the Greek colony of Ainos (Aenus) opposite the island of Samothrake. The closest neighbouring rivers personified\n        by the Greeks were the Istros (Ister) (Danube) to the north, and the Nestos to the west. The Ardeskos (modern-day\n        Maritsa), a tributary of the Hebros, was also personified.\n\n[1] RHODOPE (Lucian The Dance\n          51)\n        [2] Perhaps ABA\n\nAlcaeus, Fragment 45a (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric I) (C7th to 6th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Hebros (Hebrus), you flow, the most beautiful of rivers, past Ainos (Aenus) into the turbid sea, surging\n        throug the land of Thrake (Thrace) . . ((lacuna)) and many maidens visit you (to bathe) their (lovely) thighs\n        with tender hands; they are enchanted (as they handle) you marvellous water like unguent.\"\n\nAlcaeus, Fragment 45b (from Scholiast on Theocritus) :\n        \"Alkaios (Alcaeus) says that the Hebros (Hebrus) is the most beautiful of rivers and that it flows down\n        through Thrake from Mount Rhodope and disgorges its waters by the city of Ainos (Aenus).\"\n\nOvid, Heroides 2. 111 ff (trans. Showerman) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The broad, broad realms of Lycurgus . . . where stretches icy Rhodope to Haemus with its shades, and\n        sacred Hebrus drives his headlong waters forth.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
