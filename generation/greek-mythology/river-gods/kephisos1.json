  "content": "KEPHISOS (Cephisus) was a River-God of Phokis (Phocis) and northern Boiotia (Boeotia) in central Greece.\n\nThe Kephisos River had its headwaters on the northern slopes of Mount Parnassos (Parnassus) and the southern\n        foothills of the Mount Othrys. It flowed east through Phokis and Boiotia before emptying into Lake Kopais\n        (Copais) near the town of Orkhomenos (Orchomenus).\n        The most important neighbouring rivers of Boiotian Kephisos were the Sperkheios\n          (Spercheus) of Malis to the north, the Pleistos of Phokis to the south,\n        and the Ismenos of central Boiotia to the south-east.\n\nIt is possible that this River-God also presided over the two Kephisos\n        streams of Attika. The river may have been thought to travel underground from Lake Kopais, rising again in the\n        mountains of Kithairon (Cithaeron) and Parnes to form the two Athenian rivers of the same name.\n        A fourth river named Kephisos, located in Argos, vanished into a cleft in\n        the earth. It may have been imagined as the source of the Phokian river--reemerging in Phokis after travelling\n        north through subterranean channels.\n\n[1.1] ETEOKLOS (Hesiod Catalogues Frag 26, Pausanias 9.34.9)\n        [2.1] THE KEPHISIDES (Corinna Frag\n          655)\n        [3.1] LILAIA, DAULIS, MELAINE (Pausanias 10.32.4, 10.4.7,\n          10.6.4)\n        [4.1] KASTALIA (Alcaeus Frag, Pausanias\n          10.8.9)\n        [5.1] THYIA (Herodotus 7.178)\n        [6.1] NARKISSOS (by Liriope)\n        (Ovid Metamorphoses 3.342)\n        [6.2] NARKISSOS (Hyginus Fabulae 271, Statius\n          Thebaid 7.340)\n        [7.1] Perhaps THE NYMPHAI KYRONIAI, THE NYMPHAI KORYKIAI, MELIA, ARGIOPE, KLEODORA, KORYKIA, MIDEIA\n\nCEPHISSUS (Kêphissos), the divinity of the river Cephissus, is described as a son of Pontus and Thalassa,\n        and the father of Diogeneia and Narcissus, who is therefore called (Cephisius.
