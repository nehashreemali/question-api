  "content": "EUENOS (Evenus) was a river-god of eastern Aitolia (Aetolia), in central Greece. The Aitolian prince Euenos\n        threw himself into the river after failing to recover his abducted daughter Marpessa from the hero Idas.\n        According to some he was then transformed into the god of the river. Others say the river, formerly known as the\n        Lykormas, was simply renamed Euenos in his honour.\n\nThe Euenos River had its headwaters in the Pindus mountain range. It flowed south through Aitolia, emptying\n        into the Gulf near the town of Kalydon (Calydon). The most important neighbouring rivers were the Akheloios (Achelous) to the west, and Pleistos in the east.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Hesiod Theogony 337)\n        [2.1] ARES & DEMODIKE (Apollodorus\n          1.60)\n        [2.2] ARES & STEROPE (Plutarch\n          Parallel Stories 40)\n\n[1.1] MARPESSA (Homer Iliad 9.556, Apollodorus 1.60, Propertius Elegies 1.2)\n        [1.2] MARPESSA (by Alkippe) (Plutarch Parallel Stories 40)\n\nHomer, Iliad 9. 556 ff (trans.

The father Euenos pursued him in his own chariot, but, when he had not overtaken him by\n        the time he reached the Lykormas (Lycormas) river, he slew his horses and threw himself into the river, which is\n        now called the Euenos after him.\"\n\nPseudo-Plutarch, Greek and Roman Parallel Stories 40 (trans.
