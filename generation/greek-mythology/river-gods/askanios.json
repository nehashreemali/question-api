  "content": "ASKANIOS (Ascanius) was a river- and lake-god of western Bithynia in Anatolia (modern Turkey). His Naiad-nymphe\n        daughters abducted the youth Hylas when he came to the stream to fetch water.\n\nThe Askanios River flowed from the lake of the same name in Eastern Bithynia emptying into the Propontis Sea\n        near the town of Kios (Cius). The most important neighbouring rivers were the Rhyndakos (Rhyndacus) and the Aisepos (Aesepus) in the west, the Phyllis to\n        the north, and mighty Saggarios (Sangarius) in the east.\n\n[1] THE NAIADES MYSIAI (Antoninus\n          Liberalis 26)\n        [2] Perhaps MELIA\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 26 (trans.

They dropped anchors and let the ship ride . . . The boy Hylas\n        went carrying a pail to the River Askanios (Ascanius) to fetch water for the leaders. And when the Nymphai\n        (Nymphs), who were the daughters of this River, saw and fell in love with him, they pulled him in.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 14 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"In Moesia near [the town of] Cios and the river Ascanius Hylas was snatched away by Nymphae\n        (Nymphs).\" [Cf. Antoninus Liberalis above.]\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
