  "content": "ALPHEIOS (Alpheus) was a River-God of Elis and Arkadia (Arcadia) in the Peloponnesos, southern Greece. He fell\n        in love with the nymph Arethousa (Arethusa) who fled his advances and leapt into the sea. Alpheios pursued her\n        across the sea to the island of Syrakousa (Syracuse) in Sicily where the spring of Arethousa burst forth from\n        the ground.\n\nThe River Alpheios had its headwaters in the south-eastern corner of Arkadia, flowing the length of the country\n        east into Elis, past Olympia where it emptied into the Ionian sea. Several of its tributories were also\n        personified as river-gods namely Ladon, Erymanthos, Kladeos (Cladeus) and Kytheros (Cytherus). Another personified Eleian river was the small Anigros to the south.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Hesiod Theogony 337, Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] ORTILOKHOS (Homer Iliad 5.541)\n          [1.2] ORTILOKHOS (by Telegone) (Pausanias 4.30.2)\n          [2.1] PHEGEOS (Hyginus Fabulae 244)\n          [3.1] Perhaps DANAIS, MYRTOESSA\n\nALPHEIUS or A′LPHEUS (Alpheios or Alpheos), the god of the river Alpheius in Peloponnesus, a son of\n        Oceanus and Thetys. (Pind. Nem. i. l; Hes. Theog. 338.) According to Pausanias (v. 7. §\n        2) Alpheius was a passionate hunter and fell in love with the nymph Arethusa, but she fled from him to the\n        island of Ortygia near Syracuse, and metamorphosed herself into a well, whereupon Alpheius became a river, which\n        flowing from Peloponnesus under the sea to Ortygia, there united its waters with those of the well Arethusa.\n        (Comp. Schol. ad Pind. Nem. i. 3.) This story is related somewhat differently by Ovid. (Met.\n        v. 572, &c.) Arethusa, a fair nymph, once while bathing in the river Alpheius in Arcadia, was surprised and\n        pursued by the god; but Artemis took pity upon her and changed her into a well, which flowed under the earth to\n        the island of Ortygia. (Comp. Serv. ad Virg. Ecl. x. 4; Virg. Aen. iii. 694; Stat.\n        Silv. i. 2, 203; Theb. i. 271, iv. 239; Lucian, Dial. Marin. 3.) Artemis, who is here\n        only mentioned incidentally, was, according to other traditions, the object of the love of Alpheius. Once, it is\n        said, when pursued by him she fled to Letrini in Elis, and here she covered her face and those of her companions\n        (nymphs) with mud, so that Alpheius could not discover or distinguish her, and was obliged to return. (Paus. vi.\n        22. § 5.) This occasioned the building of a temple of Artemis Alphaea at Letrini. According to another\n        version, the goddess fled to Ortygia, where she had likewise a temple under the name of Alphaea. (Schol. ad\n          Pind. Pyth. ii. 12.) An allusion to Alpheius' love of Artemis is also contained in the fact, that at\n        Olympia the two divinities had one altar in common. (Paus. v. 14. § 5 ; Schol. ad Pind. Ol. v.\n        10.) In these accounts two or more distinct stories seem to be mixed up together, but they probably originated\n        in the popular belief, that there was a natural subterraneous communication between the river Alpheius and the\n        well Arethusa. For, among several other things it was believed, that a cup thrown into the Alpheius would make\n        its reappearance in the well Arethusa in Ortygia. (Strab. vi. p. 270, viii. p. 343; Senec. Quaest. Nat.\n        iii. 26; Fulgent. Myth. iii. 12.) Plutarch (de Fluv. 19) gives an account which is altogether\n        unconnected with those mentioned above. According to him, Alpheius was a son of Helios, and killed his brother\n        Cercaphus in a contest. Haunted by despair and the Erinnyes he leapt into the river Nyctimus which hence\n        received the name Alpheius.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 337 ff (trans.

But Artemis had a suspicion of the plot of Alpheios, and smeared with mud her own face and the\n        faces of the Nymphai with her. So Alpheios, when he joined the throng, could not distinguish Artemis from the\n        others, and, not being able to pick her out, went away without bringing off his attempt.

Pindar equates Artemis with Arethousa. The Arethousan spring was sacred to the goddess.]\n\nStrabo, Geography 6. 2. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Island of Ortygia [near Syrakousa (Syracuse), Sikelia (Sicily)] . . . has the fountain of Arethousa\n        (Arethusa), which sends forth a river that empties immediately into the sea. People tell the mythical story that\n        the river Arethousa is the Alpheios (Alpheus), which latter, they say, rises in the Peloponnesos, flows\n        underground through the sea as far as Arethousa, and then empties thence once more into the sea. And the kind of\n        evidence they adduce is as follows : a certain cup, they think, was thrown out into the river at Olympia and was\n        discharged into the fountain; and again, the fountain was discolored as the result of the sacrifices of oxen at\n        Olympia. Pindaros (Pindar) follows these reports when he says : ‘O resting-place august of Alpheios,\n        Ortygia, scion of famous Syrakouse.’ And in agreement with Pindaros Timaios (Timaeus) the historian also\n        declares the same thing.\n        Now if the Alpheios fell into a pit before joining the sea, there would be some plausibility in the view that\n        the stream extends underground from Olympia as far as Sikelia (Sicily), thereby preserving its potable water\n        unmixed with the sea; but since the mouth of the river empties into the sea in full view, and since near this\n        mouth, on the transit, there is no mouth visible that swallows up the stream of the river--though even so the\n        water could not remain fresh; yet it might, the greater part of it at least, if it sank into the underground\n        channel--, the thing is absolutely impossible. For the water of Arethousa bears testimony against it, since it\n        is potable; and that the stream of the river should hold together through so long a transit without being\n        diffused with the seawater, that is, until it falls into the fancied underground passage, is utterly\n        mythical.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 7. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"They say that there was a hunter called Alpheios (Alpheus), who fell in love with Arethousa (Arethusa),\n        who was herself a huntress, Arethousa, unwilling to marry, crossed, they say, to the island opposite Syrakousa\n        (Syracuse) called Ortygia, and there turned from a woman to a spring. Alpheios too was changed by his love into\n        the river . . . But that the Alpheios passes through the sea and mingles his waters with the spring at this\n        place I cannot disbelieve, as I know that the god at Delphoi (Delphi) confirms the story. For when he despatched\n        Arkhias (Archias) the Korinthian to found Syrakousa he uttered this oracle : ‘An isle, Ortygia, lies on\n        the misty sea over against Trinakria (Trinacria), where the mouth of the Alpheios bubbles mingling with the\n        springs of broad Arethousa.’\n        For this reason, therefore, because the water of the Alpheios mingles with the Arethousa, I am convinced that\n        the legend arose of the river's love-affair.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 6 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The land [at Olympia] furnishes a stadium in a simple glen of sufficient extent, from which issues the\n        stream of the Alpheios (Alpheus), a light stream--that, you know, is why it alone of rivers flows on top of the\n        sea.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 5. 572 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Ceres-Demeter] enquired of Arethusa the reason of her flight and why she was a sacred spring. The waters\n        of her pool fell silent; from the depths their goddess raised her head and, combing her green tresses dry, told\n        the old story of the Eleian River's [Alpheus'] love.\n        ‘One of the Nymphae (Nymphs) whose home is in Achais [Greece] I used to be, and none more keen than I to\n        roam the glades, more keen to place the nets. Though I was strong and brave and never sought beauty's renown,\n        yet I was known for beauty, nor did its praise--too praised--once profit me. That dower of beauty, other girls'\n        delight, brought but a bumpkin's blushes to my cheeks and in my thoughts it seemed a crime to please. I was\n        returning tired, I well remember, from hunting in the woods; the heat was great and doubled my toil. I found a\n        stream that glided with no eddy, with no sound, clear to the bottom, each pebble in its depths easy to count; it\n        hardly seemed to move. Poplars fed by the stream and silvery willows gave to the shelving banks a natural shade.\n        I reached the water's edge and dipped my feet; then to my knees, and not content with that took off my light\n        soft clothes and laid them by on a curved willow branch and, naked, dropped into the water, plunging to and fro\n        in countless twists and turns; and as I flung my arms and gaily gambolled there, I heard, deep in the stream, a\n        strange rough rumbling sound, and leapt in terror on the nearer bank. \"Wither so fast?\" It was\n        Alpheus' voice, calling me from his waters. \"Wither so fast, fair Arethusa?\" his harsh voice called\n        again. I fled, just as I was, unclothed--my clothes there on the other bank. He chased the hotter; I seemed the\n        readier in my nakedness. As doves on fluttering wings flee from a hawk, and as a hawk pursues a fluttering dove,\n        so did I run, so fiercely he gave chase. On past Orchomenos, past Elis' towers and Psophis and Cyllene and the\n        combes of Maenalus and icy Erymanthus I held my flight, nor did he gain on me; until, my strength outmatched,\n        the pace was more than I could long endure, and he still fresh. Yet on through moors and tree-clad\n        mountainsides, over crags and cliffs and trackless wastes I ran. The sun was at our backs : I saw in front--or\n        it was fear that saw--a giant shadow. For sure I heard his frightful footfalls, fled his panting breath upon my\n        braided hair. Exhausted, \"Save me! Save thy hunting-nymphe Diana [Artemis].\" I cried, \"to whom so\n        oft thou gavest thy bow to bear, they arrows and thy quiver!\" The goddess heard and, choosing a thick\n        cloud, draped it about me; and the Amnis (River), baulked, circled me wrapped in darkness, quested round the\n        hollow cloud, stood twice, at fault, beside my hiding-place and twice called \"Arethusa! Hey,\n        Arethusa!\"\n        ‘Oh poor wretched me! What heart had I! Was I not like a lamb that hears the wolves howling around the\n        fold, or like a hare that, hiding in the brake, sees the hounds' deadly jaws and dares not stir? Alpheus waited;\n        at that place he saw my footprints stop; he watched the clouds, the place. Trapped and besieged! A cold and\n        drenching sweat broke out and rivulets of silvery drops poured from my body; where I moved my foot, a trickle\n        spread; a stream fell from my hair; and sooner than I now can tell the tale I turned to water. But the Amnis\n        (River) knew that water, knew his love, and changed again, his human form discarding, and resumed his watery\n        self to join his stream with me. Delia [Artemis] cleft the earth. I, sinking down, borne through blind caverns\n        reached Ortygia [i.e. the island of the town of Syrakousa (Syracuse)], that bears my goddess' name, the isle I\n        love, that first restored me to the air above.’\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 3. 694 ff (trans.

Not far from it stands another altar of Alpheios.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 24. 7 :\n        \"[At Olympia] they have dedicated images of Pelops and of the river Alpheios (Alpheus) respectively.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 20. 2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Leukippos (Leucippus) [mythical Eleian hero] was growing his hair long for the river Alpheios\n        (Alpheus).\"\n        [N.B.

Wilson) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to 3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The nature of rivers, and their streams, are visible to us. But men who honour them, and have statues made\n        of them, in some cases set up anthropomorphic statues, while others give them bovine form . . . The form of a\n        man is adopted by the Psophidians for the Erymanthos (Erymanthus), and by the Heraians (Heraeans) for the\n        Alpheios (Alpheus); the Kherronesians from Knidos (Cnidus) treat the same river in the same way.\"\n        [N.B.
