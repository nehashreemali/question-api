  "content": "MAIANDROS (Maeander) was a river-god of Karia (Caria) in Anatolia (modern Turkey).\n\nThe River Maiandros had its headwaters the highlands of southern Phrygia and, flowing west through Karia,\n        entered the Aegean Sea opposite the town of Miletos (Miletus). The major neighbouring rivers were the Kaystros (Cayster) to the north and the Indos\n        to the south.\n\n[1] OKEANOS & TETHYS (Hesiod Theogony 339, Hyginus\n          Preface)\n\n[1] SAMIA (Pausanias 7.4.1)\n        [2] KYANEE (Ovid Metamorphoses 9.446, Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 11.449)\n        [3] KALAMOS (Nonnus Dionysiaca 11.379)\n        [4] Perhaps SALMAKIS, THE\n          NYMPHAI KARIAI , THE MYKALESSIDES\n\nMAEANDRUS (Maiandros), a son of Oceanus and Tethys, and the god of the winding river Maeander in Phrygia.
