  "content": "SAGGARIOS (Sangarius) was a river-god of Phrygia and central Bithynia in Anatolia (modern Turkey).\n\nThe Sangarios was the largest and most important river of central Phrygia, rising in the Phrygian highlands it\n        flowed north across the plateau to central Bithynia where it empited into the Black Sea. The most important\n        neighbouring rivers were the Askanios (Ascanius) to the west, Phyllis to the north and Nymphaios to the\n        east.\n\n[1] HEKABE (by Metope) (Apollodorus 3.148)\n        [2] NANA (Pausanias 7.17.8)\n        [3] OKYRHOE (Quintus Smyrnaeus\n          11.37)\n        [4] NIKAIA, ALKE (by Kybele)\n        (Nonnus Dionysiaca 15.16)\n        [5] SAGARITIS (Ovid Fasti\n          4.222)\n        [6] Perhaps THE ASTAKIDES, MELIA\n\nSANGA′RIUS (Sangarios), a river-god, is described as the son of Oceanus and Tethys, and as the husband of\n        Metope, by whom he became the father of Hecabe. (Hes. Theog. 344 ; Apollod. iii. 12. § 5.) The\n        river Sangarius (in Phrygia) itself is said to have derived its name from one Sangas, who had offended Rhea, and\n        was punished by her by being changed into water.
