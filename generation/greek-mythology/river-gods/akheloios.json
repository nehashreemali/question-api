  "content": "AKHELOIOS (Achelous) was a River-God of Aitolia (Aetolia) in central Greece. As the deity of the largest river\n        in the region he was often portrayed as the god of fresh-water in general.\n\nAkheloios competed with Herakles for the hand of the Aitolian princess Deianeira. During their wrestling match\n        the hero tore off one of the god's horns forming the legendary Cornucopia or Horn of Plenty.\n\nThe river-god was depicted in one of four forms. In ancient Greek vase painting he appears as a man-headed\n        bull, a bull-shaped centaur, and a \"merman\" with a coiling fish-tail in place of a lower torso and\n        legs. In each case his head was crowned with a horn. In mosaic art he was portrayed as a reclining man with an\n        arm resting upon a pitcher of flowing water.\n\nThe Akheloios river rises in the Pindar mountain range, flows south through the heart of Aitolia and Akarnania\n        (Acarnania), to empty into the Ionian Sea near the mouth of the Gulf of Korinthos (Corinth). The most\n        significant neighbouring river is the Euenos (Evenus) to the east.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Theogony 337; Hyginus Pref)\n        [1.2] OKEANOS & GAIA (Greek Lyric I Alcaeus Frag 450)\n\n[1.1] THE SEIRENES (by Melpomene) (Apollodorus 1.18, 1.63,\n          Lycophron 712, Hyginus Fabulae 141)\n        [1.2] THE SEIRENES (by Sterope) (Apollodorus\n          1.63)\n        [1.3] THE SEIRENES (by Terpsikhore) (Argonautica 4.892,\n          Dionysiaca 13.313)\n        [1.4]  THE SEIRENES (Pausanias 9.34.3,\n          Metamorphoses 14.85)\n        [2.1] KALLIRHOE (Apollodorus 3.88,\n          Pausanias 8.24.9)\n        [3.1] HIPPODAMOS, ORESTES (by Perimede) (Apollodorus 1.52)\n        [4.1] KASTALIA (Panyassis Frag, Pausanias\n          10.8.9)\n        [5.1] PEIRENE (Pausanias 2.2.2)\n        [6.1] THE AKHELOIDES (Metamorphoses\n          8.547)\n\nACHELO′US (Achelôios), the god of the river Achelous which was the greatest, and according to\n        tradition, the most ancient among the rivers of Greece. He with 3000 brother-rivers is described as a son of\n        Oceanus and Thetys (Hes. Theog. 340), or of Oceanus and Gaea, or lastly of Helios and Gaea. (Natal.\n        Com. vii. 2.) The origin of the river Achelous is thus described by Servius (ad Virg. Georg. i. 9;\n        Aen. viii. 300): When Achelous on one occasion had lost his daughters, the Sirens, and in his grief\n        invoked his mother Gaea, she received him to her bosom, and on the spot where she received him, she caused the\n        river bearing his name to gush forth. Other accounts about the origin of the river and its name are given by\n        Stephanus of Byzantium, Strabo (x. p. 450), and Plutarch. (De Flum. 22.) Achelous the god was a\n        competitor with Heracles in the suit for Deïaneira, and fought with him for the bride. Achelous was\n        conquered in the contest, but as he possessed the power of assuming various forms, he metamorphosed himself\n        first into a serpent and then into a bull. But in this form too he was conquered by Heracles, and deprived of\n        one of his horns, which however he recovered by giving up the horn of Amalthea. (Ov. Met. ix. 8,\n        &c.; Apollod. i. 8. § 1, ii. 7. § 5.) Sophocles (Trachin. 9, &c.) makes\n        Deïaneira relate these occurrences in a somewhat different manner. According to Ovid (Met. ix.\n        87), the Naiads changed the horn which Heracles took from Achelous into the horn of plenty. When Theseus\n        returned home from the Calydonian chase he was invited and hospitably received by Achelous, who related to him\n        in what manner he had created the islands called Echinades. (Ov. Met. viii. 547, &c.) The numerous\n        wives and descendants of Achelous are spoken of in separate articles. Strabo (x. p. 458) proposes a very\n        ingenious interpretation of the legends about Achelous, all of which according to him arose from the nature of\n        the river itself. It resembled a bull's voice in the noise of the water; its windings and its reaches gave rise\n        to the story about his forming himself into a serpent and about his horns; the formation of islands at the mouth\n        of the river requires no explanation. His conquest by Heracles lastly refers to the embankments by which\n        Heracles confined the river to its bed and thus gained large tracts of land for cultivation, which are expressed\n        by the horn of plenty. (Compare Voss, Mytholog. Briefe, lxxii.) Others derive the legends about\n        Achelous from Egypt, and describe him as a second Nilus. But however this may be, he was from the earliest times\n        considered to be a great divinity throughout Greece (Hom. Il. xxi. 194), and was invoked in prayers,\n        sacrifices, on taking oaths, &c. (Ephorus ap. Macrob. v. 18), and the Dodonean Zeus usually added\n        to each oracle he gave, the command to offer sacrifices to Achelous. (Ephorus, l. c.) This wide extent\n        of the worship of Achelous also accounts for his being regarded as the representative of sweet water in general,\n        that is, as the source of all nourishment. (Virg. Georg. i. 9, with the note of Voss.) The contest of\n        Achelous with Heracles was represented on the throne of Amyclae (Paus. iii. 18. § 9), and in the treasury\n        of the Megarians at Olympia there was a statue of him made by Dontas of cedar-wood and gold. (Paus. vi. 19.\n        § 9.) On several coins of Acarnania the god is represented as a bull with the head of an old man. (Comp.\n        Philostr.

For you are to\n        recognize the figure in the painting as Oineos, despondent on account of his daughter Deianeira, who looks so\n        dolefully at her suitor.

But why spend time on tales of others? I\n        myself, young friends, also possess the power of changing, though my choice is limited. At times you see me as I\n        am; at times I twist into a snake; at times a bull that leads the herd, my strength set in my horns.\n        Horns!--while I could!--but now one side, you see, has lost its weapon.’\n        And he gave a groan. Why the god groaned and how his brow was maimed Neptunius [Theseus son of Poseidon]\n        enquired, and great River of Calydon (Amnis Calydonius), his tangled tresses bound with reeds, began :\n        ‘Sad is the task you set. For who would wish to chronicle the battles that he lost? Yet the whole tale\n        I'll tell. It was less shame to lose than glory to have fought the fight: much comfort comes from such a\n        conqueror. You may perhaps have heard of Deianira, once a most lovely girl, the envied hope of many a suitor. I\n        was one of them and entered the king's palace hopefully and \"Sire, son of Parthaon [i.e. Oeneus],\" I\n        said, \"I crave your daughter's hand.\" So, too, said Alcides [Heracles]. The others all gave way to us,\n        us two. He told his tale how Jove [Zeus] would be her father-in-law, the fame of his great labours, the\n        accomplishment of Juno's [Hera's] orders. I, opposing, said, \"Disgrace it is if gods give way to men.\"\n        (He was not yet a god.) \"In me you see the master of the waters that descend in winding courses through\n        your royal realm; no stranger son-in-law from foreign shores, but one of your own folk, your own affairs. Let it\n        not damage me that royal Juno [Hera] does not detest me, that no toils imposed have ever punished me! You,\n        Alcmena's son [Heracles], who claim your father's Juppiter--that tale's untrue, or true to your disgrace: a\n        father through your mother's sin. So choose which you prefer, either that fatherhood is false or you were born\n        in infamy.\" While I was speaking, all the time, he scowled, and, failing to control his flaring rage, gave\n        me his curt reply : \"This hand of mine is better than my tongue. Win, if you may, with words, provided I\n        prevail in deeds!\"\n        ‘And on he rushed in fury. My fine words made me ashamed to flinch. I threw aside my green cloak, raised\n        my arms and poised my hands half-curled before my chest and stood to fight. He scooped up dust and threw it over\n        me, and he was yellowed too with my golden sand. Now at my neck, now at my twinkling legs he lunged (or\n        feinted), pressing his attack at every point. My weight protected me; I stood unscathed, like a huge rock that\n        waves beat with a roaring crash, and there it stands fast in the safety of its mighty mass. We drew apart a\n        little, then again joined battle, standing rooted, both resolved never to yield an inch. Foot locked with foot,\n        fingers with fingers, brow to brow, I pressed him down half-prone; as I've seen battling bulls collide in\n        contest for the sleekest cow of all the countryside; the herd looks on in fear and awe not knowing which of them\n        the victory and the sovereignty await. Three times with no success did Alcides [Heracles] struggle and strain to\n        break my lock; the fourth shook off my hold and loosed my clinching arms, and, striking with his fist (I mean to\n        tell the truth) he whirled me round and clung with all his weight upon my back If you'd believe (I seek no fame\n        from fiction), crushing me I seemed to have a mountain. Even so I managed to insert my sweating arms, I managed\n        to dislodge his iron grip. He charged as I stood breathless, gave me no chance to recover, and got me round my\n        neck. At last, forced to my knees, I bit the sand. Outmatched, out'man'ned, I used that art of mine : changed to\n        a long smooth snake I slid from him. In circling sinuous coils I wound myself and flickering my forked tongue\n        hissed horribly. Tirynthius [Heracles] laughed and mocked my magic. \"Mastering Dracones (Dragon-Serpents)\n        is child's play, Achelous! Yes, if you were champion serpent, how could you compare with Echidna Lernaea [i.e.\n        the Hydra], you a single snake? It throve on wounds: of all its hundred heads I cut off one but from its neck\n        two more sprang to succeed it, stronger than before! Yes, though it branched with serpents sprung from death,\n        and multiplied on doom, I mastered it, and, mastered, I dispatched it. What's in store for you, d'you think, no\n        proper snake at all, no weapons of your own, just skulking in a shape you've begged and borrowed?\"\n        ‘As he spoke, he locked his fingers round my neck; I felt my windpipe in a vice; in agony I fought to free\n        my gullet from his thumbs. Vanquished again, my third shape still remained, a savage bull. A bull! And I fought\n        back! On my left side he threw his arms around my bulging neck and, as I raced along, kept pace and dragged me\n        down and forced my horns right into the hard ground and laid me low in the deep sand. Even that was not enough :\n        he grasped my strong stiff horn in his fierce hand, broke it, and wrenched it off--my brow was maimed! My Naides\n        (Naiads) filled it full of fragrant flowers and fruits, and hallowed it. From my honour now Bona Copia (Good\n        Plenty) finds her wealth and riches flow.’\n        His tale was done. One of the serving Nympha, dressed in Diana's [Artemis'] simple style, her hair flowing on\n        either side, came bearing in the horn with all its wealth, all autumn there, fruits in perfection for our second\n        course. Dawn came, and, when the sun's first rising beams struck on the peaks, the young men went their way, not\n        waiting till the Flumina (River) had regained its peace and placid flow and all the flood had fallen. Achelous\n        hid his face, his rustic face, and head with missing horn beneath his waters. Humbled though he was to lose that\n        elegance, all else was sound, and he concealed his loss with willow leaves or reeds and rushes worn upon his\n        head.\"\n\nOvid, Heroides 9. 137 ff (trans. Showerman) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Deianeira writes a letter to Heracles :] Twice you have fought for the sake of men. In tears Achelous\n        gathered up his horns on the wet banks of his stream, and bathed in its clayey tide his mutilated brow; [and]\n        the half-man Nessus sank down in lotus-bearing Euenus.\"\n\nOvid, Heroides 16. 263 ff :\n        \"Ah, might the gods make you the prize in a mighty contest, and let the victor have you for his couch! . .\n        . as fierce Hercules broke the horns of Achelous while aspiring to thy embraces, Deianira.\"\n\nPropertius, Elegies 2. 34 (trans. Goold) (Roman elegy C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The course of Aetolian Achelous, its waters flowed shattered by the power of love.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 4. 106 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"The River [Akheloos (Achelous)] whose face the athlete Hercules did mar : even yet scarce dares he raise\n        his stricken visage from the water's depth, but mourns with head sunk far below in his green cave, while the\n        river-banks pant and sicken with dust.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 17. 238 ff (trans.

Five lie there, but distance blurs\n        their difference. What great Diana [Artemis] did when she was scorned need not surprise you. These five islands\n        once were Nymphae (Nymphs). Ten bullocks they had sacrificed and called the rustic gods to share the rite with\n        festal dance, but me they forgot. I swelled in anger, high as when my flood flows at its highest, merciless\n        alike in rage and waters. Fields I tore from fields, forests from forests, and the Nymphae, at last mindful of\n        me, with the ground beneath their feet I rolled right out to sea.

She was my loved one and to me she lost her\n        maidenhead. Hippodamas, her father, in outrage hurled his daughter to her doom from a high cliff.

How delightful is the breeze :--so very sweet; and there is a sound in the air shrill and summerlike\n        which makes answer to the chorus of the cicadae. But the greatest charm of all is the grass, like a pillow\n        gently sloping to the head.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 34. 3 (trans.
