  "content": "KAIKOS (Caicus) was a river-god of Teuthrania in southern Mysia, Anatolia (modern Turkey).\n\nThe headwaters of the River Kaikos were located in the Temnos Mountains and it entered the Aegean Sea near the\n        town of Pitane on the Mysian border with Lydia. The most important neighbouring rivers were the Satnioeis to the north-west and Hermos to\n        the south.\n\nCAICUS (Kaïkos), two mythical personages, one a son of Oceanus and Tethys (Hesiod, Theog. 343),\n        and the other a son of Hermes and Ocyrrhoë, who threw himself into the river Astraeus, henceforth called\n        Caicus.
