  "content": "In the ancient Greek cosmogony the RIVER OKEANOS (Oceanus) was a great, fresh-water stream which encircled the\n        flat disc of the earth. It was the source of all of the earth's fresh-water--from the rivers and springs which\n        drew their waters from it through subterranean aquifers to the clouds which dipped below the horizon to collect\n        their moisture from its stream.\n\nOkeanos also marked the outer boundary of the flat earth which it surrounded with a \"nine-fold\"\n        stream. The sun, moon, and stars rose all from and set into its waters. At night the sun-god would sail around\n        its northern reach in a golden boat to reach his rising place in the east from his setting in the west. In a\n        cosmological sense the river symbolised the eternal flow of time.\n\nBeyond Okeanos lay a dark and misty shore--the farthest edge of the cosmos--a place where the great sky-dome\n        rested its hard edge upon the flat earth and where, from below, the walls of the great pit of Tartaros rose up\n        to meet the earth and sky. Together the sky dome and Tartarean pit formed a great sphere--or egg-shaped\n        ovoid--which enclosed the entire cosmos. Within it was divided into two equal hemispheres by the flat earth. The\n        world above was the home of gods and men, the world below of the Titanes. Haides, the realm of the dead, was\n        often located on the outer rim of the earth, on the gloomy far shore of Okeanos beyond the setting sun.\n\nThe native gods of the River Okeanos were the Titan Okeanos, his wife\n        Tethys and their daughters, the three thousand Okeanides. The gods of day and night--Helius the Sun, Eos the Dawn and\n        Selene the Moon--also possessed palaces on islands in the stream.\n\nThe River Okeanos (Oceanus) flowed in a circle around the entire earth. From its stream the rivers and clouds\n        drew their waters. Most rivers drew their waters from it through subterranean aquifers but a few--such as the\n        underworld Styx, the river Eridanos of Hyperborea and Nile of Aithiopia--flowed directly from the stream.\n\nHomer, Iliad 18. 399 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"Okeanos (Oceanus), whose stream bends back in a circle.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 21. 194 ff : \n        \"The enormous strength of Okeanos (Oceanus) with his deep-running waters, Okeanos, from whom all rivers are\n        and the entire sea and all springs and all deep wells have their waters of him.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 337 ff (trans.
