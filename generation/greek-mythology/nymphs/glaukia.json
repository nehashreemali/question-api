  "content": "GLAUKIA (Glaucia) was a Naiad-nymph of the river Skamandors (Scamander) in the Troad (north-western Anatolia).\n        She was loved by the hero Deimakhos (Deimachus), a companion of Herakles in his campaign against the Trojans.\n\nSKAMANDROS (by Deimakhos) (Plutarch Greek Questions 41)\n\nGLAU′CIA (Glaukia), a daughter of the river-god Scamander. When Heracles went to war against Troy,\n        Deimachus, a Boeotian, one of the companions of Heracles, fell in love with Glaucia. But Deimachus was slain in\n        battle before Glaucia had given birth to the child she had by him. She fled for refuge to Heracles, who took her\n        with him to Greece, and entrusted her to the care of Cleon, the father of Deimachus. She there gave birth to a\n        son, whom she called Scamander, and who afterwards obtained a tract of land in Boeotia, traversed by two\n        streams, one of which he called Scamander and the other Glaucia. He was married to Acidusa, from whom the\n        Boeotian well, Acidusa, derived its name, and had three daughters, who were worshipped under the name of\n        \"the three maidens.\" (Plut. Quaest. Gr. 41).\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Plutarch Greek Questions 41.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
