  "content": "HIEROMNEME was the Naiad-nymph of a spring of the River Simoeis on Mount Ida in the Troad (north-western\n        Anatolia). She was the wife the Dardanian prince Assarakos (Assaracus).\n\nHieromneme's means \"Memory of the Holy Rites\" from the Greek words hieros and\n        mnêma. She was probably associated with the orgiastic rites of the Mother of the Gods celebrated on Mount Ida. Furthermore, her grandson\n        Ankhises was a lover of the goddess Aphrodite--a pairing which echoes the figures of Kybele (Cybele) and Attis in the indigenous Phrygian cult.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 141 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Assarakos (Assaracus) [prince of Dardania] and [the river] Simoeis' daughter Hieromneme were parents of\n        Kapys (Capys).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
