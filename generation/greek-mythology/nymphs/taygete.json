  "content": "TAYGETE was the Pleiad star- and mountain-nymph of the Taygetos Mountains in Lakedaimonia (Laconia), southern\n        Greece. She was loved by Zeus. Their son Lakedaimon (Lacedaemon) was the ancestor of the kings of Sparta.\n\n[1.1] ATLAS (Hesiod\n            Astronomy Frag 1)\n          [1.2] ATLAS & PLEIONE (Apollodorus 3.110, Hyginus Fabulae 192, Hyginus Astronomica 2.21, Ovid Fasti 4.169\n            & 5.79)\n\n[1.1] LAKEDAIMON (by Zeus) (Apollodorus 3.116, Pausanias 3.12, Hyginus Fabulae 155 & Astronomica 2.21, Nonnus\n            Dionysiaca 32.65)\n\nTAY′GETE (Taügetê), a daughter of Atlas and Pleione, one of the Pleiades. (Apollod. iii. 10.\n        § 1.) By Zeus she became the mother of Lacedaemon (Apollod. iii. 10. § 3; Paus. iii. 1. § 2, 18.\n        § 7, 20. § 2) and of Eurotas. (Steph. Byz. s. v. Taygeton.) Mount Taygetus, in Laconia,\n        derived its name from her. (Schol. ad Eurip. Or. 615.) According to some traditions, Taygete refused to\n        yield to the embraces of Zeus, and in order to secure her against him, Artemis metamorphosed her into a cow.\n        Taygete showed her gratitude towards Artemis by dedicating to her the Cerynitian hind with golden antlers.\n        (Schol. ad Pind. Ol. iii. 53.) Some traditions, moreover, state that by Tantalus she became the mother\n        of Pelops. (Hygin. Fab. 82.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Astronomy Fragment 1 (from Scholiast on Pindar's Nemean Odea 2.16) (trans.\n          Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or 7th B.C.) :\n        \"The Pleiades whose stars are these :--‘Lovely Teygata (Taygete), and dark-faced Elektra (Electra),\n        and Alkyone (Alcyone), and bright Asterope, and Kelaino (Celaeno), and Maia, and Merope, whom glorious Atlas\n        begot.’\"\n\nPindar, Olympian Ode 3. 27 ff (trans.
