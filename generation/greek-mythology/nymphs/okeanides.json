  "content": "THE OKEANIDES (Oceanids) were three thousand goddess-nymphs who presided over the\n        sources of earth's fresh-water--from rain-clouds to subterranean springs and fountains. Their numbers included\n        the Nephelai (Cloud-Nymphs), Aurai (Breeze-Nymphs), Naiades (Spring and Fountain Nymphs), Leimonides (Pasture Nymphs), and Anthousai\n        (Flower Nymphs). They were all daughters of the great, earth-encircling, fresh-water stream Okeanos (Oceanus)\n        and his wife Tethys.\n\nThe eldest among them were numbered among the Titanides (female Titans)--Styx, Dione, Neda, Metis, Klymene,\n        Eurynome, Doris, Elektra, and Pleione. These were most likely heavenly goddesses of the clouds.\n\nSome of the Okeanides personified divine blessings such as Metis (Wisdom), Klymene (Fame), Plouto (Wealth),\n        Tykhe (Good Fortune), Telesto (Success), and Peitho (Persuasion). The goddess Nemesis was sometimes also\n        included in their number as one who provided balance by punishing undeserved good fortune as might arise from\n        her sister's gifts.\n        These Good Spirits (Daimones Agathoi) were ephemeral in nature much like the dark children of Nyx\n        (Night), the Spirits of Harm (Daimones Kakoi).\n\nAnother group of Okeanides were handmaidens of the Olympian goddesses, the most prominent of these were the\n        sixty Okeanis companions of Artemis, Peitho the handmaiden of Aphrodite, and Klymene the handmaiden of Hera.\n\nThe Naias-Okeanides (Naiads) were primarily nymphs of springs, wells and fountains. They were often portrayed\n        as the wives of the Potamoi (River-Gods) and mothers of younger Naiades.\n\nThe Okeanides were occasionally described as sea-nymphs. In the late classical era the mythical,\n        earth-encircling, fresh-water river Okeanos was increasily equated with the briny Atlantic and Indian Oceans,\n        and his nymph-daughters reimagined as marine deities.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Hesiod Theogony 346, Aeschylus Prometheus 136, Apollodorus 1.8, Hyginus Preface\n          Nonnus Dionysiaca 38.108)\n        [1.2] OKEANOS (Homeric Hymn 2.5)\n\n[1.1] PEITHO, ADMETE, IANTHE, ELEKTRA, DORIS, PRYMNO, OURANIA, HIPPO, KLYMENE, RHODEIA, KALLIRHOE, ZEUXO,\n        KLYTIA, EIDYIA, PASITHOE, PLEXAURE, GALAXAURA, DIONE, MELOBOSIS, THOE, POLYDORA, KERKEIS, PLOUTO, XANTHE,\n        AKASTE, PERSEIS, IANEIRA, PETRIAE, EUROPA, METIS, EURYNOME, TELESTO, KHRYSEIS, ASIA, KALYPSO, EUDORA, TYKHE,\n        AMPHIRO, OKYROE, STYX (41 Names) (Hesiod Theogony 346)\n        [1.2] LEUKIPPE, PHAINO, ELEKTRA, IANTHE, MELITE, IAKHE, RHODEA, KALLIRHOE, MELOBOSIS, TYKHE, OKYRHOE, KHRYSEIS,\n        IANEIRA, AKASTE, ADMETE, RHODOPE, PLOUTO, KALYPSO, STYX, OURANIA, GALAXAURA (21 Names) (Homeric Hymn 2.415)\n        [1.3] ASIA, STYX, ELEKTRA, DORIS, EURYNOME, AMPHITRITE, METIS, EIDYIA, MELIA, MELIBOEA, PLEIONE, KALLIRRHOE\n        (Apollodorus 1.8, 1.6, 1.13, 1.29, 2.1, 2.106, 3.96, 3.110)\n        [1.4] MELITE, IANTHE, ADMETE, STILBO, PASIPHAE, POLYXO, EURYNOME, EUAGOREIS, RHODOPE, KLYTIA, METIS, MENIPPE,\n        ARGIA, PLEIONE (14 Names) (Hyginus Preface & Fabulae 142)\n        [1.5] KLEIO, BEROE, KLYMENE, EPHYRA (Virgil Georgics 4.341)\n\nADMETE An Okeanis whose name means \"the unbroken\" or \"unwedded\".

Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Prometheus [who has just been chained to a mountain crag] : Ha! Behold! What murmur, what scent wings to\n        me, its source invisible, heavenly or human, or both? Has someone come to this crag at the edge of the world to\n        stare at my sufferings--or with what motive? . . . What may be this rustling stir of birds I hear again nearby?\n        The air whirs with the light rush of wings. Whatever approaches causes me alarm.\n        [The Daughters of Okeanos enter on a winged car, perhaps representing the clouds.]\n        Chorus [of Okeanides (Oceanids)] : Do not fear! For our group has come in swift rivalry of wings to this crag as\n        friend to you, having won our father's consent as best we might. The swift-coursing breezes (aurai)\n        bore me on; for the reverberation of the clang of iron pierced the depths of our caves and drove my grave\n        modesty away in fright; unsandalled I have hastened in a winged car.\n        Prometheus : Alas! Alas! Offspring of fruitful (polyteknos) Tethys and of him who with his sleepless\n        current encircles the whole earth, children of your father Okeanos (Oceanus), behold, see with what fetters,\n        upon the summit crag of this ravine, I am to hold my unenviable watch\n        Chorus [of Okeanides] : I see, Prometheus; and over my eyes a mist of tears and fear spread as I saw your body\n        withering ignominiously upon this rock in these bonds of adamant. For there are new rulers in heaven, and Zeus\n        governs with lawless customs; that which was mighty before he now brings to nothing. . . . Who of the gods is so\n        hard of heart as to exult in this? Who does not sympathize with your woes--save only Zeus? But he in malice, has\n        set his soul inflexibly and keeps in subjection the race [Titanes] sprung from Ouranos (Uranus); nor will he\n        stop, until he has satiated his soul or another seizes his impregnable empire by some device of guile . . . You\n        are bold, and do not yield to your bitter pangs; you give too much license to your tongue. But my soul is\n        agitated by piercing fear, and I am in dread about your fate, wondering to what haven you must steer your ship\n        to see an end of your voyage of sorrow. For the heart of Kronos' (Cronus') son [Zeus] is hardened against\n        entreaty and his ways are inexorable. . . . \n        Chorus [of Okeanides] : Not to unwilling ears have you made this appeal, Prometheus. And so now with light foot\n        I will quit my swift-speeding seat and the pure air (aithêr), the pathway of birds and draw near\n        to this rugged ground; for I want to hear the whole story of your sorrows.\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 399 ff :\n        \"Chorus [of Okeanides] : I mourn your unfortunate fate, Prometheus. Shedding from my eyes a coursing flood\n        of tears I wet my tender cheeks with their moist streams. For Zeus, holding this unenviable power by\n        self-appointed laws, displays towards the gods of old an overweening spirit. Now the whole earth cries aloud in\n        lamentation.\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 528 ff :\n        \"[Chorus of Okeanides :] Nor may I be slow to approach the gods, with holy sacrifices of oxen slain, by the\n        side of the ceaseless stream of Okeanos (Oceanus), my father; and may I not offend [Zeus] in speech; but may\n        this rule abide in my heart and never fade away.\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 1054 ff :\n        \"Hermes : Such indeed are the thoughts and the words [of Prometheus] one hears from men deranged . . . But,\n        at all events, may you [the Okeanides (Oceanids)] who sympathize with his anguish, withdraw in haste from this\n        spot so that the relentless roar of the thunder [from Zeus] does not stun your senses.\n        Chorus [of Okeanides] : Use some other strain and urge me to some other course in which you are likely to\n        convince me. This utterance in your flood of speech is, I think, past all endurance. How do you charge me to\n        practise baseness? With him I am content to suffer any fate; for I have learned to detest traitors, and there is\n        no pest I abhor more than this.\n        [As the thunder begins to roar, the Okeanides heed the warning and depart.]\"\n\nIn Aiskhylos' (Aeschylus') play Prometheus Bound the Okeanides--aunts of the Nymphe Io--prompt her to\n        tell them of her trials.\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 631 ff (trans.

For it is worthwhile to indulge in weeping and in wailing over evil\n        fortunes when one is likely to win the tribute of a tear from the listener.\n        Io: I do not know how to refuse you. You shall learn in truthful speech all that you would like to know. Yet I\n        am ashamed to tell about the storm of calamity sent by Heaven, of the marring of my form, and of the source from\n        which it swooped upon me, wretched that I am.\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 894 ff :\n        \"[Chorus of Okeanides :] Never, oh never, immortal Moirai (Fates), may you see me the partner of the bed of\n        Zeus, and may I be wedded to no bridegroom who descends to me from heaven. For I shudder when I behold the\n        loveless maidenhood of Io [niece of the Okeanides], cruelly crushed like this by her toilsome wanderings sent by\n        Hera.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 38. 108 ff (trans.
