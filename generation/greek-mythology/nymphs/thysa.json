She was a daughter and close companion of\n        the god Dionysos.\n\nThysa was probably identified with Thyone, the mother of Dionysos in the\n        guise of goddess of the Bacchic frenzy, and Thyia, a nymph who presided over the\n        Bacchic rites at Delphoi.\n\nDIONYSOS (Euripides Palamedes Frag,\n          Strabo 10.3.13)\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 13 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"And in the Palamedes [a play by Euripides] the Chorus says, ‘Thysa, daughter of Dionysos,\n        who on Ida rejoices with his dear mother in the Iakkhic (Iacchic) revels of tambourines.’\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
