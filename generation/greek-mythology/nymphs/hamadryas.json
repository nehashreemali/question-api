  "content": "HAMADRYAS was a Dryad-nymph of Mount Othrys in Malis (central Greece). She was the daughter of Oreios \"Of\n        the Mountain\", wife of Oxylos \"Of the Forests\", and mother of eight Hamadryades who each presided\n        over a specific type of tree.\n\nHamadryas' name means \"Together-with-Tree\" and \"Together-with-Oak\" from the Greek words\n        hama and drys --the latter being both \"holm oak\" and generic \"tree.\" She\n        was probably the first oak-tree nymph.\n\nTHE HAMADRYADES (KARYA, BALANOS, KRANEIA, MOREA, AIGEIROS, PTELEA, AMPELOS, SYKE) (by Oxylos) (Athenaeus 78b)\n\nAthenaeus, Deipnosophistae 1. 78a (trans. Gullick) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to 3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The Epic poet Pherenikos (Pherenicus), a Herakleto by birth, declares that the fig (sykon) was\n        named from Syke (Fig-Tree), the daughter of Oxylos (Thick with Woods); for Oxylos, son of Oreios (of the\n        Mountain), married his sister Hamadryas (One with Tree) and begot among others, Karya (Nut-Tree), Balanos\n        (Acorn-Tree), Kraneia (Cornel-Tree), Morea (MulberryTree), Aigeiros (Black Poplar-Tree), Ptelea (Elm-Tree),\n        Ampelos (Vines), and Syke (Fig-Tree); and these are called Nymphai Hamadryades (Hamadryad Nymphs), and from them\n        many trees derive their names. Hence, also, he adds, Hipponax says : ‘The black fig-tree (syke),\n        sister of the vine (ampelos).’\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
