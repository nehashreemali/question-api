  "content": "EUPHEME was a nymph of Mount Helikon (Helicon) in Boiotia (central Greece) who nursed the young goddess Mousai (Muses). Eupheme was loved by the god Pan and bore him a son named\n        Krotos (Crotus) who was a favourite of the nine goddesses.\n\nEupheme the \"Well-Spoken\" was probably the Naiad-nymph of the spring of\n        Hippokrene (Hippocrene) on Mount Helikon whose waters were believed to inspire poets. She was perhaps identified\n        with Aganippe.\n\nKROTOS (by Pan) (Sositheus Frag, Eratosthenes, Hyginus Fabulae 224, Hyginus Astronomica 2.27)\n\nEUPHE′ME (Euphêmê), the nurse of the Muses, of whom there was a statue in the grove of the\n        Muses near Helicon.
