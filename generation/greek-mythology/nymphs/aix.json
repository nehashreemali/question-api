  "content": "AIX (Aex) was the Epimelid-nymph of nanny-goat wife of the god Pan. She was\n        seduced by Zeus and bore him a son named Aigipan (Aegipan).\n\nAix may be the same as Aix Amaltheia--the goatish nurse of Zeus in the\n        cave of Dikte. She was perhaps also identified with the primordial Gorgon\n          Aix whose skin Zeus crafted into his aigis arm-guard.\n\nAIGIPAN (by Zeus) (Euhemerus Frag, Hyginus Astronomica 2.13)\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 13 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The constellation Capra.] Euhemerus [Greek writer C4th-3rd B.C.] says that a certain Aex was the wife of\n        Pan. When she was embraced by Jove [Zeus] she bore a son whom she called son of Pan. So the child was called\n        Aegipan, and Jove, Aegiochus [i.e. Holder of the Goat or Aegis]. Since he was very fond of him, he placed in\n        memory the form of a goat among the stars.\" [N.B. Capra is a group of stars beside the shoulder of the\n        constellation Auriga.]\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
