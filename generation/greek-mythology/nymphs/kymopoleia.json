  "content": "KYMOPOLEIA (Cymopoleia) was a sea-nymph daughter of the god Poseidon and the wife of the hundred-handed,\n        storm-giant Briareos. She was probably a goddess of the violent storm waves generated by her husband.\n\nPOSEIDON & AMPHITRITE (Hesiod Theogony 817 &\n          240)\n\nHesiod, Theogony 817 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or 7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"But the glorious allies of loud-crashing Zeus [i.e. the three Hekatonkheires] have their dwelling upon\n        Okeanos' (Oceanus') foundations, even Kottos (Cottus) and Gyes; but Briareos (Briareus), being goodly, the\n        deep-roaring Earth-Shaker [Poseidon] made his son-in-law, giving him Kymopoleia (Cymopoleia) his daughter to\n        wed.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 140 ff :\n        \"[The Nereid] Kymodoke (Cymodoce) who, with Kymatolege (Cymatolege) and Amphitrite, light of foot, on the\n        misty face of the open water easily stills the waves and hushes the winds in their blowing.\"\n        [N.B. Kymatolege is named in connection with the Nereides but was not numbered amongst them. She was probably\n        Kymopoleia, daughter of Amphitrite, who occurs later in Hesiod.]\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
