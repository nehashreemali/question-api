  "content": "HALIA was a sea-nymph of the island of Rhodes loved by the god Poseidon. When her sons denied Aphrodite landing on the island, the goddess drove them into a mad\n        frenzy causing them to rape their mother. Halia in shame cast herself into the sea and her sons were exiled by\n        their father to the dark caverns beneath the island. According to the Rhodians Halia became Leukothea, although most accounts describe this goddess as the apotheosed\n        Boiotian princess Ino.\n\nHalia was perhaps identified with Kapheira (Capheria), the Rhodian nurse of\n        the god Poseidon. She was probably also related to Himalia, a nymph seduced by\n        Zeus when he vanquished the Telkhines of Rhodes. Finally, as the mother of Rhode--the Rhodian Athena--she was\n        probably identified with Polyphe.\n\nPROSEOOUS DAIMONES, RHODOS (by\n        Poseidon) (Diodorus Siculus\n          5.55.4)\n\nHA′LIA (Halia). A sister of the Telchines in Rhodes, by whom Poseidon had six sons and one daughter,\n        Rhodos or Rhode, from whom the island of Rhodes received its name. Halia, after leaping into the sea, received\n        the name of Leucothea, and was worshipped as a divine being by the Rhodians. (Diod. v. 55; comp. Rhodos.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 55. 4 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"Poseidon, the myth continues, when he had grown to manhood, became enamoured of Halia, the sister of the\n        Telkhines (Telchines), and lying with her he begat six male children and one daughter, called Rhodos (Rhode),\n        after whom the island was named . . . And while these were still young men, Aphrodite, they say, as she was\n        journeying [after her birth from the sea] from Kytherea (Cytherea) to Kypros (Cyprus) and dropped anchor near\n        Rhodes, was prevented from stopping there by the sons of Poseidon, who were arrogant and insolent men; whereupon\n        the goddess, in her wrath, brought a madness upon them, and they lay with their mother against her will . . .\n        Halia cast herself into the sea, and she was afterwards given the name Leukothea (Leucothea) and attained to\n        immortal honour in the eyes of the natives.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
