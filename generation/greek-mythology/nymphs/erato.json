  "content": "ERATO was a Dryad-nymph of the Akakesion (Acacesium) Hill near Mount Lykaios (Lycaeus) in Arkadia (southern\n        Greece). She was a prophetess of the god Pan and the wife of Arkas (Arcas),\n        eponymous king of Arkadia.\n\nErato is probably the same as Khrysopeleia, the nymph-wife of Arkas in\n        Apollodorus' account. She was also related to Sose, an Arkadian prophetess of the\n        god Pan.\n\nAZAN, APHEIDAS, ELATOS (by Arkas) (Pausanias 8.4.2 &\n            10.9.5)\n\nE′RATO (Eratô), a nymph and the wife of Arcas, by whom she became the mother of Elatus, Apheidas,\n        and Azan. She was said to have been a prophetic priestess of the Arcadian Pan.

Beside this Pan a fire is kept burning which is never allowed to go out. It is said in\n        days of old this god also gave oracles, and that the Nymphe Erato became his prophetess, she who wedded Arkas\n        (Arcas), the son of Kallisto (Callisto).\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 4. 2 :\n        \"His [King Arkas of Arkadia's] wife, according to the legend, was no mortal woman but a Dryas Nymphe (Dryad\n        nymph) . . .
