  "content": "KAPHEIRA (Capheira) was an Okeanid-nymph of the island of Rhodes who, along with the Telkhines (Telchines), nursed and protected the infant god Poseidon.\n\nKapheira may have been a minor goddess of storm-clouds. Her name was derived from the Greek words\n        kaphos \"breath\" and eir \"stormy.\" She was probably identified with, if not\n        the same as, Halia, sister of the Telkhines.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 55. 1 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The island which is called Rhodes was first inhabited by the people who were known as Telkhines\n        (Telchines) . . . together with Kapheira (Capheira), the daughter of Okeanos (Oceanus), nurtured Poseidon, whom\n        Rhea had committed as a babe to their care.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
