  "content": "EPHYRA was the eponymous Okeanid-nymph of the town of Ephyra--better known as Korinthos (Corinth)--on the\n        Isthmos in southern Greece. She was the wife or daughter of the Titan Epimetheus. She probably presided over her\n        namesake town's water supply.\n\nEphyra was surely identified with Pyrrha--the daughter of Epimetheus and wife of Deukalion.\n\n[1] OKEANOS & TETHYS (Simonides Frag 596; Pausanias 2.1.1,\n          Hyginus Fabulae 275)\n        [2] EPIMETHEOS (Simonides Frag\n          596)\n        [3] MYRMEX (Other references)\n\nE′PHYRA (Ephura), a daughter of Oceanus, from whom Ephyraea, the ancient name of Corinth was derived.\n        (Paus. ii. 1. § 1; Virg.
