  "content": "NYMPHAI (Nymphs) were female spirits of the natural world--minor goddesses of the forests, rivers, springs,\n        meadows, mountains and seas. They were the crafters of nature's wild beauty, from the growing of trees, flowers\n        and shrubs, to the nurture of wild animals and birds, and the formation of grottos, springs, brooks and\n        wetlands.\n\nNymphs were also companions of the gods. Dionysos had his wild-eyed\n        Mainades (Maenads) and Bakkhai (Bacchae), Artemis was accompanied by a\n        band of huntress nymphs, Hekate by the dark Lampades of the underworld,\n        Poseidon by the Nereides, and the goddesses of Olympos by a bevy of\n        nymph handmaidens.\n\nOthers were the nurses of the gods including the Idaian nymphs who nursed the\n        infant Zeus, and the Nysian nymphs who cared for Dionysos.\n\nThe nymphs were depicted as beautiful young women with attributes matching their abode.\n\nFor a comprehensive list see the Catalogue of Nymphs.\n\nNYMPHAE (Numphai), the name of a numerous class of inferior female divinities, though they are designated by\n        the title of Olympian, are called to meetings of the gods in Olympus, and described as the daughters of Zeus.\n        But they were believed to dwell on earth in groves, on the summits of mountains, in rivers, streams, glens, and\n        grottoes. (Hom. Od. vi. 123, &c., xii. 318, Il. xx. 8, xxiv. 615.) Homer further describes\n        them as presiding over game, accompanying Artemis, dancing with her, weaving in their grottoes purple garments.\n        and kindly watching over the fate of mortals. (Od. vi. 105, ix. 154, xiii. 107, 356, xvii. 243,\n        Il. vi. 420, 616.) Men offer up sacrifices either to them alone, or in conjunction with other gods,\n        such as Hermes. (Od. xiii. 350, xvii. 211, 240, xiv. 435.) From the places which they inhabit, they are\n        called agronomoi (Od. vi. 105),orestiades (Il. vi. 420), and nêïades (Od. xiii.\n        104).\n\nAll nymphs, whose number is almost infinite, may be divided into two great classes. The first class embraces\n        those who must be regarded as a kind of inferior divinities, recognised in the worship of nature. The early\n        Greeks saw in all the phenomena of ordinary nature some manifestation of the deity; springs, rivers, grottoes,\n        trees, and mountains, all seemed to them fraught with life; and all were only the visible embodiments of so many\n        divine agents. The salutary and beneficent powers of nature were thus personified, and regarded as so many\n        divinities; and the sensations produced on man in the contemplation of nature, such as awe, terror, joy,\n        delight, were ascribed to the agency of the various divinities of nature. The second class of nymphs are\n        personifications of tribes, races, and states, such as Cyrene, and many others.\n\nThe nymphs of the first class must again be sublatter divided into various species, according to the different\n        parts of nature of which they are the representatives. 1. Nymphs of the watery element. Here we first\n        mention the nymphs of the ocean, Ôkeaninai or Ôkeanides, numphai hagiai, who are regarded as the\n        daughters of Oceanus (Hes. Theog. 346, &c., 364; Aeschyl. Prom.; Callim. Hymn. in\n          Dian. 13; Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1414; Soph. Philoct. 1470); and next the nymphs of the\n        Mediterranean or inner sea, who are regarded as the daughters of Nereus, whence they are called Nereides\n        (Nêreïdes; Hes. Theog. 240, &c.). The rivers were represented by the Potameides\n        (Poramêïdes), who, as local divinities, were named after their rivers, as Acheloides, Anigrides,\n        Ismenides, Amniisiades, Pactolides. (Apollon. Rhod. iii. 1219; Virg. Aen. viii. 70; Paus. v. 5. § 6, i. 31.\n        § 2; Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 15; Ov. Met. vi. 16; Steph. Byz. s.v. Amnisos.) But\n        the nymphs of fresh water, whether of rivers, lakes, brooks, or wells, are also designated by the general name\n        Naiades, Nêïdes, though they have in addition their specific names, as Krênaiai, Pêgaiai,\n        Hegeionimoi, Limnatides, or Limnades. (Hom. Od. xvii. 240; Apollon. Rhod. iii. 1219; Theocrit. v. 17;\n        Orph. Hymn. 50. 6, Argon. 644.) Even the rivers of the lower regions are described as having\n        their nymphs; hence, Nymphae infernae paludis and Avernales. (Ov. Met. v. 540,\n        Fast. ii. 610.) Many of these presided over waters or springs which were believed to inspire those that\n        drank of them, and hence the nymphs themselves were thought to be endowed with prophetic or oracular power, and\n        to inspire men with the same, and to confer upon them the gift of poetry. (Paus. iv. 27. § 2, ix. 3. §\n        5, 34. § 3; Plut. Aristid. 11; Theocrit. vii. 92; comp. MUSAE.) Inspired soothsayers or priests\n        are therethe fore sometimes called numphogêptoi. (Plat. Phaedr. p. 421, e.) Their powers,\n        however, vary with those of the springs over which they preside; some were thus regarded as having the power of\n        restoring sick persons to health (Pind. Ol. xii. 26; Paus. v. 5. § 6, vi. 22. § 4); and as\n        water is necessary to feed all vegetation as well as all living beings, the water nymphs (Hydriades) were also\n        worshipped along with Dionysus and Demeter as giving life and blessings to all created beings, and this\n        attribute is expressed by a variety of epithets, such as karpotrophoi, aipolikai, nomiai, kourotrophoi, &c.\n        As their influence was thus exercised in all departments of nature, they frequently appear in connection with\n        higher divinities, as, for example, with Apollo, the prophetic god and the protector of herds and flocks\n        (Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1218); with Artemis, the huntress and the protectress of game, for she herself was\n        originally an Arcadian nymph (Apollon. Rhod. i. 1225, iii. 881; Paus. iii. 10. § 8); with Hermes, the\n        fructifying god of flocks (Hom. Hymn. in Aphrod. 262); with Dionysus (Orph. Hymn. 52; Horat.\n        Carm. i. 1. 31, ii. 19. 3); with Pan, the Seileni and Satyrs, whom they join in their Bacchic revels\n        and dances.\n\n2. Nymphs of mountains and grottoes, are called Orodemniades and Oreiades but sometimes also by names\n        derived from the particular mountains they inhabited, as Kithairônides, Pêliades, Korukiai, &c.\n        (Theocrit. vii. 137; Virg. Aen. i. 168, 500; Paus. v. 5. § 6, ix. 3. § 5, x. 32. § 5;\n        Apollon. Rhod. i. 550, ii. 711; Ov. Her. xx. 221; Virg. Eclog. vi. 56.)\n\n3. Nymphs of forests, groves, and glens, were believed sometimes to appear to and frighten solitary\n        travellers. They are designated by the names Alsêïdes, Holêôroi, Aulôniades, and\n        Napaiai. (Apollon. Rhod. i. 1066, 1227; Orph. Hymn. 50. 7; Theocrit. xiii. 44; Ov. Met. xv.\n        490; Virg. Georg. iv. 535.)\n\n4. Nymphs of trees, were believed to die together with the trees which had been their abode, and with\n        which they had come into existence. They were called Dryades, Hamadruades or Hadryades, from drys, which\n        signifies not only an oak, but any wild-growing lofty tree; for the nymphs of fruit trees were called\n        Mêlides, Mêliades, Epimêlides, or Hamamêlides. They seem to be of Arcadian origin, and\n        never appear together with any of the great gods. (Paus. viii. 4. § 2; Apollon. Rhod. ii. 477, &c.;\n        Anton. Lib. 31, 32; Hom. Hymn. in Ven. 259, &c.)\n\nThe second class of nymphs, who were connected with certain races or localities (Numphai chthoniai, Apollon.\n        Rhod. ii. 504), usually have a name derived from the places with which they are associated, as Nysiades,\n        Dodonides, Lemniae. (Ov. Fast. iii. 769, Met. v. 412, ix. 651; Apollod. iii. 4. § 3;\n        Schol. ad Pind. Ol. xiii. 74.)\n\nThe sacrifices offered to nymphs usually consisted of goats, lambs, milk, and oil, but never of wine.\n        (Theocrit. v. 12, 53, 139, 149; Serv. ad Virg. Georg. iv. 380, Eclog. v. 74.) They were\n        worshipped and honoured with sanctuaries in many parts of Greece, especially near springs, groves, and grottoes,\n        as, for example, near a spring at Cyrtone (Paus. ix. 24. § 4), in Attica (i. 31. § 2),at Olympia (v.\n        15. § 4, vi. 22. § 4), at Megara (i. 40. § 1), between Sicyon and Phlius (ii. 11. § 3), and\n        other places. Nymphs are represented in works of art as beautiful maidens, either quite naked or only\n        half-covered. Later poets sometimes describe them as having sea-coloured hair. (Ov. Met. v. 432.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nAncient Greek writers describe many types of nymph but the classifications were rather fluid. The Naiad nymph\n        of a local spring could, for example, also be the Dryad of the large tree growing by its waters. Only in modern\n        compendiums are they divided into neatly arranged groups.\n\n1. OKEANIDES (Oceanids) were the eldest of the nymphs, daughters of the great,\n        earth-encircling River Okeanos (Oceanus). They presided over the sources of fresh-water and were responsible for\n        the nurture of the natural world. As such they are often described as nurses not only of nature but of the gods\n        themselves. Their numbers included Naiades (nymphs of springs and fountains), Nephelai (of rain-clouds), Aurai\n        (of cool breezes), Dryades (of trees), Epimelides (of pastures), and Leimonides (of flowery meadows). In modern\n        compilations Okeanides are often mistakenly described as \"ocean\" nymphs. In Greek mythology, however,\n        their father Okeanos \"Ocean\" was an earth-encircling, fresh-water stream and not a salt-sea ocean.\n\n2. NAIADES (Naiads) were nymphs of the earthly sources of fresh-water, including\n        springs, rivers, streams, wells and fountains. Some were daughters of the earth-encircling river Okeanos (i.e.\n        the Okeanides), while others were born of local River Gods. They were sometimes also associated with rain-clouds\n        (the Naiad-Nephelai), trees (the Naiad-Dryades), and flowery meadows (the Naiad-Leimonides).\n\n3. HYDRIADES (Hydriads) were fresh-water nymphs whose name comes from the Greek word\n        hydros \"water\". They were essentially the same as the Naiades (above).\n\n4. DRYADES (Dryads) were the nymphs of the trees, forests and groves. Some Dryades\n        were Naiades (Water-Nymphs) who happened to preside over the trees growing beside their spring or stream. Others\n        were Oreiades (Mountain-Nymphs) connected with highland-growing firs and manna ash trees.\n\n5. HAMADRYADES or HADRYADES (Hamadryads) were Dryad\n        nymphs whose life force was bound to that of a specific tree. They were often paired with the loftiest trees of\n        a sacred grove. Some were also the Naiades of springs--in paticular those which seemed to sprout from beneath\n        the roots of a tree.\n\n6. MELIAI (Meliae) were nymphs of the mountain ash (manna ash-tree) and honey\n        bees. They were Hamadryades (Tree-Nymphs), Oreiades (Mountain-Nymphs), and Melissai (Bee-Nymphs). Many of the\n        Meliai presided over local springs and so might also be classed as Naiades.\n\n7. MELISSAI (Melissae) were the nymphs of honey bees. They were usually Meliai or Oreiades, nymphs of ash-trees\n        and mountain forests.\n\n8. OREIADES (Oreads) were mountain-dwelling nymphs. Some were Hamadryad nymphs of\n        highland fir and ash-trees, others were the spirits of rocky grottos, Naiades of mountain springs, and\n        Epimelides of the mountain pastures.\n\n9. EPIMELIDES (Epimelids) were nymphs of the pastures who nourished the herds of\n        cattle, goats and sheep which grazed their lands. They were also the nymphs of orchards. N.B. The ancient Greek\n        word melos means both \"fruit-tree\" and \"sheep\", hence the dual role of the nymph.\n\n10. LEIMONIDES (Limonids) were the nymphs of flowery water-meadows. They were usually described as a type of\n        Okeanid or Naiad nymph. The Leimonid companions of spring-time Persephone were Okeanides (Oceanids).\n\n11. ANTHOUSAI (Anthusae) were the nymphs of flowers. They were a mixture of Okeanides, Naiades, Epimelides and\n        Leimonides.\n\n12. NEPHELAI (Nephelae) were the nymphs of rain-clouds. They were numbered amongst\n        the Okeanides (Oceanids).\n\n13. AURAI (Aurae) were nymphs of cool breezes. They were described as daughters of\n        either Okeanos (Oceanus, the World-Stream) or Boreas (the North Wind).\n\n14. HESPERIDES (Hesperids) were the nymphs of sunsets. They were\n        daughters of Hesperos, the evening star.\n\n15. ASTERIAI (Asteriae) were nymphs of the stars. Most were daughters of the Titan Atlas including the Pleiades\n        and Hyades, both of which were also classed as Oreiades (Mountain-Nymphs).\n\n16. HALIAI (Haliae) were the nymphs of sea and shore. They were spirits of the deep,\n        the waves, fish, coastal caverns, sandy beaches, rocks and pebbly shores. Most were daughters of the sea-gods\n        including the fifty Nereides. A few were also Naiad nymphs who guided fresh-water streams through the sea.\n\n17. NEREIDES (Nereids) were nymphs of the sea. They were numbered\n        amongst the Haliai or marine nymphs.\n\n18. LAMPADES (Lampads) were the torch-bearing nymphs of the\n        underworld. They formed the train of the goddesses Persephone and Hekate. Many underworld nymphs were described\n        as daughters of the infernal Rivers.\n\n19. MAINADES (Maenads) (also known as Bakkhantes, Bakkhai, Bassarides, Thyiai, and Mimallones) were orgiastic\n        nymphs in the train of the god Dionysos. These thyrsos-bearing women consorted with Satyroi (Satyrs) and Silenoi\n        (Silens). They were a mixture of Dryades, Naiades, and Oreiades.\n\n20. NYMPHAI (Nymphs) of no specific class were daughters of various gods, e.g. Kalypso daughter of Atlas,\n        Lampetia and Phaethousa daughters of Helios, Britomartis daughter of Zeus, etc.\n\nAncient poets and writers introduce various types of nymph. References to sea-nymphs (Nereides, etc.) are not\n        included here.\n\nHomer classifies Nymphs by habitat as follows: those of the springs (pegai, krenai), rivers\n        (potamoi), tree groves (alsea), grassy meadows (pisea), and mountain-tops\n        (orea). These were named Naiades, Dryades, Leimonides and Oreiades by later authors.\n\nHomer, Iliad 20. 4 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"The Nymphai (Nymphs) who live in the lovely groves (alsea), and the springs of rivers (pegai\n          potamon) and the grassy meadows (pisea poiêenta).\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 6. 121 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"A shriek rang in my ears just then--womanish, it seemed. Did it come from girls--did it come from Nymphai\n        (Nymphs) who live on high mountain-tops (orea) or in river-springs (pegai potamon) or in\n        grassy meadows (pisea)?\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 10. 348 ff :\n        \"They [Nymphai (Nymphs)] come from springs (krênai), they come from groves (alsea),\n        they come from the sacred rivers (potamoi) flowing seawards.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 5 to Aphrodite 94 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th to 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The Nymphai (Nymphs) [of Mount Ida] who haunt the pleasant woods (alsea), or of those who inhabit\n        this lovely mountain (oros) and the springs of rivers (pegai potamoi) and grassy meads\n        (pisea).\"\n\nHesiod describes two classes of Nymph in the Theogony--the Okeanides of fresh-water springs, streams\n        and meadows, and the Meliai, mountain-dwelling tree nymphs. In the Catalogues of Women he introduces\n        the Oreiades of the mountains--which are quite similar to the Meliai--and the Naiad daughters of the River-gods.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 346 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or 7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"There are three thousand light-stepping daughters of Okeanos (Oceanus) [i.e. the Okeanid Nymphs] scattered\n        far and wide, bright children among the goddesses, and all alike look after the earth and the depths of the\n        standing water.\"\n        [N.B. Presumably \"look after the earth\" means taking care of the flora--trees, shrubs, flowers--and\n        \"the depths of the standing water\" refers to springs, streams, lakes and wells.]\n\nHesiod, Theogony 176 ff :\n        \"[Ouranos (Uranus) was castrated by Kronos (Cronus) :] The bloody drops that gushed forth Gaia (Gaea,\n        Earth) received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great Gigantes (Giants) with\n        gleaming armour and the Nymphai (Nymphs) whom they call Meliai (Meliae) all over the boundless earth.\"\n\nHesiod, Fragments of Unknown Position 6 (from Strabo 10. 3. 19) (trans. Evelyn-White)\n          (Greek epic C8th or 7th B.C.) :\n        \"But of them [the Hekaterides (Hecaterides)] were born the divine Nymphai of the Mountains (Nymphai\n          Oreiai) [i.e. Oread Nymphs] and the tribe of worthless, helpless Satyroi (Satyrs).\"\n\nThe poet Alkman--whose works are no longer extant--describes three types of nymph:- fresh-water Naiades;\n        torch-bearing Lampades of the underworld (which were connected with the Mysteries of Demeter); and\n        thyrsos-bearing Thyiades of the Dionysian orgy. The latter were no doubt connected with Hesiod's Oreiades\n        (Mountain-Nymphs), sisters of the Satyrs.\n\nAlcman, Fragment 63 (from Scholiast on Iliad) (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric II)\n          (C7th B.C.) :\n        \"Some say there are many kinds of Nymphai (Nymphs), e.g. Alkman: Naides (Naiads) and Lampades and Thyiades,\n        Thyiades being those who revel and go wild, i.e. go out of their minds, with Dionysos, Lampades those who carry\n        torches and lights with Hekate (Hecate).\"\n\nThe ancient Greek geographer Strabo lists the various types of orgiastic Nymph in the train of the god\n        Dionysos. These include Lenai (Lenae, Of the Wine-Press), Thyiai (Thyiae, Of the Orgies), Mimallones (Of the\n        Music), and Naiades (Of the Water).\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 10 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Bakkhai (Bacchae), and also the Lenai and Thyiai and Mimallones and Naïdes Nymphai (Naiad Nymphs) . .\n        . [are attendants] of Dionysos.\"\n\nThe geographer Pausanias describes the Nymph-cults of the Peloponnese. Most of these were dedicated to the\n        Naiades of specific springs, grottos and town-fountains, but Dryad-cults were not unknown.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 4. 2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"They used to call some Nymphai Dryades (Of the Trees) (Dryad Nymphs), other Epimeliades (Of the Sheep),\n        and others Naides (Of Fresh-Water), and Homer in his poetry talks mostly of Naides Nymphai (Naiad Nymphs).\"\n\nOvid and Virgil's celebrated poems immortalise the paired \"Naiads and Dryads\" of the countryside.\n        Their poems contain many other references to individual nymphs and groups of nymphs--such as those inhabiting\n        specific mountains and rivers.\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 6. 453 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Richer still her beauty; such the beauty of the Naides (Naiads) and Dryades (Dryads), as we used to hear,\n        walking the woodland ways.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 5. 538 ff :\n        \"[Orphne] not the least famous of Avernus' [Hades'] Nymphae (Nymphs).\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 2. 15 ff :\n        \"On the land people and cities, woods and beasts . . .
