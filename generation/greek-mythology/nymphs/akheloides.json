  "content": "THE AKHELOIDES (Acheloides) were Naiad-nymphs of the river Akheloos (Achelous) in\n        Aitolia (central Greece).\n\nThree of their number, the Seirenes (Sirens), were close companions of\n        the goddess Persephone. When their mistress was abducted by Haides they were given the bodies of birds to assist\n        in the search for the goddess.\n\n[1] KALLIRHOE (Apollodorus 3.88, Pausanias\n          8.24.9)\n        [2] KASTALIA (Pausanias 10.8.9)\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 31 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"The River Achelous used to change himself into all sorts of shapes. When he fought with Hercules\n        [Heracles] to win Dejanira in marriage, he changed himself into a bull. Hercules tore off his horn, presenting\n        it to the Hesperides or the Nymphae (Nymphs) [i.e. the Acheloides], and the goddesses filled it with fruits and\n        called it Cornucopia.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 8. 568 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The river-god Achelous welcomes Theseus in his underwater palace :] Of porous pumice and rough tufa-rock\n        the residence was built. The floor was damp and soft with moss, the ceiling diapered with shells of conch and\n        murex laid in turn . . . Theseus with his company reclined on couches . . . Soon barefoot Nymphae (Nymphs) [i.e.\n        the Acheloides] arranged the tables and spread the banquet-board, and when the feast was cleared they set a\n        jewelled bowl of wine.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 9. 86 ff :\n        \"[Achelous tells Theseus the tale of his encounter with Herakles :] ‘He [Heracles] grasped my strong\n        stiff horn in his fierce hand, broke it, and wrenched it off - my brow was maimed! My Naides (Naiads) filled it\n        full of fragrant flowers and fruits, and hallowed it. From my honour now Good Plenty (Bona Copia) finds\n        her wealth and riches flow.’\n        His [Achelous'] tale was done. One of the serving Nympha, dressed in Diana's [Artemis'] simple style, her hair\n        flowing on either side, came bearing in the horn with all its wealth, all autumn there, fruits in perfection for\n        our second course.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
