She was\n        the wife of the god of the river.\n\nDeino was probably an Okeanid-nymph like most of the other river-wives.\n\nTHE SPERKHEIDES, DIOPATRE (by Sperkheios) (Antoninus Liberalis\n          22)\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 22 (trans. Celoria) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The shepherd Kerambos (Cerambus) claimed that] the Nymphai (Nymphs) [of Mount Othrys], were not descended\n        from Zeus, but that Deino had given birth to them, with the River Sperkheios (Spercheus) was the father. He also\n        said that Poseidon, for lust of one of them, Diopatre (Diopatra), had made her sisters put down roots and turned\n        them into poplars until, satiated with his desires, he had returned them to their original shapes.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
