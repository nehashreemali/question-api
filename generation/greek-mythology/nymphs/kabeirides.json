  "content": "THE NYMPHAI KABEIRIDES (Cabeirides) were three nymphs who presided over the orgiastic rites of Samothracian\n        Mysteries.\n\nThey were perhaps identified with the Hekaterides--sisters of the Daktyloi (Dactyls) of Mount Ida.\n\n[1] HEPHAISTOS & KABEIRO\n        (Pherecydes Frag, Strabo 10.3.21)\n        [2] KADMILOS (Acusilaus Frag, Strabo\n          10.3.21)\n\nAXI′EROS (Axieros), a daughter of Cadmilus, and one of the three Samothracian Cabeiri. According to the\n        Paris-Scholia on Apollonius (i. 915-921), she was the same as Demeter. The two other Cabeiri were Axiocersa\n        (Persephone), and Axiocersus (Hades).\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nStrabo, Geography 10. 3. 21 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Akousilaüs (Acusilaus) [Greek mythographer C6th B.C.], the Argive, calls Kadmilos (Cadmilus) the son\n        of Kabeiro (Cabeiro) and Hephaistos (Hephaestus), and Kadmilos the father of three Kabeiroi (Cabiri), and these\n        the fathers of the Nymphai (Nymphs) called Kabeirides (Cabirides).\n        Pherekydes (Pherecydes) [mythographer C5th B.C.] says that . . . three Kabeiroi and three Nymphai called\n        Kabeirides were the children of Kabeiro, the daughter of [the sea-god] Proteus, and Hephaistos, and that sacred\n        rites were instituted in honor of each triad.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius 1.917.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
