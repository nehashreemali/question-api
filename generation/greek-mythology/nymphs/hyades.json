After their brother Hyas was killed by a lion, the teary Hyades were set\n        amongst the stars. The heliacal setting of their constellation in November marks the start of the rainy season\n        in Greece and from this the nymphs were named \"the Rainy Ones.\"\n\nAccording to Nonnus the Hyades were the same as the Lamides, nurses of the\n        god Dionysos. They were also closely identified with the Nysiades and Nymphai Naxiai, other reputed\n        nurses of the god. The Hyades were also related to the Naiades Mysiai whose\n        tale subsitutes a brother named Hyas for a lover named Hylas.\n\n[1.1] ATLAS & PLEIONE (Hyginus Fabulae 192)\n        [1.2] ATLAS & AITHRA (Musaeus Frag, Hyginus Astronomica 2.21, Ovid Fasti 5.164)\n        [2.1] HYAS & BOIOTIA (Hyginus Astronomica\n          2.21)\n\n[1.1] PHAISYLE, KORONIS, KLEEIA, PHAIO, EUDORE (Hesiod Astronomy 2)\n        [1.2] PHAESYLA, KORONIS, AMBROSIA, POLYXO, EUDORA (Hyginus Fabulae 192)\n        [1.3] AMBROSIA, EUDORA, AESYLE (Eustathius on Homer's Iliad 1156)\n\nHY′ADES (Huades), that is, the rainy, the name of a class of nymphs, whose number, names, and descent,\n        are described in various ways by the ancients. Their parents were Atlas and Aethra ( Ov. Fast. v. 169,\n        &c.), Atlas and Pleione (Hygin. Fab. 192), or Hyas and Boeotia (Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 21\n        ); and others call their father Oceanus, Melisseus, Cadmilus, or Erechtheus. (Hygin. Fab. 182; Theon.\n        ad Arat. Phaen. 171; Serv. ad Aen. i. 748.) Thales mentioned two, and Euripides three Hyades\n        (Theon, l. c.), and Eustathius (ad Hom. p. 1156) gives the names of three, viz. Ambrosia,\n        Eudora, and Aesyle. Hyginus (Fab. 182), on the other hand, mentions Idothea, Althaea, and Adraste; and\n        Diodorus (v. 52) has Philia, Coronis, and Cleis. Other poets again knew four, and Hesiod (ap. Theon. l.\n          c.) five, viz. Phaesyle, Coronis, Cleeia, Phaeote, and Eudora. (Comp. the five different names in Serv.\n        ad Virg. Georg. i. 138; Hygin. Fab. 182, 192.) But the common number of the Hyades is seven,\n        as they appear in the constellation which bears their name, viz., Ambrosia, Eudora, Pedile, Coronis, Polyxo,\n        Phyto, and Thyone, or Dione. (Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 21 ; Hesych. s. v.) Pherecydes, the\n        logographer, who mentioned only six, called them the Dodonaean nymphs, and the nurses appointed by Zeus to bring\n        up Dionysus. In this capacity they are also called the Nysaean nymphs. (Apollod. iii. 4. § 3; Ov.\n        Fast. v. 167, Met. iii 314; Serv. ad Aen. i. 748; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1155.)\n        When Lycurgus threatened the safety of Dionysus and his companions, the Hyades, with the exception of Ambrosia,\n        fled with the infant god to Thetis or to Thebes, where they entrusted him to Ino (or Juno), and Zeus showed them\n        his gratitude for having saved his son, by placing them among the stars. (Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 21.)\n        Previous to their being thus honoured, they had been old, but been made young again by Medeia, at the request of\n        Dionysus. (Hygin. Fab. 182; Ov. Met. vii. 295.) As nymphs of Dodona, they were said, in some\n        traditions, to have brought up Zeus. (Schol. ad Hom. Il. xviii. 486.) The story which made them the\n        daughters of Atlas relates that their number was twelve or fifteen. and that at first five of them were placed\n        among the stars as Hyades, and the seven (or ten) others afterwards under the name of Pleiades, to reward them\n        for the sisterly love they had evinced after the death of their brother Hyas, who had been killed in Libya by a\n        wild beast. (Hygin. Fab. 192; Ov. Fast. v. 181 ; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1155.) Their\n        name, Hyades, is derived by the ancients from their father, Hyas, or from Hyes, a mystic surname of Dionysus;\n        and according to others, from their position in the heavens, where they formed a figure resembling the Greek\n        letter U. The Romans, who derived it from hus, a pig, translated the name by Suculae (Cic. de Nat.\n          Deor. ii. 43.); but the most natural derivation is from Wein, to rain, as the constellation of the\n        Hyades, when rising simultaneously with the sun, announced rainy and stormy weather. (Cic. lc.; Ov.\n        Fast. v. 165; Horat. Carm. i. 3. 14; Virg. Aen. iii. 516; Gell. xii.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Astronomy Fragment 2 (from Scholiast on Aratus 254) (trans. Evelyn-White)\n          (Greek epic C8th or 7th B.C.) :\n        \"But Zeus made them [the sisters of Hyas] into the stars which are called Hyades. Hesiod in his Book\n          about Stars tells us their names : ‘Nymphai (Nymphs) like the Kharites (Charites, Graces), Phaisyle\n        and rich-crowned Kleeia and lovely Phaio and long-robed Eudora, whom the tribes of men upon the earth call\n        Hyades.’\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 192 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Atlas by Pleione or an Oceanid had twelve daughters, and a son, Hyas. The son was killed by a wild boar or\n        a lion, and the sisters, grieving for him, died of this grief. The five of them first put among the stars have\n        their place between the horns of the bull--Phaesyla, Ambrosia, Coronis, Eudora, Polyxo--and are called, from\n        their brother's name, Hyades. In Latin they are called Suculae.\n        Some say that since they are arranged in the form of the letter Upsilon they are called Hyades; some, they are\n        so called because they bring rain when they rise, for to rain is hyein in Greek.\n        There are those who think they are among the stars because they were the nurses of Father Liber\n        [Dionysos].\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 21 :\n        \"It [the constellation Taurus] faces towards the East, and the stars which outline the face are called\n        Hyades.\n        These, Pherecydes the Athenian [mythographer C5th B.C.] says, are the nurses of Liber [Dionysos], seven in\n        number, who earlier were Nymphae (Nymphs) called Dodonidae. Their names are as follows : Ambrosia, Eudora,\n        Pedile, Coronis, Polyxo, Phyto, and Thyone.\n        They are said to have been put to flight by Lycurgus and all except Ambrosia took refuge with Thetis, as\n        Asclepiades [Greek poet C3rd B.C.] says.\n        But according to Pherecydes [mythographer C5th B.C.], they brought Liber [Dionysos] to Thebes and delivered him\n        to Ino, and for this reason Jove [Zeus] expressed his thanks to them by putting them among the\n        constellations.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 21 :\n        \"The Pleiades (Many) were so named, according to Musaeaus, because fifteen daughters were born to Atlas and\n        Aethra, daughter of Oceanus. Five of them are called Hyades, he shows, because their brother was Hyas, a youth\n        dearly beloved by his sisters. When he was killed in a lion hunt, the five we have mentioned, given over to\n        continual lamentation, are said to have perished. Because they grieved exceedingly at his death, they are called\n        Hyades.\n        The remaining ten brooded over the death of their sisters, and brought death on themselves; because so may\n        experienced the same grief, they were called Pleiades. Alexander says they were called Hyades because they were\n        daughters of Hyas and Boeotia, Pleiades, because born of Pleio, daughter of Oceanus, and Atlas.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 5. 164 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"When darkening twilight ushers in the night, the whole flock of Hyades is revealed. Taurus' face gleams\n        with seven rays of fire, which Greek sailors call Hyades from their rain-word. To some they were the nurses of\n        Bacchus [Dionysos], to others granddaughters of Tethys and old Oceanus. Atlas did not shoulder the load of\n        Olympus yet, when lovely, eye-catching Hyas was born. Oceanus' daughter, Aethra, bore him and the Nymphae\n        (Nymphs) in timely births, but Hyas was born first. While his beard was fresh, stags trembled in terror before\n        him, and the hare was welcome prey. But when years matured his manhood, he breavely closed with the shaggy\n        lioness and the boar. He sought the lair and brood of the whelped lioness and was bloody prey to the Libyan\n        beast. His mother sobbed for Hyas, his sad sisters sobbed and Atlas, whose neck would haul the world. The\n        sisters surpassed both parents in pious love and won heaven. Their name is from Hyas.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 14. 143 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"The water Neiades (Naiads). . . whom men call Hyades, offspring of the river Lamos.
