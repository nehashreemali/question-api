  "content": "ASTERODEIA was the Naiad-nymph of a gold-bearing stream of the Kaukasos (Caucasus) Mountains. She was loved by\n        King Aeetes of Kholkis (Colchis) and bore him a son named Apsyrtos.\n\nAsterodeia's name was derived from the Greek words astêr \"star\" and rhodos\n        \"rose\", and her son's from syrtos \"washed down from a river\" (usually referring to\n        gold). This suggests that Asterodeia was the nymph of a gold-bearing stream which sparkled like a\n        \"rosy-star\". Ancient Greek writers commenting on the story of the Golden Fleece note that tribesmen of\n        the Kaukasos mountains collected gold from the streams with the aid of lambskin fleeces. Also, n the tale of the\n        Argonauts, the heroes stole not only the fleece but also Apsyrtos--the boy of the gold-bearing stream.\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 240 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[In Kholkis (Colchis) :] Higher buildings stood at angles to this court on either side. In one of them,\n        the highest, King Aeetes lived with his queen; in another, his son Apsyrtos (Apsyrtus), whom a Kaukasian\n        (Caucasian) Nymphe named Asterodeia had borne to him before he married Eidyia, the youngest daughter of Tethys\n        and Okeanos (Oceanus).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
