He carried her off to Thrake where she became his immortal wife.\n\nOreithyia was probably the goddess of chill mountain winds for her name means \"mountain-rager\"--from\n        the Greek words oreios and thyô--and she was named the mother of Khione (Snow).\n\nOreithyia's sisters Pandrosos (All Dewy) and Herse (Dew) were also minor Athenian deities. Oreithyia was\n        probably the same as Khione (Chione) who was also described as the consort of\n        the North Wind.\n\n[1.1] EREKHTHEUS & PRAXITHEA (Apollodorus\n          3.196, Pausanias 3.15.1)\n        [1.2] EREKHTHEUS (Simonides Frag 534, Herodotus 7.189, Apollonius Rhodius 1.212,\n          Diodorus Siculus 4.43.3, Hyginus Fabulae 14, Ovid Metamorphoses 6.679, Ovid Fasti 5.203, Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          37.155, Suidas s.v.

It was from Attika (Attica) that Thrakian Boreas had brought her there. She was whirling in the dance\n        on the banks of Ilissos (Ilissus) when he snatched her up and carried her far away to a spot called Sarpedon's\n        Rock, near the flowing waters of Erginos, where he wrapped her in a dark cloud and overcame her. And now, these\n        sons of hers could soar into the sky. Astounding spectacle! As they flapped wings on either side of their\n        angles, a glint of gold shone through from spangles on the dusky feathers; an their black locks streaming from\n        head and neck along their backs were tossed by the wind to this side and that.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 23 ff :\n        \"The two sons of Boreas (the North Wind) . . . Phineos (Phineus), Agenor's son, who when he ruled in Thrake\n        (Thrace) won Kleopatra (Cleopatra), sister of that pair, with his bridal gifts and brought her to his.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 1. 166 ff (trans.

Godley) (Greek historian C5th B.C.) :\n        \"[During the historical war between the Greeks and the Persians :] The story is told that because of an\n        oracle the Athenians invoked Boreas, the North Wind, to help them, since another oracle told them to summon\n        their son-in-law as an ally. According to the Hellenic story, Boreas had an Attic wife, Orithyia, the daughter\n        of Erekhtheus (Erechtheus), ancient king of Athens. Because of this connection, so the tale goes, the\n        Athenians considered Boreas to be their son-in-law.\n        They were stationed off Khalkis (Chalcis) in Euboia (Euboea), and when they saw the storm rising, they then, if\n        they had not already, sacrificed to and called upon Boreas and Orithyia to help them by destroying the barbarian\n        [Persian] fleet, just as before at Athos. I cannot say whether this was the cause of Boreas falling upon the\n        barbarians as they lay at anchor, but the Athenians say that he had come to their aid before and that he was the\n        agent this time. When they went home, they founded a sacred precinct of Boreas beside the Ilissos (Ilissus)\n        river.\"\n\nPlato, Phaedrus 229 ff (trans. Fowler) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"Phaidros (Phaedrus) : I should like to know, Sokrates, whether the place is not somewhere here at which\n        Boreas (the North Wind) is said to have carried off Oreithyia from the banks of the Ilissos (Ilissus)?\n        Sokrates (Socrates) : Such is the tradition.\n        Phaidros : And is this the exact spot? The little stream is delightfully clear and bright; I can fancy that\n        there might be maidens playing near.\n        Sokrates : I believe that the spot is not exactly here, but about a quarter of a mile lower down, where you\n        cross to the temple of Artemis, and there is, I think, some sort of an altar of Boreas at the place.\n        Phaidros : I have never noticed it; but I beseech you to tell me, Sokrates, do you believe this tale?\n        Sokrates : The wise are doubtful, and I should not be singular if, like them, I too doubted. I might have a\n        rational explanation that Oreithyia was playing with Pharmakeia (Pharmaceia), when a northern gust carried her\n        over the neighbouring rocks; and this being the manner of her death, she was said to have been carried away by\n        Boreas. There is a discrepancy, however, about the locality; according to another version of the story she was\n        taken from Areopagos, and not from this place.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 7. 3. 1 (trans.

Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"This Ilisos (Ilissus) [at Athens] is the river by which Oreithyia was playing when, according to the\n        story, she was carried off by Boreas (the North Wind). With Oreithyia he lived in wedlock, and because of the\n        tie between him and the Athenians he helped them by destroying most of the foreigners' warships. The Athenians\n        hold that the Ilisos is sacred to other deities as well.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 38. 2 :\n        \"[The hero] Eumolpos (Eumolpus) they say came from Thrake (Thrace), being the son of Poseidon and Khione\n        (Chione).

These sons sailed with Jason and met their end in chasing the Harpyiai (Harpies); but\n        according to Akousilaos (Acusilaus), they were killed by Herakles in Tenos.\n        Kleopatra was married to Phineus, who had by her two sons, Plexippos and Pandion. When he had these sons by\n        Kleopatra, he married Idaia (Idaea), daughter of Dardanos. She falsely accused her stepsons to Phineus of\n        corrupting her virtue, and Phineus, believing her, blinded them both. But when the Argonauts sailed past with\n        the Boreades, they punished him.\n        Khione had connexion with Poseidon, and having given birth to Eumolpos (Eumolpus) unknown to her father, in\n        order not to be detected, she flung the child into the deep.

But when fair speeches failed him, anger stormed, the\n        North Wind's too familiar mood at home. ‘Yes, I deserved it! Why, oh, why,’ he said, ‘Did I\n        give up my armoury, my wrath, my blustering threats, my force, my savagery, and take to grovelling and disgrace\n        myself? Force is what fits me, force! . . .

Trailing his dusty cloak across the peaks, he swept the ground and, clothed\n        in darkness, wrapped terrified Orithyia in his wings, his loving tawny wings, and as he flew his fire was fanned\n        and flared. The ravisher held on his airy course until he reached the peopled cities of the Cicones [in\n        Thrace].\n        There the princess of Attica became wife of the icy king and mother too, mother of twins [the Boreades], who had\n        their father's wings, though all else from their mother.

But later\n        as their cheeks grew yellow down, so, like a bird, wings lapped them on each side.
