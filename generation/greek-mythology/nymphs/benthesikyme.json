  "content": "BENTHESIKYME (Benthesicyme) was an African sea-nymph. She was a duaghter of the god Poseidon and the wife of\n        Enalos (Of the Sea), king of Aithiopia (Ethiopia). Benthesikyme was a goddess of the waves. Her name means\n        \"Lady of Deep-Swells\" from Greek words benthos \"depths\" and kyma\n        \"waves.\"\n\nBenthesikyme was perhaps related to Tritonis--goddess of the Libyan Lake of\n        the same name. Indeed Benthesikyme's \"Aithiopia\" might encompass this region for the term was often\n        used to describe the whole of Africa. If this were the case, then her husband Enalos (Of the Sea) might be the\n        Libyan Triton. Apollodorus also mentions she had two daughters like\n        Tritonis the mother of Pallas and the Libyan Athena.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 201 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Poseidon rescued him [his son Eumolpos by Khione (Chione)] and took him to Aithiopia (Ethiopia), where he\n        gave him to his and Amphitrite's daughter Benthesikyme (Benthesicyme) to rear. When he was grown, Benthesikyme's\n        husband gave him one of their two daughters.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
