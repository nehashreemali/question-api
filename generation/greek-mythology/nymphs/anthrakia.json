  "content": "ANTHRAKIA (Anthracia) was a nymph of Mount Lykaios (Lycaeus) in Arkadia (southern Greece). She was one of the\n        Arkadian nurses of the infant god Zeus. Her attribute was a burning-torch\n        which suggests she was an Oread or Dryad tree-nymph.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 47. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[In the temple of Athene in Tegea, Arkadia :] Represented on the altar are Rhea and the nymphe Oinoe\n        holding the baby Zeus. On either side are four figures : on one, Glauke (Glauce), Neda, Theisoa and Anthrakia\n        (Anthracia); on the other Ide (Ida), Hagno, Alkinoe (Alcinoe) and Phrixa.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 8. 31. 4 :\n        \"[In the sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone in Megalopolis, Arkadia :] The table also has a representation\n        of Nymphai (Nymphs), Neda carrying the infant Zeus and another Arkadian Nymphe Anthrakia (Anthracia) holding a\n        torch, and Hagno with a water-jar in one hand and a drinking cup in the other; Ankhiroe (Anchiroe) and Myrtoessa\n        are carrying water-jars and in fact water is pouring down from them.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
