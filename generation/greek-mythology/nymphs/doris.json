  "content": "DORIS was the Okeanid-nymph wife of the sea-god Nereus and the mother of the fifty Nereides. She may have been\n        the goddess of the rich fishing-grounds found at the mouths of rivers where fresh water mingled with the brine.\n        The Okeanides were of course sisters of the Rivers.\n\nHer name is connected with two words--dôron, \"gift\" or \"bounty,\" and\n        zôros, \"pure\" and \"unmixed.\" Zôros was often used to describe\n        fresh water and from it were derived words such as zôrua \"a pipe for running water\" and\n        zôrux \"a canal or water conduit.\"\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Hesiod Theogony 240 & 350; Apollodorus 1.8)\n        [1.2] OKEANOS (Aelian On Animals\n          14.28)\n\n[1.1] THE NEREIDES (by Nereus)\n        (Hesiod Theogony 240, Apollodorus 1.11, Hyginus Preface, Ovid Metamorphoses\n          2.269)\n        [1.2] NERITES, THE NEREIDES (by Nereus) (Aelian On Animals 14.28)\n\nDORIS (Dôris), a daughter of Oceanus and Thetis, and the wife of Nereus, by whom she became the mother of\n        the Nereides. (Apollod. i. 2. § 2; Hesiod. Theog. 240, &c.; Ov. Met. ii. 269.) The\n        Latin poets sometimes use the name of this marine divinity for the sea itself. (Virg. Eclog. x. 5.) One\n        of Doris's daughters, or the Nereides, likewise bore the name of Doris. (Hom. Il. xviii. 45.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 346 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or 7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Tethys bore to Okeanos (Oceanus) the swirling Potamoi (Rivers) . . . She [Tethys] brought forth also a\n        race apart of daughters, who with lord Apollon and the Rivers have the young in their keeping all over the\n        earth, since this right from Zeus is given them. They are Peitho, Admete, Ianthe and Elektra (Electra), Doris\n        and Prymno . . . [and others, in a long list of names.] \n        Now these are the eldest of the daughters who were born to Tethys and Okeanos, but there are many others beside\n        these, for there are three thousand light-stepping daughters of Okeanos scattered far and wide, bright children\n        among the goddesses, and all alike look after the earth and the depths of the standing water.\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 240 ff : \n        \"To Nereus and to Doris of the lovely hair, daughter of Okeanos (Oceanus) the completely encircling river,\n        there were born in the barren sea daughters [the Nereides] greatly beautiful even among goddesses : Ploto and\n        Eukrante and Amphitrite and Sao, Eudora and Thetis, and Galene and Glauke, Kymothoe and Speio, and Thoe and\n        lovely Halia, Pasithea and Erato, Eunike of the rose arms, and graceful Melite and Eulimene and Agaue, Doto and\n        Proto, Dynamene and Pherousa, Nesaie and Aktaie and Protomedeia, Doris and Panopeia, and Galateia the beautiful,\n        Hippothoe the lovely and Hipponoe of the rose arms, Kymodoke who, with Kymatolege and Amphitrite, light of foot,\n        on the misty face of the open water easily stills the waves and hushes the winds in their blowing.

These were the daughters born to irreproachable Nereus, fifty in all, and the\n        actions they know are beyond reproach, also.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 8 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Titanes (Titans) had children.

Homer also mentions them in his poems. But they do\n        not state that one son was born after all that number of daughters, though he is celebrated in mariners' tales.\n        And they say that he was named Nerites and was the most beautiful of men and gods.\" [N.B. Nerites was\n        transformed into a cockle-shell by Aphrodite or Helios.]\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans.
