  "content": "THE AURAI (Aurae) were nymphs of the breezes. They were daughters of either the earth-encircling river Okeanos\n        (Oceanus) or the north-wind Boreas.\n\nIn the story of Kephalos (Cephalus) the dawn-goddess Eos was portrayed as a\n        singular Aura. Similarly, the Titan-goddess Aura was a single personification\n        of the breeze.\n\n[1] OKEANOS (Homer Odyssey 4.561)\n        [2] BOREAS (Quintus Smyrnaeus 1.683)\n\nHomer, Odyssey 4. 561 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"The world's end, the Elysian fields . . . [there] for men's refreshment Okeanos (Oceanus) sends out\n        continually the high-singing breezes of the west (aetai zephyroio).\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 88 ff (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[The Titan Prometheus calls on the spirits of nature to witness his torment :] ‘O you bright sky of\n        heaven (dios aithêr), you swift-winged breezes (takhypteroi pnoiai) [i.e. the Aurai],\n        you river-waters (pêgai potamôn), and infinite laughter of the waves of sea\n        (pontos), O universal mother Earth (panmêtôr gê), and you, all-seeing orb of\n        the sun (panoptês kyklos hêlios), to you I call! See what I, a god, endure from the\n        gods.’\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 115 ff :\n        \"[The Okeanides (Oceanids) arrive on the mountain of Prometheus in a winged chariot :] ‘Our group has\n        come in swift rivalry of wings to this crag as friend to you, having won our father's consent as best we might.\n        The swift-coursing breezes (aurai) bore me on . . . unsandalled I have hastened in a winged\n        car.’\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 1. 683 ff (trans. Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The Breezes bring Ares news of the death of his daughter Penthesilea in the Trojan War :] For the Aurai\n        (Breezes), Boreas' (the North-Wind's) fleet-winged daughters, bare to him, as through the wide halls of the sky\n        he strode.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 37. 70 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"The East Wind [Euros] left the rosy chamber of Eos (the Dawn) his mother, and fanned the blazing pure all\n        night long, stirring up the windfed leaping fire; the wild Aurai (Breezes), neighbours of the sun, shot the\n        gleams into the air.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 47. 302 ff :\n        \"[Ariadne is abandoned by Theseus on the island of Naxos :] Boreas (the North Wind) lovelorn himself cared\n        nothing for the maid stricken with desire--yes, even the Aurai (Breezes) themselves must have had a spite\n        against the maiden when they carried the ship [of Theseus away] to the Athenian land.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
