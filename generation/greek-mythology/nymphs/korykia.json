  "content": "KORYKIA (Corycia) was a Naiad-nymph of the springs of the Korykian (Corycian) Cave of Delphoi in Phokis\n        (central Greece). She was either the only Korykian nymph or one of three Korykiai\n          (Coryciae).\n\nKorykia may have been identified with Kastalia (Castalia), nymph of the\n        sacred springs of Mount Parnassos, Kleodora, the mother of Parnassos, and Melaine, the mother of Delphos.\n\nProbably a daughter of the River KEPHISOS or PLEISTOS\n\nLYKORAS (by Apollon) (Pausanias 10.6.3,\n          Hyginus Fabulae 159)\n\nCORY′CIA (Kôrukia or Kôrukis), a nymph, who became by Apollo the mother of Lycorus or\n        Lycoreus, and from whom the Corycian cave in mount Parnassus was believed to have derived its name. (Paus. x. 6.\n        § 2, 32. § 2.) The plural, Coryciae, is applied to the daughters of Pleistus. (Apollon. Rhod. ii. 710;\n        Ov.
