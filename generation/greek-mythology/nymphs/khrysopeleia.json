  "content": "KHRYSOPELEIA (Chrysopeleia) was the Hamadryad-nymph wife of Arkas (Arcas), eponymous king of Arkadia.\n\nHer name means \"Golden Dove\" from the Greek words khrysos \"gold\" and\n        peleia \"dove.\" Peleia was also a title for female seers--such as the Peleiades of Dodona--,\n        so Khrysopeleia was probably a prophetess.\n\nShe was probably identical Erato--the Dryad wife of Arkas mentioned by\n        Pausanias.\n\nCHRYSOPELEIA (Chrusopeleia), a hamadryad who was one day in great danger, as the oak-tree which she inhabited\n        was undermined by a mountain torrent. Arcas, who was hunting in the neighbourhood, discovered her situation, led\n        the torrent in another direction, and secured the tree by a dam. Chrysopeleia became by Arcas the mother of\n        Elatus and Apheidas.
