  "content": "MYSTIS was the goddess-nymph of the initiation rites of the Bakkhic (Bacchic) orgies. She was a nymph of the\n        island of Euboia (Euboea) who was entrusted with the care of the infant god Dionysos.\n\nMystis' name was simply the ancient Greek word for an inititiate of the mysteries--mystis. Her son\n        Korymbos (Corymbus),  \"Ivy-Berries,\" personified the\n        ivy-wreath with which the initiates were crowned.\n\nMystis was probably the same as Makris (Macris), the Euboian nurse of Dionysos\n        in other accounts, and Kombe (Combe), the mother of the Euboian Korybantes.\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 13. 135 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"Shield-bearing Korybantes (Corybantes) [of Euboia], guardians of Dionysos in his growing days : who in the\n        Phrygian gulf beside mountain-ranging Rheia surrounded Bakkhos (Bacchus) still a child with their drumskins.\n        They found him once, a horned baby, covered with a cloak the colour of purple wine, lying among the rocks where\n        Ino had left him in charge of Mystis the mother Korymbos (Corymbus).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
