  "content": "ASKRE (Ascra) was the Naiad-nymph of the main spring, well or fountain of the town of Askra in Boiotia (central\n        Greece). She was loved by the god Poseidon.\n\nOIOKLOS (by Poseidon) (Hegesinus Frag,\n          Pausanias 9.29.1)\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 9. 29. 1 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The first to sacrifice on Helikon (Helicon) to the Mousai (Muses) and to call the mountain sacred to the\n        Mousai were, they say, Ephialtes and Otos, who also founded Askre (Ascra). To this also Hegesinos (Hegesinus)\n        alludes in his poem Atthis :--‘And again with Askre (Ascra) lay Poseidon Earth-shaker, who when\n        the year revolved bore him a son Oioklos (Oeoclus), who first with the children of Aloeus founded Askre, which\n        lies at the foot of Helikon, rich in springs.’\n        This poem of Hegesinos I have not read, for it was no longer extant when I was born. But Kallippos (Callippus)\n        of Korinthos (Corinth) in his History of Orkhomenos uses the verses of Hegesinos as evidence in support\n        of his own views, and I too have done likewise, using the quotation of Kallippos himself.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
