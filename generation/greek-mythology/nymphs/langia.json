  "content": "LANGIA was the Naiad-nymph of the fresh-water springs of the town of Nemea in Argolis (southern Greece). When\n        the god Dionysos afflicted the Argive land with drought, Langia's spring was the only one to be spared.\n\nLangia was probably the same as the Naiad-nymph Nemea and may have been also\n        identified with Nemea-Ersa, the daughter of Zeus and Selene.\n\nStatius, Thebaid 4. 716 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[Dionysos scorched Argos with drought and dried up all the springs :] [The Nemean spring] Langia\n        alone--and she by the god's command--preserves her waters in the silence of a secret shade. Not yet had\n        slaughtered Archemorus [i.e. Opheltes whose death beside her spring resulted in the founding of the Nemean\n        Games] brought her sorrowful renown, no fame had come to the goddess; nevertheless, in far seclusion, she\n        maintains her spring and grove. Great glory awaits the Nympha, when the toiling contests of Achaean princes and\n        the four-yearly festival of woe [i.e. the Nemean Games] shall do honour to sad Hypsipyle and holy Opheltes.\n        [The parched Argive army then stopped in Nemea in search of water.]\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
