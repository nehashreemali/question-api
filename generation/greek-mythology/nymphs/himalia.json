She was seduced by the god Zeus when he came to subdue the\n        island's resident Titanes--the Telkhines.\n\nHimalia was perhaps identified with Halia, the sister of the Telkhines.\n\nSPARTAIOS, KRONIOS, KYTOS (by Zeus) (Diodorus Siculus 5.55.4)\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 55. 4 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"And at this period in the eastern part of the island [of Rhodes] there sprung up the Gigantes (Giants), as\n        they were called; and at the time when Zeus is said to have subdued the Titanes, he became enamoured of one of\n        the Nymphai (Nymphs), Himalia by name, and begat by her three sons, Spartaios (Spartaeus), Kronios (Cronius),\n        and Kytos (Cytus).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
