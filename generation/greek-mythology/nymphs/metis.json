  "content": "METIS was a Naiad-nymph of the river Meles near Smyrna in Ionia (western Anatolia). She was the legendary\n        mother of the poet Homer by Maion (Maeon).\n\nMELES (Hellanicus Frag, Cleanthes Frag, Of\n          the Origin of Homer and Hesiod 1)\n\nHOMEROS (by Maion) (Hellanicus Frag, Cleanthes Frag, Of the Origin of Homer and\n          Hesiod 1)\n\nHomerica, Of the Origina of Homer and Hesiod and their Contest, Fragment 1 (trans.\n          Evelyn-White) (Greek epic B.C.) :\n        \"Foremost of the men of Smyrna who say that he [Homer] was the son of [the river] Meles, the river of their\n        town, by a Nymphe Kretheis (Cretheis), and that he was at first called Melesigenes (Meles-Born). As to his\n        parents also, there is on all hands great disagreement. Hellanikos (Hellanicus) and Kleanthes (Cleanthes) say\n        his father was Maion (Maeon), but Eugaion says Meles; Kallikles (Callicles) is for Mnesagoras, Demokritos\n        (Democritus) of Troizenos for Daimon (Daemon), a merchant-trader. Some, again, say he was the son of Thamyras,\n        but the Egyptians say of Menemakhos (Menemachus), a priest-scribe, and there are even those who father him on\n        Telemakhos (Telemachus), the son of Odysseus. As for his mother, she is variously called etis, Kretheis\n        (Cretheis), Themista, and Eugnetho. Others say she was an Ithakan woman sold as a slave by the Phoinikians\n        (Phoenicians); other, Kalliope (Calliope) the Mousa (Muse); others again Polykasta (Polycaste), the daughter of\n        Nestor . . . Maion (Maeon) who was the father of Homer by the daughter of the river Meles.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
