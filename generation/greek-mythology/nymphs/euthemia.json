  "content": "EUTHEMIA was a nymph of the Aegean island of Kos (Cos) who insulted the goddess Artemis and was struck down by her arrows.\n\nEuthemia was probably one of the Naiades--fresh-water nymphs that were believed to die if their springs dried\n        up. Indeed the passage \"snatched away alive by Persephone\" suggests a spring lost beneath the earth.\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 16 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Meropes of Cos] had a wife, Ethemea, of the race of Nymphae (Nymphs), who was struck with the arrows of\n        Diana [Artemis] when she ceased worshipping her. At last she was snatched away alive by Proserpina [Persephone]\n        to the Land of the Dead.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
