  "content": "RHODOPE was an Oreiad- and Naiad-nymph of Kikonia (Ciconia) in Thrake (north of Greece). She was a daughter of\n        the river-god Hebros and wife of the Kikonian king Haimos (Haemus). She and her husband were transformed into\n        mountains as punishment for impersonating Zeus and Hera.\n\nThe couple were similar to the Ourea--minor gods of individual mountain\n        peaks which were not usually the subjects of worship.\n\n[1.1] HEBROS (by Haimos) (Lucian The\n          Dance 51)\n        [2.1] KIKON (by Apollon) (Other\n          References)\n\nRHO′DOPE (Rhodopê), the nymph of a Thracian well, was the wife of Haemus and mother of Hebrus, and\n        is mentioned among the playmates of Persephone.
