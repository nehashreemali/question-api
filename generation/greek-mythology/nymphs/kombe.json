  "content": "KOMBE (Combe) was a nymph of the island of Euboia (central Greece) who was the mother of the seven Euboian\n        Korybantes (Corybantes) by Sokos (Socus).\n\nKombe may have been the same as Mystis and Makris--Euboian nurses of the infant god Dionysos. The Korybantes were sometimes\n        described as his protectors.\n\nKORYBANTES (by Sokos)\n        (Nonnus Dionysiaca 13.135)\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 7. 382 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Pleuron [in Aetolia], where on fluttering wings Combe, the child of Ophius, escaped her sons'\n        assault.\"\n        [N.B. It is not clear if this Kombe (Combe) is the same as the one mentioned by Nonnus below. However Kombe is\n        described fleeing the island with her sons.]\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 13. 135 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"From the famous island [of Euboia (Euboea) came the Korybantes (Corybantes)] : Prymneus, and Mimas\n        Waddlefoot, and Akmon (Acmon) the forester, Damneus and Okythoos (Ocythous) the shieldman; and with them came\n        flash-helm Melisseus as comrade to Idaios (Idaeus), whom their father Sokos (Socus) under the insane goad of\n        impiety had once cast out of the brinegirt country along with Kombe (Combe) the mother of seven. They escaped\n        [from Euboia] and passed to Knossian (Cnossian) soil, and again went on their travels from Krete (Crete) to\n        Phrygia, and from Phrygia to Athens; where they remained as foreign settlers and hearthguests until Kekrops\n        (Cecrops) destroyed Sokos with avenging blade of justice; then leaving the land of brineflooded Marathon turned\n        their steps homewards to the sacred soil of the Abantes.\" [N.B. Kekrops was the first king of Athens. The\n        names of these Korybantes are the same as those of the Kouretes (Curetes), the Kretan protectors of the infant\n        Zeus.]\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
