  "content": "MELIA ARGEIA was the Okeanid-nymph ancestress of the royal houses of Argos, Sikyon (Sicyon) and Thebes. She was\n        the wife of the river-god Inakhos (Inachus) and the mother of Phoroneus, first king of Argos, Aigieleus\n        (Aegialeus), first king of Sikyon, and the nymph Io. Their descendants, through Io, resettled Greece after the\n        Great Deluge--with Danaus founding the city of Argos in the Peloponnese and Kadmos (Cadmus) the city of Thebes\n        in Boiotia.\n\nMelia was perhaps identified with Melia, the nymph of the Ismenian spring of\n        Thebes loved by Apollon, and Ismene, the eponymous nymph of the Ismenian spring.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS (Apollodorus 2.1, Hyginus Fab\n          143)\n\n[1.1] PHORONEUS, AIGIALEUS (by Inakhos) (Apollodorus 2.1)\n        [1.2] PHORONEUS, IO (by Inakhos)\n        (Hyginus Fabulae 143 & 145)\n\nME′LIA (Melia), a nymph, a daughter of Oceanus, became by Inachus the mother of Phoroneus and Aegialeus\n        or Pegeus.
