  "content": "KHARIKLO (Chariclo) was a nymph of Mount Pelion in Magnesia (northern Greece) who was the wife of the wise\n        centaur Kheiron (Chiron). She was the foster-mother of many of\n        the great heroes of myth including Peleus, Akhilleus (Achilles), Aristaios\n          (Aristaeus) and Asklepios (Asclepius).\n\nKhariklo's name means \"Graceful Spinner\" from the Greek words kharis \"grace\" and\n        klôsis \"to spin\". In the vase-painting (right) she accompanies Leto, mother of the god\n        Apollon, in the wedding procession of Peleus and Thetis.\n\n[1] APOLLON (Scholiast on Pindar's\n          Pythian 4.181)\n        [2] PERSES (Scholiast on Pindar's Pythian\n          4.181)\n        [3] OKEANOS (Scholiast on Pindar's Pythian\n          4.181)\n\n[1] NYMPHAI PELIONIDES (by Kheiron) (Pindar Pythian Ode\n          5)\n        [2] ENDEIS (by Skeiron) (Plutarch Theseus\n          10.3)\n        [3] OKYRHOE (by Kheiron)\n        (Ovid Metamorphoses 2.636)\n        [4] KARYSTOS (by Kheiron) (Scholiast on Pindar's\n          Pythian 4.181; Eustathius on Homer 281)\n\nCHA′RICLO (Chariklô).

From Khariklo (Chariclo), I say, and Philyra's cave I come, where the chaste daughters of the Kentauros\n        (Centaur) nursed my young days. Through all my twenty years I gave them no rough word or hasty deed . . .\n        For they [Jason's parents], when first I saw the light, fearing that leader's overweening and cruel pride, laid\n        forth within the house dark robes of mourning, as though their babe were dead; and amidst wailing women sent me\n        forth secretly, wrapped in purple swaddling clothes, that only the dark of night might know my path, and gave me\n        to Kheiron, Kronos' (Cronus') son, to be my guardian.’\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1. 551 ff (trans.

His wife [i.e. Khariklo (Chariclo)] came too.
