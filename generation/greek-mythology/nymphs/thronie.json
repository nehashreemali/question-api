  "content": "THRONIA was the Naid-nymph of the spring, well or fountain of the town of Abdera in Bistonia, Thrake (north of\n        Greece). She was loved by the god Poseidon and bore him Abderos (Abderus), the eponymous founding-king of the\n        town.\n\nAbdera, however, was usually said to have been named by Herakles after his squire Abderos who was torn apart by\n        the man-eating mares of Diomedes.\n\nPindar, Paean 2 (trans. Sandys) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"Abderos, with breast-plate of bronze, thou son of the Naias Thronia and of Poseidon.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
