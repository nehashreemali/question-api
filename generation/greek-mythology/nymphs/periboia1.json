  "content": "PERIBOIA (Periboea) was the Okeanid-nymph wife of the Titan Lelantos and the mother of Aura, goddess of the\n        breeze.\n\nShe and her husband may have been associated with the Lelantian plain of Euboia (Euboea). Nonnus however\n        locates their daughter in Phrygia.\n\nPeriboia's name means \"Surrounding Cattle\" from the Greek words peri- \"around\" and\n        bous \"cattle\"--which perhaps suggests she was a nymph of pastureland or a small stream.\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 48. 264 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"The father of this stormfoot girl [Aura] was ancient Lelantos the Titan, who wedded Periboia (Periboea), a\n        daughter of Okeanos (Oceanus); a manlike maid she [Aura] was, who knew nothing of Aphrodite [i.e. of\n        love].\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
