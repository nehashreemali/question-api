  "content": "NEAIRA (Neaera) was a nymph of the mythical island of Thrinakia (Thrinacia) loved by the sun-god Helios. She\n        bore him two shining daughters--the rustic-nymphs Lampetia and Phaethousa.\n\nThe island of Thrinakia might be the same as Trinakria which was an old Greek name for the island of Sicily.\n\nNeaira's name means \"New-Rising\" or \"Newly-Risen\" from the Greek words neos\n        \"new\" and aeirô \"to rise.\" She was probably a minor goddess of the dawn\n        similar to Eos.\n\nPerhaps a daughter of OKEANOS & TETHYS, though nowhere stated\n\nLAMPETIA, PHAETHOUSA (by Helios) (Homer Odyssey 12.128)\n\nNEAERA (Neaira). A nymph, who became by Helios the mother of Lampetia and Phaetusa. (Hom. Od. xii.\n        133.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Odyssey 12. 138 ff (trans.
