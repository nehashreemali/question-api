  "content": "THE ASTERIONIDES were three Naiad-nymph daughters of the river Asterion in Argos (southern Greece). They were\n        the nurses of the infant goddess Hera.\n\nACRAEA (Akraia). A daughter of the river-god Asterion near Mycenae, who together with her sisters Euboea and\n        Prosymna acted as nurses to Hera. A hill Acraea opposite the temple of Hera near Mycenae derived its name from\n        her. (Paus. ii. 17. § 2.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 17. 1-2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Fifteen stades distant from Mykenai (Mycenae) is on the left the Heraion (Heraeum, Temple of Hera). Beside\n        the road flows the brook called Water of Freedom (Hydros Eleutherion). The priestesses use it in\n        purifications and for such sacrifices as are secret. The sanctuary [of Hera] itself is on a lower part of Euboia\n        (Euboea). Euboia is the name they give to the hill here, saying that Asterion the river had three daughters,\n        Euboia, Prosymna, and Akraia (Acraea), and that they were nurses of Hera. The hill opposite the Heraion they\n        name after Akraia, the environs of the sanctuary they name after Euboia, and the land beneath the Heraion after\n        Prosymna. This Asterion flows above the Heraion, and falling into a cleft disappears. On its banks grows a\n        plant, which also is called asterion. They offer the plant itself to Hera, and from its leaves weave\n        her garlands.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
