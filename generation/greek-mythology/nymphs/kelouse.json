  "content": "PERO KELOUSE (Celusa) was the Naiad-nymph of the springs of the river Asopos in Sikyonia (southern Greece). She\n        was the mother of the river by the god Poseidon. Pero was probably numbered amongst the Okeanides (Oceanids)--the nymphs of fresh water.\n\nPero's son Asopos was often portrayed as a lame, hobbling god whose stream ran dry in summer. This explains her\n        two names--Kelousa was derived from the Greek word kêloô meaning \"to have an abnormal\n        delivery\" and Pero from pêroô \"to make lame.\"\n\nASOPOS (by Poseidon)\n        (Acusilaus Frag, Apollodorus 3.156, Pausanias 2.12.4)\n\nPERO (Pêrô). The mother of the river god Asopus by Poseidon. (Apollod. iii. 12. § 6.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 156 (trans.
