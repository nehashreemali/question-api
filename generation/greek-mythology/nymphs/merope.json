  "content": "MEROPE was one of the Pleiades--seven star-nymph daughters of the Titan Atlas. She was the wife the impious\n        king Sisyphos (Sisyphus) and ancestress of the Korinthian (Corinthian) and Lykian (Lycian) royal houses. Merope\n        was so ashamed of her husband's crimes that she hid her face in heaven, causing the seventh star of the Pleiades\n        to gradually fade from sight.\n\nMerope's name was variously interpreted to mean \"Face-Turned\" from the Greek words meros\n        \"to turn away\" and ops \"face\", \"Sparkling-Face\" from\n        (mar)mairô and ops, and \"Bee-Eater\" from merops. The first\n        etymology was derived from the fading light of her star, the second from its sparkle, and the third from avian\n        nature of the Pleiades--\"the Doves.\"\n\n[1.1] ATLAS (Hesiod Astronomy Frag\n          1)\n        [1.2] ATLAS & PLEIONE (Apollodorus 3.110, Hyginus Fabulae 192, Hyginus Astronoicay 2.21, Ovid Fasti 4.169 &\n          5.79)\n\n[1.1] GLAUKOS (by Sisyphos) (Apollodorus 1.85, Hyginus Astronomica 2.21)\n\nME′ROPE (Meropê). A daughter of Atlas, one of the Pleiades, and the wife of Sisyphus of Corinth, by\n        whom she became the mother of Glaucus. In the constellation of the Pleiades she is the seventh and the least\n        visible star, because she is ashamed of having had intercourse with a mortal man.

According to the fabulous story told by Pherekydes (Frag. 78 in Müller,\n        Fragmenta Historicum Graecorum) . . . ‘Before he died Sisyphos directed his wife Merope to omit\n        his funeral rites, so that Haides, being deprived of his customary offerings, was persuaded by the cunning\n        trickster to let him go back to life in order to complain of his wife’s neglect. But, once in the upper\n        world, he refused to return, and had to be fetched back by Hermes.’\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 85 (trans.

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"To Atlas and Okeanos' (Oceanus') daughter Pleione were born on Arkadian Kyllene (Arcadian Cyllene) seven\n        daughters called the Pleiades, whose names are Alkyone (Alcyone), Merope, Kelaino (Celaeno), Elektra (Electra),\n        Sterope, Taygete, and Maia.

Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Atlas by Pleione or an Oceanitide (Oceanid) had twelve daughters . . . Their names are as follows :\n        Electra, Alcyone, Celaeno, Merope . . .\n        Of these, they say Electra does not appear, because of the death of Dardanus and the loss of Troy. Others think\n        that Merope appears to blush because she had a mortal as husband, though the others had gods. Driven from the\n        band of her sisters because of this, she wears her hair long in grief, and is called a comet, or\n        longodes because she trails out for a long distance, or xiphias because she shows the shape of\n        a sword-point. This star, too, portends grief.\" [N.B. In Greek longodes means\n        \"spear-shaped,\" not \"long,\" as Hyginus erroneously says.]\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 21 :\n        \"The Pleiades are called seven in number, but only six can be seen. This reason has been advanced, that of\n        the seven, six mated with immortals--hree with Jove [Zeus], two with Neptunus [Poseidon], and one with Mars\n        [Ares]--; the seventh was said to have been the wife of Sisyphus . . . Merope, wed to Sisyphus, bore Glaucus,\n        who, as many say, was the father of Bellerophon. On account of her other sisters she was placed among the\n        constellations, but because she married a mortal, her star is dim.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 4. 169 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Pleiades will start relieving their sire's [Atlas'] shoulders. Called seven, they are usually six,\n        wither because six of them entered a god's embrace . . . the seventh, Merope, wed you, mortal Sisyphus, she\n        regrets it, and hides alone in shame.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
