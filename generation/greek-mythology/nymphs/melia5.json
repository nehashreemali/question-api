  "content": "MELIA was the Naiad-nymph of the main spring or fountain of the town of Kios (Cius) in Bithynia (north-western\n        Anatolia). She was loved by the old rustic-god Seilenos (Silenus) and bore him Dolion--the eponymous\n        founding-king of the Doliones tribe of western Bithynia.\n\nMelia's name was derived from the ancient Greek word meli \"honey-sweet\", an adjective\n        frequently applied to the waters of a spring. Honey and water were also mixed with wine which further connects\n        her with her mate, the old drunk god Seilenos. Her name was also connected with the word melia\n        \"ash-tree\", the wood of which was used for crafting spears. She may therefore also have been numbered\n        amongst Meliai tree-nymphs.\n\nMelia was perhaps identified with two nymphs of the same name--Melia, the\n        Peloponnesian wife of the god Seilenos, and Melia, a Bithynian nymph loved by\n        the god Poseidon.\n\nStrabo, Geography 12. 4. 8 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Alexandros (Alexander) the Aitolian says, ‘who have their homes on the Askanian (Ascanian) streams\n        [in Bithynia in Anatolia], on the lips of the Askanian Lake, where dwelt Dolion [eponym of the Doliones tribe]\n        the son of Silenos (Silenus) and Melia.’\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
