  "content": "MELIA was the Okeanid- and Naiad-nymph of the spring or fountain of the main town of the Bebrykes (Bebryces)\n        tribe of eastern Bithynia (north-western Anatolia). She was loved by the god Poseidon and bore him Amykos\n        (Amycus), first king of the Bebrykes.\n\nMelia's name was derived from one of two Greek words--meli \"honey-sweet\" which was used to\n        describe the pure waters of a spring, and melia \"ash-tree\" whose wood was used for the\n        crafting of spears. She might therefore have also been numbered amongst the Meliai or ash-tree nymphs.\n\nMelia was perhaps identified with Melia, a Bithynian Nymphe loved by the god\n        Seilenos. However that Melia was associated with the Doliones tribe of western Bithynia, while the Melia loved\n        by Poseidon was located amongst the Bebrykes of eastern Bithynia.\n\n[1.1] AMYKOS, MYGDON (by Poseidon) (Apollodorus 1.119 & 2.100)\n        [1.2] AMYKOS (by Poseidon) (Apollonius\n          Rhodius 2.2, Hyginus Fabulae 157, Valerius Flaccus 4.104)\n\nME′LIA (Melia), a nymph, a daughter of Oceanus. By Poseidon she became the mother of Amycus.
