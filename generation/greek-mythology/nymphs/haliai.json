Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Argyra, they say, was a Nymphe Thalassa (Sea-Nymph).\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 24 to the Nereides (trans.

Bright, watery\n        dolphins, sonorous and gay, well-pleased to sport with Bacchanalian play; Nymphai beauteous-eyed, whom sacrifice\n        delights, give plenteous wealth, and bless our mystic rites.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 13. 736 ff (trans.
