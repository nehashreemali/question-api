  "content": "KORKYRA (Corcyra) was the Naiad-nymph of the springs or fountain of the main town of the island of Korkyra in\n        the Ionian Sea. She was a daughter of the Argive river Asopos who was abducted to the island by the god Poseidon\n        where she bore Phaiax (Phaeax), the eponymous founding-king of the Phaiakoi (Phaeacian) nation.\n\n[1.1] ASOPOS (Corinna Frag 654,\n          Bacchylides Frag 9, Pausanias 2.5.1, Apollonius Rhodius 4.567)\n        [1.2] ASOPOS & METOPE (Diodorus Siculus 4.72.1-5)\n\n[1.1] PHAIAX (by Poseidon) (Diodorus\n          Siculus 4.72.1)\n\nCorinna, Fragment 654 (trans.

Who does not know of the well-built town of . . . Korkyra (Corcyra).\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 565 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Korkyra (Corcyra), where Poseidon found a home, far from her native land, for Asopos' daughter, Korkyra of\n        the lovely locks, when in his passion he had made off with her from Phlios (Phlius). The dark forests that cover\n        the island give it a sombre look, and passing sailors call it Black Korkyra.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 5. 1 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"His [Asopos'] daughters, say the Phliasians, were Korkyra (Corcyra), Aigina, and Thebe.

Their images have been ordered thus: Nemea is the first of the sisters . . . after her is Korkyra\n        (Corcyra), with Thebe next; last of all comes Asopos. There is a legend about Korkyra that she mated with\n        Poseidon.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 72. 1-5 (trans.
