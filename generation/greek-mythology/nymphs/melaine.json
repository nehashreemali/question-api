  "content": "MELAINE (Melaena) was a Naiad-nymph of the springs of Delphoi in Phokis (central Greece). She was the daughter\n        of the river-god Kephisos (Cephisus) and the mother by Apollon of Delphos (Delphus), the eponymous founder of\n        the town.\n\nMelaine was likely numbered amongst the Korykiai (Coryciae)--the nymphs of\n        the sacred Korykian cave. Her name, meaning \"the Black\", would seem to suggest she presided over a\n        subterranean spring.\n\nShe was probably identified with Thyia, the mother of Delphos in another\n        account, Kleodora (Cleodora), the mother of Parnassos, and Korykia, the mother of Lykoras.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 10. 6. 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"They hold that Delphos (Delphus) [eponymous founder of Delphoi (Delphi) in Phokis] was a son of Apollon\n        and Thyia. Others say that his mother was Melaina (Melaena), daughter of Kephisos (Cephisus).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
