  "content": "KLEODORA (Cleodora) was a nymph of Mount Parnassos in Phokis (central Greece). She was loved by the god\n        Poseidon and bore him Parnassos, eponym of the mountain and founder of the pre-Deluge town of Delphoi. She was\n        probably the Naiad-nymph of a spring or fountain of the town and was perhaps numbered amongst the Korykiai (Coryciae)--nymphs of sacred Korykian cave.\n\nKleodora may have been identified with Melaine and Thyia, mothers of Delphos, and Korykia, mother of\n        Lykoras, by the god Apollon.\n\nPARNASSOS (by Poseidon or Kleopompos) (Pausanias 10.6.13)\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 10. 6. 13 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"They say that the oldest city [in the world] was founded here [at Delphoi] by Parnassos (Parnassus), a son\n        of Kleodora (Cleodora), a Nymphe. Like the other heroes, as they are called, he had two fathers; one they say\n        was the god Poseidon, the human father being Kleopompos (Cleopompus). After this Parnassos were named, they say,\n        both the mountain and also the Parnassian glen.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
