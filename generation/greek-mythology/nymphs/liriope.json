  "content": "LIRIOPE was a Naiad-nymph of Phokis (in central Greece). She bore the river-god Kephisos (Cephisus) a beautiful\n        son named Narkissos (Narcissus) who was transformed into his namesake flower.\n\nLiriope's name means \"Face of the Narcissus\" from the Greek words leirion\n        \"narcissus\" and ops \"face.\" Her son was also named for the\n        flower--narkissos in Greek. Leiron and narkissos might be the same plant or could\n        represent two different species of daffodil.\n\nLiriope was probably identified with Lilaia, the Naiad-nymph of the springs of\n        the river Kephisos.\n\nNARKISSOS (by Kephisos) (Ovid\n          Metamorphoses 3.342)\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 3. 342 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Wave-blue water-nymph Liriope, whom once Cephisos in his sinuous flow embracing held and ravished. In due\n        time the lovely Nymphe bore a fine infant boy, from birth adorable, and named her son Narcissus; and of him she\n        asked the seer [Teiresias of Thebes], would he long years and ripe old age enjoy, who answered ‘If he\n        shall himself not know.’ For long his words seemed vain; what they concealed the lad's strange death and\n        stranger love revealed. [Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection and wasted away.]\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
