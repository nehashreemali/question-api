  "content": "ATLANTEIA and PHOIBE (Phoebe) were Hamadryad-nymphs of Libya in north Africa. They\n        were wives of the Libyan King Danaus who bore him ten of his fifty Danaid daughters.\n\nThe names Atlanteia and Phoibe might suggest they were star-nymph daughters of the Titan Atlas rather than\n        simple tree-nymphs.\n\nHIPPODAMEIA, RHODIA, KLEOPATRA, ASTRIA, PHYLODAMEIA, GLAUKE, HIPPOMEDOUSA, GORGE, IPHIMEDOUSA, RHODE (by\n        Danaus) (Apollodorus 2.17)\n\nPHOEBE (Phoibê). A nymph married to Danaus. (Apollod. ii. 1. § 5.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 17 (trans.
