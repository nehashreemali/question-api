  "content": "EIDYIA was an Okeanid-nymph of the town of Kolkhis (Colchis) in Aia at the eastern end of the Black Sea. She\n        was the wife of King Aeetes and the mother of the witch Medea.\n\nEidyia's name was derived from the Greek word eidô meaning \"to see\" or \"to\n        know.\" She probably personified the power of the eye which in Greek superstition was the source of a\n        witch's supernatural powers. As an Okeanid-nymph she was presumably also the Naiad of the main well or fountain\n        of Kolkhis--the marriage of founding-king and local Naiad is a common motif in Greek myth.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Hesiod Theogony 352, 960; Apollonius Rhodius 3.243)\n        [1.2] OKEANOS (Apollodorus 1.129, Cicero De\n          Natura Deorum 3.19)\n\n[1.1] MEDEA (by Aeetes) (Hesiod Theogony 962; Apollodorus 1.129, Hyginus Fabulae\n          25)\n        [1.2] MEDEA, KHALKIOPE (by Aeetes) (Apollonius Rhodius 3.244)\n        [1.3] MEDEA, ABSYRTOS (by Aeetes) (Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.19)\n\nIDYIA or EIDYIA (Iduia), that is, the knowing goddess, a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, and the wife of the\n        Colchian king Aeetes.

Whither goest thou?’ she cries; ‘here\n        are all thy folk, and thy father, not yet angry; this is thy land, thy kingdom. Why trustest thou thyself alone\n        to Achaea? What place hast thou there, a stranger among Inachian maidens? Lies there the home of thy desire, the\n        wedlock thou awaitest? Is this the day I prayed my old age might see? Ah, would that like a bird I could rend\n        with hooked talons the very face of that brigand, and hover above his ship and with loud cry demand my daughter\n        back again! To the Albanian prince was she betrothed, not to thee; no compact made her unhappy parents with\n        thee, Aesonides [Jason]; by no such ruse doth Pelias bid thee escape, or rob the Colchians of their daughters.\n        Keep the fleece, take aught else that our temples hold. But why accuse I thus any mad with undeserved complaint?\n        She herself willed to flee, and avows (ah, horror!) the passion that consumes her. That then was the cause,\n        unhappy girl (for each thing now do I recall), why, ever since the Thessalian oars drew night the shore, no\n        feasting, no seasons gave thee pleasure. No colour hadst thou then, thy voice was faint, thy glance wandered,\n        and ever was thy face a stranger to rejoicing. Why was not so dire a plague revealed to me, that Jason might\n        have taken his place as a son-in-law in our palace, and that thou mightest not have stooped to a flight so base?\n        Or at least we might no have shared all the crime between us, and were voyaging no matter where together; gladly\n        should we both be seeking Thessaly and the city, whate'er its name, of the cruel stranger.’\n        So she spake her mother, and her sisters filled everything with like complaints, shrieking aloud.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
