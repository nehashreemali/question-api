  "content": "AIGLE (Aegle) was the Naiad-nymph mother of the Kharites (Charites) by the sun-god Helios.\n\nThe Kharites were, however, usually described as daughters of Zeus and Eurynome.\n\nZEUS & NEIARA (Servius on Virgil\n          Eclogues 6.20?)\n\nTHE KHARITES (by Helios) (Antimachus Frag, Pausanias 9.35.1, Suidas s.v. Aigles Kharites)\n\nAEGLE (Aiglê), The most beautiful of the Naiads, daughter of Zeus and Neaera (Virg. Eclog. vi.\n        20), by whom Helios begot the Charites. (Paus. ix. 35. § 1.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 9. 35. 1 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Antimakhos (Antimachus) [of Kolophon (Colophon), epic poet C5th B.C.], while giving neither the number of\n        the Kharites (Charites, Graces) nor their names, says that they are daughters of Aigle (Aegle) and Helios (the\n        Sun).\"\n\nSuidas s.v. Aigles Kharites (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek lexicon C10th\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Aigles Kharites (Radiant Graces) : They have plausibly traced the lineage of the Kharites (Charites).\n        Helios (the Sun) is also from Aigle (Aegle), since, it seems, the Kharites are radiant.\"\n\nVirgil, Georgics 6. 13 ff (trans. Fairclough) (Roman bucolic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The [shepherd] lads Chromis and Mnasyllos saw Silenus lying asleep in a cave, his veins swollen, as ever,\n        with the wine of yesterday. Hard by lay the garlands, just fallen from his head, and his heavy tankard was\n        hanging by its well-worn handle. Falling on him--for oft the aged one had cheated both of a promised song--they\n        cast him into fetters made from his own garlands. Aegle joins their company and seconds the timid pair--Aegle,\n        fairest of the Naiades--and, as now his eyes open, paints his face and brows with crimson mulberries.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
