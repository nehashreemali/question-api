  "content": "MELIBOIA (Meliboea) was an Okeanid-nymph of Mount Kyllene (Cyllene) in Arkadia (southern Greece). She was the\n        wife of Pelasgos (Pelasgus), the eponymous first king of the aboriginal Pelasgian tribes of Arkadia.\n\nMeliboia's name was derived from the Greek words meli \"honey-sweet\" and bous \"cow\"--honeyed\n        was an adjective often applied to springs and cow was a favourable term for a woman (whose bride-price was once\n        paid in cattle). Meliboia was probably the same as Kyllene (Cyllene), the wife\n        of Pelasgos by other accounts.\n\nMELIBOEA (Meliboia.) A daughter of Oceanus, and, by Pelasgus, the mother of Lycaon.
