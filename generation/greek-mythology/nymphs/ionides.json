  "content": "THE IONIDES were the Naiad-nymphs of the springs of the River Kytheros (Cytherus) in Elis (southern Greece).\n        Their waters were believed to cure aches and pains.\n\nThe Ionides were similar to the Anigrides--another set of Elean healing\n        nymphs.\n\nKALLIPHAEIA, SYNALLASIS, PEGAIA, IASIS (Pausanias\n            6.22.7)\n\nIO′NIDES (Iônides or Iôniades), a name borne by four nymphs believed to possess healing\n        powers. They had a temple on the river Cytherus in Elis, and derived their name from a mythical Ion, a son of\n        Gargettus, who was believed to have led a colony from Athens to those districts. The story undoubtedly arose\n        from the existence of a mineral spring on the spot where their sanctuary stood.

Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Distant from Olympia about fifty stades is Herakleia (Heraclea), a village of the Eleans, and beside it is\n        a river Kytheros (Cytherus). A spring flows into the river, and there is a sanctuary of Nymphai (Nymphs) near\n        the spring. Individually the names of the Nymphai are Kalliphaeia (Calliphaea), Synallasis, Pegaia (Pegaea) and\n        Iasis, but their common surname is Ionides. Those who bathe in the spring are cured of all sorts of aches and\n        pains. They say the Nymphai are named after Ion, the son of Gargettos, who migrated to this place from\n        Athens.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
