  "content": "NONAKRIS (Nonacris) was the Naiad-nymph of the springs of the town of Nonakris in Arkadia, southern Greece. She\n        was the wife of the impious Arkadian King Lykaon (Lycaon) and the mother of the bear-maiden Kallisto (Callisto).\n\nNonakris is connected with the Arkadian nymphs Kyllene (Cyllene) and Nomia both of which are named as the wife of Lykaon in alternate accounts.\n\nPerhaps a daughter of a local RIVER-GOD, though nowhere stated\n\n[1.1] KALLISTO (by Lykaon) (Pausanias 8.3.6\n          & 8.17.6, Ovid Metamorphoses 2.409)\n\nNONACRIS (Nônakris), the wife of Lycaon, from whom the town of Nonacris in Arcadia was believed to have\n        derived its name. (Paus. viii. 17. § 5.) From this town Hermes and Evander are called Nonacriates and\n        Nonacrius, in the general sense of Arcadian. (Steph. Byz. s. v. Nônakris; Ov.
