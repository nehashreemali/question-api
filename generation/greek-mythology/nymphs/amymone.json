  "content": "AMYMONE was the Naiad-nymph of the spring of Amymone at Lerna in Argolis (southern Greece).\n\nShe was usually, but not always, identical to the Danaid Amymone loved by\n        Poseidon.\n\nCallimachus, Aetia Fragment 66 (trans. Trypanis) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"O water Nympha Nepodes (Water Nymph) bride of Poseidon [Amymone] . . . the sacred rock about which you\n        flow . . . Venerable Amymone, and beloved Physadea and Hippe and Automate [i.e. other fountains of Argos], hail,\n        most ancient home of Nymphai; flow, brilliant Pelasgian maidens.\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 4. 374 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Io in the form of a heifer was driven from Argos by a stinging gadfly:] Then departing gave she last\n        kisses to her father's [Inakhos'] banks; wailed [her sister Naiades] Amymone, wailed Messeis' waters, wailed\n        Hyperia with arms outstretched to call her back . . . Wandering she [Io freed from Argos but now hounded by an\n        Erinys] comes even to the waters of Inachus, how faring and how changed from that first heifer that she was! Nor\n        do her father or the frightened Nymphae try to draw nigh her.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
