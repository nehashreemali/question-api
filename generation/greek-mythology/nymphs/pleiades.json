Five of the other Pleiades were also loved by gods becoming ancestresses\n        of various royal families including those of Sparta and Troy. When they were pursued by the lustful giant Orion, Zeus placed them amongst the stars as the constellation\n        Pleiades.\n\nTheir name means \"Daughters of Pleione\" and also \"Ladies of Plenty\" from the Greek word\n        pleiôn \"plenty.\"\n\n[1.1] ATLAS (Hesiod Astronomy Frag 1,\n          Aeschylus Frag 172, Ovid Metamorphoses 6.172)\n        [1.2] ATLAS & PLEIONE (Apollodorus 3.110, Hyginus Fabulae 192, Hyginus Astronomica 2.21, Ovid Fasti 4.169 &\n          5.79)\n        [1.3] ATLAS & AITHRA (Musaeus Frag, Hyginus Astronomica 2.21, Ovid Fasti\n          5.164)\n\n[1.1] TAYGETE, ELEKTRA, ALKYONE, STEROPE, KELAINO, MAIA, MEROPE (Hesiod Astronomy, Apollodorus 3.110, Aratus\n          Phaenomena 254, Hyginus Fabulae 192, Hyginus Astronomica 2.21, Ovid Fasti 4.169, Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          3.330)\n\nPLEIADES (Pleiades or Peleiades), the Pleiads, are called daughters of Atlas by Pleione (or by the Oceanid\n        Aethra, Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1155), or Erechtheus (Serv. ad Aen. i. 744), of Cadmus (Theon,\n        ad. Arat. p. 22), or of the queen of the Amazons. (Schol. ad Theocrit. xiii. 25.) They were\n        the sisters of the Hyades, and seven in number, six of whom are described as visible, and the seventh as\n        invisible. Some call the seventh Sterope, and relate that she became invisible from shame, because she alone\n        among her sisters had had intercourse with a mortal man ; others call her Electra, and make her disappear from\n        the choir of her sisters on account of her grief at the destruction of the house of Dardanus (Hygin. Fab.\n          192, Poet. Astr. ii. 21). The Pleiades are said to have made away with themselves from grief at the death\n        of their sisters, the Hyades, or at the fate of their father, Atlas, and were afterwards placed as stars at the\n        back of Taurus, where they form a cluster resembling a bunch of grapes, whence they were sometimes called botrus\n        (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1155). According to another story, the Pleiades were virgin companions of Artemis,\n        and, together with their mother Pleione, were pursued by the hunter Orion in Boeotia; their prayer to be rescued\n        from him was heard by the gods, and they were metamorphosed into doves (peleiades), and placed among the stars\n        (Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 21; Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. iii. 226; Pind. Nem. ii. 17).\n        The rising of the Pleiades in Italy was about the beginning of May, and their setting about the beginning of\n        November. Their names are Electra, Maia, Taygete, Alcyone, Celaeno, Sterope, and Merope (Tzetz. ad Lyc.\n        219, comp. 149; Apollod. iii. 10. § 1). The scholiast of Theocritus (xiii. 25) gives the following\n        different set of names : Coccymo, Plaucia, Protis, Parthemia, Maia, Stonychia, Lampatho. (Comp.

Still\n        riseth up in sight of toil-worn men their bright troop in the skies; but she alone hides viewless ever, since\n        the hallowed town [Troy] of her son Dardanos in ruin fell.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 192 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Atlas by Pleione or an Oceanitide (Oceanid) had twelve daughters, and a son, Hyas. The son was killed by a\n        wild boar or a lion, and the sisters, grieving for him, died of this grief. The five of them first put among the\n        stars have their place between the horns of the bull . . . and are called, from their brother's name, Hyades . .\n        . \n        The rest of the sisters, later dying from grief, were made stars, and because they were many, were called\n        Pleiades. Some think they were so named because they are joined together, that is, plesion, for they\n        are so close together that they can scarcely be counted, nor can anyone be sure whether they are six or seven in\n        number. Their names are as follows : Electra, Alcyone, Celaeno, Merope, Sterope, Taygeta, and Maia. Of these,\n        they say Electra does not appear, because of the death of Dardanus and the loss of Troy. Others think that\n        Merope appears to blush because she had a mortal as husband, though the others had gods. Driven from the band of\n        her sisters because of this, she wears her hair long in grief, and is called a comet, or longodes\n        because she trails out for a long distance, or xiphias because she shows the shape of a sword-point.\n        This star, too, portends grief.\"\n        [N.B. In Greek longodes means \"spear-shaped\", not \"long\" as Hyginus says.]\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 7 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Others say that when Mercurius [Hermes[ first made the lure on Mount Cyllene in Arcadia, he made it with\n        seven strings to correspond to the number of Atlantides [Pleiades], since Maia, his mother, was of their\n        company.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 21 :\n        \"The Pleiades (Many) were so named, according to Musaeus [a legendary Greek poet], because fifteen\n        daughters were born to Atlas and Aethra, daughter of Oceanus. Five of them are called Hyades, he shows, because\n        their brother was Hyas, a youth dearly beloved by his sisters. When he was killed in a lion hunt, the five we\n        have mentioned, given over to continual lamentation, are said to have perished. Because they grieved exceedingly\n        at his death, they are called Hyades.\n        The remaining ten brooded over the death of their sisters, and brought death on themselves; because so may\n        experienced the same grief, they were called Pleiades.\n        Alexander says they were called Hyades because they were daughters of Hyas and Boeotia, Pleiades, because born\n        of Pleio, daughter of Oceanus, and Atlas.\n        The Pleiades are called seven in number, but only six can be seen. This reason has been advanced, that of the\n        seven, six mated with immortals--three with Jove [Zeus], two with Neptunus [Poseidon], and one with Mars\n        [Ares]); the seventh was said to have been the wife of Sisyphus. From Electra and Jove [Zeus], Dardanus was\n        born; from Maia and Jove [Zeus], Mercurius [Hermes]; from Taygete and Jove [Zeus], Ladedaemon; from Alcyone and\n        Neptunus [Poseidon], Hyrieus; from Celaeno and Neptunus [Poseidon], Lycus and Nycteus. Mars [Ares] by Sterope\n        begat Oenomaus, but others call her the wife of Oenomaus. Merope, wed to Sisyphus, bore Glaucus, who, as many\n        say, was the father of Bellerophon.\n        On account of her other sisters she was placed among the constellations, but because she married a mortal, her\n        star is dim. Others say Electra does not appear because the Pleiades are thought to lead the circling dance for\n        the stars, but after Troy was captured and her descendants through Dardanus overthrown, moved by grief she left\n        them and took her place in the circle called Arctic. From this she appears, in grief for such a long time, with\n        her hair unbound, that, because of this, she is called a comet.\n        But ancient astronomers placed these Pleiades, daughters of Pleione and Atlas, as we have said, apart from the\n        Bull. When Pleione once was travelling through Boeotia with her daughters, Orion, who was accompanying her,\n        tried to attack her. She escaped, but Orion sought her for seven years and couldn't find her. Jove [Zeus],\n        pitying the girls, appointed a way to the stars, and later, by some astronomers, they were called the Bull's\n        tail. And so up to this time Orion seems to be following them as they flee towards the west.\n        Our writers call these stars Vergiliae, because they rise after spring. They have still greater honour than the\n        others, too, because their rising is a sign of summer, their setting of winter--a thing is not true of the other\n        constellations.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 6. 172 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"My [Niobe's] mother [Dione] ranks as sister of the Pleiades.

The setting of\n        the Pleiades in November marked the beginning of the stormy season.]\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 5. 304 ff :\n        \"As when Jupiter [Zeus] darts the lightning from his high citadel, ay, when he stirs the Pleiades and\n        mingled rain and thunder or freezing snow, when the whole plain is hidden by the white downpour.\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 5. 408 ff :\n        \"[Depicted on the walls of the palace of King Aeetes :] There iron Atlas stands in Oceanus, the wave\n        swelling and breaking on his knees; but the god himself [Helios the Sun] on high hurries his shining steeds\n        across the old man's body . . . behind with smaller wheel follows his sister [Selene the moon] and the crowded\n        Pleiades and the fires whose tresses are wet with dripping rain [i.e. the Hyades].\"\n\nStatius, Silvae 1. 6. 21 (trans. Mozley) (Roman poetry C1st A.D.) :\n        \"With such torrents do stormy Hyades o'erwhelm the earth of Pleiades dissolved in rain.\"\n\nStatius, Silvae 3. 2. 1 :\n        \"But when they spied vessels, the billows swelled with rage, and the hurricane arose against man. Then the\n        Pleiades and the Olenian Goat grew dark with storm, and Orion was more wrathful than his wont.\"\n        [N.B. \"The Olenian Goat\" is the star-group Capra on the shoulder of the constellation Auriga whose\n        rising marked the onset of seasonal storms.]\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Servius on Virgil's Aeneid 8.130.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
