  "content": "PHILYRE (Philyra) was an Okeanid-nymph of Mount Pelion in Thessalia (Thessaly) loved by the Titan Kronos\n        (Cronus). When his wife Rhea came upon their rendeavouz, he quickly\n        transformed himself into a horse to escape detection. As a result, Philyre birthed a half-horse, half-man\n        hybrid, the kentauros Kheiron (centaur Chiron). To ease her shame Kronos transformed the girl into a linden tree\n        (philyra in Greek).\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS (Eumelus Titanomochia Frag 6;\n          Apollonius Rhodius 2.1233; Hyginus Fabulae 138)\n\n[1.1] KHEIRON (Hesiod Theogony 1001;\n          Pindar Nemean 3.43)\n        [1.2] KHEIRON (by Kronos) (Eumelus Titanomochia Frag 6;\n          Apollonius Rhodius 2.1233; Apollodorus 1.9, Ovid Metamorphoses 6.126, Virgil Georgics 3.92 & 3.549, Pliny\n          Natural History 7.197)\n        [1.3] KHEIRON, DOLOPS (by Kronos) (Hyginus Preface & Fabulae\n          138)\n        [2.1] APHROS (by Kronos)\n        (Suidas s.v.
