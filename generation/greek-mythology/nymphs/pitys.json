  "content": "PITYS was an Oreiad-nymph loved by the god Pan. She fled his advances and\n        was transformed into a mountain pine or fir tree.\n\nNowhere stated, but perhaps a daughter of the Arkadian River-God LADON\n\nPITYS (Pitus), a nymph beloved by Pan, was changed into a fir tree. (Lucian, Dial. Deor. 22. 4; Virg.\n        Eclog. vii. 24.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 1. 689 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Pan returning from Mount Lycaeus, crowned with his wreath of pine [an allusion to Pitys], saw Syrinx once\n        [another Nymph loved by Pan].\"\n\nVirgil, Eclogues 7. 24 (trans. Fairclough) (Roman bucolic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"Here on the sacred pine shall I hang my tuneful pipe.\" [N.B. The mountain pine or fir was sacred to\n        Pan.]\n\nPropertius, Elegies 1. 18 (trans. Goold) (Roman elegy C1st B.C.) :\n        \"If trees known any love, Beech and Pine [i.e. Pitys] beloved of the god of Arcady [Pan].\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 42. 257 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"Sing also of Pitys who hated marriage, who fled fast as the wind over the mountains to escape the unlawful\n        wooing of Pan, and her fate--how she disappeared into the soil herself; put the blame of Ge (Gaea, the Earth)!\n        Then she may perhaps lament the sorrows and the fate of the wailing Nymphe.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 2. 92 ff :\n        \"[A Hamadryas nymphe laments the loss of her pine tree :] ‘May die before I wed, and go to Haides a\n        virgin, still a stranger to Eros (Love), like Pitys and like Daphne! . . . I tremble at your lustful Pan, who\n        will persecute me like Pitys, like Syrinx.’\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 16. 356 ff :\n        \"[The nymphe Nikaia (Nicaea) laments her violation by Dionysos in a drunken sleep :] ‘Hamadryas\n        Nymphai (Hamadryad Nymphs), whom shall I blame for Hypnos (Sleep), Eros (Love), trickery and wine, are the\n        robbers of my maiden state! . . . Why did not Pitys (the Pine) whisper in my ear [i.e. to warn her of the\n        danger], too low for Bakkhos (Bacchus) to hear . . . \"Maiden, beware, drink not the deceiving\n        water!\"?’\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Lucian Dialogues of the Gods 2.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
