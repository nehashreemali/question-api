  "content": "OKYRHOE (Ocyrhoe) was a Naiad-nymph of the Aegean island of Samos. She was pursued by the god Apollon and when\n        she tried to flee from the island, he turned the boat to stone and the sailor into a pilot-fish.\n\nAelian, On Animals 15. 23 (trans. Schofield) (Greek natural history C2nd to 3rd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Apollonios of Rhodes or of Naukratis says that the pilot-fish was once actually a human being and a\n        ferryman. And Apollon fell in love with a maiden [i.e. Okyrhoe byt she is not named here] and attempted to lie\n        with her, but she escaped and came to Miletos (Miletus) and implored one Pompilos (Pompilus), a seaman, to\n        conduct her across the strait. He agreed to do so, but Apollon appeared and seized the maiden, turned the ship\n        to stone, and transformed Pompilos into this fish.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
