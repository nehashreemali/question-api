  "content": "NAIADES (Naiads) were the nymphs of rivers, streams, lakes, marshes, fountains and\n        springs. They were minor goddesses who attended the assemblies of the gods on Mount Olympos.\n\nThe Naiad nymphs were sometimes classified by domain:--\n        (1) Pegaiai (Pegaeae) were the nymphs of springs;\n        (2) Krenaiai (Crenaeae) were naiads of fountains;\n        (3) Potameides presided over rivers and streams;\n        (4) Limnades and Limnatides inhabited lakes; and\n        (5) Heleionomai were the nymphs of marshes and wetlands.\n\nNaiades, in conjunction with the goddess Artemis, were nurses of the\n        young and the protectors of girls, overseeing their safe passage from child to adult. Apollon and the River-Gods were the\n        complimentary guardians of boys.\n\nIn myth many Naiades were the wives of kings and hold a prominent place in the royal genealogies. Others, such\n        as the beautiful daughters of the River Asopos, were loved by the gods. They often gave their names to towns,\n        cities and islands, and as such were surely regarded as the goddess-protectors of a settlement's main water\n        supply such as a spring, fountain, or well.\n\nOf the various types of Naiad, the Pegaiai (of Springs) and the Krinaiai (of Fountains) were the ones most\n        often individualised and worshipped. Those whose waters were believed to possess some special property might\n        even have proper shrines and cults. Examples of these include the Anigrides of Elis whose waters were believed\n        to cure disease and the Nymphs of Mount Helikon and Delphoi whose springs were thought to be fonts of poetic and\n        prophetic inspiration.\n\nThe Naiades were depicted as beautiful young women, usually seated, standing or reclining beside a spring, and\n        holding a water-jug (hydria) or a frond of lush foliage.\n\n[1] THE POTAMOI (River-Gods) (Homer, Hesiod,\n          and other sources)\n        [2] ZEUS (Homer Odyssey 17.240)\n\nNAIADES. Nymphs of the watery element. The rivers were represented by the Potameides\n        (Potamêïdes), who, as local divinities, were named after their rivers, as Acheloides, Anigrides,\n        Ismenides, Amniisiades, Pactolides. (Apollon. Rhod. iii. 1219; Virg. Aen. viii. 70; Paus. v. 5. § 6, i. 31.\n        § 2; Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 15; Ov. Met. vi. 16; Steph. Byz. s.v. Amnisos.) But\n        the nymphs of fresh water, whether of rivers, lakes, brooks, or wells, are also designated by the general name\n        Naiades, Nêïdes, though they have in addition their specific names, as Krênaiai, Pêgaiai,\n        Heleionomoi, Limnatides, or Limnades. (Hom. Od. xvii. 240; Apollon. Rhod. iii. 1219; Theocrit. v. 17;\n        Orph. Hymn. 50. 6, Argon. 644.) Even the rivers of the lower regions are described as having\n        their nymphs; hence, Nymphae infernae paludis and Avernales. (Ov. Met. v. 540,\n        Fast. ii. 610.) Many of these presided over waters or springs which were believed to inspire those that\n        drank of them, and hence the nymphs themselves were thought to be endowed with prophetic or oracular power, and\n        to inspire men with the same, and to confer upon them the gift of poetry. (Paus. iv. 27. § 2, ix. 3. §\n        5, 34. § 3; Plut. Aristid. 11; Theocrit. vii. 92.) Inspired soothsayers or priests are therefore\n        sometimes called numphogêptoi. (Plat. Phaedr. p. 421, e.) Their powers, however, vary with those\n        of the springs over which they preside; some were thus regarded as having the power of restoring sick persons to\n        health (Pind. Ol. xii. 26; Paus. v. 5. § 6, vi. 22. § 4); and as water is necessary to feed\n        all vegetation as well as all living beings, the water nymphs (Hydriades) were also worshipped along with\n        Dionysus and Demeter as giving life and blessings to all created beings, and this attribute is expressed by a\n        variety of epithets, such as karpotrophoi, aipolikai, nomiai, kourotrophoi,\n        &c. As their influence was thus exercised in all departments of nature, they frequently appear in connection\n        with higher divinities, as, for example, with Apollo, the prophetic god and the protector of herds and flocks\n        (Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1218); with Artemis, the huntress and the protectress of game, for she herself was\n        originally an Arcadian nymph (Apollon. Rhod. i. 1225, iii. 881; Paus. iii. 10. § 8); with Hermes, the\n        fructifying god of flocks (Hom. Hymn. in Aphrod. 262); with Dionysus (Orph. Hymn. 52; Horat.\n        Carm. i. 1. 31, ii. 19. 3); with Pan, the Seileni and Satyrs, whom they join in their Bacchic revels\n        and dances.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nN.B. Most of these names were used as adjectives for nymphs so marsh-nymphs were Nymphai Heleionomoi, the\n        nymphs of springs were Nymphai Pegaiai, etc.\n\nHomer, Iliad 20. 4 ff ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"But Zeus, from the many-folded peak of Olympos, told Themis to summon all the gods into assembly. She went\n        everywhere, and told them to make thier way to Zeus' house. There was no River [Potamoi] that was not there,\n        except only Okeanos (Oceanus), there was not one of the Nymphai (Nymphs) who live in the lovely groves\n        (alsea) [i.e. Dryades], and the springs of rivers (pegai potamon) [i.e. Naiades] and the\n        grassy meadows (pisea poiêenta), who came not. These all assembling into the house of Zeus\n        cloud-gathering took places among the smooth-stone cloister walks.\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 6. 121 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"A shriek rang in my ears just then--womanish, it seemed. Did it come from girls--did it come from Nymphai\n        (Nymphs) who live on high mountain-tops (orea) or in river-springs (pegai potamon) or in\n        grassy meadows (pisea)?\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 10. 348 ff :\n        \"They [the Nymphai (Nymphs)] come from springs (krênai) [i.e. Naiades], they come from\n        groves (alsea) [Dryades], they come from the sacred rivers (potamoi) [Naiades] flowing\n        seawards.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 5 to Aphrodite 94 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th to 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The Nymphai (Nymphs) [of Mount Ida] who haunt the pleasant woods (alsea) [i.e. Dryades], or of\n        those who inhabit this lovely mountain (oros) [i.e. Oreiades] and the springs of rivers (pegai\n          potamoi) [i.e. Naiades] and grassy meads (pisea). I will make you an altar upon a high peak in a\n        far seen place, and will sacrifice rich offerings to you at all seasons. And do you feel kindly towards me and\n        grant [good fortune].\"\n\nAlcman, Fragment 563 (from Scholiast on Homer's Iliad) (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek\n          Lyric II) (C7th B.C.) :\n        \"Some say there are many kinds of nymphs, e.g. Alcman : Naides (Naiads) and Lampades and Thyiades.\"\n\nPratinus, Fragment 708 (trans.

Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"To the Nymphai (Nymphs) [Okeanides and Naiades], Fumigation from Aromatics. Nymphai, who from Okeanos\n        (Oceanus) famed derive your birth, who dwell in liquid caverns of the earth; nurses of Bakkhos (Bacchus)\n        [Dionysos], secret-coursing powers, fructiferous Goddesses, who nourish flowers: earthly-rejoicing, who in\n        meadows dwell, and caves and dens, who depths extend to hell.

Naides (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek lexicon C10th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Naides : Springs. Or Nymphai (Nymphs) who dwell by the streams.\"\n\nThe most celebrated of the Naiades were the goddess-nymphs of the scattered islands of Greece. Each and every\n        island had its own Naiad for whom the island was often named. She represented the island's primary source of\n        water--be it a well or a spring--which made it habitable. They were usually daughters of the nearest mainland\n        river whose streams were thought to supply the spring with fresh-water. For example, the eponymous nymph of the\n        island of Salamis was a daughter of the mainland River Asopos and Samia of Samos was the daughter of the\n        mainland river Maiandros.\n\nSome of the more significant island Naiades were Aigina and Salamis of the islands in the Argolic Gulf, Euboia and Samia of the Aegean, and Korkyra of the Ionian Sea.\n\nAnother important group of Naiades were the eponymous goddess-nymphs of towns and cities. These presided over\n        the settlement's primary source of fresh-water--usually a spring or a well. They were usually described as\n        daughters of a local River-God, although Greek colonies often portrayed their town-Naiades as emigrant daughters\n        of Greek rivers--for example the Arkadian nymph Arethousa of the springs of Syrakousa (Syracuse) in Sicily and\n        the Argive nymph Sinope of the goddess of the Black Sea colony of Sinope.\n\nSome important town Naiades include:- Thebe, Plataia, Tanagra, Anthedon, Thespia and Thisbe, six eponymous nymphs of Boiotian towns; Peirene of the fountain of Korinthos (Corinth); the Sithnides of the fountain of Megara; Daulis\n        of a town in Phokis; Sparte and Pitane in\n        Lakonia; Mykene, Nemea, and Mideia in Argolis; Thelpousa in Arkadia; and\n        the nymphs Arethousa, Sinope and Kyrene of Greek colonies in Sicily, the Black Sea region and Libya\n        respectively.\n\nRural springs and fountains also had their Naiades. Springs which were believed to possess special\n        properties--such as healing or poetic inspiration-often had cults associated with them.\n\nSome important rural spring Naiades include the Mysian Naiades who abducted\n        Hylas, the Korykiai (Coryciae) of the sacred springs of Delphoi, the Anigrides and Ionides of two curative\n        springs in Elis, Telphousa and the Leibethrides of Mount Helikon, the Himerian\n          Nymphs of certain hot-springs in Sicily, and Salmakis the nymph of a\n        reputedly effemenizing spring in Karia.\n\nHomer, Odyssey 13. 140 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"At the harbour-head [of Ithaka] is a long-leaved olive-tree; near this lies a twilit cave, a most lovely\n        one, sacred to those Nymphai (Nymphs) called Naides (Naiads) [of the cavern's springs]; in it are bowls of stone\n        and pitchers of stone; bees also store honey there; and then there are long looms of stone on which the Nymphai\n        weave tissues of ocean-purple that ravish the gazing eye. There are streams there too that flow perpetually; and\n        there are two entrances into it, a northern entrance that mortals may descend by and a southern one that belongs\n        to the gods; by this no human being may enter; it is the pathway of the immortals.\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 17. 240 ff :\n        \"Lifting his hands he [Odysseus] prayed aloud : ‘Nymphai (Nymphs) of the fountain [Naiades],\n        daughters of Zeus, if ever upon your altars Odysseus has made burnt-offerings from his young sheep and goats and\n        covered the thigh-bones with rich fat, I beg you to grant this wish of mine: May that man return, with a god for\n        a guide.’\"\n\nPindar, Olympian Ode 12. 26 ff (trans.

Why ask so slight a tale of Phoebus [Apollon]? Do you, O Naides\n        (Naiads), relate the cause, and you compliant Fauni (Fauns) [Satyroi]--ye will suffice--inspire my song.\n        Frightened troops of Nymphae (Nymphs) were fleeing from Pan; on he came, as though all were his quarry, yet on\n        [the Naiad] Pholoe alone was he bent. By copse and stream she fled, shunning now the hairy following limbs, now\n        the wanton horns. Through Janus' grove [at the foot of the Capitol at Rome], scene of battles, and Cacus' deadly\n        haunts [on the Aventine Hill]; through the fields of Quirinus she came running a-tiptoe and gained the Caelian\n        wilds; there at last wearied out and fordone with fear--where to-day stand the quiet home of hospitable\n        Melior--she gathered her saffron robe closer about her, and sank down on the edge of the snow-white bank.\n        Swiftly follows the shepherd-god, and deems the maid his bride; already he allays the panting of his fevered\n        breast, already he hovers lightly o'er his prey. Lo! With speedy steps Diana [Artemis] approached, as she ranges\n        the seven hills and tracks the flight of a deer on Aventine; the goddess was vexed to see it, and turning to her\n        trusty comrades : ‘Shall I never keep this unseemly, wanton brood from lustful rapine? Must my chaste band\n        of followers ever grow fewer?’\n        So speaking she drew a short shaft from her quiver, but sped it not from the bent bow or with the wonted twang,\n        but was content to fling it with one hand, and touched--so 'tis said--the left hand of the drowsy Naiad with the\n        arrow-feathers. She awaking beheld at once the day and her wanton foe, and lest she should bare her snow-white\n        limbs plunged just as she was with all her raiment into the lake, and at the bottom of the mere, believing Pan\n        was following, she wrapped the weeds about her.\n        What could the robber do, so suddenly baffled? Conscious of his shaggy hide, and from childhood untaught to\n        swim, he dares not trust himself to the deep waters. Lavish complaint made he of heartless Bromius [Dionysos],\n        of the jealous lake and jealous shaft; then spying a young plane tree with long stem and countless branches and\n        summit aspiring to heaven he set it by him and heaped fresh sand about it and sprinkled it with the longed-for\n        waters, and thus commanded it : ‘Live long, O tree, as the memorable token of my vow, and do thou at least\n        stoop down and cherish the secret abode of this hard-hearted Nympha, and cover her waters with thy leaves. Let\n        her not, I pray, though she has deserved it, be scorched by the sun's heat or lashed by cruel hail; only mind\n        thou to bestrew the pool with thickly scattered leaves. Then will I long remember thee and the mistress of this\n        kindly place, and guard both a secure old age, so that the trees of Jove [the oak of Zeus] and Phoebus [the\n        laurel of Apollon], and the twy-coloured poplar shade and my own pines may marvel at thy boughs.’\n        So he spake; and the tree, quickened with the old passion of the god, hangs and broods over the full mere with\n        drooping stem, and searches the waves with loving shadows, and hops for their embrace; but he breath of the\n        waters put it from them, and suffered not its touch. At length it struggles upward, and poised upon its base\n        cunningly lifts its head without any knot, as though it sank with another root into the bottom of the lake. Now\n        not even the Nais, Phoebe's [Artemis'] votary, hates it, but her stream invites the boughs she banished.\"\n\nNaiades, along with several other types of nymphs, formed the train of the god Dionysos.
