  "content": "OTHREIS was an Oreiad-nymph of Mount Othrys in Malis, northern Greece. She was loved by the gods Zeus and\n        Apollon and bore Meliteus to one and Phagros to the other.\n\nOthreis may have been identified with the Thessalian nymphe Kyrene\n          (Cyrene) and her son Meliteus (Of the Bees) with the rustic-god Aristaios (Aristaeus).\n\n[1] PHAGROS (by Apollon) (Antoninus\n          Liberalis 13)\n        [2]\n        MELITEUS (by Zeus) (Antoninus Liberalis\n          13)\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 13 (trans. Celoria) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Zeus and the Nymphe Othreis had a child, Meliteus (Bee-Man). In fear of Hera because of her own\n        intercourse with Zeus, his mother exposed the child in a wood. By the will of Zeus the child was not lost to\n        sight but was fed by bees and began to grow. As he was pasturing his sheep, Phagros (Phagrus), son of Apollon\n        and Othreis the Nymphe, the same mother of this babe in the wood, chanced to come across him. Marvelling at how\n        well-fed the child was, and even more at the bees, he gathered him up and took him home [to Phthia]. He brought\n        him up with great care and gave him the name Meliteus (Bee-Man) because he had been nourished by bees.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
