  "content": "DAEIRA was an Okeanid-nymph of the town in Eleusis in Attika (southern Greece). She may have been the Naiad of\n        the town's famous well, the Kallikhoros (Callichorus), where Demeter first rested upon entering Eleusis. She was\n        also the mother of the town's eponymous king Eleusis by the god Hermes.\n\nDaeira was surely connected with the rites of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Her name means \"Knowing One\"\n        or \"Teacher\" from the Greek verb daô which appears to connect her with the instruction\n        of initiates in the secret knowledge of the Mysteries. The name Daeira was also an Eleusinian title of the\n        goddess Persephone. Daeira may also have been identified with the\n        Eleusinian Hekate who, according to some, was a consort of Hermes\n        Khthonios (the Guide of the Dead).\n\nDAEIRA (Daeira or Daira), that is, \"the knowing,\" a divinity connected with the Eleusinian mysteries.\n        According to Pausanias (i. 38. § 7) she was a daughter of Oceanus, and became by Hermes the mother of\n        Eleusis; but others called her a sister of Styx; while a third account represents her as identical with\n        Aphrodite, Demeter, Hera, or Persephone. (Apollon. Rhod. iii. 847; Eustath, ad Hom. p. 648.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 38. 7 (trans.
