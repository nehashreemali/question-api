  "content": "EUADNE (Evadne) was the Naiad-nymph of a well or fountain of the town of Argos in Argolis (southern Greece).\n        She was the wife of Argos (Argus), the eponymous founding-king of the town and the mother of four sons--Kriasos\n        (Criasus), next king of Argos, Ekbasos (Ecbasus), father of hundred-eyed giant Argos Panoptes, Peiras, father of\n        the drakaina (she-dragon) Ekhidna, and Epidauros, founding prince of\n        the town of Epidauros. Somewhat curiously she was described as a daughter of the river-god Styrmon in distant\n        Thrake, which might symbolise an ancient colonisation or the introduction of a cult from that region.\n\nEuadne was probably identified with Ismene, the wife of King Argos in other\n        accounts.\n\n[1.1] EKBASOS, PEIRAS, EPIDAUROS, KRIASOS (by Argos) (Apollodorus 2.3)\n        [1.2] EKBASOS, PIRANTHOS (corrupt), KRIASOS (by Argos) (Hyginus Fabulae 145)\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 3 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Niobe the first mortal woman with hom Zeus had sex, bore Zeus a son Argos (Argus) . . . He got the rule\n        and named the Peloponnesos Argos after himself. He married Euadne (Evadne), the daughter of Strymon and Neaira\n        (Neaera), and sired Ekbasos (Ecbasus), Peiras, Epidauros (Epidaurus), and Kriasos (Criasus). The son of Ekbasos\n        was Agenor, and his son was Argos surnamed Panoptes. This man had eyes all over his body . . .\n        It is also said that he waited until Ekhidna (Echidna) fell asleep, and then killed her. She was a daughter of\n        Tartaros and Ge (the Earth), who would kidnap travellers passing by . . .\n        Argos [son of Niobe]\n        and Asopos' daughter Ismene had a son Iasos, who is alleged to be the father of Io.\"\n        [N.B.

From Argus and Evadne, Criasus, Piranthus [Peiras], and Ecbasus were born; from Piranthus and\n        Callirhoe, Argus, Arestorides, and Triopas.\" [N.B. The genealogy appears to be corrupt.]\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
