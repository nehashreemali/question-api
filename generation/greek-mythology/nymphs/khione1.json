  "content": "KHIONE (Chione) was a nymph of Mount Haimos (Haemus) in Thrake (north of Greece). She was a daughter of Boreas,\n        god of the north-wind, and Oreithyia, the lady of mountain gales. Khione was probably a goddess of snow\n        (khiôn).\n\nAnother nymph named Khione was a consort of Boreas.\n\n[1.1] BOREAS & OREITHYIA (Apollodorus 3.199, Pausanias 3.15.2)\n        [1.2] BOREAS (Hyginus Fabulae 157)\n\n[1.1] EUMOLPOS (by Poseidon) (Apollodorus 3.201, Pausanias 3.15.4, Hyginus Fabulae 157)\n\nCHI′ONE (Chionê). A daughter of Boreas and Oreithyia, and sister of Cleopatra, Zetes, and Calais.\n        She became by Poseidon the mother of Eumolpus, and in order to conceal the event, she threw the boy into the\n        sea; but the child was saved by Poseidon.

But Poseidon rescued\n        him and took him to Aithiopia (Ethiopia), where he gave him to his and Amphitrite's daughter Benthesikyme\n        (Benthesicyme) to rear.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 38. 2 (trans.
