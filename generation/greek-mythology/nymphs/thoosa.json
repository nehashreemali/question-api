  "content": "THOOSA was the sea-nymph mother of the Kyklops (Cyclops) Polyphemos by the god Poseidon.\n\nHer name was derived from the Greek word thoos \"swift\" and she may have been a minor goddess\n        of dangerously swift currents.\n\nThoosa was probably envisaged as a mermaid-like woman with the tail of a serpentine-fish in place of legs. Two\n        of her sisters possessed a similar form--the monstrous mermaid Skylla\n          (Syclla) and the serpent-nymph Ekhidna (Echidna).\n\nPOLYPHEMOS (by Poseidon) (Homer Odyssey 1.70,\n          Apollodorus E7.4)\n\nHomer, Odyssey 1. 68 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"Polyphemos (Polyphemus), the Kyklops (Cyclops) whose power is greatest among the Kyklopes race and whose\n        ancestry is more than human; his mother was the nymphe Thoosa, child of Phorkys (Phorcys) the lord of the barren\n        sea, and she lay with Poseidon within her arching caverns.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E7. 4 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"A son of Poseidon and a nymphe named Thoose (Thoosa), an enormous man-eating wild man named Polyphemos,\n        who had one eye in his forehead.\"\n\nTheocritus, Idylls 11. 25 ff (trans. Rist) (Greek bucolic C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"[The Kyklops Polyphemos woos the Nereid-nymph Galateia :] ‘I fell in love with you, maiden, the\n        first time you came, with my mother [i.e. Thoosa], eager to cull the bluebells from our hillside : I was you\n        guide.’\"\n\nTheocritus, Idylls 11. 62 ff :\n        \"[Polyphemos laments :] ‘Only my mother [i.e. Thoosa] does me wrong, and it's her I blame. She's\n        never said a single word on my behalf to you [the Nereid-nymph Galateia], for all she sees me growing thin, day\n        after day. I shall tell her that my head and both my feet are throbbing: so I'll be even, making her suffer,\n        even as she makes me.’\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
