  "content": "PEIRENE was the Naiad-nymph of a fountain in the city of Korinthos (Corinth), southern Greece. She was a\n        daughter of the Sikyonian river-god Asopos who was abducted to the site of the town by the god Poseidon. Their,\n        sons Lekhes (Leches) and Kenkhrias (Cenchrias), were the eponymous founders of the city's twin ports--one on\n        each side of the Isthmos.\n\nPeirene's name was derived from the Greek word peirainô meaning \"to tie\" or\n        \"fasten.\" This might have referred to the important portage-road linking the two ports or was perhaps\n        connected with the story of Bellerophon who yoked the winged-horse Pegasos beside her spring.\n\n[1.1] ASOPOS (Bacchylides Frag\n          9)\n        [1.2] ASOPOS & METOPE (Diodorus Siculus 4.72.1-5)\n        [2.1] AKHELOIOS (Pausanias\n          2.2.2)\n        [3.1] OIBALOS (Pausanias 2.2.2)\n\nPEIRENE (Peirênê), a daughter of Achelous, Oebalus or Asopus and Methone, became by Poseidon the\n        mother of Leches and Cenchrias (Paus. ii. 2. § 3; Diod. iv. 74). She was regarded as the nymph of the well\n        Peirene near Corinth. which was believed by some to have arisen out of the tears which she shed in her grief at\n        the death of her son Cenchrias.

The legend about Peirene is that she was\n        a woman who became a spring because of the tears shed in lamentation for her son Kenkhrias (Cenchrias), who was\n        unintentionally killed by Artemis. The spring is ornamented with white marble, and there have been made chambers\n        like caves, out of which the water flows into an open-air well. It is pleasant to drink.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 5. 1 :\n        \"The spring, which is behind the temple [of Aphrodite on the Akrokorinthos (Acrocorinth)], they say was the\n        gift of Asopos to Sisyphos (Sisyphus) . . .
