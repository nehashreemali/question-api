She was loved by the local river-god Phasis.\n\nAEA, a huntress who was metamorphosed by the gods into the fabulous island bearing the same name, in order to\n        rescue her from the pursuit of Phasis, the river-god.

Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Depicted on the walls of the palace of Aeetes, King of Kolkhis (Colchis) :] In frenzied desire savage\n        [river-god] Phasis pursues [the nymphe] Aea upon her native hills; in maiden distress and panic she shoots\n        frightened arrows, and now her strength fails from her running to and fro and the god has overcome her, and\n        binds her fast beneath his rapid wave.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
