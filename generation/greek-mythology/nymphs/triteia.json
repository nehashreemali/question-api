  "content": "TRITEIA was a sea-nymph of the Korinthian (Corinthian) Gulf and the town of Triteia in Akhaia (Achaea)\n        (southern Greece). She was loved by the god Ares and bore him a son named Melanippos, the founding-prince of her\n        namesake town.\n\nTriteia resembles several other warrior-nymph consorts of Ares in the north-west Peloponnese such as Harpina and Sterope of Pisa. She was perhaps\n        also identified the Libyan Athena, a war-goddess daughter of Lake Tritonis. In\n        the cult at Triteia she may have been equated with Enyo.\n\nTRITAEA (Tritaia), a daughter of Triton, a priestess of Athena, by whom Ares became the father of Melanippus,\n        who gave to a town in Achaia the name of his mother. Sacrifices were offered there to Ares and Tritaea in the\n        temple of Athena.
