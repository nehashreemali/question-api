  "content": "SOSE was a prophetic Oreiad- or Naiad-nymph of Arkadia (southern Greece). She was the mother of the goat-legged\n        god Pan Agreus (the Hunter) by Hermes.\n\nSose resembles Penelopeia and Thymbris--two Arkadian nymphs also named as the mother of Pan--and the Dryad Erato, a highland prophetess whose husband Arkas shared the cradle of Hermes.\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 14. 67 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"Panes, the sons of Hermes, who divided his love between two Nymphai (Nymphs); for one he visited the bed\n        of Sose, the highland prophetess, and begat a son inspired with the divine voice of prophecy, [Pan] Agreus (the\n        Hunter), well versed in the beast-slaying sport of the hunt.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
