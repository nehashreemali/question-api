  "content": "RHODE was the goddess-nymph and eponym of the Aegean island of Rhodes. She was a daughter of Poseidon and the\n        wife of Helios the Sun--the island's patron god.\n\nRhode was identified by the Rhodians with the goddess Athena, and her\n        seven sons with the Kouretes (Curetes).\n\n[1.1] APHRODITE (Pindar Olympian Ode\n          7)\n        [1.2] POSEIDON & AMPHITRITE (Apollodorus 1.28)\n        [1.3] POSEIDON & HALIA (Diodorus Siculus 5.55.1)\n        [1.4] POSEIDON & APHRODITE (Scholiast on Pindar's Pythian\n          8.24)\n        [1.5] POSEIDON & POLYPHE (Suidas s.v.

It should be observed that the names Rhodos and Rhode are\n        often confounded (Diod. v. 55).\n\nRHODOS (Rhodos), was, according to Diodorus (v. 55), a daughter of Poseidon and Halia, and sometimes called\n        Rhode. The island of Rhodes was believed to have derived its name from her. According to others, she was a\n        daughter of Helios and Amphitrite, or of Poseidon and Aphrodite, or lastly of Oceanus (Pind. Olymp.\n        vii. 24; Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 923). She was a sea-nymph, of whom the following legend is related. When the\n        gods distributed among themselves the various countries of the earth, the island of Rhodes was yet covered by\n        the waves of the sea. Helios was absent at the time; and as no one drew a lot for him, he was not to have any\n        share in the distribution of the earth. But at that moment the island of Rhodes rose out of the sea, and with\n        the consent of Zeus he took possession of it, and by the nymph of the isle he then became the father of seven\n        sons.

And of these one\n        begot he eldest Ialysos (Ialysus), and Kamiros (Camirus) and Lindos; and in three parts they divided their\n        father's land, and of three citadels the brothers held each his separate share, and by their three names are the\n        cities called.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 28 (trans.
