Their daughter Niobe was the first mortal\n        woman loved by the god Zeus.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 1 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"To Okeanos (Oceanus) and Tethys was born a son Inakhos (Inachus), after whom the Inakhos river in Argos is\n        named. By Melia, daughter of Okeanos, he had sons named Phoroneus and Aigialeus (Aegialeus). Although Aigialeus\n        died childless, his whole land was called Aigialeia. Phoroneus ruled the entire region later called the\n        Peloponnesos, and by a Nymphe named Teledike (Teledice) fathered Apis and Niobe.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
