  "content": "IYNX was the nymph inventress of a magical love-charm known as the iynx--a spinning wheel with a\n        wryneck bird attached. Iynx used her enchantments to make Zeus fall in love\n        with her or, some say, with the nymph Io. Hera was enraged and transformed her into a wryneck bird.\n\nThe English word \"jinx\" is derived from Iynx's name.\n\n[1.1] EKHO (Suidas s.v. Iynx)\n        [1.2] PAN & EKHO (Other References)\n        [2.1] PEITHO (Suidas s.v. Iynx)\n\nIYNX (Iunx), a daughter of Peitho and Pan, or of Echo. She endeavoured to charm Zeus, or make him, by magic\n        means, fall in love with Io; in consequence of which Hera metamorphosed her into the bird called lynx (iynx\n          torquilla). (Schol. ad Theocrit. ii. 17, ad Pind. Pyth. iv. 380, Nem. iv. 56; Tzetz.\n        ad Lycoph. 310.) According to another story, she was a daughter of Pierus, and as she and her sisters\n        had presumed to enter into a musical contest with the Muses, she was changed into the bird lynx. (Anton. lib.\n        9.) This bird, the symbol of passionate and restless love, was given by Aphrodite to Jason, who, by turning it\n        round and pronouncing certain magic words, excited the love of Medeia. (Pind. Pyth. iv. 380, &c.;\n        Tzetz. l. c.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nSuidas s.v. Iynx (trans.

And she was called\n        kinaidion (wryneck) by some. There is also a little instrument which is called iynx, which\n        enchantresses are accustomed to turn about as they cast charms on their beloveds. It is also a bird, which is\n        believed to have the same power. Wherefore they bind [them] on wheels.\"\n\nSuidas s.v.
