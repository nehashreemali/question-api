  "content": "MELITE was a Naiad-nymph of Mount Melite on the mythical island of the Phaiakes (Phaeacians)--later identified\n        with Greek island of Korkyra (Corcyra). According to some she was the mother of Hyllos by Herakles (Deianeira,\n        however, was usually named as the boy's mother).\n\nMelite was probably identified with the honey-nymph Makris. Their fathers also\n        appear to be connected--Aigaios (Of the Goats) and Aristaios Nomios (Of the Pastures).\n\nMELITE (Melitê).A Naias, a daughter of the river-god Aegaeus, who became, by Heracles, the mother of\n        Hyllus, in the country of the Phaeacians.

There Herakles fell in love with the Naias\n        Melite, a daughter of the River Aigaios (Aegaeus), and she bore him the mighty Hyllos.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
