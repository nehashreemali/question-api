He carried her off\n        in the guise of an eagle to the island of Aigina which was named after her.\n\n[1.1] ASOPOS (Pindar Isthmian 8, Pindar\n          Paean 6, Corinna Frag 654, Bacchylides Frag 9, Herodotus 5.80.1, Pausanias 2.29.2, Antoninus Liberalis 38,\n          Hyginus Fabulae 52, Ovid Metamorphoses 7.615, Statius Thebaid 7.315, Nonnus Dionysiaca 7.210)\n        [1.2] ASOPOS & METOPE (Apollodorus 3.156 Diodorus Siculus 4.72.1)\n\n[1.1] AIAKOS (by Zeus) (Hesiod Catalogues\n          Frag 53, Pindar Isthmian 8, Pindar Nemean 7, Corinna Frag 654, Bacchylides Frag 9, Apollodorus 3.156,\n          Pausanias 2.29.2, Diodorus Siculus 4.72.1, Antoninus Liberalis 38, Hyginus Fabulae 52, Ovid Metamorphoses\n          7.472, Nonnus Dionysiaca 13.201)\n        [2.1] MENOITIOS (by Aktor) (Pindar Olympian 9)\n\nAEGINA. Aeacus, a son of Zeus and Aegina, a daughter of the river-god Asopus. He was born in the island of\n        Oenone or Oenopia, whither Aegina had been carried by Zeus to secure her from the anger of her parents, and\n        whence this island was afterwards called Aegina. (Apollod. iii. 12. § 6; Hygin. Fab. 52; Paus. ii.\n        29. § 2; comp. Nonn. Dionys. vi. 212; Ov. Met. vi. 113, vii. 472, &c.) According to\n        some accounts Aeacus was a son of Zeus and Europa. Some traditions related that at the time when Aeacus was\n        born, Aegina was not yet inhabited, and that Zeus changed the ants (murmêkes) of the island into men\n        (Myrmidones) over whom Aeacus ruled, or that he made men grow up out of the earth. (Hes. Fragm. 67, ed.\n        Göttling; Apollod. iii. 12. § 6; Paus. l. c.) Ovid (Met. vii. 520; comp. Hygin. Fab. 52;\n        Strab. viii. p. 375), on the other hand, supposes that the island was not uninhabited at the time of the birth\n        of Aeacus, and states that, in the reign of Aeacus, Hera, jealous of Aegina, ravaged the island bearing the name\n        of the latter by sending a plague or a fearful dragon into it, by which nearly all its inhabitants were carried\n        off, and that Zeus restored the population by changing the ants into men.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Catalogues of Women Fragment 53 (trans.

Zeus kidnapped one\n        named Aigina. As Asopos went looking for her, he came to Korinthos (Corinth) and learned from Sisyphos\n        (Sisyphus) that the kidnapper was Zeus. Asopos started after the god, but Zeus sent him back to his own waters\n        with thunderbolts--whence to this day coal is mined from this river.
