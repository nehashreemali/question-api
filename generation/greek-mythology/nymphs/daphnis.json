  "content": "DAPHNIS was an Oread-nymph of Mount Parnassos in Phokis (central Greece). She was the prophetess of Gaia (the Earth) at Delphoi before Apollon seized control of the oracle.\n\nDaphnis was a version of Daphne--the nymph transformed into a laurel-tree by\n        Gaia as she fled the embrace of the god Apollon.\n        She was probably also connected with Kastalia (Castalia), the Naiad-nymph of\n        the oracular springs of Delphoi, and the Korykiai (Coryciae), nymphs of the\n        sacred Korykian cave.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 10. 5. 5 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Many and different are the stories told about Delphoi (Delphi), and even more son about the oracle of\n        Apollon. For they say that in earliest times the oracular seat belonged to Ge (Gaea, the Earth), who appointed\n        as prophetess Daphnis, one of the Nymphai (Nymphs) of the mountain [Mount Parnassos].\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
