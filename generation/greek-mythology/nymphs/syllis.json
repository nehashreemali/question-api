  "content": "SYLLIS was a Naiad-nymph of the town of Sikyon (southern Greece). She was loved by the god Apollon and bore him\n        Zeuxippos, a king of Sikyon.\n\nZeuxippos' name means \"bridging the horse\" or \"yoking the horse\"--a horse being both a\n        literal horse and a poetic name for a stream or river.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 6. 7 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"After Phaistos (Phaestus) [son of Herakles and king of Sikyon (Sicyon)] in obedience to an oracle migrated\n        to Krete (Crete), the next king [of Sikyon] is said to have been Zeuxippos (Zeuxippus), the son of Apollon and\n        the Nymphe Syllis. On the death of Zeuxippos, Agamemnon led an army against Sikyon.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
