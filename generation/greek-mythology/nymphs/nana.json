  "content": "NANA was a Naiad-nymph of the river Saggarios (Sangarius) in Phrygia (central Anatolia). She was accidentally\n        impregnated by an almond which fell into her lap from a tree grown from the castrated genitals of the\n        hermaphroditic deity Agdistis.\n\nATTIS (Nana impregnated by an almond from the tree\n          sprung from the severed genitals of Agdistis) (Pausanias 7.17.8)\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 7. 17. 8 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The gods, fearing [the hermaphroditic deity] Agdistis, cut off the male organ. There grew up from it an\n        almond-tree with its fruit ripe, and a daughter of the river Saggarios (Sangarius), they say, took the fruit and\n        laid it in her bosom, when it at once disappeared, but she was with child. A boy [Attis] was born, and exposed,\n        but was tended by a he-goat.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
