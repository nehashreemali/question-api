  "content": "PERSEIS was an Okeanid-nymph loved by the sun-god Helios. She bore him four children--the witches Kirke (Circe)\n        and Pasiphae and magician-kings Aeetes and Perses.\n\nAeetes was the king of Kolkhis (Colchis), at the eastern end of the Black Sea, and Perses the ruler of the\n        nearby kingdom of Persia. Perses was succeeded on the throne by his niece, the witch Medea, for whom the country\n        was renamed Media. She was regarded as the ancestress of the Median royal family and probably as the founder of\n        the order of the Magoi--the royal magicians.\n\nPerseis' name was derived from the Greek word persô meaning \"to destroy,\" \"to\n        slay,\" or \"to sack with fire.\" Perseis was also the patronymic epithet of the goddess-witch Hekate, daughter of Perses, who was no doubt identified with the\n        Okeanid-mother of witches. The name was later associated with the Greek words for Persia and the Persians.\n\n[1.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Hesiod Theogony 357 & 957)\n        [1.2] OKEANOS (Homer Odyssey 10.139, Hyginus\n          Fabulae 156)\n\n[1.1] KIRKE, AEETES (by Helios) (Hesiod Theogony 955; Homer Odyssey 10.139)\n        [1.2] KIRKE, AEETES, PASIPHAE (by Helios) (Apollodorus 1.83, 3.7, E7.14, Cicero De\n          Natura Deorum 3.19)\n        [1.3] KIRKE (by Helios) (Apollonius Rhodius 4.591)\n        [1.4] KIRKE, AEETES, PASIPHAE, PERSES (by\n        Helios) (Hyginus Preface)\n        [2.1] ALOEIS (by Helios) (Tzetzes on\n          Lycophron)\n\nPERSE (Persê), a daughter of Oceanus. and wife of Helios, by whom she became the another of Aeetes and\n        Circe.
