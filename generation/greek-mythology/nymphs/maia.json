  "content": "MAIA was the eldest of the Pleiades, the seven nymphs of the constellation Pleiades. She was a shy goddess who\n        dwelt alone in a cave near the peaks of Mount Kyllene (Cyllene) in Arkadia where she secretly gave birth to the\n        god Hermes, her son by Zeus. She also raised the boy Arkas (Arcas) in her cave whose mother Kallisto (Callisto) had been transformed into a bear.\n\nAiskhylos (Aeschylus) apparently idenifies Maia \"the nursing mother\" with Gaia \"the Earth.\" On several occassions he calls the\n        earth-goddess Gaia Maia (Mother Earth) and pairs her with Hermes Khthonios (\"of the Earth\").\n\n[1.1] ATLAS (Hesiod Theogony 938, Hesiod\n          Astronomy Frag 1, Homeric Hymn 17.3, Simonides Frag 555, Virgil Aeneid 8.134)\n        [1.2] ATLAS & PLEIONE (Apollodorus 3.110, Hyginus Fabulae 192, Hyginus Astronomica 2.21, Ovid Fasti 4.169 &\n          5.79)\n\n[1.1] HERMES (by Zeus)\n        (Hesiod Theogony 938, Hesiod Astronomy Frag 1, Homeric Hymns 4& 17, Alcaeus Frag\n          308, Simonides Frag 555, Aeschylus Libation Bearers 683 & Frag 212, Apollodorus 3.112, Philostratus Elder\n          1.26, Ovid Fasti 5.79)\n\nMAIA (Maia or Maias), a daughter of Atlas and Pleione (whence she is called Atlantis and Pleias), was the\n        eldest of the Pleiades, and in a grotto of mount Cyllene in Arcadia she became by Zeus the mother of Hermes.\n        Arcas, the son of Zeus by Callisto, was given to her to be reared.

There the Son of Kronos (Cronus) used to lie with the rich-tressed Nymphe, unseen by\n        deathless gods and mortal men, at dead of night that sleep might hold white-armed Hera fast. And when the\n        purpose of great Zeus was fulfilled, and the tenth moon with her was fixed in heaven, she was delivered and a\n        notable thing was come to pass. For then she bare a son, of many shifts . . .\n        Born with the dawning, at mid-day he played on the lyre, and in the evening he stole the cattle of far-shooting\n        Apollon on the fourth day of the month; for on that day queenly Maia bare him. So soon as he had leaped from his\n        mother's heavenly womb, he lay not long waiting in his holy cradle, but he sprang up and sought the oxen of\n        Apollon. But as he stepped over the threshold of the high-roofed cave, he found a tortoise there.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 4 to Hermes 142 ff :\n        \"[After stealing the cattle of Apollon, the infant god Hermes returns to his cradle in the cave of Maia :]\n        Then the god went straight back again at dawn to the bright crests of Kyllene (Cyllene) . . . And luck-bringing\n        Hermes, the son of Zeus, passed edgeways through the key-hole of the hall like the autumn breeze, even as mist:\n        straight through the cave he went and came to the rich inner chamber, walking softly, and making no noise as one\n        might upon the floor. Then glorious Hermes went hurriedly to his cradle, wrapping his swaddling clothes about\n        his shoulders as though he were a feeble babe, and lay playing with the covering about his knees . . . But the\n        god did not pass unseen by the goddess; but she said to him : ‘How now, you rogue! Whence come you back so\n        at night-time, you that wear shamlessness as a garment? And now I surely bnelieve the son of Leto will soon have\n        you forth out of doors with unbreakable cords about your ribs, or you will live a rogues's life in the glens\n        robbing by whiles. Go to, then; your father got you to be a reat worry to mortal men and deathless\n        gods.’\n        Then Hermes answered her with crafty words : ‘Mother, why do you seek to frighten me like a feeble child\n        whose heart knows few words of blame, a fearful babe that fears its mother's scolding? Nay, but I will try\n        whatever plan is best, and so feed myself and you continually. We will not be content to remain here, as you\n        bid, alone of all the gods unfee'd with offerings and prayers. Better to live in fellowship with the deathless\n        gods continually, rich, wealthy, and enjoying stores of grain, than to sit in a gloomy cave: and, as regards\n        honour, I too will enter upon the rite that Apollon has . . .’\n        With such words they spoke together, the son of Zeus who holds the aigis, and the lady Maia.\"\n\nHomeric Hymn 17 to Hermes 3 ff :\n        \"He [Hermes] was born of Maia, the daughter of Atlas, when she had mated with Zeus, a shy goddess she. Ever\n        she avoided the throng of the blessed gods and lived in a shadowy cave, and there the Son of Kronos used to lie\n        with the rich-tressed (euplokamos) Nymphe at dead of night, while white-armed Hera lay bound in sweet\n        sleep : and neither deathless god nor mortal man knew it.

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"To Atlas and Okeanos' (Oceanus') daughter Pleione were born on Arkadian Kyllene (Arcadian Cyllene) seven\n        daughters called the Pleiades, whose names are Alkyone, Merope, Kelaino, Elektra, Sterope, Taygete, and\n        Maia.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 112 :\n        \"The oldest daughter Maia, after her intercourse with Zeus, bore Hermes in a cave on Kyllene (Cyllene).\n        Though he was laid out in swaddling-clothes with her winnowing basket for a cradle, he escaped and made his way\n        to Pieria, where he stole some cattle that Apollon was tending . . . Apollon learned who the thief was by divine\n        science, and made his way to Maia on Kyllene to charge Hermes. Maia, however, showed Apollon the baby in his\n        swaddling-clothes, whereupon Apollon took him to Zeus and demanded his cattle.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 101 :\n        \"As Kallisto (Callisto) died [i.e. she was shot in the guise of a bear], Zeus seized his baby and handed it\n        to Maia to rear in Arkadia (Arcadia) , giving it the name Arkas (Arcas).\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 1. 26 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[From a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] Birth of Hermes. The mere babe\n        still in swaddling clothes, the one who is driving the cattle into the cleft of the earth . . . Hermes, when\n        Maia bore him, loved thievery and was skilled in it . . .\n        He is born on the crest of Olympos, at the very top, the abode of the god . . . There the Horai (Horae, Seasons)\n        care for Hermes at his birth. The painter has depicted these also, each according to her time, and they wrap him\n        in swaddling clothes, sprinkling over him the most beautiful flowers, that he may have swaddling clothes not\n        without distinction. While they turn to [Maia] the mother of Hermes lying on her couch of travail, he slips out\n        of his swaddling clothes and begins to walk at once and descends from Olympos. The mountain rejoices in him--for\n        its smile is like that of a man--and you are to assume that Olympos rejoices because Hermes was born there . . .\n        \n        Now what of the theft? . . . Apollon comes to Maia to demand back the cattle, but she does not believe him and\n        thinks the god is talking nonsense. Would you learn what he is saying? For, from his expression he seems to me\n        to be giving utterance, not merely to sounds, but to words; he looks as though he were about to say to Maia,\n        ‘Your son whom you bore yesterday wrongs me; for the cattle in which I delight he has thrust into the\n        earth, nor do I know where in the earth. Verily he shall perish and shall be thrust down deeper than the\n        cattle.’\n        But she merely marvels, and does not believe what he says. While they are still disputing with one another\n        Hermes takes his stand behind Apollon, and leaping lightly on his back, he quietly unfastens Apollon's bow and\n        pilfers it unnoticed.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 7 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Others say that when Mercurius [Hermes] first made the lure on Mount Cyllene in Arcadia, he made it with\n        seven strings to correspond to the number of Atlantides [Pleiades], since Maia, his mother, was of their\n        company.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 2. 836 ff (trans.
