  "content": "DRYADES (Dryads) and OREIADES (Oreads) were the nymphs of trees, groves, woodlands\n        and mountain forests. They were the spirits of the oaks and pines, poplar and ash, apple and laurel. For those\n        known as Hamadryades, a tree was born with her birth to which her life was tied. While the tree flourished, so\n        did its resident nymph, but when it died she passed away.\n\nThere were several types of Dryades associated with particular trees:--\n\n(1) The Meliai (Meliae) were nymphs of the ash-trees. They were born when\n        Gaia (Gaea, the Earth) was impregnated by the blood of the castrated Ouranos (Uranus, the Sky). They were wed by\n        the men of the Silver Age--in the time before the first woman was created--and from them mankind was descended.\n\n(2) The Oreiades (Oreads) were nymphs of the mountain conifers. The eldest of these were daughters of the five\n        Daktyloi (Dactyls) and five Hekaterides (Hecaterides). Subsequent generations were descended from these elder\n        Oreiades and their brother Satyroi (Satyrs). \n        N.B. In ancient Greece most of the forests were located on the slopes of the rugged hills and mountains, sas the\n        majority of the lowland forest had been cleared for farming. It was therefore natural for the Greeks to think of\n        Dryades as mountain-dwellers.\n\n(3) The Hamadryades (Hamadryads) were the nymphs of oak and poplar trees. They were usually connected with\n        river-side trees and sacred groves.\n\n(4) The Maliades, Meliades or Epimelides were nymphs of apple and other fruit trees and the protectors of\n        sheep. The Greek word melas--from which their name derives--means both apple and sheep.\n\n(5) The Daphnaie were nymphs of the laurel trees, one of a class of rarer tree-specific Dryad. Others included\n        the Nymphai Aigeiroi (of black poplars), Ampeloi (of grape vines), Balanis (of the ilex), Karyai (of the\n        hazel-nut), Kraneiai (of cherry-trees), Moreai (of the mulberry), Pteleai (of elm trees), and Sykei (of fig\n        trees).\n\nMany of these nymphs were associated with a broader domain--Oreiades were nymphs of the mountains, Alseides of\n        the sacred groves, Aulonides of glens, Napaiai of vales.\n\n[1.1] THE DAKTYLOI & THE HEKATERIDES (Strabo 10.3.19)\n        [2.1] HERMES & THE OREIADES (Homeric Hymn V To Aphrodite 256)\n        [3.1] THE SATYROI & THE OREIADES (Homeric Hymn V To Aphrodite 256)\n\n[1.1] SEILENOS (Propertius Elegies 2.32)\n        [2.1] OUROS (Athenaeus 3.78 )\n        [3.1] OXYLOS & HAMADRYAS (Athenaeus 3.78 )\n\nDRYADES (Druades) All nymphs, whose number is almost infinite, may be divided into two great classes. The first\n        class embraces those who must be regarded as a kind of inferior divinities, recognised in the worship of nature.\n        The early Greeks saw in all the phenomena of ordinary nature some manifestation of the deity; springs, rivers,\n        grottoes, trees, and mountains, all seemed to them fraught with life; and all were only the visible embodiments\n        of so many divine agents. The salutary and beneficent powers of nature were thus personified, and regarded as so\n        many divinities; and the sensations produced on man in the contemplation of nature, such as awe, terror, joy,\n        delight, were ascribed to the agency of the various divinities of nature.\n        The nymphs of the first class must again be sublatter divided into various species, according to the different\n        parts of nature of which they are the representatives.\n        1. Nymphs of mountains and grottoes, are called Orodemniades and Oreiades but sometimes also by names\n        derived from the particular mountains they inhabited, as Kithairônides, Pêliades, Korukiai, &c.\n        (Theocrit. vii. 137; Virg. Aen. i. 168, 500; Paus. v. 5. § 6, ix. 3. § 5, x. 32. § 5;\n        Apollon. Rhod. i. 550, ii. 711; Ov. Her. xx. 221; Virg. Eclog. vi. 56.)\n        2. Nymphs of forests, groves, and glens, were believed sometimes to appear to and frighten solitary\n        travellers. They are designated by the names Alsêïdes, Holêôroi, Aulôniades, and\n        Napaiai. (Apollon. Rhod. i. 1066, 1227; Orph. Hymn. 50. 7; Theocrit. xiii. 44; Ov. Met. xv.\n        490; Virg. Georg. iv. 535.)\n        3 . Nymphs of trees, were believed to die together with the trees which had been their abode, and with\n        which they had come into existence. They were called Dryades, Hamadruades or Hadryades, from drys, which\n        signifies not only an oak, but any wild-growing lofty tree; for the nymphs of fruit trees were called\n        Mêlides, Mêliades, Epimêlides, or Hamamêlides. They seem to be of Arcadian origin, and\n        never appear together with any of the great gods. (Paus. viii. 4. § 2; Apollon. Rhod. ii. 477, &c.;\n        Anton. Lib. 31, 32; Hom. Hymn. in Ven. 259, &c.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nATLANTEIA An Libyan Hamadryad nymph who was\n          the mother of several of the Danaides by King Danaus.\n\nBYBLIS A girl of Miletos in Karia (Caria) transformed into a Hamadryas.\n\nDAPHNIS An Oreiad of Mount Parnassos in Phokis who was appointed by the\n        goddess Gaia as the prophetess at the oracle at Delphoi--in the time before it passed into the hands of Apollon.\n\nDRYOPE A Hamadryad nymph of Mount Othrys in Malis.

She was cursed to only repeat the words of others by her mistress. When she fell\n        in love with the self-obsessed youth Narkissos (Narcissus), he spurned her advances, and she faded away in her\n        grief.\n\nERATO A prophetic Arkadian Dryad nymph of Mount Kyllene (Cyllene), the wife of\n        King Nyktimos (Nictymus).\n\nHELIADES (Heliads) Daughters of the sun-god Helios, the Heliades were\n        transformed into amber-teared poplar trees. They were probably regarded as a type of Hamadryad.\n\nHESPERIDES (Hesperids) The three guardians of the golden apples were\n        sometimes regarded as Hamadryad or Hamameliad (apple-tree) nymphs.\n\nKARYA (Carya) A Hamadryad nymph of the hazel or chestnut-tree.\n\nKHELONE (Chelone) An Arkadian Oreiad nymph who ignored the summons to attend\n        the wedding of Zeus and Hera and as punishment was transformed into a tortoise .\n\nKLAIA (Claea) A Messenian Oreiad nymph who had a cavern shrine on Mount\n        Kalathion (Calathium).\n\nKRANEIA (Crania) A Hamadryad nymph of the cherry tree.\n\nKYLLENE (Cyllene) An Arkadian Oreiad who was the eponym of Mount Kyllene\n        (Cyllene) in Arkadia.
