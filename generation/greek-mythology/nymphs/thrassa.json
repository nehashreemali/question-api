Celoria) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Thrassa was daughter of Ares and of Tereine daughter of Strymon. Hipponous, son of Triballos [eponym or\n        god of the Triballoi tribe of Thrake], married her and they had a daughter called Polyphonte. She scorned the\n        activities of Aphrodite and went to the mountains as a companion and sharer of sports with Artemis.\n        Aphrodite, whose activities Polyphonte failed to honour, made her fall in love with a bear and drove her\n        mad.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
