  "content": "DYSSEBEIA was the personified spirit (daimona) of impiety. She was the mother of Hybris (Excessive\n        Pride). Her Roman name was Impietas.\n\nAeschylus, Eumenides 532 ff (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"I have a timely word of advice: arrogance (hybris) is truly the child of impiety\n        (dyssebia), but from health of soul comes happiness, dear to all, much prayed for.\"\n\nSeneca, Hercules Furens 90 ff (trans. Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[Hera rages against Heracles :] ‘Dost think that now thou hast escaped the Styx [i.e. the Underword]\n        and the cruel ghosts? Here will I show thee infernal shapes. One in deep darkness buried, far down below the\n        place of banishment of guilty souls, will I call up--the goddess Discordia (Discord) [Eris], whom a huge cavern,\n        barred by a mountain, guards; I will bring her forth, and drag out from the deepest realm of Dis [Haides]\n        whatever thou hast left; hateful Scelus (Crime) [Hybris?] shall come and reckless Impietas (Impiety)\n        [Dyssebeia], stained with kindred blood, Error (Error) [Ate], and Furor (Mad-Rage) [Lyssa], armed ever against\n        itself--this, this be the minister of my smarting wrath!’\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
