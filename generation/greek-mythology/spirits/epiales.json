  "content": "EPIALES was the personified spirit (daimon) of nightmares. He was also known as the melas\n          oneiros \"black dream\". Epiales was probably numbered amongst the Oneiroi (Dream-Spirits), sons of the goddess Nyx (Night).\n\nThe Greek word epialês was derived from the verb epiallô \"to lay upon.\"\n\nGreek Lyric I Alcaeus, Frag 406 (from Etymologicum Genuinum 151) :\n        \"The words epialos, epiales and epioles denote (1) the feverish chill (2) the\n        daimon who assaults sleepers.\n        Homer and most writers have epioles with the e; the form in -os means something\n        different, namely the feverish chill . . . Alkaios (Alcaeus) called it epialos.\n        Apollonios says that Epialtes itself (the nighmare daimon) is called Epiales and by a change of a to\n        o Epioles.\"\n\nAeschylus, Suppliant Women 886 ff (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[The goddess Gaia (Earth) is invoked to drive away a nightmare :] Like a spider, he [a rapist] is carrying\n        me [a woman] seaward step by step--a nightmare (oneiros), a black nightmare (melas oneiros)!\n        Oh! Oh! Mother Earth (Ma Ge), mother Earth (Ma Ge), avert his fearful cries! O father Zeus, son of Ge\n        (Earth)!\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Phrynincus Comicus 1, Dioscorides 3.140, Artemidorus 2.37,\n          Rufus ap.
