  "content": "PROIOXIS was the personified spirit (daimona) of onrush and pursuit in battle. She and her sister Palioxis (Backrush) presided over the surge of battle. She was probably numbered\n        amongst the Makhai (Machae), daimones of the battlefield. Proioxis was probably the\n        same as Ioke.\n\nHesiod, Shield of Heracles 139 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th\n          B.C.) :\n        \"[Depicted on the shield of Herakles :] In his hands he [Herakles] took his shield, all glittering: no\n        one ever broke it with a blow or crushed it. And a wonder it was\n        to see . . . In the centre was Phobos (Fear)\n        worked in adamant, unspeakable, staring backwards with eyes that\n        glowed with fire. His mouth was full of teeth in a white row,\n        fearful and daunting, and upon his grim brow hovered frightful Eris (Battle-Strife) who arrays the throng of\n        men: pitiless she, for she took\n        away the mind and senses of poor wretches who made war against\n        the son of Zeus . . . Upon the shield Proioxis (Onrush) and Palioxis (Backrush) were wrought,\n        and Homados (Tumult), and Phobos (Panic), and Androktasia (Slaughter). Eris (Battle-Strife) also, and Kydoimos\n        (Confusion)\n        were hurrying about, and deadly Ker (Fate) was there holding one man\n        newly wounded.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
