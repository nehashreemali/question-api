He dwelt in Erebos, the land of eternal\n        darkness beyond the gates of the rising sun, and rose into the sky each night in the train of his mother Nyx\n        (Night). Hypnos was often paired with his twin brother Thanatos (Peaceful Death),\n        and the Oneiroi (Dreams) were his brothers or sons.\n\nHypnos was depicted as a young man with wings on his shoulders or brow. His attributes included either a horn\n        of sleep-inducing opium, a poppy-stem, a branch dripping water from the river Lethe (Forgetfulness), or an\n        inverted torch.\n\n[1.1] NYX (no father) (Hesiod Theogony 212,\n          Homer Iliad 14.250, Aeschylus Frag 250, Seneca Hercules Furens1068, Nonnus Dionysiaca 31.103)\n        [1.2] EREBOS & NYX (Hyginus Preface, Cicero De Natura Deorum. 3.17)\n\n[1.1] THE ONEIROI x 1000, MORPHEUS, IKELOS, PHANTASOS (Ovid\n          Metamorphoses 11.630)\n\nHYPNUS,\n        the personification and god of sleep, the Latin Somnus, is described by the ancients as a brother of Death\n        (thanatos), and as a son of Night (Hes. Theog. 211, &c.; Virg. Aen. vi. 277). At\n        Sicyon there was a statue of Sleep surnamed epidôtês, the giver (Paus. ii. 10. § 2).\n        In works of art Sleep and Death are represented alike as two youths sleeping or holding inverted torches in\n        their hands.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 21 ff (trans.

Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"There [in Lemnos] she [Hera] encountered Hypnos (Sleep), the brother of Thanatos (Death). She clung fast\n        to his hand and spoke a word and called him by name : ‘Hypnos, lord over all mortal men and all gods, if\n        ever before now you listened to word of mine, so now also do as I ask; and all my days I shall know gratitude.\n        Put to sleep the shining eyes of Zeus under his brows as soon as I have lain beside him in love. I will give you\n        gifts; a lovely throne, imperishable forever, of gold. My own son, he of the strong arms, Hephaistos, shall make\n        it with careful skill and make for your feet a footstool on which you can rest your shining feet when you take\n        your pleasure.’\n        Then Hypnos the still and soft spoke to her in answer : ‘Hera, honoured goddess and daughter of mighty\n        Kronos (Cronus), any other one of the gods, whose race is immortal, I would lightly put to sleep, even the\n        stream of that River Okeanos (Oceanus), whence is risen the seed of all the immortals. But I would not come too\n        close to Zeus, the son of Kronos, nor put him to sleep, unless he himself were to tell me. Before now, it was a\n        favour to you that taught me wisdom, on the day Herakles (Heracles), the high-hearted son of Zeus, was sailing\n        from Ilion, when he had utterly sacked the city of the Trojans. That time I laid to sleep the brain in Zeus of\n        the aegis and drifted upon him still and soft, but your mind was devising evil, and you raised along the sea the\n        blasts of the racking winds, and on these swept him away to Kos, the strong-founded, with all his friends lost,\n        but Zeus awakened in anger and beat the gods up and down his house, looking beyond all others for me, and would\n        have sunk me out of sight in the sea from the bright sky had not Nyx (Night) who has power over gods and men\n        rescued me. I reached her in my flight, and Zeus let be, though he was angry, in awe of doing anything to swift\n        Nyx' displeasure. Now you ask me to do this other impossible thing for you.’\n        Then in turn the lady ox-eyed Hera answered him : ‘Hypnos, why do you ponder this in your heart, and\n        hesitate? Or do you think that Zeus of the wide brows, aiding the Trojans, will be angry as he was angry for his\n        son, Herakles? Come now, do it, and I will give you one of the younger Kharites (Charites, Graces) for you to\n        marry, and she shall be called you lady; Pasithea, since all your days you have loved her forever.’\n        So she spoke, and Hypnos was pleased and spoke to her in answer : ‘Come then! Swear it to me on Styx'\n        ineluctable water. With one hand take hold of the prospering earth, with the other take hold of the shining salt\n        sea, so that all the undergods who gather about Kronos (Cronus) may be witnesses to us. Swear that you will give\n        me one of the younger Kharites, Pasithea, the one whom all my days I have longed for.’\n        He spoke, nor failed to persuade the goddess Hera of the white arms, and she swore as he commanded, and called\n        by their names on all those gods who live beneath Tartaros (the Pit), and who are called Titanes (Titans).\n        Then when she had sworn this, and made her oath a complete thing, the two went away from Lemnos, and the city of\n        Imbros, and mantled themselves in mist, and made their way very lightly till they came to Ida with all her\n        springs, the mother of wild beasts, to Lekton, where first they left the water, and went on over dry land, and\n        with their feet the top of the forest was shaken. There Hypnos stayed, before the eyes of Zeus could light on\n        him, and went up aloft a towering pine tree, the one that grew tallest at that time on Ida, and broke through\n        the close air to the aither. In this he sat, covered over and hidden by the pine branches, in the likeness of a\n        singing bird whom in the mountains the immortal gods call khalkis, but men call him\n        kymindis.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 14. 352 ff : \n        \"So the father [Zeus] slept unshaken on the peak of Gargaron with his wife in his arms, when Hypnos and\n        passion [of Hera] had stilled him; but gently Hypnos went on the run to the ships of the Akhaians (Achaeans)\n        with a message to tell him who circles the earth and shakes it, Poseidon, and stood close to him and addressed\n        him in winged words : ‘Poseidon, now with all your heart defend the Danaans and give them glory, though\n        only for a little, while Zeus still sleeps; since I have mantled a soft slumber about him and Hera beguiled him\n        into sleeping in love beside her.’\n        He spoke so, and went away among the famed races of men.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 16. 453 ff : \n        \"[Hera speaks to Zeus about his son Sarpedon's fated death :] ‘But after the soul and the years of\n        his life have left him [Sarpedon], then send Thanatos (Peaceful Death) to carry him away, and Hypnos (Sleep),\n        who is painless, until they come with him to the countryside of broad Lykia (Lycia) where his brothers and\n        countrymen shall give him due burial with tomb and gravestone.’\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 16. 681 ff : \n        \"[Sarpedon was killed at Troy and the god Apollon rescued his body from the fighting :] Then [Apollon] gave\n        him [the body of Sarpedon] into the charge of swift messengers to carry him, of Hypnos (Sleep) and Thanatos\n        (Death), who are twin brothers, and these two presently laid him down within the rich countryside of broad Lykia\n        (Lycia).\"\n\nHesiod, Theogony 758 ff (trans.

Near the Cimmerii (Cimmerians) a cavern lies deep in the hollow of a mountainside, the home\n        and sanctuary of lazy Somnus (Sleep), where Phoebus' [Helios the Sun's] beams can never reach at morn or noon or\n        eve, but cloudy vapours rise in doubtful twilight; there no wakeful cock crows summons Aurora (Dawn) [Eos], no\n        guarding hound the silence breaks, nor goose, a keener guard; no creature wild or tame is heard, no sound of\n        human clamour and no rustling branch. There silence dwells: only the lazy stream of Lethe 'neath the rock with\n        whisper low o'er pebbly shallows trickling lulls to sleep. Before the cavern's mouth lush poppies grow and\n        countless herbs, from whose bland essences a drowsy infusion dewy Nox (Night) [Nyx] distils and sprinkles sleep\n        across the darkening world. No doors are there for fear a hinge should creak, no janitor before the entrance\n        stands, but in the midst a high-raised couch is set of ebony, sable and downy-soft, and covered with a dusky\n        counterpane, whereon the god, relaxed in languor, lies. Around him everywhere in various guise lie empty Somnia\n        (Dreams) [Oneiroi], countless as ears of corn at harvest time or sands cast on the shore or leaves that fall\n        upon the forest floor.\n        There Iris entered, brushing the Somnia (Dreams) aside, and the bright sudden radiance of her robe lit up the\n        hallowed place; slowly the god his heavy eyelids raised, and sinking back time after time, his languid drooping\n        head nodding upon his chest, at last he shook himself out of himself, and leaning up he recognized her and asked\n        why she came, and she replied : ‘Somnus (Sleep) [Hypnos], quietest of the gods, Somnus, peace of all the\n        world, balm of the soul, who drives care away, who gives ease to weary limbs after the hard day's toil and\n        strength renewed to meet the morrow's tasks, bid now thy Somnia (Dreams), whose perfect mimicry matches the\n        truth, in Ceyx's likeness formed appear in Trachis to Alcyone and feign the shipwreck and her dear love drowned.\n        So Juno [Hera] orders.’\n        Then, her task performed, Iris departed, for she could no more endure the power of Somnus (Sleep), as drowsiness\n        stole seeping through her frame, and fled away back o'er the arching rainbow as she came. The father Somnus\n        chose from among his sons, his thronging thousand sons, one who in skill excelled to imitate the human form;\n        Morpheus his name, than whom none can present more cunningly the features, gait and speech of men, their wonted\n        clothes and turn of phrase. He mirrors only men; another forms the beasts and birds and the long sliding snakes.\n        The gods have named him Icelos; here below the tribe of mortals call him Phobetor. A third, excelling in an art\n        diverse, is Phantasos; he wears the cheating shapes of earth, rocks, water, trees--inanimate things. To kings\n        and chieftains these at night display their phantom features; other dreams will roam among the people, haunting\n        common folk. All these dream-brothers the old god passed by and chose Morpheus alone to undertake Thaumantias'\n        [Iris'] commands; then in sweet drowsiness on his high couch he sank his head to sleep.\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 6. 268 ff (trans.

But on her side the Colchian ceases not to foam with hellish poisons and to sprinkle\n        all the silences of Lethe's (Forgetfulness') bough : exerting her spells she constrains his reluctant eyes,\n        exhausting all her Stygian power of hand and tongue, until sleep gains the mastery over his blazing ire.

Obedient to command, the bright goddess leaves the pole and\n        wings her way down her long arc to earth. Beyond the cloud-wrapt chambers of western gloom and Aethiopia's other\n        realm [i.e. the Ethiopians of the West towards the evening] there stands a motionless grove, impenetrable by any\n        star; beneath it the hollow recesses of a deep and rocky cave run far into a mountain, where the slow hand of\n        Natura (Nature) [Physis] has set the halls of lazy Somnus (Sleep) [Hypnos] and his untroubled dwelling. The\n        threshold is guarded by shady Quies (Quiet) [Hesykhia] and dull Oblivio (Forgetfulness) [Lethe] and torpid\n        Ignavia (Sloth) with ever drowsy countenance.

No roar of the sea is here, though all the shores be sounding, nor yet of the\n        sky; the very torrent that runs down the deep valley nigh the cave is silent among the rocks and boulders; by\n        its side are sable herds, and sheep reclining one and all upon the ground; the fresh buds wither, and a breath\n        from the earth makes the grasses sink and fail.\n        Within, glowing Mulciber [Hephaistos] had carved a thousand likenesses of the god: here wreathed Voluptas\n        (Pleasure) clings to his side, here Labor (Labour) [Ponos] drooping to repose bears him company, here he shares\n        a couch with Bacchus [Dionysos], there with Amor (Love) [Eros], the child of Mars [Ares]. Further within, in the\n        secret places of the palace he lies with Mors (Death) [Thanatos] also, but that dread image is seen by none.\n        These are but pictures: he himself beneath humid caverns rests upon coverlets heaped with slumberous flowers,\n        his garments reek, and the cushions are warm with his sluggish body, and above the bed a dark vapour rises from\n        his breathing mouth. One hand holds up the locks that fall from his left temple, from the other drops his\n        neglected horn. V\n        ague Somnia (Dreams) [Oneiroi] of countless shapes stand round about him, true mixed with false, flattering with\n        sad, the dark brood of Nox (Night) [Nyx], and cling to beams and doorposts, or lie on the ground. The light\n        about the chamber is weak and fitful, and languid gleams that woo to earliest slumbers vanish as the lamps\n        flicker and dim.\n        Hither from the blue sky came in balanced flight the varicoloured maid [Iris the rainbow]; the forests shine\n        out, and the shady glens smile upon the goddess, and smitten with her zones of radiance the palace stars from\n        its sleep; but he himself, awoken neither by the bright glow nor by the sound or voice of the goddess, lay\n        motionless as ever, till Thaumantias [Iris] shot at him all her splendours and sank deep into his drowsy\n        vision.\n        Hither from the blue sky came in balanced flight the varicoloured maid [Iris the rainbow]; the forests shine\n        out, and the shady glens smile upon the goddess, and smitten with her zones of radiance the palace stars from\n        its sleep; but he himself, awoken neither by the bright glow nor by the sound or voice of the goddess, lay\n        motionless as ever, till Thaumantias [Iris] shot at him all her splendours and sank deep into his drowsy vision.\n        Then thus began to speak the golden fashioner of clouds : ‘Somnus (Sleep) [Hypnos], gentlest of the gods,\n        Juno [Hera] bids thee bind fast the Sidonian [Theban] leaders and the folk of ruthless Cadmus, who now, puffed\n        up by the issue of fight, are watching in ceaseless vigil the Achaean rampart, and refuse thy sway. Grant so\n        solemn a request--rarely is this opportunity vouchsafed, to win the favour of Jove [Zeus] with Juno [Hera] on\n        thy side.’\n        She spoke, and with her hand beat upon his languid breast, and charged him again and yet again, lest her message\n        be lost. He with his own nodding visage nods assent to the goddess' command; o'er-weighted with the caverns'\n        gloom Iris goes forth, and tricks out her beams, made dim by showers of rain.\n        Himself too he bestirred both swift progress and his wind-torn temples [i.e. he had wings on his temples], and\n        filling his mantle's folds with the chill dark air is borne in silent course through heaven, and from afar\n        swoops down in might upon the Aonian fields. The wind of his coming sets birds and beasts and cattle prostrate\n        on the ground, and, whatsoever region of the world he passes in his flight, the waves slide languidly from the\n        rocks, more lazily cling the clouds, the forests bow their summits, and many a star drops from the loosened\n        vault of heaven. The plain first felt the god's presence by the sudden coming of a mist, and the countless\n        voices and cries of men were hushed; but when he brooded with his dewy wings and entered the camp, unsubstantial\n        as a pitchy shadow, eyes wavered and heads sank, and words were left unfinished in mid-speech. Next shining\n        bucklers and cruel spears are dropped from their hands, their faces fall in weariness upon their breasts. And\n        now universal silence reigns: even the horn-footed steeds refuse to stand, even the fires are quenched in sudden\n        ashes. But slumber woos not the anxious Greeks [the Argives attacked Thebes] to same repose, and the\n        night-wandering, persuasive deity keeps his mists from the camp hard by; on every side they stand to arms, in\n        wrath at the hateful gloom and their foes' proud sentinels.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 10. 300 ff : \n        \"[The sleepign Theban troops were slaughtered by the Argives :] None of the slumberers lifts his head or\n        turn his gaze, so deep the shade wherewith the winged god [Somnus-Hypnos] broods over the wretched ones, and\n        unseals their eyes but as they die.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 12. 300 ff : \n        \"Sopor (Sleep) [Hypnos], too, who leaning forward plies for thee [Luna, Selene the Moon] thy humid\n        chariot-reins.\"\n\nStatius, Achilleid 1. 619 ff : \n        \"Luna (the Moon) [Selene] in her rosy chariot was climbing to the height of mid-heaven, when drowsy Somnus\n        (Sleep) [Hypnos] glided down with full sweep of his pinions to earth and gathered a silent world to his\n        embrace.\"\n\nStatius, Silvae 1. 6. 90 ff (trans.
