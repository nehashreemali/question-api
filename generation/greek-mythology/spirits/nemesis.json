  "content": "NEMESIS was the goddess of indignation against, and retribution for, evil deeds and undeserved good fortune.\n        She was a personification of the resentment aroused in men by those who commited crimes with apparent impunity,\n        or who had inordinate good fortune.\n        Nemesis directed human affairs in such a way as to maintain equilibrium. Her name means she who distributes or\n        deals out. Happiness and unhappiness were measured out by her, care being taken that happiness was not too\n        frequent or too excessive. If this happened, Nemesis could bring about losses and suffering. As one who checked\n        extravagant favours by Tykhe (Tyche) (Fortune), Nemesis was regarded as an avenging or\n        punishing divinity.\n\nIn myth Nemesis was particularly concerned with matters of love. She appears as an avenging agent in the\n        stories of Narkissos and Nikaia, whose callous actions brought about the death of their wooers. In some versions\n        of the Trojan War, she was the mother of Helene, and is shown in scenes of her seduction by Paris pointing an\n        accusing finger at the girl.\n\nNemesis was often sometimes depicted as a winged goddess. Her attributes were apple-branch, rein, lash, sword,\n        or balance. Her name was derived from the Greek words nemêsis and nemô, meaning\n        \"dispenser of dues.\" The Romans usually used the Greek name of the goddess but sometimes also named\n        her Invidia (Jealousy) and Rivalitas (Jealous Rivalry).\n\n[1.1] NYX (no father) (Hesiod Theogony 223,\n          Pausanias 7.5.3)\n        [1.2] EREBOS & NYX (Hyginus Preface, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n        [2.1] OKEANOS (Pausanias 7.5.3, Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 48.375, Tzetzes on Lycophron 88)\n        [3.1] ZEUS (Homerica Cypria Frag 8)\n\n[1.1] HELENE (by Zeus) (Homerica Cypria 8,\n          Apollodoros 3.127, Hyginus Astronomy 2.8)\n        [2.1] THE TELKHINES (by Tartaros) (Bacchylides Frag 52)\n\nNE′MESIS (Nemesis), is most commonly described as a daughter of Night, though some call her a daughter of\n        Erebus (Hygin. Fab. Praef.) or of Oceanus (Tzetz. ad Lyc. 88; Paus. i. 33. § 3, vii. 5.\n        § 1). Nemesis is a personification of the moral reverence for law, of the natural fear of committing a\n        culpable action, and hence of conscience, and for this reason she is mentioned along with Aidôs, i. e.\n        Shame (Hes. Theog. 223, Op. et D. 183). In later writers, as Herodotus and Pindar, Nemesis is a kind of\n        fatal divinity, for she directs human affairs in such a manner as to restore the right proportions or\n        equilibrium wherever it has been disturbed; she measures out happiness and unhappiness, and he who is blessed\n        with too many or too frequent gifts of fortune, is visited by her with losses and sufferings, in order that he\n        may become humble, and feel that there are bounds beyond which human happiness cannot proceed with safety. This\n        notion arose from a belief that the gods were envious of excessive human happiness (Herod. i. 34, iii. 40; Pind.\n        Ol. viii. in fin., Pyth. x. 67). Nemesis was thus a check upon extravagant favours conferred\n        upon man by Tyche or Fortune, and from this idea lastly arose that of her being an avenging and punishing power\n        of fate, who, like Dike and the Erinyes, sooner or later overtakes the reckless sinner (Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1043;\n        Sophocl. Philoct. 518; Eurip. Orest. 1362; Catull. 50, in fin.; Orph. Hymn. 60). The\n        inhabitants of Smyrna worshipped two Nemeses, both of whom were daughters of Night (Paus. vii. 5. § 1). She\n        is frequently mentioned under the surnames Adrasteia and Rhamnusia or Rhamnusis, the latter of which she derived\n        from the town of Rhamnus in Attica, where she had a celebrated sanctuary (Paus. i. 33. § 2). Besides the\n        places already mentioned she was worshipped at Patrae (Paus. vii. 20, in fin.) and at Cyzicus (Strab. p. 588).\n        She was usually represented in works of art as a virgin divinity, and in the more ancient works she seems to\n        have resembled Aphrodite, whereas in the later ones she was more grave and serious, and had numerous attributes.\n        But there is an allegorical tradition that Zeus begot by Nemesis at Rhamnus an egg, which Leda found, and from\n        which Helena and the Dioscuri sprang, whence Helena herself is called Rhamnusis (Callim. Hymn. in Dian.\n        232; Paus. i. 33. § 7). On the pedestal of the Rhamnusian Nemesis, Leda was represented leading Helena to\n        Nemesis (Paus. l. c.) Respecting the resemblance between her statue and that of Aphrodite, see Plin.\n        H. N. xxxvi. 4; comp. Paus. i. 33. § 2; Strab. pp. 396, 399.) The Rhamnusian statue bore in its\n        left hand a branch of an apple tree, in its right hand a patera, and on its head a crown, adorned with stags and\n        an image of victory. Sometimes she appears in a pensive standing attitude, holding in her left hand a bridle or\n        a branch of an ash tree, and in her right a wheel, with a sword or a scourge.\n\nADRASTEIA (Adrasteia). A surname of Nemesis, which is derived by some writers from Adrastus, who is said to\n        have built the first sanctuary of Nemesis on the river Asopus (Strab. xiii. p. 588), and by others from the verb\n        didraskein, according to which it would signify the goddess whom none can escape. (Valcken. ad Herod.\n        iii. 40.)\n\nICHNAEA (Ichnaia), that is, the tracing goddess, occurs as a surname of Themis, though in her case it may have\n        been derived from the town of Ichnae, where she was worshipped (Hom. Hymn. in Apoll. Del. 94; Lycoph.\n        129; Strab. ix. p. 435 ; Steph. Byz. s. v. Ichnai), and a surname of Nemesis. (Brunck, Anal.\n        ii. pp. 1. 86.)\n\nRHAMNU′SIA a surname of Nemesis, who had a celebrated temple at Rhamnus in Attica. (Paus. i. 33. §\n        2, vii. 5. § 3; Strab. ix. p. 396, &c.; Steph. Byz. s.v.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 21 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And Nyx (Night) bare hateful Moros (Doom) and black Ker (Violent Death) and Thanatos (Death), and she bare\n        Hypnos (Sleep) and the tribe of Oneiroi (Dreams).

Now she took the form of a fish\n        and sped over the waves of the loud-roaring sea, and now over Okeanos' (Oceanus') stream and the furthest bounds\n        of Earth, and now she sped over the furrowed land, always turning into such dread creatures as the dry land\n        nurtures, that she might escape him.\"\n\nLycophron, Alexandra 86 ff (trans.

From this union she laid an egg, which some herdsman found among the trees and handed over\n        to Lede (Leda). She kept it in a box, and when Helene was hatched after the proper length of time, she reared\n        her as her own.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 33. 4 (trans.

The Greeks say that Nemesis was the mother of Helene (Helen), while\n        Leda suckled and nursed her. The father of Helene the Greeks like everybody else hold to be not Tyndareos\n        (Tyndareus) but Zeus. Having heard this legend [the sculptor] Pheidias has represented Helene as being led to\n        Nemesis by Leda, and he has represented Tyndareos and his children.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 8 (trans.

He bade Venus [Aphrodite], in the\n        form of an eagle, pursue him; he, changed to a swan, as if in flight from the eagle, took refuge with Nemesis\n        and lighted in her lap. Nemesis did not thrust him away, but holding him in her arms, fell into a deep sleep.\n        While she slept, Jupiter [Zeus] embraced her, and then flew away. Because he was seen by men flying high in the\n        sky, they said he was put in the stars. To make this really true, Jupiter put the swan flying and the eagle\n        pursuing in the sky. But Nemesis, as if wedded to the tribe of birds, when her months were ended, bore an egg.\n        Mercurius (Mercury) [Hermes] took it away and carried it to Sparta and threw it in Leda's lap.

But, notwithstanding, even\n        these shall have some good mingled with their evils. And Zeus will destroy this race of mortal men also when\n        they come to have grey hair on the temples at their birth. The father will not agree with his children, nor the\n        children with their father, nor guest with his host, nor comrade with comrade; nor will brother be dear to\n        brother as aforetime.

A wheel\n        turned itself round before the queen's feet, signifying that she rolls all the proud from on high to the ground\n        with the avenging wheel of justice, she the allvanquishing deity who turns the path of life. Round her throne\n        flew a bird of vengeance, a Gryps (Griffin) flying with wings, or balancing himself on four feet, to go unbidden\n        before the flying goddess and show that she herself traverses the four separate quarters of the world:\n        highcrested men she bridles with her bit which none can shake off, such is the meaning of the image, and she\n        rolls a haughty fellow about as it were with the whip of misery, like a self-rolling wheel.\n        When the goddess beheld Artemis with pallid face, she knew that she was offended and full of deadly\n        threatenings, and questioned her in friendly words: ‘Your looks, Archeress, proclaim your anger. Artemis,\n        what impious son of Earth persecutes you? What second Typhoeus has sprung up from the ground? [Nemesis recounts\n        some of those punished by Artemis for their arrogance :] Has Tityos (Tityus) risen again rolling a lovemad eye,\n        and touched the robe of your untouchable mother [Leto]? Where is your bow, Artemis, where are Apollon's arrows?\n        What Orion is using force against you once more? The wretch that touched your dress still lies in his mother's\n        flanks, a lifeless corpse; if any man has clutched your garments with lustful hands, grow another scorpion to\n        avenge your girdle. If bold Otos (Otus) again, or boastful Ephialtes, has desired to win your love so far beyond\n        his reach, then slay the pretender to your unwedded virginity. If some prolific wife provokes your mother Leto,\n        let her weep for her children, another Niobe of stone. Why should not I make another stone on Sipylos? Is your\n        father pestering you to marry as he did with Athena? Surely Kronion (Cronion) [Zeus] has not promised you to\n        Hermes for a wife, as he promised pure Athena to Hephaistos (Hephaestus) in wedlock? But if some woman is\n        persecuting you as one did your mother Leto, I will be the avenger of the offended Archeress.’\n        She had not finished, when the puppybreeding maiden broke in and said to the goddess who saves men from evil :\n        ‘Virgin allvanquishing, guide of creation . . . it is that sour virgin Aura, the daughter of Lelantos\n        (Lelantus), who mocks me and offends me with rude sharp words. But how can I tell you all she said? I am ashamed\n        to describe her calumny of my body and her abuse of my breasts. I have suffered just as my mother did: we are\n        both alike--in Phrygia Niobe offended Leto the mother of twins, in Phrygia again impious Aura offended me. But\n        Niobe paid for it by passing into a changeling form, that daughter of Tantalos (Tantalus) whose children were\n        her sorrow, and she still weeps with stony eyes; I alone am insulted and bear my disgrace without vengeance, but\n        Aura the champion of chastity has washed no stone with tears, she has seen no fountain declaring the faults of\n        her uncontrolled tongue. I pray you, uphold the dignity of your Titan birth. Grant me a boon like my mother,\n        that I may see Aura's body transformed into stone immovable; leave not a maiden of your own race in sorrow, that\n        I may not see Aura mocking me again and not to be turned--or let your sickle of beaten bronze drive her to\n        madness!’\n        She spoke, and the goddess replied with encouraging words : ‘Chaste daughter of Leto, huntress, sister of\n        Phoibos (Phoebus), I will not use my sickle to chastise a Titan girl, I will not make the maiden a stone in\n        Phrygia, for I am myself born of the ancient race of Titanes (Titans) [i.e. Nemesis was a daughter of Okeanos\n        (Oceanus)], and her father Lelantos might blame me when he heard: but one boon I will grant you, Archeress. Aura\n        the maid of the hunt has reproached your virginity, and she shall be a virgin no longer. You shall see her in\n        the bed of a mountain stream weeping fountains of tears for her maiden girdle.’\n        So she consoled her; and Artemis the maiden entered her car with its team of four prickets, left the mountain\n        and drove back to Phrygia. With equal speed the maiden Adrasteia [Nemesis] pursued her obstinate enemy Aura. She\n        had harnessed racing Grypes (Griffins) under her bridle; quick through the air she coursed in the swift car,\n        until she tightened the curving bits of her fourfooted birds, and drew up on the peak of Sipylos in front of the\n        face of Tantalos's daughter [Niobe] with eyeballs of stone. Then she approached haughty Aura. She flicked the\n        proud neck of the hapless girl with her snaky whip, and struck her with the round wheel of justice, and bent the\n        foolish unbending will. Argive Adrasteia (the Unavoidable) [Nemesis] let the whip with its vipers curl round the\n        maiden's girdle, doing pleasure to Artemis and to Dionysos while he was still indignant; and although she was\n        herself unacquainted with love [although Nemesis was later seduced by Zeus], she prepared another love . . .\n        Nemesis now flew back to snowbeaten Tauros until she reached Kydnos (Cydnus) again. And Eros (Love) drove\n        Dionysos mad for the girl with the delicious wound of his arrow, then curving his wings flew lightly to\n        Olympos.\"\n\nSuidas s.v. Adrasteia Nemesis (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Adrasteia Nemesis : From her, someone could not run away (apodraseien). ‘Nemesis Adrasteia\n        follows him, avenging haughty and unrestrained words.’ So Nemesis Adrasteia [is named] from Adrastos\n        (Adrastus). [Applied] to those first experiencing good fortune but later bad; for of the descendents of those\n        who campaigned against the Thebans, only Aigialeus the son of Adrastos was killed.\"\n\nSuidas s.v. Adrasteia : \n        \"Adrasteia : Some say she is the same thing as Nemesis, and that she took the name from a particular king,\n        Adrastos (Adrastus). Alternatively from the ancient Adrastos who suffered divine wrath (nemesis) for his boasts\n        against the Thebans, who had established a shrine of Nemesis, which after these things acquired the name\n        Adrasteia. Demetrios (Demetrius) of Skepsis says that Adrasteia is Artemis, [in a cult] established by one\n        Adrastos. Antimakhos (Antimachus) says : ‘there is a certain great goddess Nemesis, who apportions out all\n        these things to the blessed; Adrestos was the first to set up an altar for her by the flowing river [Asopos\n        (Asopus)].’ Some, however, add that she is different from Nemesis herself: so Menandros (Menander) and\n        Nikostratos (Nicostratus).\"\n\nSuidas s.v. Nemesis : \n        \"Nemesis : Justice. Aristophanes [writes] : ‘O Nemesis, and deep-roaring thunderclaps.’\"\n\nSuidas s.v.

Babrios (Babrius) says [this] in the Fables. And Aelian [says] : ‘palpable evidence of\n        Nemesis the overseer, chastizing proud and disdainful ways.’\n        And a proverb : ‘At least Nemesis walks at your feet’; that is to say that the goddess swiftly\n        pursues wrong-doers. 'Unnoticed she walks at your feet, snaps your haughty neck, and always holds sway over your\n        sustenance with her forearm.'\"\n\nThe Romans occasionally named Nemesis Invidia and described her as a goddess not only of the jealous\n        indignation aroused by hubristic boasts but also as the goddess of jealousy in general.\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 2. 760 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Athena was angry with the daughters of Kekrops (Cecrops) for betraying her trust by spying upon the\n        infant Erikhthonios (Erichthonius) :]\n        Straightway she [Pallas Athene] sought the filthy slimy shack where Invidia (Envy) dwelt deep in a dreary dale,\n        a gruesome sunless hovel, filled with frost, heart-numbing frost, its stagnant air unstirred by any breeze, for\n        ever lacking warmth of cheerful fire, for ever wrapped in gloom. Reaching the place the virgin queen of war\n        paused by the threshold, since she might not pass beneath that roof, and struck upon the door with her spear's\n        point. The door flew wide and there she saw foul Invidia (Envy) eating viper's flesh, fit food for spite, and\n        turned her eyes away. Slowly the creature rose, leaving the snakes half-eaten, and approached with dragging\n        steps, and when she saw the goddess' face so fair and gleaming mail, she scowled and groaned in grief. Her\n        cheeks are sallow, her whole body shrunk, her eyes askew and squinting; black decay befouls her teeth, her\n        bosom's green with bile, and venom coats her tongue. She never smiles save when she relishes the sight of woe;\n        sleep never soothes her, night by night awake with worry, as she sees against her will successes won and sickens\n        at the sight. She wounds, is wounded, she herself her own torture. Tritonia [Athene], filled with loathing,\n        forced a few curt words: ‘Inject your pestilence in one of Cecrops' daughters; that I need; Aglauros is\n        the one [i.e. to be punished for disobeying the goddess].’\n        That said, she soared, launched from her downthrust spear, and sped to heaven. With sidelong glance the creature\n        saw her fly and muttered briefly, grieving to foresee Minerva's triumph; then she took her staff, entwined with\n        thorns, and, wrapped in a black cloud, went forth and in her progress trampled down the flowery meads, withered\n        the grass, and slashed the tree-tops, and with filthy breath defiled peoples and towns and homes, until at last,\n        brilliant and blessed with arts and wealth and peace, Athens in happy festival appears--and tears she sheds to\n        see no cause for tears. Into the room of Cecrops' child she went and did as she was bid. On the girl's breast\n        she laid her withering hand and filled her heart with thorny briars and breathed a baleful blight of poison,\n        black as pitch inside her lungs. And lest the choice of owe should stray too wide, she set before her eyes her\n        sister's face, her fortune-favoured marriage [to Hermes] and the god so glorious; and painted everything larger\n        than life. Such thoughts were agony: Aglauros pined in private grief, distraught all night, all day, in utter\n        misery, wasting away in slow decline, like ice marred by a fitful sun. The happiness of lucky Herse smouldered\n        in her heart like green thorns on a fire that never flame nor give good heat but wanly burn away. Often she'd\n        rather die than see such sights; often she meant, as if some crime, to tell the tale to her strict father. In\n        the end she sat herself outside her sister's door to bar the god's access. With honeyed words he pressed his\n        prayers and pleas.

Just at the gate of\n        full-grown life that the most beauteous of youths was striving to link three years to three Elean lustres [he\n        was fifteen, three five-year Olympian cycles].

It is thought that the wrath of this goddess fell also upon the foreigners [the Persian army] who\n        landed at Marathon. For thinking in their pride that nothing stood in the way of their taking Athens, they were\n        bringing a piece of Parian marble to make a trophy, convinced that their task was already finished. Of this\n        marble Pheidias (Phidias) made a statue of Nemesis, and on the head of the goddess is a crown with deer and\n        small images of Nike (Victory). In her left hand she holds an apple branch, in her right hand a cup on which are\n        wrought Aithiopes (Ethiopians). As to the Aithiopes (Ethiopians), I could hazard no guess myself, nor could I\n        accept the statement of those who are convinced that the Aithiopians have been carved upon the cup because of\n        the river Okeanos (Oceanus). For the Aithiopians, they say, dwell near it, and Okeanos is the father of Nemesis\n        . . .\n        Neither this nor any other ancient statue of Nemesis has wings, for not even the holiest wooden images of the\n        Smyraneans have them, but later artists, convinced that the goddess manifests herself most as a consequence of\n        love, give wings to Nemesis as they do to Eros (Love). I will now go on to describe what is figures on the\n        pedestal of the statue, having made this preface for the sake of clearness. The Greeks say that Nemesis was the\n        mother of Helene (Helen), while Leda suckled and nursed her. The father of Helene the Greeks like everybody else\n        hold to be not Tyndareos (Tyndareus) but Zeus.
