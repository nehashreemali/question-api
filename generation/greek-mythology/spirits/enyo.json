She was the female counterpart and close\n        companion of the god Ares Enyalios.\n\nEnyo was closely identified with Eris, the goddess of strife. Indeed Homer does not\n        appear to distinguish between the two goddesses. She was also connected with the Anatolian goddess Ma and the\n        Roman Bellona.\n\nENYALIOS (by Ares) (Eustathius on Homer 944 &/or Roman Antiquities)\n\nE′NYO (Enuô), the goddess of war, who delights in bloodshed and the destruction of towns, and\n        accompanies Mars in battles. (Hom. Il. v. 333, 592; Eustath. p. 140.) At Thebes and Orchomenos, a\n        festival called Homolôïa was celebrated in honour of Zeus, Demeter, Athena and Enyo, and Zeus was\n        said to have received the surname of Homoloïus from Homoloïs, a priestess of Enyo. (Suid. s.\n          v.; comp. Müller, Orchom. p. 229, 2nd edit.) A statue of Enyo, made by the sons of\n        Praxiteles, stood in the temple of Ares at Athens. (Paus. i. 8. § 5.) Among the Graeae in Hesiod\n        (Theog. 273) there is one called Enyo.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Iliad 5. 333 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"[The] goddesses, who range in order the ranks of men in fighting, [are] Athene (Athena) and Enyo, sacker\n        of cities.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 5. 590 ff : \n        \"And with him followed the Trojan battalions in their strength; and Ares led them with the goddess Enyo,\n        she carrying with her the turmoil of shameless hatred.\"\n\nAeschylus, Seven Against Thebes 41 ff (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[The leaders of the army of the Seven Against Thebes :] Seven warriors, fierce regiment-commanders,\n        slaughtered a bull over a black shield [before the commencement of battle], and then touching the bull's gore\n        with their hands they swore an oath by Ares, by Enyo, and by Phobos (Rout) who delights in blood, that either\n        they will level the city and sack the Kadmeans' (Cadmeans') town by force, or will in death smear this soil with\n        their blood.\"\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 2 to Apollo 85 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"The belted warriors of Enyo.\"\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 4 to Delos 275 ff : \n        \"On thee [the island of Delos] treads not Enyo nor Haides (Death) nor the horses of Ares (War) [i.e. the\n        island was sacrosanct and so free of war].\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 4. 30. 5 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"In the Iliad he [Homer] represented Athena and Enyo as supreme in war.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 1. 365 ff (trans. Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Who is so aweless--daring, who is clad in splendour-flashing arms : nay, surely she shall be Athene, or\n        the mighty-souled Enyo--haply Eris (Strife).\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 2. 525 ff : \n        \"'[Akhilleus (Achilles) and Memnon engage each other in battle :] Twixt these Enyo lengthened out the\n        even-balanced strife, while ever they in that grim wrestle strained their uttermost . . . Those glorious sons of\n        gods, nor ever ceased from wrath of fight. But Eris (Strife) now inclined the fatal scales of battle, which no\n        more were equal-poised.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 5. 25 ff : \n        \"[Among the images decorating the shield of Akhilleus (Achilles) :] And there were man-devouring wars, and\n        all horrors of fight . . . Phobos (Panic) was there, and Deimos (Dread), and ghastly Enyo with limbs all\n        gore-bespattered hideously, and deadly Eris (Strife).\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 8. 186 ff : \n        \"[The Greek heroes Neoptolemos and Eurypylos are engaged in combat :] Hard by them stood Enyo, spurred them\n        on ceaselessly : never paused they from the strife . . .

Revelling in equal fight, she aided none, lest Thetis' or Ares' (the\n        War-God's) wrath be stirred.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 8. 424 ff : \n        \"Many of them [soldiers battling at Troy] dyed the earth red: aye waxed the havoc of death as friends and\n        foes were stricken. O'er the strife shouted for glee Enyo, sister of Ares (War).\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 11. 7 ff : \n        \"The Akhaians (Achaeans) pressed hard on the Trojans even unto Troy. Yet these charged forth--they could\n        not choose but so, for Eris (Strife) and deadly Enyo in their midst stalked, like the fell Erinnyes (Furies) to\n        behold, breathing destruction from their lips like flame. Beside them raged the ruthless-hearted Keres (Fates)\n        fiercely: here Phobos (Panic-fear) and Ares there stirred up the hosts: hard after followed Deimos\n        (Dread).\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 11. 151 ff : \n        \"The black Keres (Fates) joyed to see their conflict [the Greeks and the Trojans], Ares laughed, Enyo\n        yelled horribly. With corpses earth was heaped, with torrent blood was streaming: Eris (Strife incarnate) o'er\n        the slain gloated.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 11. 237 ff : \n        \"[Aeneas and Neoptolemos engage in combat :] Enyo level held the battle's scales.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 12. 436 ff : \n        \"[The Trojans drag the Wooden Horse into the town Troy :] Grimly Enyo laughed, seeing the end of that dire\n        war.\"\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 13. 85 ff : \n        \"[The Greek army enters Troy :] In deadly mood then charged they on the foe.

Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"We see in the plain corpses upon corpses, and horses lying as they fell, and the arms of the warriors as\n        they slipped from their hands, and this mire of gore in which they say Enyo delights.\"\n\nAnonymous, Persian War of Diocletian and Galerius Fragment (trans.
