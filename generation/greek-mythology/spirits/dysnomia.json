  "content": "DYSNOMIA was the personifiied spirit (daimona) of lawlessness and poor civil order. She was a\n        companion of Adikia (Injustice), Ate (Ruin) and Hybris (Violence). Her opposite number was Eunomia (Civil Order).\n\nHesiod, Theogony 230 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"But abhorred Eris (Strife) bare painful Ponos (Toil), and Lethe (Forgetfulness), and Limos (Starvation),\n        and the Algea (Pains), full of weeping, the Hysminai (Fightings) and the Makhai (Battles), the Phonoi (Murders)\n        and the Androktasiai (Man-slaughters), the Neikea (Quarrels), the Pseudo-Logoi (Lies), the Amphilogiai\n        (Disputes), and Dysnomia (Lawlessness) and Ate (Ruin), who share one another's natures, and Horkos (Oath).\"\n\nSolon, Fragment 5 (trans. Gerber, Vol. Greek Elegiac) (Greek elegy C6th B.C.) :\n        \n        \"This is what my heart bids me teach the Athenians, that Dysnomia (Lawlessness) brings the city countless\n        ills, but Eunomia (Lawfulness) reveals all that is orderly and fitting, and often places fetters round the\n        unjust. She makes the rough smooth, puts a stop to excess, weakens insolence (hubris), dries up the\n        blooming of ruin (ate), straightens out crooked judgements, tames deeds of pride, and puts an end to\n        acts of sedition and to the anger of grievous strife.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
