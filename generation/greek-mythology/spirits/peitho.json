  "content": "PEITHO was the goddess or personified spirit (daimona) of persuasion, seduction and charming speech.\n        She was a handmaiden and herald of the goddess Aphrodite.\n\nPeitho was usually depicted as a woman with her hand raised in the act of persuasion or fleeing from the scene\n        of a rape. Her attributes were a ball of twine and a dove.\n\n[1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Hesiod Theogony 349)\n        [2] APHRODITE (Sappho Frag 96, 200, Aeschylus\n          Suppliant Women 1039)\n        [3] PROMETHEUS (Alcman Frags 3 &\n          64)\n        [4] ATE (Aeschylus Agamemnon 385)\n\n[1] HYGEIA (by Eros) (Orphic Rhapsodies Frag)\n        [2] IYNX (Suidas s.v. Iynx)\n        [3] AIGIALEUS, APIA (by Phoroneus) (Scholiast on Euripides' Orestes 920)\n\nPEITHO (Peithô). 1. The personification of Persuasion (Suada or Suadela among the\n        Romans), was worshipped as a divinity at Sicyon, where she was honoured with a temple in the agora. (Herod.\n        viii. 11; Paus. ii. 7. § 7.) Peitho also occurs as a surname of other divinities, such as Aphrodite, whose\n        worship was said to have been introduced at Athens by Theseus, when he united the country communities into towns\n        (Paus. i. 22. § 3), and of Artemis (ii. 21. 1). At Athens the statues of Peitho and Aphrodite Pandemos\n        stood closely together, and at Megara, too, the statue of Peitho stood in the temple of Aphrodite (Paus. i. 43.\n        § 6), so that the two divinities must he conceived as closely connected, or the one, perhaps, merely as an\n        attribute of the other. 2. One of the Charites. (Paus. ix. 35. § 1 ; Suid. s. v. Charites.) 3. One\n        of the daughters of Oceants and Thetis. (Hes. Theog. 349.) 4. The wife of Phoronens, and the mother of\n        Aegialeus and Apia. (Schol. ad Eurip.

She flapt her wings and rallied him soundly\n        : ‘So Kadmos is a baby, or only a novice in love! Eros (Love) is a quick one, and knows nothing of slow\n        bride-grooms! Forgive me, Peitho--your Kadmos dallies, Aphrodite is in haste! Hot Eros (Love) calls you,\n        bridegroom--you plod along like a laggard, and why? . . .
