  "content": "ALKE was the personification (daimona) of battle-strength, prowess and courage. She was one of the\n        spirits of the aigis (aegis)--the tasselled arm-guard of Zeus--, the others being Eris (Strife), Phobos (Terror) and Ioke\n        (Onslaught).\n\nAlke was probably numbered amongst the battle-spirits known as Makhai (Machae).\n\nHomer, Iliad 5. 738 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"Across her [Athena's] shoulders she threw the betasselled, terrible aigis (aegis), all about\n        which Phobos (Terror) hangs like a garland, and Eris (Hatred) is there, and Alke (Battle-Strength), and\n        heart-freezing Ioke (Onslaught) and thereon is set the head of the grim gigantic Gorgo (Gorgon), a thing of fear\n        and horror, portent of Zeus of the aigis.\" [N.B. The daimones (spirits) imbued the aigis with its power.]\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
