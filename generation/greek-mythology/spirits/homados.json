  "content": "HOMADOS was the personified spirit (daimon) of the din of battle--the shouts and cries of men and the\n        clashing of weapons. He was probably numbered amongst the Makhai (Machae), the\n        daimones of the battlefield.\n\nHesiod, Shield of Heracles 139 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th\n          B.C.) :\n        \"In his hands he [Herakles] took his shield, all glittering: no\n        one ever broke it with a blow or crushed it. And a wonder it was\n        to see . . . In the centre was Phobos (Fear)\n        worked in adamant, unspeakable, staring backwards with eyes that\n        glowed with fire. His mouth was full of teeth in a white row,\n        fearful and daunting, and upon his grim brow hovered frightful Eris (Battle-Strife) who arrays the throng of\n        men: pitiless she, for she took\n        away the mind and senses of poor wretches who made war against\n        the son of Zeus . . . Upon the shield Proioxis (Pursuit) and Palioxis (Flight) were wrought,\n        and Homados (Tumult), and Phobos (Panic), and Androktasia (Slaughter). Eris (Battle-Strife) also, and Kydoimos\n        (Cydoemus, Confusion)\n        were hurrying about, and deadly Ker (Fate) was there holding one man\n        newly wounded.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
