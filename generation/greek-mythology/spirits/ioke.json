  "content": "IOKE was the female personification (daimona) of onslaught, battle-tumult, pursuit and rout. She was\n        one of the spirits of the aigis (aegis)--the tasselled arm-guard of Zeus--alongside Alke (Battle-Strength), Eris (Strife) and Phobos (Terror). Alke was perhaps the same as Proioxis and\n        was likely numbered amongst the Makhai (Machae) (Battle-Spirits).\n\nHomer, Iliad 5. 738 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"Across her [Athena's] shoulders she threw the betasselled, terrible aigis (aegis), all about which Phobos\n        (Terror) hangs like a garland, and Eris (Hatred) is there, and Alke (Battle Strength), and heart-freezing Ioke\n        (Onslaught) and thereon is set the head of the grim gigantic Gorgo (Gorgon), a thing of fear and horror, portent\n        of Zeus of the aigis.\"\n        [N.B. The daimones (spirits) imbued the aigis with its power.]\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
