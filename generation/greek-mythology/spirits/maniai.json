  "content": "THE MANIAI (Maniae) were the personified spirits (daimones) of madness, insanity, and crazed frenzy.\n        They were closely related to Lyssa, the spirit of mad-rage, and the Erinyes (Furies).\n\nMA′NIAE (Maniai), certain mysterious divinities, who had a sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Megalopolis,\n        in Arcadia, and whom Pausanias (viii. 34. § 1) considered to be the same as the Eumenides.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nTheognis, Fragment 1. 1231 (trans. Gerber, Vol. Greek Elegiac) (Greek elegy C6th\n          B.C.) : \n        \"Cruel Eros (Love), the Maniai (Spirits of Madness) took you up and nursed you.\"\n\nAeschylus, Fragment 179 (from Etymologicum Genuinum s.v. asalês) (trans. Weir\n          Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        \"Or reckless madness (mania) from the gods.\" [N.B. Mania is perhaps personified here.]\n\nQuintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 5. 450 ff (trans. Way) (Greek epic C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Ajax was driven mad when the armour of Akhilleus (Achilles) was awarded to Odysseus and slew a flock of\n        sheep imagining they were his Greek enemies :] Thinking that amidst the slain Odysseus lay blood-boltered at his\n        feet. But in that moment from his mind and eyes Athena tore away the nightmare-fiend of Mania (Madness)\n        havoc-breathing, and it passed thence swiftly to the rock-walled river Styx where dwell the winged Erinnyes\n        (Furies), they which still visit with torments overweening men.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 4. 481 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Malign Tisiphone [the Erinys] seized a torch steeped in blood, put on a robe all red with dripping gore\n        and wound a snake about her waist, and started from her home [i.e. she departed from the underworld on a mission\n        to drive Athamas mad]; and with her as she went were Luctus (Grief) [Penthos] and Pavor (Dread) [Phobos], Terror\n        (Fear) [Deimos], and Insania (Madness) [Mania] too with frantic face.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
