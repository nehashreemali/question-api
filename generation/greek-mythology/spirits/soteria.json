  "content": "SOTERIA was the goddess or personified spirit (daimona) of safety, and deliverance and preservation\n        from harm.\n\nHer male counterparts were the daimon Soter and the god Dionysos Soter. The Romans named her Salus (Preservation).\n\nPresumably a daughter of ZEUS or DIONYSOS (both gods were titled Soter)\n\nSOTE′RIA (Sôtêria), i.e., the personification of safety or recovery (Lat. Salus) was\n        worshipped as a divinity in Greece, and had a Temple and a statue at Patrae (Paus. vii. 21. § 2,24. §\n        2).\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 7. 24. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[In Aigion (Aegium) in Akhaia (Achaea)] they also have a sanctuary of Soteria (Safety). Her image may be\n        seen by none but the priests, and the following ritual is performed. They take cakes of the district from the\n        goddess and throw them into the sea, saying that they send them to Arethousa at Syrakousa (Syracuse).\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 7. 19. 7 & 21. 7 :\n        \"Eurypylos [a hero of the Trojan War] opened the chest [containing a sacred idol of Dionysos], saw the\n        image, and forthwith on seeing it went mad. He continued to be insane for the greater part of the time, with\n        rare lucid intervals . . . \n        There is a sanctuary [in Patrai (Patrae) in Akhaia (Achaea)] with an image of stone. It is called the sanctuary\n        of Soteria (Deliverance), and the story is that it was originally founded by Eurypylos on being cured of his\n        madness.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 3. 879 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :\n        \n        \"March 30 Comitialis. When the shepherd feeds and pens his kids four more times and the grasslands whiten\n        with four fresh dews, Janus should be worshipped and gentle Concordia (Concord), Salus Romana (Safety of Rome)\n        and the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace).\" [N.B. Salus was the Roman equivalent of Soteria.]\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
