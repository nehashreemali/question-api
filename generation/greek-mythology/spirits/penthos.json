  "content": "PENTHOS was the personified spirit (daimon) of grief and lamentation. He may have been numbered\n        amongst the Algea (Sorrows).\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"From Aether (Air) and Terra (Gaia) [Gaia] [were born] : Dolor (Pain), Dolus (Deceit), Ira (Wrath), Luctus\n        (Lamentation) [i.e. Penthos], Mendacium (Lies), Jusjurandum (Oath), Ultio (Vengeance), Intemperantia\n        (Intemperance), Altercatio (Altercation), Oblivio (Forgetfulness), Socordia (Sloth), Timor (Fear), Superbia\n        (Pride), Incestum (Incest), Pugna (Combat).\"\n        [N.B. Luctus is the Roman name for the Greek Penthos.]\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 4. 481 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Malign Tisiphone [the Erinys] seized a torch steeped in blood, put on a robe all red with dripping gore\n        and wound a snake about her waist, and started from her home [i.e. she departed from the underworld on a mission\n        to drive Athamas mad]; and with her as she went were Luctus (Grief) [Penthos] and Pavor (Dread) [Phobos], Terror\n        (Fear) [Deimos], and Insania (Madness) [Mania] too with frantic face.\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 6. 268 ff (trans. Fairclough) (Roman epic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"[Aeneas is guided by the Sibyl through the Underworld :] On they went dimly, beneath the lonely night amid\n        the gloom, through the empty halls of Dis [Haides] and his phantom realm . . . Just before the entrance, even\n        within the very jaws of Orcus [Haides], Luctus (Grief) [Penthos] and avenging Curae (Cares) have set their bed;\n        there pale Morbi (Diseases) [Nosoi] dwell, sad Senectus (Old Age) [Geras], and Metus (Fear) [Deimos], and Fames\n        (Hunger) [Limos], temptress to sin, and loathly Egestas (Want) [Aporia], shapes terrible to view; and Letum\n        (Death) [Thanatos] and Labor (Toil) [Ponos]; next, Letum's (Death's) own brother Sopor (Sleep) [Hypnos], and\n        Gaudia (the Soul's Guilty Joys), and, on the threshold opposite, the death-dealing Bellum (War) [Polemos], and\n        the Eumenides' [the Furies'] iron cells, and maddening Discordia (Strife) [Eris], her snaky locks entwined with\n        bloody ribbons. In the midst an elm, shadowy and vast, spreads her boughs and aged arms, the whome which, men\n        say, false Somnia (Dreams) [Oneiroi] hold, clinging under every leaf.\"\n\nSeneca, Hercules Furens 686 ff (trans. Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[A description of the Underworld :] The foul pool of Cocytus' sluggish stream lies here; here the vulture,\n        there the dole-bringing owl utters its cry, and the sad omen of the gruesome screech-owl sounds. The leaves\n        shudder, black with gloomy foliage where sluggish Sopor (Sleep) [Hypnos] clings to the overhanging yew, where\n        sad Fames (Hunger) [Limos] lies with wasted jaws, and Pudor (Shame) [Aidos], too late, hides her guilt-burdened\n        face. Metus (Dread) [Deimos] stalks there, gloomy Pavor (Fear) [Phobos] and gnashing Dolor (Pain) [Algos], sable\n        Luctus (Grief) [Penthos], tottering Morbus (Disease) [Nosos] and iron-girt Bella (War) [Enyo]; and last of all\n        slow Senectus (Old-Age) [Geras] supports his steps upon a staff.\"\n\nSeneca, Oedipus 582 : \n        \"[The seer Teiresias performs necromancy to learn the cause of a pestilence ravaging Thebes :] Suddenly the\n        earth yawned and opened wide with gulf immeasurable. Myself, I saw the numb pools amidst the shadows; myself,\n        the wan gods and night in very truth. My frozen blood stood still and clogged my veins. Forth leaped a savage\n        cohort [of ghosts] . . . Then grim Erinys (Vengeance) shrieked, and blind Furor (Fury) [Lyssa] and Horror\n        (Horror) [Phrike], and all the forms which spawn and lurk midst the eternal shades [i.e. in the underworld]:\n        Luctus (Grief) [Penthos], tearing her hair; Morbus (Disease) [Nosos], scarce holding up her wearied head;\n        Senectus (Age) [Geras], burdened with herself; impending Metus (Fear) [Deimos], and greedy Pestis (Pestilence)\n        [Nosos], the Ogygian people's curse. Our spirits died within us. Even she [Manto] who knew the rites and the\n        arts of her aged sire [Teiresias] stood amazed. But he, undaunted and bold from his lost sight, summons the\n        bloodless throng of cruel Dis [Haides].\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 2. 286 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[The cursed necklace of Harmonia was crafted by Vulcan-Hephaistos with the aid of malevolent daimones :]\n        None did mould it, but Luctus (Grief) [Penthos], and all the Irae (Madnesses) [Lyssai], and Dolor (Anguish)\n        [Algos] and Discordia (Discord) [Eris], with all the craft of her right hand.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 3. 126 ff : \n        \"Luctus (Grief) [Penthos] inconsolable stands there [amongst the mourners] with bloody raiment rent and\n        with pierced breast incites the mothers [of the slain warriors]. They search the helmets of the warriors now\n        cold in death, and display the bodies they have found, stretched prostrate alike on stranger and on\n        kinsman.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 10. 556 ff : \n        \"Dreadful is the sight within [the besieged city of Thebes], scarce Mars [Ares] himself would rejoice to\n        behold it; Luctus (Grief) [Penthos] and Furor (Mad Fury) [Lyssa] and Pavor (Panic) [Phobos], and Fuga (Rout)\n        [Phyge] enwrapped in blinding gloom rend with many-voiced discord the frenzied, horror-stricken town.\"\n\nStatius, Silvae 2. 1. 12 (trans. Mozley) (Roman poetry C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Demented Luctus (Grief) [Penthos] hath his stand in they heart; at a touch thy breast heaves and\n        sobs.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
