Her opposite number was Dike (Justice) who was sometimes depicted beating her with a club.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 18. 2(trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Among the images decorating the chest of Kypselos (Cypselus) dedicated at Olympia :] A beautiful woman is\n        punishing an ugly one, choking her with one hand and with the other striking her with a staff. It is Dike\n        (Justice) who thus treats Adikia (Injustice).\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
