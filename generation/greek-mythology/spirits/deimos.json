  "content": "DEIMOS and PHOBOS were the gods or personified spirits (daimones) of fear. Deimos represented terror\n        and dread, while his brother Phobos was panic, flight and rout. They were sons of the war-god Ares who\n        accompanied their father into battle, driving his chariot and spreading fear in his wake. As sons of Aphrodite,\n        goddess of love, the twins also represented fear of loss.\n\nIn classical art the two were usually depicted as unremarkable youths, though sometimes Phobos was given the\n        head of a lion or leonine features (e.g. the image to the right).\n\n[1.1] ARES & APHRODITE (Hesiod Theogony 933, Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.2] ARES (Homer Iliad 13.298, Quintus Smyrnaeus\n          10.51, Statius Thebaid 3.424, Nonnus Dionysiaca 2.414)\n\nPHOBUS (Phobos), Latin Metus, the personification of fear, is described as a son of Ares and Cvthereia, a\n        brother of Deimos, and is one of the ordinary companions of Ares. (Hom. Il. xi. 37, xiii. 299, xv. 119;\n        Hes. Theog. 934.) Phobus was represented on the shield of Agamemnon, on the chest of Cypsellus, with\n        the head of a lion.
