  "content": "ADEPHAGIA was the goddess of gluttony or eating ones full who possessed a temple in one of the Greek colonies\n        of Sicily.\n\nShe was probably worshipped as a goddess of agricultural bounty rather than self-indulgence or excess.\n\nAelian, Historical Miscellany 1. 27 (trans. Wilson) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to 3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"It is also said that there is a temple to Adephagia (Gluttony) in Sikelia (Sicily), and a statue of\n        Demeter Sitos (the Corn-Goddess).\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Athenaeus 416b (after Polemon Historicus).\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
