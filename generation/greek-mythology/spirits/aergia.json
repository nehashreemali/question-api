  "content": "AERGIA was the personified spirit (daimona) of idleness, laziness, indolence and sloth. Her opposite\n        number was probably Hormes (Effort).\n\nN.B. Aergia is presumably the Greek form of the Latin Socordia mentioned by Hyginus. Although his list of\n        abstractions is derived from a Greek source, the name-words have mostly been translated into Latin.\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"From Aether (Air) and Terra (Earth) [Gaia] [were born] : Dolor (Pain), Dolus (Guile), Ira (Rage), Luctus\n        (Lamentation), Mendacium (Lies), Jusjurandum (Oath), Ultio (Vengeance), Intemperantia (Intemperance), Altercatio\n        (Altercation), Oblivio (Forgetfulness), Socordia (Sloth) [i.e. Aergia], Timor (Fear), Superbia (Pride), Incestum\n        (Incest), Pugna (Combat).\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 10. 90 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[In] the hollow recesses of a deep and rocky cave . . . [are] set the halls of lazy Somnus (Sleep)\n        [Hypnos] and his untroubled dwelling. The threshold is guarded by shady Quies (Quiet) and dull Oblivio\n        (Forgetfulness) [Lethe] and torpid Ignavia (Sloth) [Aergia] with ever drowsy countenance. Otia (Ease) and\n        Silentia (Silence) with folded wings sit mute in the forecourt.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
