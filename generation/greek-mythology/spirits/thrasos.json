  "content": "THRASOS was the personified spirit (daimon) of rashness, insolence, recklessness and excessive\n        boldness. He was a companion of Hybris and Ate, malevolent\n        spirits of arrogance and delusion.\n\nAeschylus, Agamemnon 763 ff (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"But an old Hybris (hubris) tends to bring forth in evil men, sooner or later, at the fated hour of birth,\n        a young hubris and that irresistible, unconquerable, unholy spirit (daimon), Thrasos (Recklessness),\n        and for the household black Ates (Curses), which resemble their parents. But Dike (Righteousness) shines in\n        smoke-begrimed dwellings and esteems the virtuous man.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
