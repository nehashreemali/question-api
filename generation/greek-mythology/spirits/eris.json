  "content": "ERIS was the goddess or personified spirit (daimona) of strife, discord, contention and rivalry. She\n        was often portrayed, more specifically, as the daimona of the strife of war, haunting the battlefield\n        and delighting in human bloodshed.\n\nBecause of Eris' disagreeable nature she was the only goddess not to be invited to the wedding of Peleus and\n        Thetis. When she turned up anyway and was refused admittance, she\n        raged and threw a golden apple amongst the goddesses inscribed \"To the fairest.\" Three laid claim to\n        it--Hera, Aphrodite and Athena--and in their rivalry brought about the events leading up to the Trojan War.\n\nEris was closely identified with the war-goddess Enyo. Homer uses the names\n        interchangeably. Her Roman name was Discordia.\n\n[1.1] NYX (Hesiod Theogony 225, Hesiod Works\n          & Days 11)\n        [1.2] EREBOS & NYX (Hyginus Preface)\n        [2.1] ZEUS & HERA (Eris named sister\n        of Ares) (Homer Iliad 4.441, Quintus Smyrnaeus 10.51)\n\n[1.1] PONOS, LETHE, LIMOS, THE ALGEA, THE HYSMINAI, THE\n          MAKHAI, THE PHONOI, THE ANDROKTASIAI, THE NEIKEA, THE PSEUDOLOGOI, THE AMPHILOGIAI, DYSNOMIA, ATE,\n        HORKOS (no father) (Hesiod Theogony 226)\n        [1.2] HORKOS (Hesiod Works & Days 804)\n\nERIS (Eris), the goddess who calls forth war and discord. According to the Iliad, she wanders about, at first\n        small and insignificant, but she soon raises her head up to heaven (iv. 441). She is the friend and sister of\n        Ares, and with him she delights in the tumult of war, increasing the moaning of men. (iv. 445, v. 518, xx. 48.)\n        She is insatiable in her desire for bloodshed, and after all the other gods have withdrawn from the\n        battle-field, she still remains rejoicing over the havoc that has been made. (v. 518, xi. 3, &c., 73.)\n        According to Hesiod (Theog. 225, &c.), she was a daughter of Night, and the poet describes her as\n        the mother of a variety of allegorical beings, which are the causes or representatives of man's misfortunes. It\n        was Eris who threw the apple into the assembly of the gods, the cause of so much suffering and war. Virgil\n        introduces Discordia as a being similar to the Homeric Eris; for Discordia appears in company with Mars,\n        Bellona, and the Furies, and Virgil is evidently imitating Homer. (Aen.. viii. 702; Serv. Aen.\n        i. 31, vi. 280.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Iliad 4. 441 ff (trans.

But the woman [Pandora] took off the great\n        lid of the jar with her hands and scattered all these [presumably the daimon-spawn of Eris] and her thought\n        caused sorrow and mischief to men. Only Elpis (Hope) remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim\n        of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of\n        Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. But the rest, countless plagues (muria lugra), wander\n        amongst men; for earth is full of evils (kakoi) and the sea is full. Of themselves diseases\n        (nosoi) come upon men continually by day and by night, bringing mischief to mortals silently; for wise\n        Zeus took away speech from them. So is there no way to escape the will of Zeus.\"\n        [N.B.\n        The word Lugra (Banes) used above to describe the Daimones released from the jar of Pandora, is found in the\n        works of Homer and other poets in combination with terms such as algea, androktasie,\n        neikos, makhai, penthos, ponoi, nosos, olethros and\n        geras. Most of these Lugra (Banes) are personified as children of Eris in Hesiod's Theogony.

Zeus plans with Themis to bring about the Trojan war. Eris (Strife) arrives while the gods are feasting\n        at the marriage of Peleus and starts a dispute between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite as to which of them is\n        fairest. The three are led by Hermes at the command of Zeus to Alexandros (Alexander) [Paris] on Mount Ida for\n        his decision, and Alexandros, lured by his promised marriage with Helene (Helen), decides in favour of Aphrodite\n        [which led to the Trojan War].\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E3. 2 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Eris (Strife) tossed an apple [at the wedding of Thetis] to Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, in recognition of\n        their beauty, and Zeus bade Hermes escort them to Alexandros (Alexander) [Paris] on Ide, to be judged by him.\n        They offered Alexandros gifts: Hera said if she were chosen fairest of all women, she would make him king of all\n        men; Athena promised him victory in war; and Aphrodite promised him Helene (Helen) in marriage. So he chose\n        Aphrodite [which led to the Trojan War].\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 92 (trans.

When she came later and was not admitted to the banquet, she threw an apple through the door, saying\n        that the fairest should take it. Juno [Hera], Venus [Aphrodite], and Minerva [Athene] claimed the beauty prize\n        for themselves.\"\n\nColluthus, Rape of Helen 38 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poetry C5th to C6th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The wedding of Peleus and Thetis :] And all the race of gods hasted to do honour to the white-armed bride\n        [Thetis] . . . But Eris (Strife) [alone] did Kheiron (Chiron) [who sent out the invitations] leave unhonoured:\n        Kheiron did not regard her and Peleus heeded her not . . . And Eris (Strife) overcome by the pangs of angry\n        jealousy, wandered in search of a way to disturb the banquet of the gods. And often would she leap up from her\n        chair, set with precious stones, and anon sit down again. She smote her hand the bosom of the earth and heeded\n        not the rock. Fain would she unbar the bolts of the darksome hollows and rouse the Titanes (Titans) from the\n        nether pit and destroy heaven the seat of Zeus, who rules on high. Fain would she brandish the roaring\n        thunderbolt of fire, yet gave way, for all her rage, to Hephaistos (Hephaestus), keeper of quenchless fire and\n        of iron. And she thought to rouse the heavy-clashing din of shields, if haply they might leap up in terror at\n        the noise. But from her later crafty counsel, too, she withdrew in fear of iron Ares, the shielded warrior.\n        And now she bethought her of the golden apples of the Hesperides. Thence Eris took the fruit that should be the\n        harbinger of war, even the apple, and devised the scheme of signal woes. Whirling her arm she hurled into the\n        banquet the primal seed of turmoil and disturbed the choir of goddesses. Hera, glorying to be the spouse and to\n        share the bed of Zeus, rose up amazed, and would fain have seized it. And Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite], as being\n        more excellent than all, desired to have the apple, for that it is the treasure of the Erotes (Loves). But Hera\n        would not give it up and Athena would not yield. And Zeus, seeing the quarrel of the goddesses, and calling his\n        son Hermaon [Hermes], who sat below his throne, addressed him thus : ‘If haply, my son, thou hast heard of\n        a son of Priamos (Priam), one Paris, the splendid youth, who tends his herds on this hills of Troy, give to him\n        the apple; and bid him judge the goddesses' meeting brows and orbed eyes. And let her that is preferred have the\n        famous fruit to carry away as the prize of the fairer and ornament of the Loves.’\n        So the father, the son of Kronos (Cronus), commanded Hermaon. And he hearkened to the bidding of his father and\n        led the goddesses upon the way and failed not to heed . . . \n        [Paris received the goddesses and awarded the apple to Aphrodite who had bribed him by offering the most\n        beautiful woman in the world--Helene (Helen)--as his bride. With Aphrodite's aid Paris seduced queen Helene and\n        abducted her to Troy, the spark that preempted the Trojan War].\"\n\nAesop, Fables 534 (from Chambry 129) (trans. Gibbs) (Greek fable C6th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Herakles (Heracles) was making his way through a narrow pass. He saw something that looked like an apple\n        lying on the ground and he tried to smash it with his club. After having been struck by the club, the thing\n        swelled up to twice its size. Herakles struck it again with his club, even harder than before, and the thing\n        then expanded to such a size that it blocked Herakles's way. Herakles let go of his club and stood there,\n        amazed. Athena saw him and said, ‘O Herakles, don't be so surprised! This thing that has brought about\n        your confusion is Aporia (Contentiousness) and Eris (Strife). If you just leave it alone, it stays small; but if\n        you decide to fight it, then it swells from its small size and grows large.’\"\n\nEris was a goddess of the battlefield with an insatiable desire for bloodshed. Even after all the other gods\n        had withdrawn from battle, she remained, rejoicing over the slaughter.\n\nHomer, Iliad 4. 441 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"Ares drove these [the Trojans] on, and the Akhaians (Achaeans) grey-eyed Athene (Athena), and Phobos\n        (Terror) drove them, and Deimos (Fear), and Eris (Hate) whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and\n        companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides\n        on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she\n        walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 5. 333 ff : \n        \"[The] goddesses, who range in order the ranks of men in fighting, [are] Athene and Enyo, sacker of\n        cities.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 5. 518 ff : \n        \"Their fighting work [was woken by] . . . man-slaughtering Ares, and Eris, whose wrath is relentless.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 5. 738 ff (trans.
