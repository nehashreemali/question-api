  "content": "HESYKHIA (Hesychia) was the personified spirit (daimona) of quiet, rest, silence and stillness. She\n        was a daughter of Dike (Lady Justice). Her Roman equivalents were Quies (Quiet) and Silentia (Silence).\n\nHESY′CHIA (Hêsuchia), the personification of tranquillity and peace, is called a daughter of Dice,\n        that is, Justice. (Pind. Ol. iv. 18, Pyth. viii. 1, Fragm. 228. p. 669, ed. Boeckh.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPindar, Pythian Ode 8. 1 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"Hesykhia (Hesychia, Tranquility), goddess of friendly intent, daughter of Dike (Justice), you who make\n        cities great, holding the supreme keys of counsel and of wars.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 10. 90 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[In] the hollow recesses of a deep and rocky cave . . . [are] set the halls of lazy Somnus (Sleep)\n        [Hypnos] and his untroubled dwelling. The threshold is guarded by shady Quies (Quiet) [Hesykhia] and dull\n        Oblivio (Forgetfulness) [Lethe] and torpid Ignavia (Sloth) with ever drowsy countenance. Otia (Ease) and\n        Silentia (Silence) [Hesykhia] with folded wings sit mute in the forecourt sand drive the blustering winds from\n        the roof-top, and forbid the branches to sway, and take away their warblings from the birds. No roar of the sea\n        is here, though all the shores be sounding, nor yet of the sky; the very torrent that runs down the deep valley\n        nigh the cave is silent among the rocks and boulders.\"\n\nStatius, Silvae 1. 6. 90 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman poetry C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[During the celebrations of the Saturnalia festival at Rome :] The sky was ablaze with fire, and suffered\n        not the reign of darkness : sluggish Quies (Quiet) [Hesykhia] fled, and lazy Somnus (Sleep) [Hypnos] betook\n        himself to other cities at the sight.\"\n\nApuleius, The Golden Ass 11. 15 ff (trans. Walsh) (Roman novel C2nd A.D.) :\n        \n        \"Lucius, you have reached [in your spirit] the harbour of Quies (Quiet) [Hesykhia] and the altar of\n        Misericordia (Mercy) [Eleos].\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
