  "content": "EUKLEIA (Eucleia) was the goddess or personified spirit (daimona) of good repute and glory. She and\n        her three sisters--Eupheme (Acclaim), Euthenia\n        (Prosperity) and Philophrosyne (Welcome)--were probably the goddesses known\n        collectively as the younger Kharites (Charites).\n\nIn Greek vase paintings Eukleia was often depicted amongst the attendants of the goddess Aphrodite where she\n        represented the good repute of a chaste bride. She was sometimes identified with Artemis.\n\nEukleia had a temple at Aigia (Aegae) in Makedonia.\n\n[1] HEPHAISTOS & AGLAIA (Orphic Rhapsodies Frag)\n        [2] HERAKLES & MYRTO (Plutarch Aristides 20.5)\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 13 (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric IV) (Greek lyric C5th\n          B.C.) :\n        \"If their bodies have perished . . . their fame still lives; for Arete (Excellence), shining among all men,\n        is not dimmed, hidden by the lightless (veil) of night : flourishing constantly with undying fame she ranges\n        over the land and the sea that drives many from their course. Look, now she honours [Aigina] the glory-winning\n        island of Aiakos (Aeacus) and with garland-loving Eukleia (Eucleia, Good Repute) steers the city, she and wise\n        Eunomia (Good Order), who has festivities as her portion and guards in peace the cities of pious men.\"\n\nPlutarch, Life of Aristides 20. 5 (trans. Perrin) (Greek historian C1st to C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"In admiration of him [an historical war-hero] the Plataians (Plataeans) gave him burial in the sanctuary\n        of Artemis Eukleia (Eucleia), and inscribed upon his tomb this tetrameter verse :--Eukhidas (Euchidas), to Pytho\n        running, came back here the selfsame day.\n        Now Eukleia is regarded by most as Artemis, and is so addressed; but some say she was a daughter of Herakles and\n        of that Myrto who was daughter of Menoitios (Menoetius) and sister of Patroklos (Patroclus), and that, dying in\n        virginity, she received divine honors among the Boiotians (Boeotians) and Lokrians (Locrians). For she has an\n        altar and an image built in every market place, and receives preliminary sacrifices from would-be brides and\n        bridegrooms [i.e. as the goddess of good repute].\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Inscriptiones Graecum 3.277.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
