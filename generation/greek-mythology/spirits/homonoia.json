  "content": "HOMONOIA was the personified spirit (daimona) of concord, unanimity and oneness of mind. She was\n        sometimes numbered amongst the Praxidikai (Exacters of Justice), goddess-daughters\n        of an early Theban king named Ogygos. As such Homonoia was probably closely identified with the Theban\n        goddess-queen Harmonia (Harmony).\n        Her opposite number was Eris (Strife).\n\nSOTER & PRAXIDIKE (Suidas\n          s.v.
