  "content": "NOMOS was the personified spirit (daimon) of law. He was the husband of Eusebeia (Piety) and the\n        father of Dike (Justice).\n        Nomos was usually just an aspect of Zeus rather than a separate divinity.\n\nNOMOS (Nomos), a personification of law, described as the ruler of gods and men. (Pind. Fragm. 151, p.\n        640, ed. Böckh; Plat. Gorg. p. 484, b.; Orph. Hymn. 63.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nOrphic Hymn 64 to Nomos (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Hymn to Nomos (Law). The holy king of gods and men I call, heavenly Nomos, the righteous seal of all: the\n        seal which stamps whatever the earth contains, and all concealed within the liquid plains: stable, and starry,\n        of harmonious frame, preserving laws eternally the same. Thy all-composing power in heaven appears, connects its\n        frame, and props the starry spheres; and unjust envy shakes with dreadful sound, tossed by thy arm in giddy\n        whirls around. 'Tis thine the life of mortals to defend, and crown existence with a blessed end; for thy command\n        alone, of all that lives, order and rule to every dwelling goes. Ever observant of the upright mind, and of just\n        actions the companion kind. Foe to the lawless, with avenging ire, their steps involving in destruction dire.\n        Come, blest, abundant power, whom all reverse, by all desired, with favouring mind draw near; give me through\n        life on thee to fix my sight, and never forsake the equal paths of right.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
