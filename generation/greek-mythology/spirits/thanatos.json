  "content": "THANATOS was the god or personified spirit (daimon) of non-violent death. His touch was gentle,\n        likened to that of his twin brother Hypnos (Sleep).\n        Violent death was the domain of Thanatos' blood-craving sisters, the Keres, spirits of\n        slaughter and disease.\n\nThanatos plays a prominent role in two myths. Once when he was sent to fetch Alkestis (Alcestis) to the\n        underworld, he was driven off by Herakles in a fight. Another time he was captured by the criminal Sisyphos\n        (Sisyphus) who trapped him in a sack so as to avoid death.\n\nIn Greek vase painting Thanatos was depicted as a winged, bearded older man, or more rarely as a beardless\n        youth. He often appears in a scene from the Iliad, opposite his brother Hypnos (Sleep) carrying off the\n        body of Sarpedon. In Roman sculptural reliefs he was portrayed as a youth holding a down-turned torch and wreath\n        or butterfly which symbolised the soul of the dead.\n\n[1.1] NYX (no father) (Hesiod Theogony 212,\n          Homer Iliad 14.250, Pausanias 5.18.1, Seneca Hercules Fur. 1068)\n        [1.2] EREBOS & NYX (Hyginus Preface, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n\nTHA′NATOS (Thanatos), Latin Mors, a personification of Death. In the Homeric poems Death does\n        not appear as a distinct divinity, though he is described as the brother of Sleep, together with whom he carries\n        the body of Sarpedon from the field of battle to the country of the Lycians. (Il. xvi. 672, xiv. 231.)\n        In Hesiod (Theog. 211, &c. 756) he is a son of Night and a brother of Ker and Sleep, and Death and\n        Sleep reside in the lower world. (Comp. Virg. Aen. vi. 277.) In the Alcestis of Euripides, where Death\n        cones upon the stage, he appears as an austere priest of Hades in a dark robe and with the sacrificial sword,\n        with which he cuts off a lock of a dying person, and devotes it to the lower world. (Alcest. 75, 843,\n          845.) On the whole, later poets describe Death as a sad or terrific being (Horat. Carm. i. 4.\n        13, Sat. ii. 1. 58), but the best artists of the Greeks, avoiding any thing that might be displeasing,\n        abandoned the ideas suggested to them by the poets. and represented Death under a more pleasing aspect. On the\n        chest of Cypselus, Night was represented with two boys, one black and the other white (Paus. v. 18. § 1),\n        and at Sparta there were statues of both Death and Sleep. (iii. 18. § 1.) Both were usually represented as\n        slumbering youths, or as genii with torches turned upside down. There are traces of sacrifices having been\n        offered to Death (Serv. ad Aen. xi. 197; Stat. Theb. iv. 528; Lucan, vi. 600; Philostr.\n        Vit. Apoll. v. 4), but no temples are mentioned anywhere.\n\nPAEAN (Paian, Paiêôn or Paiôn), that is, \"the healing.\" The name was used in the more general\n        sense of deliverer from any evil or calamity (Pind. Pyth. iv. 480), and was thus applied to Apollo and\n        Thanatos, or Death, who are conceived as delivering men from the pains and sorrows of life. (Soph. Oed. Tyr.\n          154 ; Paus. i. 34. § 2 ; Eurip. Hippol. 1373.) With regard to Apollo and Thanatos however,\n        the name may at the same time contain an allusion to paiein, to strike, since both are also regarded as\n        destroyers.

According to\n        the fabulous story told by Pherekydes (Frag. 78 in Müller, Fragmenta Historicum Graecorum)\n        Sisyphos made known to Asopos that it was Zeus who had carried off his daughter Aigina; in punishment for which\n        offence the god sent Thanatos (Death) against the babbler; but Sisyphos bound Thanatos (Death) fast, so that men\n        ceased to die, until Ares came to the rescue, released Thanatos, and gave Sisyphos into his power.\"\n\nEuripides, Alcestis 19 ff (trans.

The stain of death in the house must not be on me. I step therefore from these chambers dearest to my\n        love. And here is Thanatos (Death) himself, I see him coming, Thanatos who dedicates the dying, who will lead\n        her down to the house of Hades. He has come on time.

You at this house, Phoibos (Phoebus)? Why do you haunt this place. It is unfair to take for your\n        own and spoil the death-spirits' [eneroi, ‘of those below’] privileges. Was it not enough,\n        then, that you blocked the death of Admetos, and overthrew the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) by a shabby wrestler's\n        trick? And now your bow hand is armed to guard her too, Alkestis, Pelias' daughter, though she promised her life\n        for her husband's.\n        Apollon : Never fear. I have nothing but justice and fair words for you.\n        Thanatos : If you mean fairly, what are you doing with a bow?\n        Apollon : it is my custom to carry it with me all the time.\n        Thanatos : It is your custom to help this house more than you ought.\n        Apollon : But he is my friend, and his misfortunes trouble me.\n        Thanatos : You mean to take her body, too, away from me?\n        Apollon : I never took his body away from you by force.\n        Thanatos : How is it, then, that he is above ground, not below?\n        Apollon : He gave his wife instead, and you have come for her now.\n        Thanatos : I have. And I shall take her down where the dead are.\n        Apollon : Take her and go. I am not sure you will listen to me.\n        Thanatos : Tell me to kill whom I must kill. Such are my orders.\n        Apollon : No, only to put death off. They must die in the end.\n        Thanatos : I understand what you would say and what you want.\n        Apollon : Is there any way, then, for Alkestis to grow old?\n        Thanatos : There is not. I insist on enjoying my rights too.\n        Apollon : You would not take more than one life in any case.\n        Thanatos : My privilege means more to me when they die young.\n        Apollon : If she dies old, she will have a lavish burial.\n        Thanatos : What you propose, Phoibos, is to favour the rich.\n        Apollon : What is this?

Are you determined not to do this for me?\n        Thanatos : I will not do it. And you know my character.\n        Apollon : I know it: hateful to mankind, loathed by the gods.\n        Thanatos : You cannot always have your way where you should not.\n        Apollon : For all your brute ferocity you shall be stopped. The man to do it is on the way to Pheres' house now,\n        on an errand from Eurystheus, sent to steal a team of horses from the wintry lands of Thrake (Thrace). He shall\n        be entertained here in Admetos' house and he shall take the woman away from you by force, nor will you have our\n        gratitude, but you shall still be forced to do it, and to have my hate beside.\n        Thanatos : Much talk. Talking will win you nothing. All the same, the woman goes with me to Haides' house. I go\n        to take her now, and dedicate her with my sword, for all whose hair is cut in consecration by this blade's edge\n        are devoted to the gods below.\n        Thanatos enters the house.
