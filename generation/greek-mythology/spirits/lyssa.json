  "content": "LYSSA was the goddess or personified spirit (daimona) of mad rage, fury, crazed frenzy and, in\n        animals, rabies. The Athenians spelt her name Lytta.\n\nLyssa was a figure of Athenian tragedy. In Aeschylus she appears as an agent of Dionysos sent to drive the\n        Minyades mad, and in Euripides she is sent by Hera to inflict Herakles with madness. Greek vase-painting depicts\n        her standing beside Aktaion (Actaeon) as he is torn apart by his maddened hounds. In this scene she appears as a\n        women dressed in a short skirt and crowned with a dog's-head cap representing the madness of rabies.\n\nLyssa was closley related to the Maniai (Maniae), the goddesses of mania and\n        madness. Her Roman equivalents were Ira, Furor and Rabies. Sometimes she was multiplied into a host of Irae and\n        Furores.\n\n[1] NYX & the blood of OURANOS (Euripides Heracles 844)\n        [2] AETHER & GAIA (Hyginus Preface)\n\nAeschylus, Fragment 85 Xantriae (from Photius, Lexicon 326. 22) (trans. Weir Smyth)\n          (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        \"[Lyssa speaks in a play describing the madness inflicted by Dionysos upon either the impious daughters of\n        Minyas or the Mainades (Maenads) who dismembered Pentheus :]\n        From the feet up the crown of the head steals the spasm, the stab of Lyssa (Frenzy), aye, the scorpion's\n        sting.\"\n\nEuripides, Heracles 815 ff (trans. Vellacott) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        \"[The spectres of Lyssa (Madness) and Iris appear from above. The Chorus sees them.] \n        Chorus : Ha! see there, my old comrades! is the same wild panic fallen on us all; what phantom is this I see\n        hovering over the house? Fly, fly, bestir your tardy steps! begone! away! O savior prince, avert calamity from\n        me!\n        Iris : Courage, old men! she, whom you see, is Lyssa (Madness), daughter of Nyx (Night), and I am Iris, the\n        handmaid of the gods. We have not come to do your city any hurt, but our warfare is against the house of one man\n        only, against him whom they call [Herakles (Heracles)] the son of Zeus and Alkmena (Alcmena). For until he had\n        finished all his grievous labors, Destiny was preserving him, nor would father Zeus ever suffer me or Hera to\n        harm him. But now that he has accomplished the labors of Eurystheus, Hera wishes to brand him with the guilt of\n        shedding kindred blood by slaying his own children, and I wish it also. Come then, unwed maid, child of black\n        Nyx (Night), harden your heart relentlessly, send forth frenzy upon this man, confound his mind even to the\n        slaying of his children, drive him, goad him wildly on his mad career, shake out the sails of death, that when\n        he has conveyed over Akheron's (Acheron's) ferry that fair group of children by his own murderous hand, he may\n        learn to know how fiercely against him the wrath of Hera burns and may also experience mine; otherwise, if he\n        should escape punishment, the gods will become as nothing, while man's power will grow.\n        Lyssa : Of noble parents was I born, the daughter of Nyx (Night), sprung from the blood of Ouranos (Uranus,\n        Heaven); and these prerogatives I hold, not to use them in anger against friends, nor do I have any joy in\n        visiting the homes of men; and I wish to counsel Hera, before I see her err, and you too, if you will hearken to\n        my words. This man, against whose house you are sending me, has made himself a name alike in heaven and earth;\n        for, after taming pathless wilds and raging sea, he by his single might raised up again the honors of the gods\n        when sinking before man's impiety; . . ((lacuna)) wherefore I counsel you, do not wish him dire mishaps.\n        Iris : Spare us your advice on Hera's and my schemes.\n        Lyssa : I seek to turn your steps into the best path instead of into this one of evil.\n        Iris : It was not to practice self-control that the wife of Zeus sent you here.\n        Lyssa :\n        I call Helios the sun-god to witness that here I am acting against my will; but if indeed I must at once serve\n        you and Hera and follow you in full cry as hounds follow the huntsman, then I will go; neither ocean with its\n        fiercely groaning waves, nor the earthquake, nor the thunderbolt with blast of agony shall be like the headlong\n        rush I will make into the breast of Herakles; through his roof will I burst my way and swoop upon his house,\n        after first slaying his children; nor shall their murderer know that he is killing the children he begot, till\n        he is released from my madness. Behold him! see how even now he is wildly tossing his head at the outset, and\n        rolling his eyes fiercely from side to side without a word; nor can he control his panting breath, like a\n        fearful bull in act to charge; he bellows, calling on the Keres of Tartaros. Soon will I rouse you to yet wilder\n        dancing and pipe a note of terror in your ear. Soar away, O Iris, to Olympos on your honored course; while I\n        unseen will steal into the halls of Herakles.\n        Choru s: Alas alas! lament; the son of Zeus, flower of your city, is being cut down. Woe to you, Hellas! that\n        will cast from you your benefactor, and destroy him as he dances in the shrill frenzy of Lyssa (Madness). She is\n        mounted on her chariot, the queen of sorrow and sighing, and is goading on her steeds, as if for outrage, the\n        Gorgon child of Nyx, with a hundred hissing serpent-heads, Lyssa (Madness) of the flashing eyes. Soon has the\n        god changed his good fortune; soon will his children breathe their last, slain by a father's hand.\"\n\nImage N17.1 (below): \"Lyssa runs forward urging on the hounds in their maddened attack on Aktaion. She\n        wears a chitoniskos; over it, a coat with long sleeves; over that a pelt, girt; high laced boots. Above the\n        crown of her head, as if growing from it, is the head of a small hound, with alert look and ears pricked up. She\n        wears a sleeved coat, the Persian kandys. It is worn by Amazons as part of their Oriental costume.\"\n        Perseus Digital Library, Vase Catalogue (accessed October 2000)\n\nIra (Anger) was the Roman equivalent of Lyssa. She was often pluralized by the Latin into a host of Irae\n        (Angers).\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Preface (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"From Aether and Terra (Earth) [were born] : Dolor (Grief), Dolus (Deceit), Ira (Wrath) [i.e. Lyssa],\n        Luctus (Lamentation), Mendacium (Falsehood), Jusiurandum (Oath), Vltio (Vengeance), Intemperantia\n        (Intemperance), Altercatio (Altercation), Obliuio (Forgetfulness), Socordia (Sloth), Timor (Fear), Superbia\n        (Pride), Incestum (Incest), Pugna (Combat).\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 2. 200 ff (trans.

Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[Hephaistos (Hephaestus) crafts the cursed necklace of Harmonia which ultimately dooms the Thebans to a\n        fratricidal war :] Not Pasithea, eldest of the gracious sisters [Gratiae-Kharites (Graces)], nor Decor (Charm)\n        nor the Idalian youth did mould it [i.e. assisted in the crafting of the cursed necklace], but Luctus (Grief)\n        [Penthos], and all the Irae (Passions), and Dolor (Anguish) [Algos] and Discordia (Discord) [Eris], with all the\n        craft of her right hand.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 3. 424 ff : \n        \"Amid the night-wandering shades the god of battle [Mars-Ares] from on high made to resound with the\n        thunder of arms the Nemean fields and Arcadia from end to end, and the height of Taenarum and Therapnae . . .\n        filled excited hearts with passion for himself [war].

She was sometimes pluralized into a group of Furores.\n\nSeneca, Hercules Furens 90 ff (trans. Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[Hera rages against Herakles (Heracles) :] ‘Dost think that now thou hast escaped the Styx [i.e. the\n        Underword] and the cruel ghosts?
