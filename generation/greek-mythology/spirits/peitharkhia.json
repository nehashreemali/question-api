Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"When you invoke the gods, do not be ill-advised. For Peitharkhia (Obedience) is the mother of Eupraxia\n        (Success), wife of Soter (Salvation)--as the saying goes.\n        So she is, but the power of god [Zeus] is supreme, and often in bad times it raises the helpless man out of\n        harsh misery even when stormclouds are lowering over his eyes.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
