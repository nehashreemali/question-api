  "content": "THE KERES were female spirits (daimones) of violent or cruel death, including death in battle, by\n        accident, murder or ravaging disease. Another spirit, Thanatos, was the god of\n        non-violent death.\n\nThey were agents of the Moirai (Fates), birth-goddesses who measured out the length\n        of a man's life when he first entered the world, and Moros (Doom) the Daimon who drove\n        a man towards his inevitable destruction. The Keres were cravers of blood and feasted upon it after ripping a\n        soul free from the mortally wounded bodies and sending it on their way to Haides. Thousands of Keres haunted the\n        battlefield, fighting amongst themselves like vultures over the dying. The Keres had no absolute power over the\n        life of men, but in their hunger for blood would seek accomplish death beyond the bounds of fate. Zeus and the\n        other gods, however, could stop them in their course or speed them on. The Olympian gods are often described\n        standing by their favorites in battle, beating the clawing death spirits from them. Some of the Keres were\n        personifications of epidemic diseases, which haunted areas riven by plague. (See also the Nosoi.) The Keres were depicted as fanged, taloned women dressed in bloody garments.\n\nThe Keres may have been the evil spirits released from Pandora's jar to\n        plague mankind. Hesiod mentions them indirectly in his account of the episode. He describes these spirits as\n        kakoi (evils), nosoi (sicknesses and plagues) and lugra (banes).\n\n[1.1] NYX (no father) (Hesiod Theogony\n          225)\n        [1.2] EREBOS & NYX (Hyginus Preface, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.17)\n\nCER (Kêr), the personified necessity of death (Kêr or Kêres Thanatoio). The\n        passages in the Homeric poems in which the Kêr or Kêres a appear as real personifications, are not\n        very numerous (Il. ii. 302, iii. 454, xviii. 535), and in most cases the word may be taken as a common\n        noun. The plural form seems to allude to the various modes of dying which Homer ((Il. xii. 326)\n        pronounces to be muriai, and may be a natural, sudden, or violent death. (Od. xi. 171, &c., 398,\n        &c.) The Kêres are described as formidable, dark, and hateful, because they carry off men to the\n        joyless house of Hades. (Il. ii. 859, iii. 454; Od. iii. 410, xiv. 207.) The Kêres,\n        although no living being can escape them, have yet no absolute power over the life of men: they are under Zeus\n        and the gods, who can stop them in their course or hurry them on. (Il. xii. 402, xviii. 115, iv. 11;\n        Od. xi. 397.) Even mortals themselves may for a time prevent their attaining their object, or delay it\n        by flight and the like. (Il. iii. 32, xvi. 47.) During a battle the Kêres wander about with Eris\n        and Cydoimos in bloody garments, quarrelling about the wounded and the dead, and dragging them away by the feet.\n        (Il. xviii. 535, &c.) According to Hesiod, with whom the Kêres assume a more definite form,\n        they are the daughters of Nyx and sisters of the Moerae, and punish men for their crimes. (Theog. 211,\n        217; Paus. v. 19. § 1.) Their fearful appearance in battle is described by Hesiod. (Scut. Here.\n        249, &c.) They are mentioned by later writers together with the Erinnyes as the goddesses who avenge the\n        crimes of men. (Aesch. Sept. 1055; comp. Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1665, &c.) Epidemic diseases are\n        sometimes personified as Kêres. (Orph. Hymn. xiii. 12, lxvi. 4, Lith. vii. 6; Eustath.\n        ad Hom. p. 847.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 211 ff (trans.

But the woman took off the great lid of the jar\n        (pithos) with her hands and scattered all these and her thought caused sorrow and mischief to men. Only\n        Elpis (Hope) remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at\n        the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aigis-holding Zeus who gathers the\n        clouds. But the rest, countless plagues (lugra), wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils and the\n        sea is full. Of themselves diseases (nosoi) come upon men continually by day and by night, bringing\n        mischief to mortals silently; for wise Zeus took away speech from them.
