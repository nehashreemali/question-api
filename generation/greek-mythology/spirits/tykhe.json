She was usually honoured in a more\n        favourable light as Eutykhia (Eutychia), goddess of good fortune, luck, success and prosperity.\n\nTykhe was depicted with a variety of attributes--holding a rudder, she was conceived as the divinity guiding\n        and conducting the affairs of the world, and in this respect she was called one of the Moirai (Moirae, Fates); with a ball she represented the varying unsteadiness of\n        fortune, unsteady and capable of rolling in any direction; with Ploutos (Plutus) or the cornucopia, she was the\n        symbol of the plentiful gifts of fortune.\n\nNemesis (Fair Distribution) was cautiously regarded as the downside of Tykhe, one\n        who provided a check on extravagant favours conferred by fortune. The pair were often depicted as companions in\n        Greek vase painting. In the vase painting (right) Nemesis (Indignation) with her arm around Tykhe (Fortune)\n        points an accusing fingure at Helene, who Aphrodite has persuaded to elope with Paris.\n\n[1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Hesiod Theogony 360; Homeric Hymn 2.420)\n        [2] ZEUS (Orphic Hymn 72, Pindar Olympian\n          Ode)\n        [3] PROMETHEUS (Alcman Frag 3)\n\n[1] PLOUTOS (Aesop Fables 130, Pausanias\n          9.16.2)\n\nTYCHE (Tuchê). 1. The personification of chance or luck, the Fortuna of the Romans, is called by Pindar\n        (Ol. xii. init.) a daughter of Zeus the Liberator. She was represented with different attributes. With\n        a rudder, she was conceived as the divinity guiding and conducting the affairs of the world, and in this respect\n        she is called one of the Moerae (Paus. vii. 26. § 3; Pind. Fragm. 75, ed. Heyne); with a ball she\n        represents the varying unsteadiness of fortune; with Plutos or the horn of Amalthea, she was the symbol of the\n        plentiful gifts of fortune. (Artemid. ii. 37.) Tyche was worshipped at Pharae in Messenia (Paus. iv. 30. §\n        2); at Smyrna, where her statue, the work of Bupalus, held with one hand a globe on her head, and in the other\n        carried the horn of Amalthea (iv. 30. § 4); in the arx of Sicyon (ii. 7. § 5); at Aegeira in Achaia,\n        where she was represented with the horn of Amalthea and a winged Eros by her side (vii. 26. § 3; comp.\n        Plut. De Fort. Rom. 4; Arnob. adv. Gent. vi. 25); in Elis (Paus. vi. 25. § 4); at Thebes\n        (ix. 16. § 1); at Lebadeia, together with agathos daimôn (ix. 39. § 4); at Olympia (v. 15.\n        § 4), and Athens. (Aelian, V. H. ix. 39; comp. Fortuna.) 2. A nymph, one of the playmates of\n        Persephone. (Hom. Hymn. in Cer. 421.) 3. One of the daughters of Oceanus. (Hes.

Prometheus made the way of freedom rough at the beginning, impassable and steep, with\n        no water anywhere to drink, full of brambles, and beset with dangers on all sides at first. Eventually, however,\n        it became a smooth plain, lined with paths and filled with groves of fruit trees and waterways. Thus the\n        distressing experience ended in repose for those who breath the air of freedom. The way of slavery, however,\n        started out as a smooth plain at the beginning, full of flowers, pleasant to look at and quite luxurious, but in\n        the end it became impassable, steep and insurmountable on all sides.\"\n        [N.B.

His spirit soared as he abandoned the lowly plow and drove his oxen off to better\n        pastures. He immediately built an altar to the earth goddess Tellus (Earth) [Gaia], worshipping her for having\n        happily bestowed on him the wealth that had been buried inside her. While the farmer was rejoicing in his new\n        circumstances, the goddess Fortuna (Fortune) [Tyche] was indignant that he had not considered her equally worthy\n        of incense and offerings. She thus appeared to the man and gave him this warning about the future :\n        ‘Instead of making an offering of your new-found wealth in my temple, you are sharing it with all the\n        other gods.

I am afraid that if you fall into the well, I will be the one that\n        people blame, giving me a bad reputation.

The lines are : ‘We all in a lovely meadow, Leukippe,\n        Phaino, Electre and Ianthe, Melobosis and Tykhe and Okyrhoe with a face like a flower.’\n        He said nothing further about this goddess being the mightiest of gods in human affairs and displaying greatest\n        strength, as in the Iliad he represented Athena and Enyo as supreme in war, and Artemis feared in childbirth,\n        and Aphrodite heeding the affairs of marriage. But he makes no other mention of Tykhe. Bouplaos (Buplaus) a\n        skilful temple-architect and carver of images, who made the statue of Tykhe at Smyrna, was the first whom we\n        know to have represented her with the heavenly sphere upon her head and carrying in one hand the horn of\n        Amaltheia, as the Greeks call it, representing her functions to this extent.

Walsh) (Roman novel C2nd A.D.) :\n        \n        \"The lowest possible specimen of humanity, one who as the victim of Fortuna (Fortune) has lost status,\n        inheritance and security, a man so disreputable that nowhere in the world can he find an equal in\n        wretchedness.\"\n\nApuleias, The Golden Ass 7. 2 ff : \n        \"Learned men of old had good grounds for envisaging and describing Fortuna (Fortune) as blind and utterly\n        sightless [i.e. like Ploutos (Plutus) the god of wealth]. That goddess, I mused, ever bestows her riches on the\n        wicked and the unworthy, never favouring anyone by discerning choice, but on the contrary preferring to lodge\n        with precisely the people to whom she should have given wide berth, if she had eyes to see. Worst of all, she\n        foists on us reputations at odds with and contrary to the truth, so that the evil man boasts in the glory of\n        being honest, while by contrast he transparently innocent man is afflicted with a damaging reputation.\"\n\nApuleius, The Golden Ass 6. 19 ff : \n        \"I implore you by your personal Fortuna (Fortune) and your Genios (Genius, Guardian Spirit)to come to the\n        aid of this destitute old man.\"\n\nApuleius, The Golden Ass 9. 1 ff : \n        \"But truly, if Fortuna (Fortune) disapproves, nothing can turn out right for any mortal, and neither wise\n        planning nor shrewd remedies can overtun or reshape the pre-ordained arrangements of divine providence.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
