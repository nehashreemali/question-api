  "content": "HEDONE was the personified spirit (daimona) of pleasure and enjoyment. As the daughter of Eros (Love)\n        she was more specifically the goddess of sensual pleasure.\n\nPlato, Philebus 12b (trans. Fowler) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"Sokrates (Socrates) : Let us begin with the very goddess who Philebos says is spoken of as Aphrodite but\n        is most truly named Hedone (Pleasure) . . . And now I call Aphrodite by that name which is agreeable to her; but\n        pleasure I know has various aspects.\"\n\nCicero, De Natura Deorum 2. 23 (trans. Rackham) (Roman rhetorician C1st B.C.)\n          :\n        \"In other cases some exceptionally potent force is designated by a title of divinity, for example [the\n        daimones of virtuous behaviour] . . . In the same class the names Cupidos (Sexual Desire) [Eros], Voluptas\n        (Pleasure) [Hedone] and Venus Lubentina [Aphrodite] have been deified--things vicious and unnatural (although\n        Velleius thinks otherwise), yet the urge of these vices often overpowers natural instinct . . . the names that I\n        just now enumerated express the various powers of the gods that bear them.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 10. 90 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Within [the halls of Somnus-Hypnos, god of sleep], glowing Mulciber [Hephaistos] had carved a thousand\n        likenesses of the god [Somnus]: here wreathed Voluptas (Pleasure) [Hedone] clings to his side.\"\n\nStatius, Silvae 1. 3. 8 (trans. Mozley) (Roman poetry C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Voluptas (Pleasure) [Hedone] herself with her own delicate hand is said to have traced with thee [the\n        beautiful summer villa of a Roman noble].\"\n\nApuleius, The Golden Ass 6. 24 ff (trans. Walsh) (Roman novel C2nd A.D.) :\n        \n        \"Psyche (Soul) was wed to Cupidos (Love) [Eros], and at full term a daughter was born to them. We call her\n        Voluptas (Pleasure) [Hedone].\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
