  "content": "Harpokrates was the Greek interpretation of the Egyptian god Harpa-Khruti (Horus the Child) who was usually\n        depicted as a small boy with a finger held to his lips--an Egyptian gesture symbolising childhood which the\n        Greeks mistook for a hush for silence.\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 277 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The Egyptian goddess] Isis first invented sails, for while seeking her son Harpocrates [Horus], she\n        sailed on a ship.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 9. 688 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"She saw before her bed, or seemed to see as in a dream, great [Egyptian goddess] Isis with her train of\n        holy deities. Upon her brow there stood the crescent moon-horns, garlanded with glittering heads of golden\n        grain, and grace of royal dignity; and at her side . . . [Harpocrates] the god who holds his finger to his lips\n        for silence's sake.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 9. 692 ff :\n        \"Upon her [the Egyptian goddess Isis'] brow stood the crescent moon-horns, garlanded with glittering heads\n        of golden grain, and grace of royal dignity; and at her side the baying dog Anubis, dappled Apis, sacred\n        Bubastis and the god [Harpocrates] who holds his finger to his lips for silence sake.\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Augustine City of God 18.5, Varro On the Latin Language 5.57,\n          Catullus 102, Erasmus Adages 4.1.52.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
