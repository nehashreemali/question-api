  "content": "PISTIS was the personified spirit (daimona) of trust, honesty and good faith.\n        She was one of the good spirits to escape Pandora's box and promptly fled\n        back to heaven, abandoning mankind. Her Roman name was Fides and her opposite number were Apate (Deception) and the Pseudologoi (Lies).\n\nTheognis, Fragment 1. 1135 (trans. Gerber, Vol. Greek Elegiac) (Greek elegy C6th\n          B.C.) : \n        \"Elpis (Hope) is the only good god remaining among mankind; the others have left and gone to Olympos.\n        Pistis (Trust), a mighty god has gone, Sophrosyne (Restraint) has gone from men, and the Kharites (Charites,\n        Graces), my friend, have abandoned the earth. Men's judicial oaths are no longer to be trusted, nor does anyone\n        revere the immortal gods; the race of pious men has perished and men no longer recognize the rules of conduct or\n        acts of piety.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 5. 43 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[King Kepheus' (Cepheus') brother Phineus attempts to kill Perseus when the hero is awarded Andromeda for\n        his bride :] Cepheus left the hall, calling Fides (Faith) [Pistis], Jus (Justice) [Dike] and the Di Hospitii\n        (Gods of Hospitality) to bear him witness that what was done defied his word and will.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 11. 98 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[One Erinys addresses another as the brothers Polyneices and Eteocles engage in fratricidal combat :]\n        ‘'Tis no common fray or Martian battle we prepare, but brothers--though kindly Fides (Faith) [Pistis] and\n        Pietas (Piety) [Eusebia] resist, they will be o'ercome.’\"\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Plutarch Numa 16, Appianus Bella Civilia 1.16, Dio Cassius\n          45.17.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
