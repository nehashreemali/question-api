  "content": "PRAXIDIKE was the goddess or personified spirit (daimona) of exacting justice. She and her two\n        daughters--Arete (Virtue) and Homonoia (Concord)--together\n        formed a divine triad known as the Praxidikai.\n\nIn the Orphic Hymns Praxidike is equated with Persephone,\n        Soter with Zeus, and the Praxidikai with the goddess Erinyes. She was\n        probably also connected with the daimona Poine (Retribution).\n\nKTESIOS, HOMONOIA, ARETE (by Soter) (Suidas s.v. Praxidike)\n\nPRAXI′DICE (Praxidikê), i. e. the goddess who carries out the objects of justice, or watches that\n        justice is done to men. When Menelaus arrived in Laconia, on his return from Troy, he set up a statue of\n        Praxidice near Gytheium, not far from the spot where Paris, in carrying off Helen, had founded a sanctuary of\n        Aphrodite Migonitis (Paus. iii. 22. § 2). Near Haliartus, in Boeotia, we meet with the worship of\n        Praxidicae, in the plural (ix. 33. § 2), who were called daughters of Ogyges, and their names are\n        Alalcomenia, Thelxinoea, and Auilis (ix. 33. § 4; Suid. s. v.; Steph. Byz. s. v.\n        Tremilê). Their images consisted merely of heads, and their sacrifices only of the heads of animals. With\n        the Orphic poets Praxidice seems to be a surname of Persephone.

Taylor) (Greek hymns C3rd B.C. to 2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Hymn to Phersephone (Persephone) . . . Zeus' holy offspring, of a beauteous mien, Praxidike (avenging\n        Goddess), subterranean queen.

Mnaseas [Greek C2nd B.C.] in his\n        treatise On Europe says that Soter (Saviour) and his sister Praxidike (Exacter of Justice) had a son\n        Ktesios (Ctesius, Household) and daughters Homonoia (Concord) and Arete (Virtue), who were called Praxidikai\n        (Exacters of Penalties) after their mother.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
