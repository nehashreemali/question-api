  "content": "NIKE (Nicé) was the winged goddess of victory--victory both in war and in peaceful competition. When Zeus was gathering allies at the start of the Titan War, Styx brought her four children Nike (Victory), Zelos (Rivalry),\n        Kratos (Cratus Strength) and Bia (Force) into the god's service. Nike was appointed his charioteer and together\n        the four became sentinels of Zeus' throne.\n\nNike was depicted in ancient Greek vase painting with a variety of attributes including a wreath or sash to\n        crown a victor, an oinochoe and phiale (bowl and cup) for libations, a thymiaterion\n        (incense burner), an altar, and a lyre for the celebration of victory in song.\n        In scenes of the War of the Giants she appears as the charioteer of Zeus.\n        In mosaic art and coins Nike is often shown holding a palm branch as a symbol of victory.\n\nNike was closely identified with the goddess Athena and at times was\n        little more than an attribute of the goddess. Nike was sometimes multiplied into a host of Nikai (Nicae,\n        Victories).\n\n[1] PALLAS & STYX (Hesiod Theogony 383, Bacchylides Frag 11 & Ep 2, Apollodorus 1.9, Hyginus\n          Preface)\n        [2] ARES (Homeric Hymn 8 to Ares)\n\nNICE (Nikê). 1. The goddess of victory, or, as the Romans called her, Victoria, is described as a\n        daughter of Pallas and Styx, and as a sister of Zelus (zeal), Cratos (strength), and Bia (force). At the time\n        when Zeus entered upon the fight against the Titans, and called upon the gods for assistance, Nice and her two\n        sisters were the first that came forward, and Zeus was so pleased with their readiness, that he caused them ever\n        after to live with him in Olympus. (Hes. Theog. 382, &c.; Apollod. i. 2. § 2.) Nice had a\n        celebrated temple on the acropolis of Athens, which is still extant and in excellent preservation. (Paus. i. 22.\n        § 4. iii. 15. § 5.) She is often seen represented in ancient works of art, especially together with\n        other divinities, such as Zeus and Athena, and with conquering heroes whose horses she guides. In her appearance\n        she resembles Athena, but has wings, and carries a palm or a wreath, and is engaged in raising a trophy, or in\n        inscribing the victory of the conqueror on a shield. (Paus. v. 10. § 2. 11. §§ 1, 2, .vi. 18.\n        § 1.)\n\n2. Nice also occurs as a surname of Athena, under which the goddess had a sanctuary on the acropolis of Megara.\n        (Paus. i. 42. § 4; Eurip. Ion, 1529.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 383 ff (trans.

Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And Styx the daughter of Okeanos (Oceanus) was joined to Pallas and bare Zelos (Emulation) and trim-ankled\n        Nike (Victory) in the house. Also she brought forth Kratos (Cratus, Strength) and Bia (Force), wonderful\n        children. These have no house apart from Zeus, nor any dwelling nor path except that wherein God leads them, but\n        they dwell always with Zeus the loud-thunderer. For so did Styx the deathless daughter of Okeanos plan on that\n        day when the Olympian Lightener called all the deathless gods to great Olympos (Olympus), and said that\n        whosoever of the gods would fight with him against the Titanes (Titans), he would not cast him out from his\n        rights, but each should have the office which he had before amongst the deathless gods. And he declared that he\n        who was without office and rights as is just. So deathless Styx came first to Olympos with her children through\n        the wit of her dear father. And Zeus honoured her, and gave her very great gifts, for her he appointed to be the\n        great oath of the gods, and her children to live with him always. And as he promised, so he performed fully unto\n        them all.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 9 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Nike, Kratos (Cratus), Zelos (Zelus), and Bia were born to Pallas and Styx. Zeus instituted and oath to be\n        sworn by the waters of Styx that flowed from a rock in Haides' realm, an honor granted in return for the help\n        she and her children gave him against the Titanes (Titans).\"\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 11 (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric IV) (Greek lyric C5th\n          B.C.) :\n        \"Nike (Victory) . . . in gold-rich Olympos you stand beside Zeus and judge the outcome of prowess for\n        immortals and mortals.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 2. 205 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"[When the monster Typhoeus besieged Olympos (Olympus), all the gods fled except for Zeus and Nike :] Zeus\n        was alone, when Nike (Victory) came to comfort him, scoring the high paths of the air with her shoe. She had the\n        form of Leto; and while she armed her father, she made him a speech full of reproaches with guileful lips :\n        ‘Lord Zeus! Stand up as champion of your own children! Let me never see Athene mingled with Typhon\n        [Typhoeus], she who knows not the way of a man with a maid! Make not a mother of the unmothered! Fight, brandish\n        your lightning, the fiery spear of Olympos! Gather once more your clouds, lord of the rain! For the foundations\n        of the steadfast universe are already shaking under Typhon's hands: the four blended elements are melted! Deo\n        [Demeter] has renounced her harvests. Hebe has left her cup, Ares has thrown down his spear, Hermes has dropped\n        his staff, Apollon has cast away his harp, and taken a swan's form, and flown off on the wing, leaving his\n        winged arrows behind! Aphrodite, the goddess who brings wedlock to pass, has gone a wandering, and the universe\n        is without seed. The bonds indissoluble of harmony are dissolved, leaving behind his generative arrows, the\n        adorner of brides, he the all-mastering, the unmastered! And your fiery Hephaistos (Hephaestus) has left his\n        favourite Lemnos, and dragging unruly knees, look how slowly he keeps his unsteady course! See a great\n        miracle--I pity your Hera, though she hates me sure enough! What--is your begetter [Kronos (Cronus)] to come\n        back into the assembly of the stars? May that never be, I pray! Even if I am called a Titenis, I wish to see no\n        Titan lords of Olympos, but you and your children. Take your lordly thunderbolt and champion chaste\n        Artemis.’\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 2. 358 & 2. 475 ff : \n        \"[The monster Typhoeus engaged Zeus in battle :] Eris (Strife) was Typhon's escort in the mellay, Nike\n        (Victory) led Zeus into battle . . . impartial Enyo held equal balance between the two sides, between Zeus and\n        Typhon, while the thunderbolts with booming shots revel like dancers in the sky.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 2. 414 ff : \n        \"[In the battle between Zeus and Typhoeus :] Nike (Victory) lifted her shield and held it before Zeus :\n        Enyo countered with a shout, and Ares made a din.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 2. 699 ff : \n        \"Zeus Kronides (Cronides) . . . swiftly turned his golden chariot toward the round of the ethereal stars,\n        while Nike by his side drove her father's team with the heavenly whip.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 5. 88 ff : \n        \"[At the wedding of Kadmos (Cadmus) and Harmonia :] Nike (Victory) turned a tripling foot for the pleasure\n        of Zeus, and stood as bridesmaid crying triumph for Kadmos the god's champion [i.e. who had assisted him in his\n        conflict with the monster Typhoeus]; about the bridebed she wove the wedding song with her virgin voice, and\n        moved her gliding steps in the pretty circles of the dance, while she fluttered her wings, shamesfast beside the\n        wings of the Erotes (Loves).\"\n\nPindar, Isthmian Ode 2. 26 ff (trans.
