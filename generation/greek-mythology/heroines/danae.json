  "content": "DANAE was a princess of Argos in the Greek Peloponnese, the only child of King Akrisios (Acrisius). When her\n        father learned a prophecy that he was destined to be killed by a son of his daughter, he locked Danae away in a\n        subterranean, bronze chamber. Her prison, however, was infiltrated by the god Zeus who impregnated her in the guise of a golden shower. She conceived and\n        bore a son named Perseus. As soon as her father learned of this, he placed Danae and the infant in a chest and\n        set them adrift at sea. By the providence of the gods they made it safely to the island of Seriphos where the\n        fisherman Diktys (Dictys) offered them refuge in his home.\n\nLater when Perseus was fully grown, King Polydektes (Polydectes) of Seriphos sought Danae for his wife and,\n        wishing to rid himself of her son, commanded Perseus fetch the Gorgon's\n        head. The hero returned victorious only to learn that his mother had fled to the temple of Athena seeking refuge\n        from the king. In anger Perseus turned Polydektes and his allies to stone with Gorgon's head. He then travelled\n        with mother to Argos to claim his grandfather's throne.\n\nDanae was the eponymous \"queen\" of the Danaans. Danaan was synonymous with Argive but was sometimes\n        used to describe Greeks in general (e.g. in Homer's Iliad).\n\nIn the chronology of myth Danae was a descendant of Io--an Argive maiden loved by Zeus\n        who was forced to wander all the way to Egypt in the guise of a cow.\n        Io's great-great-grandson Danaus made the return trip to Argos with his fifty daughters, the Danaides, to claim\n        the throne. Danae was a great-grandaughter of the Danaid Hypermnestra and her cousin Lynkeus.\n        Of Danae's descendants, the most famous were Herakles, her great-great grandson, and King Eurystheus, her\n        great-grandson\n        It should be noted that the Argive genealogies were quite bloated and do not synchronise well with those of the\n        other mythic royal houses.\n\n[1.1] AKRISIOS (Homer Iliad 14.319, Aeschylus, Herodotus 6.53, Strabo 10.5.10,\n          Diodorus Siculus 4.9.1, Pausanias 2.23.7, Hyginus Fabulae 155, Ovid Metamorphoses 4.607, Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          30.264)\n        [1.2] AKRISIOS & EURYDIKE (Apollodorus 2.26)\n        [1.3] AKRISIOS & AGANIPPE (Hyginus Fabulae 63)\n\n[1.1] PERSEUS (by Zeus) (Homer Iliad 14.319, Pindar Pythian 12. 16, Aeschylus, Apollodorus 2.34, Strabo 10.5.10,\n          Herodotus 6.53 & 7.61, Diodorus Siculus 4.9.1, Hyginus Fabulae 63 & 155, Ovid Metamorphoses 4.607,\n          Nonnus Dionysiaca 2.286, et al)\n\nDANAE (Danaê). An oracle declared that Danaë, the daughter of Acrisius, would give birth to a son,\n        who would kill his grandfather. For this reason Acrisius kept Danaë shut up in a subterraneous apartment,\n        or in a brazen tower. But here she became mother of Perseus, notwithstanding the precautions of her father,\n        according to some accounts by her uncle Proetus, and according to others by Zeus, who visited her in the form of\n        a shower of gold. Acrisius ordered mother and child to be exposed on the wide sea in a chest; but the chest\n        floated towards the island of Seriphus, where both were rescued by Dictys, the brother of king Polydectes.\n        (Apollod. ii. 2. § 1, 4. § 1; Paus. ii. 16. § 2, 25. § 6, iii. 13. § 6; Hygin.\n        Fab. 63.) According to a later or Italian tradition, the chest was carried to the coast of Italy, where\n        king Pilumnus married Danaë, and founded Ardea (Virg. Aen. vii. 410; Serv. ad Aen. vii.\n        372); or Danaë is said to have come to Italy with two sons, Argus and Argeus, whom she had by Phineus, and\n        took up her abode on the spot where Rome was afterwards built (Serv. ad Aen. viii. 345). But, according\n        to the common story, Polydectes, king of Seriphos, made Danae his slave, and courted her favour, but in vain;\n        and in order to obtain the undisturbed possession of her, he sent off Perseus, who had in the meantime grown up\n        to manhood, to the Gorgons, to fetch the head of Medusa, which he said he would give to Hippodameia as a wedding\n        present (Tzetz. ad Lyc. 838).\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Iliad 14. 319 ff (trans.

The Net-draggers of the title were the Satyrs who fished the chest to shore.\n\nAeschylus, Fragment 274 The Net-Draggers (from Papyri) (trans. Lloyd-Jones)\n          :\n        \"[The fisherman Diktys (Dictys) sees the chest containing Danae in the sea and summon the Satyrs to help\n        him drag it ashore.

But\n        whatever you [Danae] do, don't rush recklessly away from us; understand at last and accept me as a most kindly\n        protector and supporter.

Won't he always be the same towards me, as time goes on?\n        Danae : Rivers of Argos and gods of my fathers, and you, Zeus, who bring my ordeal to such an end! Will you give\n        me to these beasts [i.e. Silenos and the lusty Satyrs], so that they may outrage me with their savage\n        onslaughts, or so that I endure in captivity the worst of tortures? Anyhow, I shall escape. Shall I then knot\n        myself a noose, applying a desperate remedy against this torture, so that no one may put me to sea again,\n        neither a lascivious beast nor a father? No, I am afraid to! Zeus, send me some help in this plight, I beg you!\n        for you were guilty of the greater fault, but it is I who have paid the full penalty. I call upon you to set\n        things right!

(He makes chuckling noises.) Don't\n        be frightened! Why are you whimpering? Over here to my sons, so that you can come to my protecting arms, dear\n        boy--I'm so kind--, and you can find pleasure in the martens and fawns and the young porcupines, and can make a\n        third in bed with your mother and with me your father. And daddy shall give, the little one his fun. And you\n        shall lead a healthy life, so that one day, when you've grown strong, you yourself--for your father's losing his\n        grip on his fawn-killing footwork--you yourself shall catch beasts without a spear, and shall give them to your\n        mother for dinner, after the fashion of her husband's family, amongst whom you'll be earning your keep.\n        Chorus [of Satyrs] : Come now, dear fellows, let us go and hurry on the marriage [with Danae], for the time is\n        ripe for it and without words speaks for it. Why, I see that already the bride is eager to enjoy our love to the\n        full. No wonder : she spent a long time wasting away all lonely in the ship beneath the foam. Well, now that she\n        has before her eyes our youthful vigour, she rejoices and exults; such is the bridegroom that by the bright\n        gleam of Aphrodite's torches.\"\n\nEuripides, Danae (lost play) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        The Greek tragedian Euripides wrote a play about Danae.\n\nSophocles, Danae (lost play) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        Sophocles followed in the footsteps of Aeschylus and Euripides with his play Danae.\n\nHerodotus, Histories 6. 53. 1 (trans.

I said as far back as Perseus, and I took the matter no further than that, because no\n        one is named as the mortal father of Perseus, as Amphitryon is named father of Herakles . . .

While Akrisios was making oracular inquiry into the problem of fathering sons, the god informed him\n        that a son born of his daughter would slay him. In fear Akrisios constructed a bronze chamber beneath the earth,\n        where he kept Danae under guard. Now some say that Proitos (Proetus) [twin brother of Akrisios] seduced her,\n        which led to the hard feelings between the brothers, but others say that Zeus had sex with her by changing\n        himself into gold that streamed in through the ceiling and down into her womb. When Akrisios later learned that\n        she had given birth to Perseus, not believing that Zeus seduced her, he cast his daughter out to sea with her\n        son on an ark. The ark drifted ashore at Seriphos, where Diktys (Dictys) recovered the child and brought him\n        up.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 36 :\n        \"The ruler of Seriphos was Polydektes (Polydectes), Diktys' (Dictys') brother.

He asked for horses from the others, but, because he got no horses from Perseus and because\n        Perseus had said that he would not deny Polydektes even the Gorgo's head, he assigned him the task of fetching\n        that very object.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 45 :\n        \"[Perseus returned home with the Gorgon's head.] When he reached Seriphos, Perseus found that his mother\n        [Danae] along with Diktys (Dictys) had sought refuge at the altars from the violence of Polydektes (Polydectes),\n        so he entered the royal palace where Polydektes was entertaining his friends, and with his own face turned aside\n        he displayed the Gorgo's head. When they looked at it, each one turned to stone, holding the pose he happened to\n        have been striking at that moment.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 47 :\n        \"Perseus with Danae and Andromeda hurried on to Argos in order to get a look at Akrisios (Acrisius).
