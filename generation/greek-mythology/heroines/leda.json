  "content": "LEDA was a queen of Sparta, the wife of King Tyndareus, who was seduced by Zeus in the guise of the swan. There\n        were several versions of the parentage of her children:-\n        Some say she laid an egg from which were hatched the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri) twins, Kastor and Polydeukes, both\n        sons of Zeus.\n        Others say she laid two eggs each containing a child of Zeus and a child of Tyndareus--Polydeukes and Kastor in\n        one, and Helene and Klytaimnestra (Clytemnestra) in the other.\n        Yet others relate that the second egg, containing just Helene, was delivered to Leda by the goddess Nemesis who had lain it after coupling with Zeus in the guise of a goose.\n\nIn the chronology of myth Leda was a contemporary of Herakles who placed her husband Tyndareus on the throne of\n        Sparta. Her Dioskouroi sons joined the expedition of the Argonauts and the Kalydonian Boar Hunt--albeit at a\n        very young age--while her daughters Helene and Klytaimnestra were the wives of Trojan War heroes.\n        In ancient Greek vase painting the generation gap between the sons and daughters of Leda was sometimes\n        illustrated--with the full-grown DIoskouroi standing witness as Helene hatches from the egg. In myth the twins\n        also led an army to Athens when Theseus kidnapped their ten year old sister.\n\nLeda was usually described as a daughter of Thestios, king of Pleuron. Her sister Althaia was the mother of\n        the Kalydonian hero Meleagros (Meleager). Thestios himself was a grandson of Aitolos (Aetolus), son of the famed\n        Endymion.\n\n[1.1] THESTIOS & EURYTHEMIS (Apollodorus 1.7.10)\n        [1.2] THESTIOS & LAOPHONTE (Pherecydes Frag, Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius\n          1.146)\n        [1.3] THESTIOS (Asius of Samos Frag, Theocritus Idylls 22.1, Pausanias 3.13.8, Clement\n          Recognitions 10.22, Hyginus Fabulae 78 & 155)\n        [2.1] SISYPHOS & PANTEIDYIA (Eumelus Corinthiaca Frag, Scholiast on Apollonius\n          Rhodius 1.146)\n        [3.1] GLAUKOS (Alcman Frag 4, Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius 1.146)\n\n[1.1] KASTOR & POLYDEUKES (by Zeus*) (Homer\n          Odyssey 11.298, Homeric Hymns 17 & 33, Terpander Frag 4, Apollodorus 1.8.2, Apollonius Rhodius 1.146,\n          Theocritus Idylls 22.1 & 214, Pausanias 3.16.1, Hyginus Fabulae 14 & 155, Ovid Fasti 1.705)\n        [1.3] KASTOR, POLYDEUKES, HELENE (by Zeus) (Homer\n          Iliad 3.237 & 426, Clement Recognitions 10.22, Hyginus Fabulae 224, Fulgentius 2.13) \n        [1.3] KASTOR (by Tyndareus), KASTOR (by Zeus) (Pindar Nemean Ode 10.79)\n        [1.4] POLYDEUKES, HELENE (by Zeus), KASTOR, KLYTAIMNESTRA (by Tyndareus)\n        (Apollodorus 3.10.7, Hyginus Fabulae 77, Valerius Flaccus 1.426)\n        [1.5] HELENE (Diodorus Siculus 4.63.2) \n        [1.6] HELENE (by Zeus) (Lucian Judgement of Paris,\n          Hyginus Fabulae 240 & Astronomica 1.8, Ovid Heroides 16.1 & 17.43)\n        [1.7] HELENE (by Tyndareus) (Dictys Cretensis 1.9)\n        [1.8] HELENE, KLYTAIMNESTRA (by Tyndareus) (Hyginus Fabulae 77)\n        [1.9] KLYTAIMNESTRA (Aeschylus Agamemnon 914, Seneca Agamemnon 125)\n        [1.10] TIMANDRA, KLYTAIMNESTRA, PHYLONOE (by Tyndareus) (Apollodorus 3.10.6)\n\n* Kastor and Polydeukes were called sons of Zeus but also, in the majority of these passages, Tyndaridai (i.e.\n        sons of Tyndareus).\n\nLEDA (Lêda), a daughter of Thestius, whence she is called Thestias (Apollod. iii. 10. § 5; Paus.\n        iii. 13. § 8; Eurip. Iph. Aul. 49); but others call her a daughter of Thespius, Thyestes, or\n        Glaucus, by Laophonte, Deidamia, Leucippe, Eurythemis, or Paneidyia. (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. i. 146,\n        201 ; Serv. ad Aen. viii. 130; Hygin, Fab. 14; Apollod. i. 7. § 10.) She was the wife of\n        Tyndareus, by whom she became the mother of Timandra, Clytaemnestra, and Philonoe. (Apollod. iii. 10. § 6;\n        Hom. Od. xxiv. 199.) One night she was embraced both by her husband and by Zeus, and by the former she\n        became the mother of Castor and Clytaemnestra, and by the latter of Polydeuces and Helena. (Hygin. Fab.\n        77.) According to Homer (Od. xi. 298, &c.) both Castor and Polydeuces were sons of Tyndareus and\n        Leda, while Helena is described as a daughter of Zeus. (Il. iii. 426; comp. Ov. Fast. i. 706;\n        Horat. Carm. i. 12, 25; Martial, i. 37.) Other traditions reverse the story, making Castor and\n        Polydeuces the sons of Zeus, and Helena the daughter of Tyndareus. (Eurip. Helen. 254, 1497, 1680;\n        Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. ii. 808 ; Herod. ii. 112.) According to the common legend Zeus visited Leda in\n        the disguise of a swan, and she produced two eggs, from the one of which issued Helena, and from the other\n        Castor and Polydeuces. (Schol. ad Eurip. Orest. 453; Ov. Her. xvii. 55 ; Paus. iii. 16. §\n        1; Horat. Ars Poet. 147; Athen. ii. p. 57, &c., ix. p. 373; Lucian, Dial. Deor. ii. 2,\n        xxiv. 2, xxvi.; comp. Virgil, Cir. 489; Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 88.) The visit of Zeus to Leda in\n        the form of a swan was frequently represented by ancient artists. It should be observed that Phoebe is also\n        mentioned as a daughter of Tyndareus and Leda (Eurip. Iph. Aul. 50), and that, according to Lactantius\n        (i. 21.), Leda was after her death raised to the rank of a divinity, under the name of Nemesis.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Iliad 3. 237 & 426 ff (trans.

This reason for the name has been handed down : When\n        Jupiter [Zeus], moved by desire, had begun to love Nemesis, and couldn't persuade her to lie with him, he\n        relieved his passion by the following plan. He bade Venus [Aphrodite], in the form of an eagle, pursue him; he,\n        changed to a swan, as if in flight from the eagle, took refuge with Nemesis and lighted in her lap. Nemesis did\n        not thrust him away, but holding him in her arms, fell into a deep sleep. While she slept, Jupiter embraced her,\n        and then flew away. Because he was seen by men flying high in the sky, they said he was put in the stars. To\n        make this really true, Jupiter put the swan flying and the eagle pursuing in the sky.\n        But Nemesis, as if wedded to the tribe of birds, when her months were ended, bore an egg.

Whitbread) (Roman mythographer C5th to 6th\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The Fable of the Swan and Leda. Although love of lust is shameful in all men, yet it is never worse\n        than when it is involved with honor. For lust in relation to honor, not knowing what it sets in motion, is\n        always opposed to dignity. He who seeks what he wishes to be something so divine must beware lest it become what\n        it had not been. For Jove [Zeus] disguised as a swan lay with Leda, who laid an egg from which were born the\n        three, Castor, Pollux, and Helen of Troy.\n        This legend carries the flavour of an allegorical interpretation, for Jove is explained as the symbol of power,\n        and Leda is for lide, which in Latin we call either insult or reviling. Thus all power getting involved\n        with insults changes the appearance of its magnanimity. He is said to have changed into a swan because the\n        naturalists, particularly Melistus of Euboea who has expounded the meanings of all the natural scientists,\n        declare that a bird of this species is so filled with reviling that when this bird clamors the rest of the birds\n        nearby become silent. For this reason it is also called an olor, as if derived from oligoria,\n        necessarily involved with insults. But let us see what is produced from this affair, no less than an egg, for,\n        just as in an egg, all the dirt which is to be washed away at birth is retained inside, so too in the work of\n        reviling everything is impurity. But from this egg are born the three, Castor, Pollux, and Helen, nothing less\n        than a seedbed of scandal and strife, as I once wrote : ‘And the adulteress shatters both worlds with\n        grief.’ For they explain Castor and Pollux as symbols of destruction, whence they explain the signs\n        (signa) of the Castors in the sea as creating peril; they say that both of them rise up and fall down\n        alternately, because pride always commands but always falls; whereby in Greek iperefania is the word\n        for pride. Iperefania is strictly the term for appearance above, because, in those two constellations\n        which they call by the name of the brothers, once appears above and the other sinks down, like Lucifer and\n        Antifer; for in Greek Pollux is apo tu apollin, that is, seeking to destroy, and Castor is for\n        cacon steron, that is, final evil.\" [N.B. The faux etymologies have been constructed according to\n        the author's tastes.]\n\nThe First Vatican Mythographer (Roman Christian mythographer) :\n        According to the First Vatican Mythographer (78), Castor, Pollux, and Helen all emerged from a single egg;\n        according to another account (204), Leda laid two eggs, one of which produced Castor and Pollux, and the other\n        Clytaemnestra and Helen.\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Euripides Helen 16, Euripides Iphigeneia at Aulis 49, Lucian,\n          Charidemus 7, Scholiast on Homer's Odyssey 11.298, First Vatican Mythographer 78 & 204, Second Vatican\n          Mythographer 132, Third Vatican Mythographer 3.6, Scholiast on Pindar's Nemean Ode 10.80 & 196, Tzetzes on\n          Lycophron 88, Eratosthenes Catasterismi 25, Scholiast on Callimachus' Hymn to Artemis 232, Servius on Virgil's\n          Aeneid 8.130, Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius 1.146 & 201.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
