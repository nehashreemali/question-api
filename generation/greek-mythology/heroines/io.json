  "content": "IO was an Argive princess and Naiad-nymph who was loved by the god Zeus.\n        When Hera suddenly interrupted their tryst, Zeus transformed the maiden into\n        a white heifer. However the goddess was not so easily fooled and requested the animal as a gift. She then\n        appointed the hundred-eyed giant Argos Panoptes as its guard.\n        Zeus sent Hermes to slay the warden but Hera soon retaliated by inflicing\n        the heifer-shaped Io with a gadfly. The stinging insect drove the cow-girl mad forcing her to wander miles\n        across the expanses of Europe and Asia to eventually reach Aigyptos (Egypt). Once there Zeus restored her form\n        with a touch of the hand and she gave birth to their son Epaphos.\n\nIo's descendants ruled Aigyptos and the East for many generations but later returned to Greece--Kadmos (Cadmus)\n        founding the royal house of Thebes and Danaos (Danaus) that of Argos.\n\nIo was sometimes identified with the Egyptian goddess Isis and her son Epaphos with the sacred bull Apis.\n\n[1.1] INAKHOS (Aeschylus Prometheus\n          Bound 589, Apollodorus 2.5, Callimachus Hymns 3.24, Nicaenetus Lyrcus Frag, Apollonius Rhodius Caunus Frag,\n          Parthenius Love Romances 1, Pausanias 1.25.1, Herodotus 1.1.2, Diodorus Siculus 5.60.4, Aelian On Animals\n          11.10, Virgil Aeneid 7.791, Ovid Metamorphoses 1.590, Ovid Heroides 14.105, Propertius Elegies 1.3 &\n          2.33A, Valerius Flaccus 4.345, Nonnus Dionysiaca 3.257 & 32.65, Suidas \"Io\")\n        [1.2] INAKHOS & ARGIA\n        (Hyginus Fabulae 145)\n        [2.1] IASOS (Apollodorus 2.5, Pausanias 2.16.1)\n        [3.1] PEIREN (Apollodorus 2.5)\n\n[1.1] EPAPHOS (by Zeus) (Aeschylus\n          Prometheus Bound 589, Aeschylus Suppliant Women 40 & 312, Apollodorus 2.5, Strabo 10.1.3, Aelian On\n          Animals 11.10, Hyginus Fabulae 145, Ovid Metamorphoses 1.750, Nonnus Dionysiaca 3.257 & 32.65)\n        [2.1] KEROESSA (by Zeus) (Stephanus of\n          Byzantium \"Byzantion\")\n        [3.1] HARPOKRATES (Hyginus Fabulae\n          277)\n\nIO (Iô). The traditions about this heroine are so manifold, that it is impossible to give any general\n        view of them without some classification we shall therefore give first the principal local traditions, next the\n        wanderings of Io, as they are described by later writers, and lastly mention the various attempts to explain the\n        stories about her.\n\n1. Local traditions. -- The place to which the legends of lo belong, and where she was closely\n        connected with the worship of Zeus and Hera, is Argos. The chronological tables of the priestesses of Hera at\n        Argos placed Io at the head of the list of priestesses, under the name of Callirhoë, or Callithyia.\n        (Preller, de Hellan. Lesb. p. 40.) She is commonly described as a daughter of Inachus, the founder of\n        the worship of Hera at Argos, and by others as a daughter of Iasus or Peiren. Zeus loved Io, but on account of\n        Hera's jealousy, he metamorphosed her into a white cow. Hera thereupon asked and obtained the cow from Zeus, and\n        placed her under the care of Argus Panoptes, who tied her to an olive tree in the grove of Hera at Mycenae. But\n        Hermes was commissioned by Zeus to deliver Io, and carry her off. Hermes being guided by a bird (hierax, pikon),\n        who was Zeus himself (Suid. s. v. Iô), slew Argus with a stone. Hera then sent a gad-fly. which\n        tormented Io, and persecuted her through the whole earth, until at length she found rest on the banks of the\n        Nile. (Apollod. ii. 1. § 2; Hygin. Fab. 145; comp. Virg. Georg. iii. 148, &c.) This\n        is the common story, which appears to be very ancient, since Homer constantly applies the epithet of\n        Argeiphontes (the slayer of Argus) to Hermes. But there are some slight modifications of the story in the\n        different writers. Some, for example, place the scene of the murder of Argus at Nemea (Lucian, Dial.\n          Deor. 3; Etymol. Mag. s. v. Aphesios). Ovid (Met. i. 722) relates that Hermes first\n        sent Argus to sleep by the sweetness of his music on the flute, and that he then cut off the head of Argus,\n        whose eyes Hera transferred to the tail of the peacock, her favourite bird. (Comp. Moschus, Idyll. ii.\n        59.) A peculiar mournfill festival was celebrated in honour of Io at Argos, and although we have no distinct\n        statement that she was worshipped in the historical ages of Greece, still it is not improbable that she was.\n        (Suid. l. c.; Palaephat. p. 43; Strab. xiv. p. 673.) There are indeed other places, besides Argos,\n        where we meet with the legends of Io, but they must be regarded as importations from Argos, either through\n        colonies sent by the latter city, or they were transplanted with the worship of Hera, the Argive goddess. We may\n        mention Euboea, which probably derived its name from the cow Io, and where the spot was shown on which Io was\n        believed to have been killed, as well as the cave in which she had given birth to Epaphus. (Strab vii. p. 320;\n        Steph. Byz. l. s. Argoura; Etymol. Mag. s. v. Euboia.) Another place is Byzantium, in the\n        foundation of which Argive colonists had taken part, and where the Bosporus derived its name, from the cow Io\n        having swam across it. From the Thracian Bosporus the story then spread to the Cimmerian Bosporus and\n        Panticapaeum. Tarsus and Antioch likewise had monuments to prove that Io had been in their neighbourhood, and\n        that they were colonies of Argos. Io was further said to have been at Joppa and in Aethiopia, together with\n        Perseus and Medusa (Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 835, &c.); but it was more especially the Greeks residing in\n        Egypt, who maintained that Io had been in Egypt, where she was said to have given birth to Epaphus, and to have\n        introduced the worship of Isis, while Epaphus became the founder of a family from which sprang Danaus, who\n        subsequently returned to Argos. This part of the story seems to have arisen from certain resemblances of\n        religious notions, which subsequently even gave rise to the identification of Io and Isis. Herodotus (i. l,\n        &c., ii. 41) tells us that Isis was represented like the Greek Io, in the form of a woman, with cows' horns.\n\n2. The wanderings of Io.--The idea of Io having wandered about after her metamorphosis appears to have\n        been as ancient as the mythus respecting her, but those wanderings were extended and poetically embellished in\n        proportion as geographical knowledge increased. The most important passage is in the Prometheus of\n        Aeschylus, 705, &c., although it is almost impossible to reconcile the poet's description with ancient\n        geography, so far as we know it. From Argos Io first went to Molossis and the neighbourhood of Dodona, and from\n        thence to the sea, which derived from her the name of the Ionian. After many wanderings through the unknown\n        regions of the north, she arrived in the place where Prometheus was fastened to a rock. As the Titan prescribes\n        to her the course she has yet to take, it is of importance to ascertain the spot at which he begins to describe\n        her course; but the expressions of Aeschylus are so vague, that it is a hopeless attempt to determine that spot.\n        According to the extant play, it is somewhere in European Scythia, perhaps to the north of the river Istrus; but\n        in the last play of the Trilogy, as well as in other accounts, the Caucasus is mentioned as the place where the\n        Titan endured his tortures, and it remains again uncertain in what part of the Caucasus we have to conceive the\n        suffering Titan. It seems to be the most probable supposition, that Aeschylus himself did not form a clear and\n        distinct notion of the wanderings he describes, for how lïttle he cared about geographical accuracy is\n        evident from the fact, that in the Supplices (548, &c.) he describes the wanderings of Io in a very\n        diffent manner from that adopted in the Prometheus. If, however, we place Prometheus somewhere in the\n        north of Europe, the course he prescribes may be conceived in the following manner. Io has first to wander\n        towards the east, through unknown countries, to the Scythian nomades (north of Olbia), whom, however, she is to\n        avoid, by travelling through their country along the sea-coast; she is then to have on her left the Chalybes,\n        against whom she must likewise be on her guard. These Chalybes are probably the Cimmerians, who formerly\n        inhabited the Crimea and the adjacent part of Scythia, and afterwards the country about Sinope. From thence she\n        is to arrive on the river Hybristes (the Don or Cuban), which she is to follow up to its sources, in the highest\n        parts of Mount Caucasus, in order there to cross it. Thence she is to proceed southward, where she is to meet\n        the Amazons (who at that time are conceived to live in Colchis, afterwards in Themiscyra, on the river\n        Thermodon), who are to conduct her to the place where the Salmydessian rock endangers all navigation. This\n        latter point is so clear an allusion to the coast north of the mouth of the Bosporus, that we must suppose that\n        Aeschylus meant to describe Io as crossing the Thracian Bosporus from Asia into Europe. From thence he leads her\n        to the Cimmerian Bos porus, which is to receive its name from her, and across the palus Maeotis. In this manner\n        she would in part touch upon the same countries which she had traversed before. After this she is to leave\n        Europe and go to Asia, according to which the poet must here make the Maeotis the boundary between Europe and\n        Asia, whereas elsewhere he makes the Phasis the boundary. The description of the wanderings of Io is taken up\n        again at verse 788. She is told that after crossing the water separating the two continents, she is to arrive in\n        the hot countries situated under the rising sun. At this point in the description there is a gap, and the last\n        passage probably described her further progress through Asia. Io then has again to cross a sea,after which she\n        is to come to the Gorgonaean plains of Cisthenes (which, according to the scholiast, is a town of Aethiopia or\n        Libya), and to meet the Graeae and Gorgones. The sea here mentioned is probably the so-called Indian Bosporus\n        (Steph. Byz. s. v. Bosporos; Eustath. ad Dionys. Perieg. 143), where the extremities of Asia\n        and Libya, India and Aethiopia, were conceived to be close to each other, and where some writers place the\n        Gorgones. (Schol. ad Pind. Pyth. x. 72.) The mention, in the verses following, of the griffins and\n        Arimaspae, who are generally assigned to northern regions, creates some difficulty, though the poet may have\n        mentioned them without meaning to place them in the south, but only for the purpose of connecting the\n        misfortunes of Io with the best-known monsters. From the Indian Bosporus, Io is to arrive in the country of the\n        black people, dwelling around the well of the sun, on the river Aethiops, that is, the upper part of the Nile or\n        the Niger. She is to follow the course of that river, until she comes to the cataracts of the Nile, which river\n        she is again to follow down to the Delta, where delivery awaits her. (Comp. Eurip. Iphig. Taur. 382,\n        &c.; Apollod. ii. 1. § 3; Hygin. Fab. 145.)\n\nThe mythus of Io is one of the most ancient, and at the same time one of the most difficult to explain. The\n        ancients believed Io to be the moon, and there is a distinct tradition that the Argives called the moon Io.\n        (Eustath. ad Dionys. Perieg. 92; Suid. and Hesych. s. v. Iô.) That Io is identical with\n        the moon cannot be doubted (comp. Eurip. Phoen, 1123; Macrob. Sat. i. 19), and the various\n        things related of her refer to the phases and phenomena of the moon, and are intimately connected with the\n        worship of Zeus and Hera at Argos. Her connection with Egypt seems to be an invention of later times, and was\n        probably suggested by the resemblance which was found to exist between the Argive Io and the Egyptian Isis.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, The Aegimius Frag 4 (from Herodian in Stephanus of Byzantium) (trans.\n          Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or 7th B.C.) :\n        \"Zeus changed Io in the fair island Abantis, which the gods, who are eternally, used to call Abantis\n        aforetime, but Zeus then called it Euboia (Island of Fine Cattle) after the cow.\"\n\nHesiod, The Aegimius Frag 5 (from Scholiast on Euripides, Phoenicians 1116)\n          :\n        \"And [Hera] set a watcher upon her [Io], great and strong Argos (Argus), who with four eyes looks every\n        way.

What people? By what name am I to call the one I see exposed to the tempest in bonds of\n        rock? What offence have you committed that as punishment you are doomed to destruction? Tell me to what region\n        of the earth I have wandered in my wretchedness? Oh, oh! Aah! Aah! A gad-fly (oistros), phantom\n        (eidôlon) of earth-born (gêgenês) Argos (Argus) is stinging me again! Keep\n        him away, O Earth! I am fearful when I behold that myriad-eyed herdsman. He travels onward with his crafty gaze\n        upon me; not even in death does the earth conceal him, but passing from the shades he hounds me, the forlorn\n        one, and drives me famished along the sands of the seashore. The waxen pipe drones forth in accompaniment a\n        clear-sounding slumberous strain. Alas, alas! Where is my far-roaming wandering course taking me? In what, O\n        [Zeus] son of Kronos (Cronus), in what have you found offence so that you have bound me to this yoke of\n        misery--aah! are you harassing a wretched maiden to frenzy by this terror of the pursuing gadfly? Consume me\n        with fire, or hide me in the earth, or give me to the monsters of the deep to devour; but do not grudge, O Lord,\n        the favor that I pray for. My far-roaming wanderings have taught me enough, and I cannot discern how to escape\n        my sufferings. Do you hear the voice of the horned virgin? \n        Prometheus : How can I fail to hear the maiden frenzied by the gadfly, the daughter of Inakhos (Inachus)? It is\n        she who fires the heart of Zeus with passion, and now, through Hera's hate, is disciplined by force with\n        interminable wandering. \n        Io : Why do you call my father's name? Tell me, the unfortunate maid, who you are, unhappy wretch, that you thus\n        correctly address the miserable maiden, and have named the heaven-sent plague that wastes and stings me with its\n        maddening goad. Ah me! In frenzied bounds I come, driven by torturing hunger, victim of Hera's vengeful purpose.\n        Who of the company of the unfortunate endures--aah! aah!--sufferings such as mine? Oh make it clear to me what\n        misery I am fated to suffer, what remedy is there, what cure, for my affliction. Reveal it, if you have the\n        knowledge. Oh speak, declare it to the unfortunate, wandering virgin.\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 631 - 695 :\n        \"Chorus [of Okeanides (Oceanids)] : Let us first inquire the story of her [Io's] affliction and let her\n        with her own lips relate the events that brought horrid calamity upon her. Then let her be instructed by you as\n        to the toils still to come.\n        Prometheus : It is for you, Io, to grant them this favor, especially since they [the Okeanides] are your\n        father's [Inakhos' (Inachus')] sisters. For it is worthwhile to indulge in weeping and in wailing over evil\n        fortunes when one is likely to win the tribute of a tear from the listener.\n        Io : I do not know how to refuse you. You shall learn in truthful speech all that you would like to know. Yet I\n        am ashamed to tell about the storm of calamity sent by Heaven, of the marring of my form, and of the source from\n        which it swooped upon me, wretched that I am.\n        Io : For visions of the night, always haunting my maiden chamber, sought to beguile me with seductive words,\n        saying : ‘O damsel greatly blessed of fortune, why linger in your maidenhood so long when it is within\n        your power to win a union of the highest? Zeus is inflamed by passion's dart for you and is eager to unite with\n        you in love. Do not, my child, spurn the bed of Zeus, but go forth to Lerna's meadow land of pastures deep and\n        to your father's flocks and where his cattle feed, so that the eye of Zeus may find respite from its\n        longing.’\n        Io : By such dreams was I, to my distress, beset night after night, until at last I gained courage to tell my\n        father [Inakhos] of the dreams that haunted me. And he sent many a messenger to Pytho and Dodona so that he\n        might discover what deed or word of his would find favor with the gods. But they returned with report of\n        oracles, riddling, obscure, and darkly worded. Then at last there came an unmistakable utterance to Inakhos,\n        charging and commanding him clearly that he must thrust me forth from home and native land to roam at large to\n        the remotest confines of the earth; and, if he would not, a fiery thunderbolt would come from Zeus that would\n        utterly destroy his whole race.\n        Io : Yielding obedience to such prophetic utterances of Loxias [Apollon], he drove me away and barred me from\n        his house, against his will and mine; but the constraint of Zeus forced him to act by necessity. Immediately my\n        form and mind were distorted, and with horns, as you see, upon my forehead, stung by a sharp-fanged gadfly I\n        rushed with frantic bounds to Kerkhnea's (Cerchnea's) sweet stream and Lerna's spring. But Argos (Argus), the\n        earth-born (gêgenês) herdsman, untempered in his rage, pursued me, peering with his many\n        eyes upon my steps. A sudden death robbed him of life unexpectedly; while I, still tormented by the gadfly, am\n        driven on from land to land before the heaven-sent plague.\n        Io : That is what happened; and if you can declare what toils still remain, reveal them. Do not, from pity, seek\n        to soothe me with untrue words; for I consider false words to be the foulest sickness.\n        Chorus : Oh, ah, go away, alas! Never, oh never, did I dream that words so strange would greet my ears; or that\n        sufferings so grievous to look upon, yes, and so grievous to endure, a tale of outrage, would strike my soul as\n        if with double-pronged goad. Alas, O Fate (moira), O Fate (moira), I shudder to behold the\n        plight that has befallen Io.\"\n\nAeschylus, Prometheus Bound 700 - 736 & 788 - 818 :\n        \"Prometheus : You [the Okeanides (Oceanids)] gained your former request easily from me; for you first\n        desired the story of her ordeal from her own lips. Hear now the sequel, the sufferings this maid is fated to\n        endure at Hera's hand. And may you, daughter of Inakhos (Inachus), lay to heart my words so that you may learn\n        the end of your wanderings.\n        Prometheus : First, from this spot, turn yourself toward the rising sun and make your way over untilled plains;\n        and you shall reach the Skythian (Scythian) nomads, who dwell in thatched houses, perched aloft on\n        strong-wheeled wagons and are equipped with far-darting bows. Do not approach them, but keeping your feet near\n        the rugged shore, where the sea breaks with a roar, pass on beyond their land. On the left hand dwell the\n        workers in iron, the Khalybes (Chalybes), and you must beware of them, since they are savage and are not to be\n        approached by strangers. Then you shall reach the river Hybristes (the Violent), which does not belie its name.\n        Do not cross this, for it is hard to cross, until you come to Kaukasos (Caucasus) itself, loftiest of mountains,\n        where from its very brows the river pours out its might in fury. You must pass over its crests, which neighbor\n        the stars, and enter upon a southward course, where you shall reach the host of the Amazones, who loathe all\n        men. They shall in time to come inhabit Themiskyra (Themiscyra) on the Thermodon, where, fronting the sea, is\n        Salmydessos' rugged jaw, evil host of mariners, step-mother of ships. The Amazones will gladly guide you on your\n        way. Next, just at the narrow portals of the harbor, you shall reach the Kimmerian (Cimmerian) isthmus. This you\n        must leave with stout heart and pass through the channel of Maiotis (Maeotis); and ever after among mankind\n        there shall be great mention of your passing, and it shall be called after you the Bosporos (Cow Ford).

Can it be that you have sufferings still left to recount to her? \n        Prometheus : Yes, a tempestuous sea of calamitous distress.\n        Io : What gain have I then in life? Why did I not hurl myself straightaway from this rugged rock, so that I was\n        dashed to earth and freed from all my sufferings?

When you have crossed the stream that bounds the two continents, toward the flaming east,\n        where the sun walks . . ((lacuna)) crossing the surging sea until you reach the Gorgonean plains of Kisthene\n        (Cisthene), where the Phorkides (Phorcides) [Graiai] dwell, ancient maids, three in number, shaped like swans,\n        possessing one eye amongst them and a single tooth; neither does the sun with his beams look down upon them, nor\n        ever the nightly moon. And near them are their three winged sisters, the snake-haired Gorgones, loathed of\n        mankind, whom no one of mortal kind shall look upon and still draw breath. Such is the peril that I bid you to\n        guard against. But now listen to another and a fearsome spectacle. Beware of the sharp-beaked hounds of Zeus\n        that do not bark, the Grypes (Griffins), and the one-eyed Arimaspoi (Arimaspians), mounted on horses, who dwell\n        about the flood of Plouton's (Pluton's) stream that flows with gold. Do not approach them.

He cannot tell whether\n        she lives or dwells among the shades, and finding her nowhere thinks she must be nowhere and fear feeds fear\n        when knowledge fails. Io returning from her father's stream had caught Juppiter's [Zeus'] eye. ‘You\n        charming girl,’ he said, ‘Well worthy of Jove's [Zeus'] love, happy is he, whoe'er he be, that wins\n        you for his bed. Go to the deep wood's shade’--he pointed to the shady wood--‘the hour is hot; the\n        sun shines in his zenith. If you fear alone to risk the wild beasts' lairs, a god will guard you and in the\n        deepest forest keep you safe--no common god! The sceptre of the sky is mine to hold in my almighty hand; I wield\n        at will the roaming thunderbolts--no, do not run!’\n        For now the girl had run; through Lerna's meadows and the forest lands of high Lyrceus she sped until the god\n        drew down a veil of darkness to conceal the world and stayed her flight and ravished her. Juno [Hera] meanwhile\n        observed the land of Argos and wondered that the floating clouds had wrought in the bright day the darkness of\n        night. These were no river mists! No clouds like these the humid earth exhaled! She looked around to find her\n        husband; well she knew his tricks, so often had caught him in his escapades; and searched the sky in vain.\n        ‘If I'm not wrong,’ she thought, ‘I'm being wronged’; and gliding down from heaven's\n        height she lighted on the earth and bade the clouds disperse. Juppiter [Zeus] had fore-sensed his spouse's visit\n        and transformed poor Inachis [Io] into a sleek white heifer (lovely still although a cow). Saturnia [Hera],\n        against her will, admired the creature and asked whose she was, and whence she came and to what herd belonged,\n        pretending not to know the truth. He lied--‘The earth had brought her forth’--so to deflect\n        questions about her birth. Then Saturnia [Hera] begged the heifer as a gift. What should he do? Too cruel to\n        give his darling! Not to give--suspicious; shame persuades but love dissuades. Love would have won; but then--if\n        he refused his wife (his sister too) so slight a gift, a cow, it well might seem no cow at all!\n        The goddess won her rival, but distrust lingered and still she feared her husband's tricks, till, for\n        safe-keeping, she had given the cow to Arestorides (Son of Arestor)--Argus of the hundred eyes, all watching and\n        on duty round his head, save two which took in turn their sleep and rest. Whichever way he stood he looked at\n        Io, Io before his eyes behind his back! By day he let her graze, but when the sun sank down beneath the earth he\n        stabled her and tied--for shame!--a halter round her neck. She browsed on leaves of trees and bitter weeds, and\n        for her bed, poor thing, lay on the ground, not always grassy, and drank the muddy streams; and when, to plead\n        with Argus, she would try to stretch her arms, she had no arms to stretch. Would she complain, a moo came from\n        her throat, a startling sound--her own voice frightened her. She reached her father's river and the banks where\n        often she had played and, in the water, mirrored she saw her muzzle and her horns, and fled in terror from the\n        self she saw. The Naides did not know--not even her father knew who she was, but she, disconsolate, followed her\n        sisters, followed her father, let them stroke her, offered herself to be admired. Old Inachus picked grass and\n        held it out; she licked her father's hand, cow-kissed his palms; her tears rolled down; if only words would\n        come, she'd speak her name, tell all, implore their aid. For words her hoof traced letters in the dust--I,\n        O--sad tidings of her body's change. ‘Alas, alack!’ her father cried, and clasped the moaning\n        heifer's horns and snow-white neck. ‘Alas, alack!’ he groaned: ‘Are you the child I sought\n        through all the world? Oh, lighter grief you were unfound than found. You give no answer; silent, but from your\n        heart so deep a sigh! A moo - all you can say - is your reply! I, knowing naught, made ready for your marriage,\n        hoped for a son-in-law and grandchildren. But now the herd must find your husband, find your child. For me death\n        cannot end my owes. Sad bane to be a god! The gates of death are shut; my grief endures for evermore.’ As\n        they thus grieved, Argus, star-eyed, drove off daughter from father, hurrying her away to distant pastures.\n        Then himself, afar, high on a mountain top sat sentinel to keep his scrutiny on every side. But now heaven's\n        master [Zeus] could no more endure Phoronis' [Io's] distress, and summoned his son [Hermes], whom the bright\n        shining Pleias [Maia] bore, and charged him to accomplish Argus' death. Promptly he fastened on his ankle-wings,\n        grasped in his fist the wand that charms to sleep, put on his magic cap, and thus arrayed Jove's [Zeus'] son\n        [Hermes] sprang from his father's citadel down to earth. There he removed his cap, laid by his wings; only his\n        wand he kept. A herdsman now, he drove a flock of goats through the green byways, gathered as he went, and\n        played his pipes of reed. The strange sweet skill charmed Juno's [Hera's] guardian. ‘My friend,’ he\n        called, ‘whoever you are, well might you sit with me here on this rock, and see how cool the shade extends\n        congenial for a shepherd's seat.’ So Atlantiades [Hermes] joined him, and with many a tale he stayed the\n        passing hours and on his reeds played soft refrains to lull the watching eyes. But Argus fought to keep at bay\n        the charms of slumber and, though many of his eyes were closed in sleep, still many kept their guard. He asked\n        too by what means this new design (for new it was), the pipe of reeds, was found. Then the god told this story\n        [of Pan and his pursuit of the nymphe Syrinx] . . . The tale remained untold; for Cyllenius [Hermes] saw all\n        Argus' eyelids closed and every eye vanquished in sleep. He stopped and with his wand, his magic wand, soothed\n        the tired resting eyes and sealed their slumber; quick then with his sword he struck off the nodding head and\n        from the rock threw it all bloody, spattering the cliff with gore.\n        Argus lay dead; so many eyes, so bright quenched, and all hundred shrouded in one night. Saturnia [Hera]\n        retrieved those eyes to set in place among the feathers of her bird [the peacock] and filled his tail with\n        starry jewels. At once her wrath flared up and soon her anger was fulfilled. Before her rival's eyes and in her\n        mind she set a frightful Erinys (Fury) and deep down plunged blinding goads of fear; and Io fled a cowering\n        fugitive through all the world. Her boundless travails found their end at last beside the Nile; there, falling\n        on her knees, her head thrown back, she raised towards the stars all she could raise, her face; her groans and\n        tears, her wild grief-laden lowings seemed to send a prayer to Jove [Zeus] to end her sufferings. And Jove\n        [Zeus] pleaded with Juno [Hera], throwing his arms around her neck, to end the punishment at last. ‘Lay\n        fear aside; never again,’ he swore, ‘shall Io give you cause to grieve,’ and charged the pools\n        of Stygia (Styx) to attest his oath. The goddess was appeased. Io regained her shape, became once more what once\n        she was. The hair falls from her hide, her horns are gone, her great wide eyes contract, her gaping mouth\n        shrinks small again, her arms and hands return, her cloven hoofs resume their fivefold form; the heifer\n        vanished, save her fair white grace. The Nympha, content to use two legs again, now walked erect, yet still\n        afraid to speak lest, cow-like, she might moo, and timorously assayed the syllables so long disused.\n        She is a goddess now [Egyptian Isis], famous divine, and linen-robed adorers throng her shrine. To her a son was\n        born, young Epaphus, sprung, it was thought, at last from Jove's [Zeus'] begetting, and in each town he shred\n        his mother's shrines.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 2. 522 :\n        \"Let him [Zeus] unbeast the beast, her shape restore, as Phoronides Argolica's [Io's] was, his other\n        paramour!\"\n\nOvid, Heroides 14. 85 ff (trans. Showerman) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Clear it is that Juno's [Hera's] wrath endures from the time the mortal maid [Io] became a heifer, and the\n        heifer became a goddess. Yet it is punishment enough that the tender maid was a lowing beast, and, but now so\n        fair, could not retain Jove's [Zeus'] love. On the banks of her sire's [Inachus'] stream the new-created heifer\n        stood, and in the parental waters beheld the horns that were not her own; with mouth that tried to complain, she\n        gave forth only lowings; she felt terror at her form, and terror at her voice. Why rage, unhappy one? Why gaze\n        at thyself in the water's shadow? Why count the feet thou hast for thy new-created frame? Thou art the mistress\n        of great Jove, that rival to be dreaded by his sister--and must quiet thy fierce hunger with the leafy branch\n        and grassy turf, drink at the spring, and gaze astonied on thine image there, and fear lest the arms thou\n        bearest may wound thyself! Thou, who but now wert rich, so rich as to seem worthy even of Jove, liest naked upon\n        the naked ground. Over seas, and lands, and kindred streams dost thou course; the sea opens a way for thee, and\n        the rivers, and the land. What is the cause of thy flight? Why doest thou wander over the long seas? Thou wilt\n        not be able to fly from thine own features. Child of Inachus, whither doest thou haste? Thou followest and\n        fliest--the same; thou art thyself guide to thy companion, thou art companion to thy guide!\n        The Nile, let flow to the sea through seven mouths, strips from the maddened heifer the features loved of\n        Jove.\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 7. 791 (trans. Day-Lewis) (Roman epic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"On his [the Italian king Turnus'] shield was blazoned in gold the image of Io, now changed to a heifer,\n        with horns uplifted, and fought-haired - a potent symbol; also her guardian, Argus, and Inachus her father,\n        pouring out his stream from a graven pitcher.\"\n\nVirgil, Georgics 3. 146 (trans. Fairclough) (Roman bucolic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"Round the groves of Silarus and the green holm oaks of Alburnus swarms a fly, whose Roman name is\n        asilus, but the Greeks have called it in their speech oestrus [the gadfly]. Fierce it is, and\n        sharp of note; before it whole herds scatter in terror through the woods: with their bellowings the air is\n        stunned and maddened, the groves, too, and the banks of parched Tanager. With this monster Juno [Hera] once\n        wreaked her awful wrath, when she devised a pest for the heifer maid [Io] of Inachus.\"\n\nPropertius, Elegies 1. 3 (trans. Goold) (Roman elegy C1st B.C.) :\n        \"I remained rooted with eyes intent upon her, like those of Argus upon the strange horns of Inachus' child\n        [Io].\"\n\nPropertius, Elegies 2. 28 :\n        \"Io in her early years lowed, her head transformed : now she who as a cow drank the Nile's waters is a\n        goddess.\"\n\nPropertius, Elegies 2. 33A :\n        \"Once again to my sorrow the dismal rites have returned: now for ten nights is Cynthia engaged in worship.\n        Down with the rites which the daughter of Inachus [Io-Isis] has sent from the warm Nile to the matrons of\n        Italy!\n        The goddess that has so often sundered ardent lovers, whoever she was, was always harsh. In your secret love of\n        Jove [Zeus], Io, you certainly discovered what it means to travel on many paths. When Juno [Hera] bade you, a\n        human girl, put on horns and drown your speech in the hoarse lowing of a cow, ah, how often did you chafe your\n        mouth with oak leaves and chew in your stall the arbute you had fed on! Is it because Jupiter [Zeus] has taken\n        that wild shape from your features that you have become such a haughty goddess? Are the swarthy daughters of\n        Aegyptus (Egypt) too few for your worship? What profit is it to you that girls should sleep alone? Take it from\n        me, either you will have horns again or else, cruel creature, we will banish you from our city: the Nile has\n        never found favour with the Tiber.\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 4. 345 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Bosporus . . . these very waves Io, not yet a goddess, to thy folk, O Nile, and crossed, whence the\n        straight had its name . . . [Orpheus then tells his fellow Argonauts the] story, of Inachus' daughter [Io] and\n        her wandering, and how the heifer ranged the sea in exile : eagerly do they hearken to his song.\n        Oft did our fathers see Jupiter [Zeus] come down to earth and the Pelasgians' Argive realm, aflame for the coy\n        Iasian maid. Juno [Hera], aware of his deceit and aglow with bridal fears, leapt down from heaven; the Lyrceian\n        land and its bowers, their guilty secret known, trembled before the queen. Then did the frightened paramour with\n        the god's will take on the features of an Inachian heifer; Juno [Hera] caresses her and soothes her breast,\n        stifling her own sighs beneath a smiling countenance. Then she accosts Jove thus : ‘Give me the untamed\n        heifer that feeds on Argos' fertile plains and is just showing the horns of the infant moon; give her as a gift\n        to thy dear bride. Myself now will I choose fit pastures and choicest fountains for my pet.&esquo; What ruse\n        could Jove [Zeus] find to say her nay? What trickery, once found, could he have maintained?\n        She, possessed of the gift, straightway sets Argus on guard; Argus as guardian pleases her, for everywhere on\n        his head are sleepless eyes, as though a Lydian bride should bedeck her web with flecks of purple. At Argus'\n        bidding must she go on paths unknown, over rocks, through monster-haunted wilds, tarrying oft, alas! And\n        struggling with prayers and words fast locked within her breast. Then departing gave she last kisses to her\n        father's banks; wailed [her sister Naiades] Amymone, wailed Messeis' waters, wailed Hyperia with arms\n        outstretched to call her back. But she, when her limbs trembled aweary of her wandering or when now chilly\n        evening sped down from heaven's height--ah! How often laid she her body on a stone, or when long thirst made her\n        faint, what pools did her lips drink, what pastures graze, how oft did her white shoulders quail before the\n        lash! Nay, too, as daring death she planned to leap from some lofty height, swift did Argus drive her down to\n        the vale beneath, and cruelly saved her at his queen's behest: when on a sudden a hollow flute pipes out a\n        measure of Arcady, and the winged Cyllenian [Hermes], hastening to obey his sire, draws nigh, and tuning his oft\n        reed to melody cries, ‘Wither away? Where roamest thou? Ho there! Give heed to my music!’ Following\n        Argus close he notes that all his eyes are already languishing and seeking after sweet slumber, and in the midst\n        of his song out he flashes his swift blade.\n        And now, her former shape gradually restored by Jove [Zeus], Io is walking the fields victorious over Juno\n        [Hera], when lo! she sees Tisiphone [one of the Erinyes] with brands of fire and coiling snakes and fiendish\n        yells; at the first sight she stops and passes once again into the shape of a hapless heifer, nor bethinks her\n        in what vale or on what height to stay her steps. Wandering she comes even to the waters of Inachus, how faring\n        and how changed from that first heifer that she was! Nor do her father or the frightened Nymphae try to draw\n        nigh her. Therefore once more she seeks the woods, once more the pathless wilds, fleeing from that dear head as\n        from hateful Styx; and thence is she hurried through Grecian towns and steep-banked rivers, until the deep\n        waters meet her path, and hesitating awhile she plunges in: the waves dispart and the clam ocean foreknowing the\n        future yields her a path; with high horns she gleams afar, and upholds her dewlaps on the summit of the wave.\n        But the maid of Erebus [Tisiphone] flies through the air to rich Memphis to be beforehand and repel the\n        new-comer from the Pharian land. But Nile withstands Tisiphone and driving her with all his eddying flood\n        plunges her to the depths of his sandy bed, calling for help to Dis [Haides] and all the powers of that cruel\n        realm; here and there are seen her brands and whips far scattered, and the serpents shaken from her dishevelled\n        hair. Nor meanwhile is Jove's [Zeus'] hand idle; the Father arising thunders from high heaven and makes his\n        anger known, and Juno [Hera] herself quails before his word.\n        All this from Pharos' height afar Io beholds, now added to the gods, with snake-girt hair and loud triumphant\n        sistrum [i.e. as the Egyptian goddess Isis]. Hence was it that men of old spread abroad the story of Bosphorus\n        [Greek for cow-ford], so called from the wandering goddess; may she herself now help our toils, and sending\n        winds to aid us urge our vessel [the Argo] through her own straight.\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 7. 111 :\n        \"Wandering Io fled the sandy verge and ventured and shrank again, yet by compulsion of the Erinnyes\n        (Furies) must she go upon the swelling sea.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 6. 275 (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Next in order [of the images at Nemea] is seen father Inachus reclining leftward on the mound of a reedy\n        bank and letting the streming urn flow free. Io, already prone [transformed into a cow] and sorrow of her sire,\n        sees behind her back Argus starred with eyes that no setting. But kindlier Jupiter [Zeus] had raised her erect\n        in the Pharian fields [Egypt], and already was Aurora (the Dawn) [Eos] giving her gracious welcome.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 3. 257 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"[Kadmos (Cadmus) addresses the Pleaid Elektra (Electra) :] ‘There is a city of Argos, famous for\n        horses, and Hera's habitation, the midnipple of the island of Tantalides. There a man begat a daughter, and a\n        beautiful daughter,-- Inakhos (Inachus), famed burgher of the land Inakhian. A templeman he was, and brooded\n        over the awful rites that spoke the voice of the divine cityholder, he chief and eldest in practice of her\n        mysteries: aye, he refused to wed his daughter to Zeus lord of the gods, leader of the stars, all for reverence\n        of Hera . . ((lacuna)) at the time when Io changed her face and became a cattleshaped heifer; when she was\n        driven to pasture along with the herd of kine; when Hera made sleepless Argos (Argus) herdsman to that\n        calf--spotted Argos, covered with unwavering eeys. He was to watch the horned bride of Zeus, Zeus whom eye may\n        not see. To pasture went the girl Io, trembling at the eyes of her busy-peeping drover: then pierced by\n        limb-gnawing gadfly, she scored the gulf of the Ionian sea with travelling hoof. She came as far as Aigyptos\n        (Egypt), my own river, which my people have called Neilos by name, because year by year that water consort\n        covers earth with new slime by its muddy flood [Nea Ilus meanung New Slime]--she came as far as\n        Aigyptos, where after her cow's form, after putting off the horned image ordained by heaven, she became a\n        goddess of fruitful crops; when the fruit starts up, the fruit of Aigypian Demeter my stronghorned Io [i.e. Io\n        as the Egyptian goddess Isis], scented vapour is carried around by the fragrant breezes. There she brought forth\n        Epaphos (Epaphus) the Toucher to Zeus, so called because the divine bed-fellow with love-mad hands touched the\n        inviolate breasts of the heifer child of Inakhos. Epaphos the god-beggoten was father of Libya.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 20. 35 :\n        \"You are not like a son of Zeus ... you did not kill that unhappy lover bold Orion, nor Hera's guardian\n        Argos (Argus), the cowkeeper, a son of the earth so fertile in evil, the spy on Zeus in his weddings with horned\n        cattle [Io]!\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 31. 36 :\n        \"Beside the Nile with his harvests they hold a festival for another [Isis the immortalised Io], instead of\n        sheafbearing mother Demeter; they tell of a spurious bountiful Deo, bullbred, horned, Inakhos's daughter Io\n        [i.e. the Egyptian goddess Isis].\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 32. 65 :\n        \"I [Zeus] loved Inakhos' (Inachus') daughter Io, the wandering heifer, from whom beside the Neilos (Nile)\n        came the line begun by Epaphos and primeval Keroessa (Ceroessa).\"\n\nSuidas s.v.
