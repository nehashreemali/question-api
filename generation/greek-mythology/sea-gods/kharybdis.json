  "content": "KHARYBDIS (Charybdis) was a sea-monster whose gigantic whirlpool swirled in the straits of Messina opposite the\n        cliffs of the monster Skylla (Scylla). She was probably the daimon of the\n        tides with her thrice daily sucking and expulsion of waters--mentioned by Homer--imagined as the cause of the\n        three high and low tides of the day.\n\nThe ancient Greek scholia on Homer's Odyssey give several different accounts of the origin of\n        Kharybdis. In one she was a daughter of Pontos (Sea) and Gaia (Earth) who laid siege to the land with her waves.\n        Zeus, in anger, captured and chained to the sea-bed. In another tale, she was a voracious women who stole the\n        cattle of Herakles. For this reason Zeus cast her into the sea with the blow of a thunderbolt.\n\nThe Greeks had a verb ekcha rubdizô which meant to swallow like Kharybdis. According to\n        Hesykhios (s.v. anepothe) this verb was invented by Pherekydes to describe those who were glutonous.\n\nKharybdis was perhaps identical to Keto Trienos \"the Sea-Monster Thrice\" who\n        was the mother of Skylla and grandmother of the Sicilian giant Polyphemos.\n\n[1.1] PONTOS & GAIA (see\n        Keto)\n        [1.2] POSEIDON & GAIA (Scholiast on Homer's Odyssey)\n\n[1.1] Perhaps SKYLLA (by Phorkys) (Apollodorus E7.20)\n\nSCYLLA (Skulla) and CHARYBDIS, the names of two rocks between Italy and Sicily, and only a short distance from\n        one another. In the midst of the one of these rocks which was nearest to Italy, there dwelt, according to Homer,\n        Scylla, a daughter of Crataeis, a fearful monster, barking like a dog, with twelve feet, six long necks and\n        mouths, each of which contained three rows of sharp teeth. The opposite rock, which was much lower, contained an\n        immense fig-tree, under which there dwelt Charybdis, who thrice every day swallowed down the waters of the sea,\n        and thrice threw them up again : both were formidable to the ships which had to pass between them (Hom.\n        Od. xii. 73, &c., 235, &c.). Charybdis is described as a daughter of Poseidon and Gaea, and as\n        a voracious woman,who stole oxen from Heracles, and was hurled by the thunderbolt of Zeus into the sea, where\n        she retained her voracious nature. (Serv. ad Aen. iii. 420.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Odyssey 12. 84 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"[Kirke (Circe) advises Odysseus on the dangers he will face on his voyage :] On the other side are a pair\n        of cliffs. One of them with its jagged peak reaches up to the spreading sky, wreathed in dark cloud that never\n        parts. There is no clear sky above this peak even in summer or harvest-time, nor could any mortal man climb up\n        it or get a foothold on it, not if he had twenty hands and feet; so smooth is the stone, as if it were burnished\n        all over. Half-way up the cliff is a murky cave [the home of Skylla (Scylla)], facing north-west to Erebos . . .\n        You will see the other cliff [opposite Skylla] lies lower, no more than an arrow's flight away. On this there\n        grows a great leafy fig-tree; under it, awesome Kharybdis (Charybdis) sucks the dark water down. Three times a\n        day she belches it forth, three times in hideous fashion she swallows it down again. Pray not to be caught there\n        when she swallows down; Poseidon himself could not save you from destruction then. No keep closer to Skylla's\n        cliff, and row past that as quickly as may be.”\n\nHomer, Odyssey 12. 231 ff : \n        \"So with much lamenting we [Odysseus and his men] rowed on and into the strait; this side lay Skylla\n        (Scylla); that side, in hideous fashion, fiendish Kharybdis (Charybdis) sucked the salt water in. When she\n        spewed it forth, she seethed and swirled through all her depths like a cauldron set on a great fire, and\n        overhead the spray fell down on the tops of the two rocks. But when she sucked the sea-water in, one might look\n        right down through the swirling eddy while the rock roared hideously around her and the sea-floor came to view,\n        dark and sandy. Ashy terror seized on the crew. We had looked her way with the fear of death upon us; and at\n        that moment Skylla snatched up form inside my ship the six of my crew who were the strongest of arm and\n        sturdiest.\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 12. 430 ff : \n        \"[After Odysseus' ship had left the island of Thrinakie (Thrinacia), Zeus sent a storm to wash it into the\n        maw of Kharybdis (Charybdis) :] The raging west wind abated, but the south instead came at once to plague me\n        [Odysseus], forcing me to retrace my track towards pitiless Kharybdis. All night I was carried backward thus;\n        then at sunrise I reached Skylla's rock and murderous Kharybdis. Just then she swallowed the salt-water; I threw\n        myself up to the lofty fig-tree and clung close against it like a bat, because there was no firm foothold there,\n        and no chance of climbing either; the roots were far below, and the big long branches hung out of reach\n        overhead, overshadowing Kharybdis. I held on grimly till she should vomit out mast and keel again. That time\n        seemed long to my anxious hopes, but about the hour when a judge in court will hear no more claims from brisk\n        young plaintiffs--when he stands up and goes home to dine--about that hour the timbers swam up again from\n        Kharybdis. I let myself drop, hands and feet together, and fell with a crash into mid-strait just by the\n        timbers, then clambered on to them and rowed with my hands. The father of gods and men [Zeus] would not allow\n        Skylla to spy me, else I should never have escaped the precipice of destruction.\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 23. 322 : \n        \"To grim Kharybdis (Charybdis) and to Skylla, who no man ever passed by unscathed.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E7. 21 - 23 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"After them [the Seirenes (Sirens)], Odysseus came to a divided passage. On one course lay the rocks called\n        Planktai (Planctae), and on the other were two great cliffs, in one of which was Skylla . . . On the other crag\n        was Kharybdis (Charybdis), who three times a day sucked in the water and spat it out again.\n        As it [his ship] fell apart, Odysseus hung on to the mast, and drifted back to Kharybdis. As Kharbydis sucked\n        down the mast, he grabbed an overhanging wild fig and waited, and when he saw the mast bob up again, he jumped\n        on it and was borne through the sea to the island of Ogygia.\"\n\nLycophron, Alexandra 668 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"What Kharybdis (Charybdis) shall not eat of his [Odysseus'] dead? What half-maiden Fury-hound\n        [Skylla]?\"\n\nLycophron, Alexandra 740 ff : \n        \"[Odysseus] clinging to the branch of a wild fig-tree so that the wave which draws spouting Kharybdis\n        (Charybdis) to the deep may not swallow him in the surge.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 125 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"He [Odysseus] had come to the island of Sicily to the sacred herds of Sol [Helios the Sun] . . . Borne on\n        to Charybdis, who three times a day sucked down the water and three times belched it up, by Tiresias' warning he\n        passed by.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 136 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The ship [Argo] then came successively to Kharybdis (Charybdis), Skylla (Scylla), and the wandering rocks\n        called Planktai (Planctae). But Hera sent for Thetis and the Nereides, who escorted the ship through these\n        hazards.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 786 & 825 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd\n          B.C.) :\n        \"[Hera commands the sea-goddess Thetis assist the Argonauts in their passage between Skylla (Scylla) and\n        Kharybdis (Charybdis) :] ‘I brought them [the Argonauts] safely through the Wandering Rocks, where fiery\n        blasts rage and roar and the rollers break in foam on jagged reefs. But it still remains for them to pass the\n        great cliff of Skylla and the gurgling whirlpool of Kharybdis . . . Do not let my friends [the Argonauts] be so\n        unwary as to fall into Kharybdis, or at one gulp she will swallow them all. Nor let them go too near the hateful\n        den of Ausonian Skylla, the wicked monster borne to Phorkys by nigh-wandering Hekate (Hecate), whom men call\n        Kratais (Crataeis)--or she may swoop down, take her pick and destroy them in her terrible jaws. What you must do\n        is so to guide the ship that they escape disaster, if only by a hair's breadth.’\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 921 ff : \n        \"The Argonauts sailed on in gloom. The Seirenes (Sirens) were behind them, but worse perils lay ahead, at a\n        place where two seas met and shipping came to grief. On one side the sheer cliff of Skylla (Scylla) hove in\n        sight; on the other Kharybdis (Charybdis) seethed and roared incessantly; while beyond, great seas were booming\n        on the Wandering Rocks.\"\n\nOvid, Heroides 12. 123 ff (trans. Showerman) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Medea laments :] ‘Would [that] . . . Scylla the ravening submerged us [the Argonauts] in the deep\n        to be devoured by her dogs--fit were it for Scylla to work woe to ingrate men! And she [Kharybdis (Charybdis)]\n        who spews forth so many times the floods, and sucks them so many times back in again--would she had brought us,\n        too, beneath the Trinacrian [Sicilian] wave!’\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 3. 418 ff (trans. Day-Lewis) (Roman epic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The sea rushed violently in between them, dividing Italy for Sicily, severing their coasts and washing\n        cities and fields on either side with a narrow strait. Scylla guards the right shore, insatiable Charybdis the\n        left. Three times a day the latter, down in the depths of a whirlpool gulps whole tons of wave into her maw,\n        then spews them up again, flailing the heavens with spray.\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 3. 555 ff : \n        \"[Aeneas recounts his voyage :] Then we made out Trinacrian Aetna (Sicilian Etna) on the horizon, and from\n        afar we heard a thunder of waves throbbing on rocks, and inshore noises broke fitfully on our ears; the race was\n        dancing with fury, the shoal-water boiling with sand. Anchises cried :--‘That must be the infamous\n        Charybdis! Those are the reefs, the terrible rocks that Helenus told of! Row for your lives, my comrades! Pull\n        together! Pull!’\n        Yarely they all obeyed my father's command. Palinurus turned away first to port, the bows of his vessel\n        creaking; then the whole convoy, with oars and sails, clawed off to port. We were tossed up high on an arching\n        surge, then down we went in the trough as the wave fell away, down to the very Pit. Thrice roared aloud the\n        reefs and the caverns of rock beneath us, thrice we beheld the sky through a spattering flounce of spindrift.\n        Time passed. The wind went down with the sun. Utterly spent, not knowing where we were, we crept to the shores\n        of the Cyclops.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 13. 729 ff (trans.
