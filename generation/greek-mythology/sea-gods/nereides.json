  "content": "THE NEREIDES (Nereids) were fifty sea-nymphe daughters of Nereus the old man of the sea. They were goddesses of\n        the sea's rich bounty and protectors of sailors and fishermen, coming to the aid of those in distress.\n        Individually they represented various facets of the sea from the salty brine, to the sea foam, sand, rocks,\n        waves and currents, as well as the various skills possessed by seamen.\n\nThe Nereides dwelt with their elderly father in a silvery grotto at the bottom of the Aegean Sea. The Nereid Thetis was their unofficial leader and Amphitrite\n        was Poseidon's queen.\n\nThe Nereides were depicted in ancient art as beautiful, young maidens, sometimes running with small dolphins or\n        fish in their hands, or else riding on the backs of dolphins, hippokampoi\n          (hippocamps) and other sea creatures.\n\nThe name Nereides means \"Daughters of Nereus\" but also \"the Wet Ones\" from\n        nêros the Greek word for \"wet\".\n\n[1.1] NEREUS & DORIS (Hesiod Theogony 260, Apollodorus 1.11, Aelian On Animals 14.28, Hyginus Pref, Ovid\n          Metamorphoses 2.10, 11.60)\n        [1.2] NEREUS (Homer lliad 18.37, Orphic Hymn 24, Quintus\n          Smyrnaeus 3.580, Pausanias 5.19)\n\nNEREIS (Nêreïs), or Nerine (Virg. Eclog. vii. 37), is a patronymic from Nereus, and applied\n        to his daughters (Nereides, Nêreïdes, and in Homer Nêrêïdes) by Doris, who were\n        regarded by the ancients as marine nymphs of the Mediterranean, in contra-distinction from the Naiades, or the\n        nymphs of fresh water, and the Oceanides, or the nymphs of the great ocean (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 622).\n        The number of the Nereides was fifty, but their names are not the same in all writers (Hom. Il. xviii.\n        39, &c.; Hes. Theog. 240, &c.; Pind. Isthm. vi. 8; Apollod. i. 2. § 7; Ov.\n        Met. ii. 10, &c.; Virg. Aen. v. 825; Hygin. Fab. praef.) They are described as\n        lovely divinities, and dwelling with their father at the bottom of the sea, and they were believed to be\n        propitious to all sailors, and especially to the Argonauts (Hom. Il. xviii. 36, &c. 140; Apollod.\n        i. 9. § 25; Apollon. Rhod. iv. 859, 930). They were worshipped in several parts of Greece, but more\n        especially in sea-port towns. such as Cardamyle (Paus. iii. 2. § 5), and on the Isthmus of Corinth (ii. 1.\n        § 7). The epithets given them by the poets refer partly to their beauty and partly to their place of abode.\n        They were frequently represented in antiquity, in paintings, on gems, in relievoes and statues, and commonly as\n        youthful, beautiful, and naked maidens, and often grouped together with Tritons and other marine monsters, in\n        which they resemble the Bacchic routs. Sometimes, also, they appear on gems as half maidens and half fish, like\n        mermaids, the belief in whom is quite analogous to the belief of the ancients in the existence of the Nereides.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nBelow is a list of named Nereids with notes on the source/s and possible explanations of their names.\n        N.B.

There she called to all her sister Nereides to help\n        her. They heard her call, and when they had assembled Thetis told them what Hera wished and sent them speeding\n        off to the Ausonian Sea. She herself, quick as the twinkle of an eye or the sun's rays when he springs from the\n        world's rim, sped through the water to the beach of Aia on the Tyrrhenian coast.\n        She found the young lords [the Argonauts] by their ship, passing the time with quoits and archery. Drawing near,\n        she touched the hand of the lord Peleus, who was her husband. The rest saw nothing. She appeared to him only and\n        to him she said : ‘You and your friends have sat here long enough. In the morning you must cast off the\n        hawsers of you gallant ship in obedience to Hera. She is your friend and has arranged for the Nereides to\n        foregather quickly and bring Argo safely through the Wandering Rocks, as they are called, that being the way you\n        must follow. But when you see me coming with the rest do not point me out to anyone. Keep my appearance to\n        yourself, or you will make me angrier that you did when you treated me in such a brutal fashion.’\n        And with that she vanished into the depths of the sea . . .\n        The Argonauts sailed on in gloom . . . great seas were booming on the Wandering Rocks . . . The Nereides\n        swimming in from all directions, met them here, and Lady Thetis coming up astern laid her hand on the blade of\n        the steering-oar to guide them through the Wandering Rocks. While she played the steersman's part, nymph after\n        nymph kept leaping from the sea and swimming round Argo, like a school of dolphins gambolling round a moving\n        ship in sunny weather, much to the entertainment of the crew as they see them darting up, now aft, now ahead,\n        and now abeam. But just as they were about to strike the Rocks, the Sea-nymphs, holding their skirts up over\n        their white knees, began to run along on top of the reefs and breaking waves following each other at intervals\n        on either side of the ship. Argo, caught in the current, was tossed to right and left. Angry seas rose up all\n        round her and crashed down on the Rocks which at one moment soared into the air like peaks, and at the next,\n        sticking fast at the bottom of the sea, were submerged by the raging waters. But the Nereides, passing the ship\n        from hand to hand and side to side, kept her scudding through the air on top of the waves. It was like that game\n        that young girls play beside a sandy beach, when they roll their skirts up to their waists on either side and\n        toss a ball round to one another, throwing it high in the air so that it never touches the ground. Thus, though\n        the water swirled and seethed around them, these Sea-Nymphai kept Argo from the Rocks . . . The Nereides worked\n        hard to heave Argo clear of the resounding rocks and it took then as long a time as daylight lingers in an\n        evening of spring.\"\n\nAeschylus, Nereides (lost play) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n          The subject of this lost play, in which the Nereides form the chorus, is summarised by Weir Smyth\n          (L.C.L.): \"Thetis, accompanied by her sister Nereïdes, comes from the depths of the sea to enquire\n          the cause of the lamentations of her son.

I conjecture that this scene refers to the death of Patroklos (Patroclus); the women in the chariots, I\n        take it, are Nereides, and Thetis is receiving the armour from Hephaistos (Hephaestus).

Circle gracefully about her\n        on either side, and divide your duties : some stretch taut from the mast the hempen rigging, some set the\n        topsails and spread the canvas to the zephyrs; let others place the benches, or let down into the water the\n        rudder that guides the curving bark; let there be some to make the heavy sounding-lead explore the depths, and\n        others to fasten the skiff that will follow astern, and to dive down and drag the hooked anchor from the depths,\n        and one to control the tides and make the sea flow eastward: let none of the sea-green sisterhood be without a\n        task.\"\n\nApuleius, The Golden Ass 4. 31 ff (trans.
