Of Anthedon in Boeotia, a fisherman, who had the good luck to eat a part of the divine herb\n        which Cronos had sown, and which made Glaucus immortal. (Athen. vii. c. 48; Claud. de Nupt. Mar. x.\n        158.) His parentage is different in the different traditions, which are enumerated by Athenaeus; some called his\n        father Copeus, others Polybus, the husband of Euboea, and others again Anthedon or Poseidon. He was further said\n        to have been a clever diver, to have built the ship Argo, and to have accompanied the Argonauts as their\n        steersman. In the sea-fight of Jason against the Tyrrhenians, Glaucus alone remained unhurt; he sank to the\n        bottom of the sea, where he was visible to none save to Jason. From this moment he became a marine deity, and\n        was of service to the Argonauts. The story of his sinking or leaping into the sea was variously modified in the\n        different traditions. (Bekker, Anecdot. p. 347; Schol. ad Plat. de Leg. x. p. 611.) There was\n        a belief in Greece that once in every year Glaucus visited all the coasts and islands, accompanied by marine\n        monsters, and gave his prophecies. (Paus. ix. 22. § 6.) Fishermen and sailors paid particular reverence to\n        him, and watched his oracles, which were believed to be very trustworthy. The story of his various loves seems\n        to have been a favourite subject with the ancient poets, and many of his love adventures are related by various\n        writers. The place of his abode varies in the different traditions, but Aristotle stated that he dwelt in Delos,\n        where, in conjunction with the nymphs, he gave oracles; for his prophetic power was said by some to be even\n        greater than that of Apollo, who is called his disciple in it. (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. i. 1310;\n        Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 753; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 271; Ov. Met. xiii. 904, &c.; Serv.\n        ad. Virg. Georg. i. 437, Aen. iii. 420, v. 832, vi. 36; Strab. p. 405.) A representation of\n        Glaucus is described by Philostratus (Imag i. 15): he was seen as a man whose hair and beard were\n        dripping with water, with bristly eye-brows, his breast covered with sea-weeds, and the lower part of the body\n        ending in the tail of a fish. (For further descriptions of his appearance, see Nonn. Dionys. xiii. 73,\n        xxxv. 73, xxxix. 99; Schol. ad Eurip. Orest. 318, 364 ; Stat. Silv. iii. 2, 36, Theb.\n        vii. 335, &c.; Vell. Pat. ii. 83.) This deified Glaucus was likewise chosen by the Greek poets as the\n        subject of dramatic compositions and we know from Velleius Paterculus that the mimus Plancus represented this\n        marine daemon on the stage.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer's Epigrams 11 (trans.

Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Now, they [the Argonauts sailing the through sea of Marmara] suddenly saw Glaukos (Glaucus), the sage\n        spokesman of the sea-god Nereus, emerge from the salt-depths. Raising his shaggy head and front, as far down as\n        the waist, he laid his sturdy hand on the side of the ship and cried to the contending Argonauts : ‘Why do\n        you propose, in defiance of almighty Zeus, to bring the dauntless Herakles to Kolkhis (Colchis)? Argos is his\n        place. There he is fated to serve his cruel master, Eurystheus; to accomplish twelve tasks; and if he succeeds\n        in the few that yet remain, to join the immortals in their home. So let there by no regrets for him. Nor for\n        Polyphemos, who is destined to found a famous city among the Mysians where Kios (Cios) flows into the sea, and\n        to meet his end in the broad land of the Khalybes (Chalybes). As for Hylas, who caused these two to go astray\n        and so be left behind, a Nymphe has lost her heart to him and made him her husband.’\n        With that, he plunged and was swallowed by the restless waves. The dark water swirled round him, broke into\n        foam, and dashed against the hollow ship as she moved on.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 9. 2. 13 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"In the Anthedonian territory is . . . the scene of the myth of Glaukos (Glaucus), the Anthedonian, who is\n        said to have changed into a Ketos (Sea-monster).\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 6. 10. 1 (trans.

That\n        Glaukos was a fisherman, who, on eating of the grass, turned into a deity of the sea and ever since has foretold\n        to men the future, is a belief generally accepted; in particular, sea-faring men tell every year many a tale\n        about the soothsaying of Glaukos. Pindar and Aiskhylos (Aeschylus) got a story about Glaukos from the people of\n        Anthedon.”\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 48. 6 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"[The Argonauts] had already reached the middle of the Pontic Sea when the ran into a storm which put them\n        in the greatest peril. But when Orpheus . . . offered up prayers to the deities of Samothrake [the Kabeiroi\n        (Cabeiri)], the winds ceased and there appeared near the ship Glaukos (Glaucus) the Sea-God, as he is called.\n        The god accompanied the ship in its voyage without ceasing for two days and nights and foretold to Herakles his\n        Labours and immortality, and to the Tyndaridai (Tyndaridae) that they should be called Dioskoroi (Dioscuri) and\n        receive at the hands of all mankind honour like that offered to the gods. And, in general, he addressed all the\n        Argonauts by name and told them that because of the prayers of Orpheus he had appeared in accordance with a\n        Providence of the gods and was showing forth to them what was destined to take place; and he counselled them,\n        accordingly, that so soon as they touched their lands they should pray their vows to the gods [the Kabeiroi]\n        through the intervention of whom they had twice already been saved. After this, the account continues, Glaukos\n        sank back beneath the deep.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 15 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] Glaukos Pontios (Glaucus of\n        the Sea).\n        After passing through the Bosporus and between the Symplegadai the Argo is already cutting its way through the\n        midst of the surging Pontos [the Black Sea] . . . \n        But now, methinks, even the eye of [the sharp-sighted Argonaut] Lynkeus (Lynceus) is stricken with consternation\n        at the approach of the apparition, which also causes the fifty sailors to stop their rowing; Herakles\n        (Heracles), it is true, remains unmoved at the sight, as one who has met with many like monsters, but the rest,\n        I believe, are calling it a wonder. For they see Glaukos Pontios (Of the Sea). The story is that he once dwelt\n        in ancient Anthedon and that he ate a certain grass on the seashore, and that when a wave came upon him unawares\n        he was borne away to the haunts of the fishes. Now he is probably uttering some great oracle, for he excels in\n        this art. As to his appearance, the curls of his beard are whet, but white as gushing fountains to the sight;\n        and heavy are the locks of his hair, which conduct on to his shoulders all the water they have taken up form the\n        sea; his eyebrows are shaggy and they are joined together as though they were one. Ah, the arm! how strong it\n        has become through exercise against the sea, continually battling against the waves and making them smooth for\n        his swimming. Ah, the breast! what a shaggy covering of seaweed and tangle is spread over it like a coat of\n        hair; while the belly beneath is undergoing a change and already begins to disappear. That Glaukos is a fish as\n        to the rest of his body is made evident by the tail, which is lifted and bent back toward the waist; and the\n        part of it that is shaped like a crescent is sea-purple in colour. Kingfishers circle about him both singing the\n        deeds of men (for they like Glaukos have been transformed from the men they once were) and at the same time\n        giving to [the Argonaut] Orpheus a specimen of their own song, by reason of which not even the sea is without\n        music.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 199 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Scylla, daughter of the River Crataeis, is said to have been a most beautiful maiden. Glaucus loved her,\n        but Circe, daughter of Sol [Helios], loved Glaucus. Since Scylla was accustomed to bathe in the sea, Circe,\n        daughter of Sol, out of jealousy poisoned the water with drugs, and when Scylla went down into it, dogs sprang\n        from her thighs, and she was made a monster. She avenged her injuries, for as Ulysses sailed by, she robbed him\n        of his companions.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 7. 232 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"From Anthedon she [the witch Medea] plucked the grass of life, not yet renowned for that sea-change the\n        Euboean merman [Glaukos (Glaucus)] found.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 13 .900 - 14. 74 : \n        \"Scylla turned back; she dared not trust herself far out at sea. Along the thirsty sands she sauntered\n        naked or, when she was tired, made for a little land-locked cove and in its sheltered waves enjoyed a cooling\n        bathe. Suddenly, breaking the surface of the sea Glaucus appeared, a new inhabitant of ocean's deeps since on\n        Anthedon Euboia's shore he suffered as sea change. He saw the girl, and stopped, his heart transfixed, then\n        spoke to her, spoke anything he thought might stay her flight. But Scylla fled (her terror gave her speed) and\n        reached a cliff-top rising from the shore, a vast cliff by the strait, that towered up to one great peak and\n        with its tree-clad height rose in a curve far out over the sea. The place was safe; she stopped; she could not\n        tell if he were god or monster, and she gazed in wonder at his colour and his hair that clothed his shoulders\n        and streamed down his back, and thighs that formed a twisting fish's tail.\n        He knew her thoughts, and leaning on a ledge of rock that rose near by, ‘Fair maid,’ he said,\n        ‘I am no monster nor a savage beast; I am a Sea-God (deus aquae). Over the open sea not Proteus,\n        no, nor Triton nor Palaemon Athamantiades (Son of Athamas) has greater power than I. Yet I was once a mortal,\n        dedicated even then to the open sea--there all my time and toil. I used to haul the nets that hauled the fish,\n        or sitting on a rock plied rod and line. Beside a lush green lea there lies a beach, one side the sea, the other\n        side the meadow, a meadow never marred by grazing cows, nor cropped by shaggy goats or placid sheep. No busy bee\n        had worked the flowers there, no gracious garland thence was ever given, nor hands had swung the scythe. I was\n        the first to sit upon that sward and dry my lines, and on it ranged my row of fish to count what I had caught,\n        as chance had guided them into my nets or trust to my barbed hook. It sounds a fairy-tale, but what have I to\n        gain by fairy-tails? My fish, my catch, in contact with the grass, began to move and turn from side to side and\n        glide across the ground as in the sea, and while I watched, waiting and wondering, they all made off, the lot of\n        them, back to the sea, their home, leaving their new-found master and the beach. I was amazed and pondered long\n        to find the reason. Could some god have done it or the juices of some plant? And yet what plant could have such\n        power? I picked some stalks and chewed what I had picked. The juice, the unknown juice, had hardly passed my\n        throat when suddenly I felt my heart-strings tremble and my soul consumed with yearning for that other world. I\n        could not wait. \"Farewell,\" I cried, \"farewell, land never more my home,\" and plunged\n        beneath the waves. The Sea-Gods (di naris) welcomed me to join their company (so well was I esteemed)\n        and called on Tethys and Oceanus to take away my mortal essences. They purified me with a ninefold chant that\n        purges my sins; then bade me plunge my body beneath a hundred rivers. Instantly torrents cascaded down from near\n        and far and poured whole seas of waters on my head. So far I can relate what I recall, so far remember; but the\n        rest is lost. When sense returned, I found myself in body another self, nor was my mind the same. For the first\n        time I saw this bronze-green beard, these flowing locks that sweep along the swell, these huge broad shoulders\n        and my sea-blue arms, my legs that curve to form a fishes tail. But what avail my looks, what to have pleased\n        the ocean's gods? What good to be a god myself, unless such things can touch your heart?’\n        But Scylla fled. Enraged at his repulse, he made in fury for the magic halls of Circe Titanis.\n        And now the Euboian merman through the main, the main that held his heart, had left behind Aetne heaped high\n        upon the giant's throat, the Cyclopes' fields that never knew the use of plough or harrow, nor owed any debt to\n        teams of oxen; Zancle too behind and Regium's facing bastions, and the strait, the ship-destroying strait, whose\n        twin shores hem the bounds of Aysonia and Sicula. Then on he swam with mighty strokes across the Tyrrhena Sea\n        and reached the herb-clad hills and magic halls of Circe, Sol's (the Sun's) [Helios'] child, crowded with\n        phantom beasts.\n        He met her then and, mutual greetings given, ‘Goddess’, he said, ‘Have pity on a god, I beg of\n        you. For you alone Titanis can ease this love of mine, if only I am worthy. No one knows better than I the power\n        of herbs, for I was changed by herbs. And I would have you learn my passion's cause: on the Italian coast,\n        facing Messenia's battlements, I saw Scylla. I blush to tell my wooing words, my promises, my prayers--she\n        scorned them all. But you, let now your magic lips, if spells have aught of sovereignty, pronounce a spell, or\n        if your herbs have surer power, let herbs of proven virtue do their work and win. I crave no cure, nor want my\n        wounds made well; pain need not pass; but make her share my hell!’\n        But Circe said : ‘You would better woo one who is willing, wants the same as you, is caught by love no\n        less. You should be wooed (How well you could have been!) and if you give some hope, believe me, wooed you well\n        shall be! Trust in those looks of yours; be bold and brave. See, I the daughter of shining Sol (the Sun), a\n        goddess who possess the magic powers of spell and herb, I, Circe, pray that I be yours, Spurn her who spurns\n        you; welcome one who wants you. By one act requite us both!’\n        But Glaucus answered : ‘Sooner shall green leaves grow in the sea or seaweed on the hills that I shall\n        change my love while Scylla lives.’ Rage filled the goddess' heart. She had no power nor wish to wound him\n        (for she loved him well), so turned her anger on the girl he chose. In fury at his scorn, she ground together\n        her ill-famed herbs, her herbs of ghastly juice, and, as she ground them, sang her demon spells . . . \n        There was a little bay, bent like a bow, a place of peace, where Scylla loved to laze, her refuge from the rage\n        of sea and sky, when in mid heaven the sun with strongest power shone from his zenith and the shade lay least.\n        Against her coming Circe had defiled this quiet bay with her deforming drugs, and after them had sprinkled\n        essences of noxious roots; then with her witch's lips had muttered thrice nine times a baffling maze of magic\n        incantations. Scylla came and waded in waist-deep, when round her lions she saw foul monstrous barking beasts.\n        At first, not dreaming they were part of her, she fled and thrust in fear the bullying brutes away. But what she\n        feared and fled, she fetched along, and looking for her thighs, her legs, her feet, found gaping jaws instead\n        like vile Cerberus. Poised on a pack of beasts! No legs! Below her midriff dogs, ringed in a raging row! Glaucus\n        her lover, wept and fled the embrace of Circe who had used too cruelly the power of her magic. Scylla stayed\n        there where she was and, when the first chance came to vent her rage and hate on Circe, robbed Ulixes [Odysseus]\n        of his comrades. Later, too, she would have sunk the galleons of the Teucrae [Trojans], had she not been\n        transformed before they came into a reef whose rocks rise up today, and sailors shun her still and steer\n        away.\"\n\nOvid, Heroides 18. 159 ff (trans.
