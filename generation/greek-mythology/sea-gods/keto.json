  "content": "KETO (Ceto) was the goddess of the dangers of the sea and, more specifically, of sea-monsters, whales and large\n        sharks (all called ketea in Greek). She consorted with her brother Phorkys (Phorcys) to produced a\n        brood of fearsome monsters including--the she-dragon Ekhidna (viper), sailor-devouring Skylla (crab), the\n        hundred-headed serpent Ladon, the one-eyed Graiai (grey ones), and the petrifying Gorgones (terrible ones).\n\nAs the mother of Skylla Keto was also named (Crataeis, of the Rocks), Lamia (the Shark) and Trienos (the\n        Thrice). The last title appears to equate her with the thrice-swallowing whirlpool-monster Kharybdis (Charybdis).\n        Krataiis was also identified or confused with the goddess Hekate\n          (Hecate), a divinity whose power extended over the sea. There was also a river named Krataiis in the\n        territory of the Brutti, near the Straits of Messina in Italy.\n\n[1.1] PONTOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 238, Apollodorus 1.10)\n\n[1.1] THE GORGONES, THE GRAIA, EKHIDNA, DRAKON HESPERIOS\n        (by Phorkys) (Hesiod Theogony 270)\n        [1.2] THE GORGONES, THE GRAIA (by Phorkys) (Apollodorus 1.10)\n        [1.3] THE GRAIA (by Phorkys) (Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.4] THE GORGONES (by Gorgo) (Hyginus Preface)\n\n[1.1] SKYLLA (by Phorkys) (Apollodorus E7.20, Apollonius Rhodius 4.828)\n        [1.2] SKYLLA (Homer Odyssey 12.125, Hyginus Fabulae\n          199)\n\nCRATAEIS (Krataiïs), according to several traditions, the mother of Scylla.
