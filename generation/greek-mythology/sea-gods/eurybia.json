She apparently presided over external forces\n        which influence the main such as the rise of the constellations, seasonal weather, and the power of the winds.\n\nEurybia was the wife of the Titan Krios (Crius) and the grandmother of a variety of divinities with power over\n        the sea. These included the Anemoi (Winds), the Astra (Stars), Hekate (Lady of Witchraft), Selene (the Moon),\n        Nike (Victory), Bia (Force), Kratos (Power), Zelos (Rivalry). Some of these also represent human mastery of the\n        seas such as the winds for sailing, stars for navigation, and force, power and victory representing naval\n        supremacy.\n\nPONTOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 239, Apollodorus 1.10)\n\nASTRAIOS, PERSES, PALLAS (by Krios) (Hesiod Theogony 375, Apollodorus 1.8)\n\nEURY′BIA (Eurubia), a daughter of Pontus and Ge, who became by Crius the mother of Astraeus, Pallas, and\n        Perses.
