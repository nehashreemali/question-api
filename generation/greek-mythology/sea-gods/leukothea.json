  "content": "LEUKOTHEA (Leucothea) was a sea goddess who came to the aid of sailors in distress.\n\nShe was once a mortal princess named Ino, a daughter of King Kadmos (Cadmus) of Thebes. She and her husband\n        Athamas incurred the wrath of Hera when they fostered the infant god Dionysos. As punishment the goddess drove Athamas into a murderous rage\n        and he slew his eldest child. Ino then grapped the other, and in her flight leapt off a cliff into the sea. The\n        pair were welcomed into the company of the sea-gods and renamed Leukothea (the White Goddess) and Palaimon (Palaemon).\n\nLeukothea later came to the aid of Odysseus when his raft had been destroyed by Poseidon, and wrapped him in\n        the safety of her buoyant shawl.\n\nThe Romans identified her with the goddess Mater Matuta.\n\n[1.1] KADMOS (Homer Odyssey 5.333, Orphic Hymn 74)\n        [1.2] KADMOS & HARMONIA (Pindar Olympian\n          Ode 2, Pindar Pythian Ode 11, Apollodorus 3.25, Pausanias 9.5.2, Hyginus Fabulae 1, Nonnus Dionysiaca\n          5.556)\n\n[1.1] LEARKHOS & MELIKERTES (by Athamas) (Apollodorus\n          1.80 & 3.28, Hyginus Fabulae 1 & 239, Nonnus Dionysiaca 5.556)\n        [1.2] MELIKERTES (Pausanias 1.44.7, Philostratus\n          Elder 2.16, Virgil Georgics 1.432, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.15)\n\nINO (Inô), a daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia, and the wife of Athamas, who married her in addition to his\n        proper wife Nephele, but according to some, not till after the death of Nephele. After her death and apotheosis,\n        Ino was called Leucothea. The common story about her is related under Athamas [not included here]; but there are\n        great variations in the traditions respecting her, which probably arose from the fact of the story having been\n        made great use of by the Greek poets, especially the dramatists, among whose lost tragedies we find the titles\n        of Athamas, Ino, and Phrixus. It here remains for us to mention the principal traditions about the latter period\n        of her life and her apotheosis. After the supposed death of Ino, and after his flight from Boeotia, Athamas\n        married Themisto; but when he was informed that Ino was still living as a Bacchant in the valleys of Mount\n        Parnassus, he secretly sent for her. Themisto, on hearing this, resolved to kill the children of Ino. With this\n        object in view, she ordered one of her slaves at night to cover her own children with white, and those of Ino\n        with black garments, that she might know the devoted children, and distinguish them from her own. But the slave\n        who received this command was Ino herself in disguise, who changed the garments in such a manner as to lead\n        Themisto to kill her own children. When Themisto discovered the mistake, she hung herself. (Hygin. Fab.\n        1 - 5.) Other traditions state that Athamas, when Hera visited him and Ino with madness for having brought up\n        Dionysus, killed Learchus, one of his sons by Ino, and when he was on the point of killing also the other,\n        Melicertes, Ino fled with him across the white plain in Megaris, and threw herself with the boy (or, according\n        to Eurip. Med. 1289, with her two sons) into the sea. Melicertes is stated in some traditions to have\n        previously died in a cauldron filled with boiling water. (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1543; Plut.\n        Sympos. v. 3; Ov. Met. iv. 505, 520, &c.; Tzetz, ad Lycoph. 229.) According to\n        Plutarch (Quaest. Rom. 13), Ino killed her own son, as she had become mad from jealousy of an Aetolian\n        slave, of the name of Antiphera, and Plutarch recognized an allusion to that story in a ceremony observed at\n        Rome in the temple of Matuta, who was identified with Leucothea; for no female slave was allowed to enter the\n        temple of Matuta at her festival, with the exception of one, who received a box on the ears from the matrons\n        that were present. Hyginus (Fab. 2; comp. Paus. ii. 44. § 11) states, that Athamas surrendered Ino\n        and her son Melicertes to Phrixus to be killed, because she herself had attempted to kill Phrixus. But when\n        Phrixus was on the point of committing the crime, Dionysus enveloped him in darkness and thus saved Ino.\n        Athamas, who was thrown by Zeus into a state of madness, killed Learchus ; and Ino, who leaped into the sea, was\n        raised to the rank of a divinity, by the desire of Dionysus. Others relate that Leucothea placed Dionysus with\n        herself among the gods. (Plut. de Frat. Am. in fin.) After her leap into the sea, Leucothea was carried\n        by a dolphin to the coast of Corinth, which was governed by Sisyphus, a brother of Athamas, who instituted the\n        Isthmian games and an annual sacairfice in honour of the the. (Tzetz,. ad Lycoph. 107; comp. 229;\n        Schol. ad Pind. Hypoth. Isthm. p. 514, ed. Boeckh.) According to a Megarian tradition, the body of Ino\n        was washed on the coast of Megara, where she was found and buried by two virgins; and it is further said that\n        there she received the name of Leucothea.

Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[A description of an ancient Greek painting :] There was a figure on the Skythian (Scythian) shores, not\n        yet up for display but fashioned not inelegantly for a contest of beauty in painting. It represented Athamas\n        goaded on by madness. He was shown as naked, his hair reddened with blood and its locks flying in the wind, his\n        eye distraught, himself filled with consternation; and he was armed not by madness alone for a rash deed, nor\n        did he rage merely with the soul-consuming fears which the Erinyes (Furies) send; nay, he even held a sword out\n        in front of him, like a man making a sally . . .\n        Ino too was present, in a state of terror, trembling slightly, her face place and corpse-like though fright; and\n        she embraced her infant child [Melikertes (Melicertes)] and held her breast to its lips, letting the nurturing\n        drops fall on the nursling. The figure of Ino was hastening towards the promontory of Skeiron (Sciron) and the\n        sea at the foot of the mountain, and the breakers that were wont to surge in billows were spreading out in a\n        hollow to receive her, and something of Zephyros (the West Wind) pervaded the waters as he with shrill blast\n        lulled the sea to rest. For in truth the wax beguiled the sense into thinking that it could fashion a breeze and\n        cause the sea winds to rise and could apply the art of imitation to nature's works. And sea-dolphins were\n        sporting near by, coursing through the waves in the painting, and the wax seemed to be tossed by the wind and to\n        become wet in imitation of the sea, assuming the sea's own qualities.\n        Moreover, at the outer edges of the painting an Amphitrite rose from the depths, a creature of savage and\n        terrifying aspect who flashed from her eyes a bright radiance. And round about her stood Nereides; these were\n        dainty and bright to look upon, distilling love's desire from their eyes; and circling in their dance over\n        crests of the sea's waves, they amazed the spectator. About them flowed Okeanos (Oceanus), the motion of his\n        stream being well-nigh like the billows of the sea.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 1 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Athamas, son of Aeolus, had by his wife Nebula [Nephele], a son Phrixus and a daughter Helle . . . and by\n        Ino, daughter of Cadmus, two sons, Learchus and Melicertes.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 2 :\n        \"Ino, daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia, wishing to kill Phrixus and Helle, Nebula's [Nephele's] children,\n        formed a plan with the women of the entire tribe, and conspired to parch the seed grain to make it unfertile, so\n        that, when the sterility and scarcity of grain resulted, the whole state should perish, some by starvation,\n        others by sickness. With regard to this situation Athamas sent a servant to Delphi, but Ino instructed him to\n        bring back a false reply that the pestilence would end if he sacrificed Phrixus to Jove [Zeus]. When Athamas\n        refused to do this, Phrixus voluntarily and readily promised that he alone would free the state from its\n        distress. Accordingly he ws led to the altar, wearing fillets of sacrifice, but he servant, out of pity for the\n        youth, revealed Ino's plans to Athamas. The king, thus informed of the crime, gave over his wife Ino and her son\n        Melicertes to be put to death, but Father Liber [Dionysos] cast mist around her, and saved Ino his nurse. Later,\n        Athamas, driven mad by Jove [Zeus], slew his son Learchus. But Ino, with Melicertes her son, threw herself into\n        the sea. Liber [Dionysos] would have her called Leucothea, and Melicertes, her son the god Palaemon, but we call\n        her Mater Matuta, and him Portunus. In his honor every fifth year gymnastic contests are held, which are called\n        Isthmian.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 4 :\n        \"Ino with the younger [son of her and Athamas], Melicertes, cast herself into the sea and was made a\n        goddess.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 224 :\n        \"Mortals who were made immortal . . . Ino, daughter of Cadmus, into Leucothea, whom we call Mater Matuta;\n        Melicertes, son of Athamas, into the god Palaemon.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 239 :\n        \"Ino, daughter of Cadmus, killed her son Melicertes by Athamas, son of Aeolus, when she was fleeing from\n        Athamas.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 243 :\n        \"Ino, daughter of Cadmus, hurled herself into the sea with her son, Melicertes.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 4. 416 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Bacchus' [Dionysos'] divinity was hymned through all Thebae (Thebes), and Ino everywhere told of the god's\n        (her nephew's) mighty power. Of all the sisters she alone was spared sorrow except her sorrow for her sake. Her\n        pride was high, pride in her children, pride in Athamas, her husband and the god, her foster-child; and this in\n        Juno's [Hera's] sight was more than she could bear . . .\n        [And the goddess summoned up an Erinys to drive the couple mad.]\n        Then raving through the palace Aeolides [Athamas] shouted ‘Here in this copse, friends, spread the nets!\n        I've seen a lioness with her two cubs!’ And, in this madness hunting her, tracked down his wife and\n        snatched Learchus from her arms, his little laughing son with hands outstretched, and like a slinger whirled him\n        round and round and wildly smashed the baby's head against a granite block; and then his mother, crazed by grief\n        or by the sprinkled poison's power, screamed madly and with streaming hair rushed out with tiny Melicerta in her\n        arms, and shouted ‘Bacchus! Bacchus!’; at the name of Bacchus Juno [Hera] smiled, ‘Well done,\n        the brat you fostered, to bestow a boon like that!’\n        A cliff hung by the shore; the bottom part was hollowed by the waves and formed a roof to shield the waters from\n        the storms; the top stood hard and high and faced the open sea. Here Ino climbed (her madness gave her strength)\n        and with her burden launched herself, unchecked by any thought of fear, out and away, and where she fell the\n        waves were white with spray. But Venus [Aphrodite], pitying her grandchild's woes, so undeserved, addressed with\n        winning words her uncle : ‘Lord of waters, whose power yields to heaven alone, great Neptunus [Poseidon],\n        what I ask is much indeed, put pity those I love, now tossing in the vast Ionian Sea, and make them gods to join\n        your company. I too should find some favour with the sea, for in its holy depths in days gone by from sea-foam I\n        was formed, and still from foam I take my name in Greece.’\n        Her prayer was granted. Neptunus [Poseidon] removed their mortal essences, clothed them in majesty and awe, and\n        changed features and names alike, the boy to be Palaemon, and his mother Leucothoe.\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 8. 16 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Ino horror-stricken leaps into the sea, nor in her panic remembers the tiny babe [Melikertes (Melicertes)]\n        she carries; her spouse strikes the far end of the Isthmus--baffled.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 1. 12 ff (trans.

A kind of stepmother, I planned to mow down the bastard plants of Athamas, and Hera, the real\n        stepmother of newly nurtured Dionysos, is angry with me.’\n        She spoke, and with trembling feet sprang into the sea, swiftly diving with her son. Seabluehair [Poseidon]\n        opened his arms to receive Leukothea (Leucothea), and took her into the divine company in the deep waters. She\n        helps ever since the seamen who lose their way, and now she is Ino of the sea, a Nereis who has charge of\n        untumultuous calm.\n        So Kronides (Cronides) [Zeus] pointed her out to the mother of Lyaios [i.e. Semele the mother of Dionysos],\n        because she owed it to Bromios that she was a goddess. Semele in her joy addressed her seafaring sister in\n        mockery : ‘Ino, you have the sea, Semele has gained the round heavens! Give me place! I had an immortal\n        husband in Kronides [Zeus] the plower of my field, who brought forth the fruit of my birth instead of me; but\n        you were wedded to a mortal mate Athamas, the murderer of your family. Your son's lot is the sea, but my son\n        will come to the house of Zeus to dwell in the sky. I will not compare heavenly Dionysos with Melikertes down in\n        the water!’\n        That is how Semele the heavenly bride yelled out in mockery of her sister Ino's life who dwelt in the sea.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 40. 209 ff : \n        \"[The Indian Queen prays for a fate like Ino's :] ‘May I dwell with the Neiades (Naiads), since\n        Seabluehair [Poseidon] received Leukothea (Leucothea) also living and she is called one of the Nereides; and may\n        I appear another watery Ino, no longer white, but blackfooted.’\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 5. 333 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"[As Odysseus was sailing from the island of Kalypso (Calypso) on a raft, Poseidon sent a storm to capsize\n        the vessel :] One being saw him [Odysseus], Kadmos' (Cadmus') daughter, slender-ankled Ino who is also Leukothea\n        (Leucothea); once she had been a mortal and spoken with human voice, but now she lives in the salt seas and the\n        gods give her the honour that is her due. She it was who now felt compassion for Odysseus the persecuted\n        wanderer; she flew up from the waves as a seagull might, sat on the strong-bound raft and spoke : ‘Unhappy\n        man, why has Poseidon who shakes the earth become so monstrously angry with you? Why does he sow all these seeds\n        of misery for you? But despite his malice he shall not destroy you utterly. Only you must do as I say--I think\n        you do not lack understanding; strip off these clothes, leave the raft for the winds to toss, strike out with\n        your arms and try to reach land again on the Phaiakian (Phaeacian) shore; it is there you are fated to find\n        deliverance. And see--this is a scarf of mine, of celestial make; wind it round you above your waist, and you\n        need fear neither death nor harm. But once you have grasped the shore with your hands, undo the scarf and throw\n        it into the wine-dark sea again, far from the shore; and avert your eyes.’\n        With that, the goddess gave him the scarf; then sank once more, as a seagull might, into the billowy sea, and\n        the dark wave covered her. Odysseus, acquainted with many perils, was distrustful now and spoke in bitterness to\n        his ardent soul : ‘Wretch that I am! Can this divinity in her turn be laying a snare for me in her command\n        to forsake the raft? I will not at once do what she said, because the land that she called my refuge seemed\n        still far away when I caught a glimpse of it. No, I will do this instead--it seems the most prudent thing. As\n        long as the planks hold together, I will stay on board and endure whatever evil comes; but when once the waves\n        have shattered the craft piece from piece, I will take to swimming : there is nothing better I can think\n        of.’\n        While he was inwardly planning thus, Poseidon the earth-shaker heaved a huge wave against him--overwhelming,\n        hideous, with arching crest; and it struck him full . . . so the wave now scattered the raft's long planks. But\n        Odysseus bestrode a single plank, like a man riding a horse; he stripped off the clothes Kalypso (Calypso) gave\n        him, drew the scarf round him above his waist at once, then let himself fall downwards into the sea, striking\n        out with his arms and striving desperately to swim . . .\n        Then for two nights and two days Odysseus was driven at random by swollen billows . . . [until he eventually\n        came ashore on the island of the Phaiakes (Phaeacians)] When he had got his breath again and rallied the spirit\n        in his breast, he undid the scarf the goddess had given him and threw it into the seaward flowing river. The\n        swelling water carried it on downstream, and Ino hastened to catch it in her hands.\"\n\nLycophron, Alexandra 755 ff (trans.
