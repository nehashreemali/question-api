  "content": "THE HARPYIAI (Harpies) were the spirits (daimones) of sudden, sharp gusts of wind. They were known as\n        the hounds of Zeus and were despatched by the god to snatch away\n        (harpazô) people and things from the earth. Sudden, mysterious dissappearances were often\n        attributed to the Harpyiai.\n\nThe Harpyiai were once sent by Zeus to plague King Phineus of Thrake (Thrace) as punishment for revealing the\n        secrets of the gods. Whenever a plate of food was set before him, the Harpyiai would swoop down and snatch it\n        away, befouling any scraps left behind. When the Argonauts came to visit, the winged Boreades gave chase, and\n        pursued the Harpies to the Strophades Islands, where the goddess Iris commanded them to\n        turn back and leave the storm-spirits unharmed.\n\nThe Harpyiai were depicted as winged women, sometimes with ugly faces, or with the lower bodies of birds.\n\n[1.1] THAUMAS & ELEKTRA (Hesiod Theogony 265, Apollodorus 1.10, Hyginus Preface)\n        [1.2] THAUMAS & OZOMENE (Hyginus Fabulae 14)\n        [2.1] TYPHOEUS (Valerius Flaccus 4.425)\n\n[1.1] OKYPETE, AELLO (Hesiod Theogony 265, Apollodorus 1.10)\n        [1.2] PODARGE (Homer Iliad 16.148, Stesichorus Frag 178)\n        [1.3] OKYPETE-OKYTHOE-OKYPODE, AELLOPOS-NIKOTHOE (Apollodorus 1.121)\n        [1.4] OKYPETE, PODARKE-AELLOPOS, KELAINO (Hyginus Preface, Hyginus Fabulae 14)\n\n[1.1] XANTHOS, BALIOS (by Zephyros)\n        (Homer Iliad 16.148, Quintus Smyrnaeus 3.743)\n        [2.1] PHLOGEUS, HARPAGOS (Stesichorus Frag 178)\n        [3.1] AREION (Quintus Smyrnaeus 4.569)\n\n[1.1] XANTHOS, PODARKES (by Boreas) (Nonnus Dionysiaca 37.155)\n\nHARPYIAE (Harpuiai), that is, \"the swift robbers,\" are, in the Homeric poems, nothing but personified storm\n        winds. (Od. xx. 66, 77.) Homer mentions only one by name, viz. Podarge, who was married to Zephyrus,\n        and gave birth to the two horses of Achilles, Xanthus and Balius. (Il. xvi. 149, &c.) When a person\n        suddenly disappeared from the earth, it was said that he had been carried off by the Harpies (Od. i.\n        241, xiv. 371); thus, they carried off the daughters of king Pandareus, and gave them as servants to the\n        Erinnyes. (Od. xx. 78.) According to Hesiod (Theog. 267, &c.), the Harpies were the\n        daughters of Thaumas by the Oceanid Electra, fair-locked and winged maidens, who surpassed winds and birds in\n        the rapidity of their flight. Their names in Hesiod are Aëllo and Ocypete. (Comp. Apollod. i. 2. § 6.)\n        But even as early as the time of Aeschylus (Eum. 50), they are described as ugly creatures with wings,\n        and later writers carry their notions of the Harpies so far as to represent them as most disgusting monsters.\n        They were sent by the gods as a punishment to harass the blind Phineus, and whenever a meal was placed before\n        him, they darted down from the air and carried it off; later writers add, that they either devoured the food\n        themselves, or that they dirtied it by dropping upon it some stinking substance, so as to render it unfit to be\n        eaten. They are further described in these later accounts as birds with the heads of maidens, with long claws on\n        their hands, and with faces pale with hunger. (Virg. Aen. iii. 216, &c.; Tzetz. ad Lycoph.\n        653; Ov. Met. vii.4, Fast. vi. 132; Hygin. Fab. 14.) The traditions about their\n        parentage likewise differ in the different traditions, for some called them the daughters of Pontus (or\n        Poseidon) and Terra (Serv. ad Aen. iii. 241), of Typhon (Val. Flacc iv. 428, 516), or even of Phineus.\n        (Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 166, Chil. i. 220; Palaephat. 23. 3). Their number is either two, as in\n        Hesiod and Apollodorus, or three; but their names are not the same in all writers, and, besides those already\n        mentioned, we find Aëllopos, Nicothoë, Ocythoë, Ocypode, Celaeno, Acholoë. (Apollod. i. 9,\n        21; Serv. ad Aen. iii. 209; Hygin. Fab. Praef. p. 15, Fab. 14.) Their place of abode\n        is either the islands called Strophades (Virg. Aen. iii. 210), a place at the entrance of Orcus (vi.\n        289), or a cave in Crete. (Apollon. Rhod. ii. 298.) The most celebrated story in which the Harpies play a part\n        is that of Phineus, at whose residence the Argonauts arrived while he was plagued by the monsters. He promised\n        to instruct them respecting the course they had to take, if they would deliver him from the Harpies. When the\n        food for Phineus was laid out on a table, the Harpies immediately came, and were attacked by the Boreades, Zetes\n        and Calais, who were among the Argonauts, and provided with wings. According to an ancient oracle, the Harpies\n        were to perish by the hands of the Boreades, but the latter were to die if they could not overtake the Harpies.\n        The latter fled, but one fell into the river Tigris, which was hence called Harpys, and the other reached the\n        Echinades, and as she never returned, the islands were called Strophades. But being worn out with fatigue, she\n        fell down simultaneously with her pursuer; and, as they promised no further to molest Phineus, the two Harpies\n        were not deprived of their lives. (Apollod. i. 9. § 21.) According to others, the Boreades were on the\n        point of killing the Harpies, when Iris or Hermes appeared, and commanded the conquerors to set them free, or\n        both the Harpies as well as the Boreades died. (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. i. 286, 297; Tzetz.\n        Chil. i. 217.) In the famous Harpy monument recently brought from Lycia to this country, the Harpies\n        are represented in the act of carrying off the daughters of Pandareus.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 265 ff (trans.

His island is a\n        floating one; all round it there is a wall of bronze, unbreakable, and rock rises sheer above it. Twelve\n        children of his live in the palace with him; six are daughters [perhaps the Thuellai, storm-winds], six are sons\n        [perhaps the Anemoi, directional-winds] in the prime of youth; moreover the king has given his daughters as\n        wives to his sons. These all hold a continual feast with their dear father and much-loved mother; countless\n        dainties are there before them, and through the daytime the hall is rich with savoury smells and murmurous with\n        the sound of music. At night they sleep, each with his own chaste wife, on inlaid bedsteads with coverlets over\n        them . . .

I myself awoke, and wondered if now I should throw myself overboard and be drowned in ocean or\n        if I should bear it all in silence and stay among the living. I did bear it and did remain, but covered my face\n        as I lay on deck.

For he showed no reverence even for Zeus, whose sacred\n        purposes he did not scruple to disclose in full to all. Zeus punished him for this by giving him a lingering old\n        age, without the boon of sight. He even robbed him of such pleasure as he might have got from the many dainties\n        which neighbours kept bringing to his house when they came there to consult the oracle. On every occasion the\n        Harpyiai (Harpies) swooped down through the clouds and snatched the food from his mouth and hands with their\n        beaks, sometimes leaving him not a morsel, sometimes a few scraps, so that he might live and be tormented.

Harpyiai who live in some abominable haunt that lies beyond our ken swoop down on me\n        and snatch the food from my lips. There is nothing I can do to stop them.

Yet bitter necessity that cannot be\n        gainsaid, not only keeps me there, but forces me to pamper my accursed belly. But there is an oracle which says\n        that these Harpyiai shall be dealt with by the two sons of Boreas (the North Wind)--no unknown foreigner shall\n        drive them off.’ . . . \n        [The Boread Zetes addresses Phineus :] ‘We should be quick to help you, if it were true that we are\n        destined for this honour.

And for all our eagerness we dare not undertake to foil the Harpyiai when they come, unless you\n        can assure us on oath that by doing so we shall not lose the favour of the gods.’\n        The old man opened his sightless eyes and raising then as thought to look him in the face, replied to Zetes :\n        ‘Say no more, my child. I beg you not to entertain such fears. I swear . . . that you will not incur the\n        wrath of Heaven by helping me.’\n        Reassured by these oaths the pair were eager to take up his cause. The younger members of the party immediately\n        prepared a meal for the old man--the last pickings that the Harpyiai (Harpies) were to get from him--while Zetes\n        and Kalias (Calais) took their stand beside him ready to smite them with their swords when they attacked. And\n        Phineus had scarcely taken the first morsel up when, with as little warning as a whirlwind or a lightning flash,\n        they dropped from the clouds proclaiming their desire for food with raucous cries. The young lords saw them\n        coming and raised the alarm. Yet they had hardly done so before the Harpyiai had devoured the whole meal and\n        were on the wing once more, far out at sea. All they left was an intolerable stench.\n        Raising their swords, the two sons of Boreas flew off in pursuit. Zeus gave them indefatigable strength; indeed,\n        without his aid, there could have been no chase, for whenever the Harpyiai came to Phineos’ house or left\n        it they outstripped the storm winds from the West. But Zetes and Kalais very nearly caught them. They even\n        touched them, though to little purpose, with their finger-tips, like a couple of keen hounds on a hillside, hot\n        on the track of a horned goat or a deer, pressing close behind the quarry and snapping at the empty air. Yet\n        even with Heaven against them, the long chase would certainly have ended in their tearing the Harpyiai to pieces\n        when they overtook them at the Ekhinades (Echinades, Floating Isles),but for Iris of the swift feet,who when she\n        saw them leapt down from Olympos through the sky and checked them with these words : ‘Sons of Boreas, you\n        may not touch the Harpyiai with your swords: they are the hounds of almighty Zeus. But I myself will undertake\n        on oath that never again shall they come near to Phineus.’\n        And she went on to swear by the waters of Styx, the most portentous and inviolable oath that any god can take,\n        that the Harpyiai should never visit Phineus' house again, such being Fate's decree. This oath prevailed upon\n        the noble brothers, who wheeled round and set their course for safety and the ship; which is the reason why the\n        Ekhinades (Floating Isles) have changed their name and are now called the Strophades (Islands of Return). The\n        Harpyiai and Iris went their different ways. The Harpyiai withdrew to a den in Minoan Krete (Crete), and Iris\n        soared up to Olympos.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 430 ff : \n        \"[Zetes, after returning from the chase of the Harpyiai (Harpies), :] told his eager friends [the\n        Argonauts] how long the chase had been; how Iris had saved the Harpyiai's lives, but with a gracious undertaking\n        for the time to come; and how the frightened monsters had taken refuge in the great cavern under the cliff of\n        Dikte (Dicte).\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 17. 11 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Among the scenes illustrated on the chest of Kypselos (Cypselus) dedicated at Olympia :] There is also\n        Phineus the Thrakian (Thracian), and the sons of Boreas are chasing the Harpyiai (Harpies) away from him.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 18. 10 - 16 :\n        \"[Among the scenes depicted on the throne of Apollon at Amyklai (Amyclae) near Sparta :] Kalais (Calais)\n        and Zetes are driving the Harpyiai (Harpies) away from Phineus.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 14 (trans.

Such portents and such penalties doth he suffer for his crimes; one hope alone the old man hath: the\n        Fates decreed of yore that the sons of Aquilo [Boreas the North Wind] should dispel the cruel plague.\n        So Phineus, aware that he Minyae and sure succour are drawing nigh, goes down with his staff’s aid to the\n        water’s edge Then, drawing faint breath, he cries : ‘All hail, O long-expected band . . . Pity my\n        present fate . . . The Harpyiae ever watch my food; never, alas! can I elude them; straightway they all swoop\n        down like the black cloud of a whirling hurricane, already by the sound of her wings I know Celaeno from afar;\n        they ravage and sweep away my banquet, and befoul and upset the cups, there is a violent stench and a sorry\n        battle arises, for the monsters are as famished as I. What all have scorned or polluted with their touch, or\n        what has fallen from their filthy claws, causes me to linger thus among the living. Nor may I break fate's bond\n        by death: by nourishment is my cruel need prolonged. But do you save me, I beseech you, if heaven's presage to\n        me be not false, do you set a term to my punishment. Surely Aquilo's [Boreas'] sons are here to rout the\n        monsters, nor are they alien to me; for I am king of rich Hebrus, and once was your Cleopatra [sister of the\n        Boreades] joined to me in wedlock . . . And deem not that I am now expiating a sin of cruelty or evil deeds: the\n        fates, vain babbler, and Jove's [Zeus'] purpose and the counsels he framed, his from all else, and suddenly to\n        be made manifest on earth--these had I disclosed, pitying the human race; hence this great plague and the\n        darkness that even as I spoke o'erclouded me . . .’\n        So he spoke, and--for so the fates now grants it--deeply stirred and excited them all with the picture of his\n        cruel punishment. They set the couches, and welcome him to the midmost cushions, and themselves recline around;\n        withal they watch the waters and withal the skies, and bid him dine and banish care: when suddenly the wretched\n        old man trembled, and his fingers dropped from his paling lips; nor was there warning of the plague, but among\n        the very dishes were seen the birds. A rank smell floats abroad, and a breath of their sire’s Avernus is\n        exhaled; one only do all attack with flapping wings, one alone does the band molest; in savage glee doth the\n        cloud of Cocytus gape at him, rousing disgust by their very sight. Then upon the ground and upon the fouled\n        coverlets of the mocked banquet do they pour a filthy stream; there is a whirring of wings, and form the\n        withholding of the prey hunger ranges on either side; for the horrible Celaeno debars not Phineus only, but her\n        wretched sisters also. Thereat on a sudden dart forth [the Boreades] the sons of Aquilo [Boreas], and rise with\n        a shout into the air, their sire impelling their wings the while. The new foe dismays the pests, and the plunder\n        drops from their jaws, and first in fear they flutter about Phineus' palace, then seek the deep; the Haemonians\n        [Argonauts] stand transfixed upon the shore, and follow the roving monsters with their gaze . . . \n        In fleet a whirlwind do they pass over peoples and seas afar, nor are suffered to settle in any land. And now\n        are they drawing nigh the bounds of the Ionian Sea and the rocks in its midst: today the dweller in that mighty\n        sea called them the Strophades [i.e. Greek for Isles of Turning]. Here while they hovered, wearing and panting\n        with fear of death’s approach, and weighed down in low and timorous flight implored with ghastly shriek\n        their father Typho [Typhoeus], he rose and brought up the darkness with him, mingling high and low, while from\n        the heart of the gloom a voice was heard : ‘It is enough to have chased the goddesses so far; why strive\n        ye father in rage against the ministers of Jove [Zeus], whom, though he wield the thunderbolt and the aegis, he\n        has chosen to work his mighty wrath? Now also hath that same Jove commanded them to depart from the dwelling of\n        Agenor’s son [Phineus]; they hearken to his prompting, and withdraw upon his word. Yet anon will ye also\n        in like manner flee, when the fatal blow shall bring doom upon you. Never shall the Harpyiae lack fresh\n        sustinence, so long as mortals shall merit the anger of the gods.’\n        The twain stopped short in the air, and hovered awhile with doubtful wing; then depart, and in triumph rejoin\n        their comrades ranks.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 8. 255 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Phineus after the long fast that was his punishment, when he knew the birds [the Harpyiai (Harpies)] were\n        driven away nor screamed any more about his house--yet believed he not wholly,--recline hilarious at the board,\n        and handle the cups that no fierce wings upset.\"\n\nApuleius, The Golden Ass 10. 15 ff (trans. Walsh) (Roman novel C2nd A.D.) :\n        \n        \"Monstrous flies soaring into their room like the Harpyiae (Harpies) of old who plundered Phineus'\n        feasts.\"\n\nOppian, Cynegetica 2. 615 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd A.D.) :\n        \"Against Phineus once on a time was the Titan Phaethon [Helios the Sun] angered, wroth for the victory of\n        prophet Phoibos [Apollon], and robbed him of his sight and sent the shameless Harpyiai (Harpies), a winged race\n        to dwell with him to his sorrow. But when the two glorious sons of Boreas, even Zetes and Kalais (Calais),\n        voyaged on this hip Argo in quest of the golden prize, assisting Jason, then did they take compassion on the old\n        man and slew that tribe and gave his poor lips sweet food.\"\n\nVirgil, Aeneid 3. 209 ff (trans. Day-Lewis) (Roman epic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"[Aeneas describes his voyage past the Strophades Islands :] Where dreadful Celaeno and her coven of\n        Harpyiae (Harpies) dwell, now the house of Phineus is barred and in fear they have left their pristine banquets.\n        No viler monstrosity than they, no pest more atrocious did ever the wrath of god conjure up out of hell's swamp.\n        Bird-bodied, girl-faced things they are; abominable their droppings, their hands are talons, their faces haggard\n        with hunger insatiable. When we had made our landfall and entered port, we observed abundant herds of cattle\n        dotted over the vale and goat flocks browsing there without any goatherd by them. We slaughtered some; we\n        invited Jove [Zeus] and the other gods to take their share of the spoil. Then by the winding shore seated on\n        makeshift benches, we are most richly feasting. But, the next moment, we hear a hoarse vibration of\n        wing-beats--the Harpyiae (Harpies) are on us, horribly swooping down from the mountains. They tear the banquet\n        to pieces, filthying all with their bestial touch. Hideous the sounds, nauseous the stench about us.\n        We choose a secluded spot under an overhanging crag, enclosed by trees and their shifting shadows, to set up our\n        tables again and light a fire on a new altar. Again from their hidden lairs, flying in from different angles,\n        that noisy coven claws at the feast, hovering around it, their mouths tainting the meal. So then I order my\n        friends, stand to arms, for we must fight this damnable brood. They did as they were ordered: they put their\n        shields out of sight beside them. So when the creatures again came screeching round the bay, Misenus from an\n        observation post above us, blew the alarum. My friends went into an unfamiliar combat, trying their steel on\n        sinister birds of the sea. But blows did not make them turn a feather, their bodies would not be wounded--they\n        simply flew off at high speed into the blue, leaving a half devoured feast and their own disgusting traces.\n        Celaeno alone, perching upon a rock pinnacle, stayed behind, and broke into speech, a fortune-teller of evil\n        :--‘So you're willing to go to war--to war, sons of Laomedon, over the cattle you slaughtered, over slain\n        bullocks? prepared to drive us innocent Harpyiae out of our rightful domain? very well: take these words to\n        heart, and never forget them. What the Father almighty foreshowed to Phoebus Apollo and he to me, will I, the\n        chief of the Furiae, reveal you. You are making all speed for Italy, and the winds won over, to Italy you shall\n        go, even enter port you may: but, before you can wall your promised city, outrageous famine shall fasten upon\n        you, in return for trying to kill us, and force you to chew your tables--yes, gnaw at them and devour\n        them.’\n        She spoke : she winged away into the sheltering forest.\n        As for my friends, their blood went cold with the shock of panic and curdled; their hearts sank: ‘no more\n        fighting,’ they said--‘through vows and prayers alone we must seek security, whether those creatures\n        are of heaven or uncanny birds of ill omen.’\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 16. 148 ff (trans.
