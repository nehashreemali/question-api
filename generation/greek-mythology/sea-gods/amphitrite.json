  "content": "AMPHITRITE was the goddess-queen of the sea, wife of Poseidon, and eldest of the fifty Nereides. She was the female personification of the sea--the loud-moaning mother of\n        fish, seals and dolphins.\n\nWhen Poseidon first sought Amphitrite's hand in marriage, she fled his advances, and hid herself away near\n        Atlas in the Ocean stream at the far ends of the earth. The dolphin-god Delphin eventually tracked her down and persuaded her to return to wed the\n        sea-king.\n\nAmphitrite was depicted in Greek vase painting as a young woman, often raising her hand in a pinching gesture.\n        Sometimes she was shown holding a fish. In mosaic art the goddess usually rides beside her husband in a chariot\n        drawn by fish-tailed horses or hippokampoi. Sometimes her hair is\n        enclosed with a net and her brow adorned with a pair of crab-claw \"horns\".\n\nHer name is probably derived from the Greek words amphis and tris, \"the surrounding\n        third.\" Her son Tritôn was similarly named \"of the third.\" Clearly \"the third\" is\n        the sea, although the reason for the term is obscure. Amphitrite was essentially the same as the primordial\n        sea-goddess Thalassa. Her Roman equivalent was Salacia whose name\n        means \"the salty one.\"\n\n[1.1] NEREUS & DORIS (Hesiod Theogony 243, Apollodorus 1.11)\n        [2.1] OKEANOS & TETHYS\n        (Apollodorus 1.8)\n\n[1.1] TRITON (by Poseidon) (Hesiod Theogony 939, Apollodorus 1.28, Hyginus Pref)\n        [2.1] RHODE (by Poseidon) (Apollodorus 1.28)\n        [3.1] KYMOPOLEIA (by Poseidon) (Hesiod Theogony 817)\n        [4.1] BENTHESIKYME (by Poseidon) (Apollodorus 3.201)\n        [5.1] SEALS, DOLPHINS, FISH, SHELLFISH (Homer Odyssey 4.404 & 5.440, Aelian On Animals 12.45, Athenaeus Deip. 3.92d, Oppian Halieutica 1.1)\n\nAMPHITRI′TE (Amphitritê), according to Hesiod (Theog. 243) and Apollodorus (i. 2. §\n        7) a Nereid, though in other places Apollodorus (i. 2. § 2, i. 4. § 6) calls her an Oceanid. She is\n        represented as the wife of Poseidon and the goddess of the sea (the Mediterranean), and she is therefore a kind\n        of female Poseidon. In the Homeric poems she does not occur as a goddess, and Amphitrite is merely the name of\n        the sea. The most ancient passages in which she occurs as a real goddess is that of Hesiod above referred to and\n        the Homeric hymn on the Delian Apollo (94), where she is represented as having been present at the birth of\n        Apollo. When Poseidon sued for her hand, she fled to Atlas, but her lover sent spies after her, and among them\n        one Delphinus, who brought about the marriage between her and Poseidon, and the grateful god rewarded his\n        service by placing him among the stars. (Eratosth. Catast. 31; Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 17.)\n        When afterwards Poseidon shewed some attachment to Scylla, Amphitrite's jealousy was excited to such a degree,\n        that she threw some magic herbs into the well in which Scylla used to bathe, and thereby changed her rival into\n        a monster with six heads and twelve feet. (Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 45, 649.) She became by Poseidon the\n        mother of Triton, Rhode, or Rhodos, and Benthesicyme. (Hesiod. Theog. 930, &c.; Apollod. i. 4.\n        § 6; iii. 15. § 4.) Later poets regard Amphitrite as the goddess of the sea in general, or the ocean.\n        (Eurip. Cycl. 702; Ov. Met. i. 14.) Amphitrite was frequently represented in ancient works of\n        art; her figure resembled that of Aphrodite, but she was usually distinguished from her by a sort of net which\n        kept her hair together, and by the claws of a crab on her forehead. She was sometimes represented as riding on\n        marine animals, and sometimes as drawn by them. The temple of Poseidon on the Corinthian isthmus contained a\n        statue of Amphitrite (Paus. ii. 1. § 7), and her figure appeared among the relief ornaments of the temple\n        of Apollo at Amyclae (iii. 19. § 4). on the throne of the Olympian Zeus, and in other places. (v. 2. §\n        3, comp. i. 17. § 3, v. 26. § 2.) We still possess a considerable number of representations of\n        Amphitrite. A colossal statue of her exists in the Villa Albani, and she frequently appears on coins of\n        Syracuse. The most beautiful specimen extant is that on the arch of Augustus at Rimini.\n        Halosydne (Halosudnê), that is, \"the seafed,\" or the sea born goddess, occurs as a surname of Amphitrite\n        and Thetys. (Hom. Od. iv. 404, Il. xx. 207.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 240 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"To Nereus and rich-haired Doris, daughter of Okeanos (Oceanus), there were born in the barren sea\n        daughters greatly beautiful even among goddesses: Ploto and Eukrante (Eucrante) and Amphitrite [the first three\n        of the fifty listed] . . . Kymodoke (Cymodoce) who, with Kymatolege (Cymatolege) and Amphitrite, light of foot,\n        on the misty face of the open water easily stills the water and hushes the winds in their blowing . . .

Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Constellation Delphin. Eratosthenes [Hellenistic poet C3rd B.C.] and others give the following reason for\n        the dolphin's being among the stars. Amphitrite, when Neptunus [Poseidon] desired to wed her and she preferred\n        to keep her virginity, fled to Atlas. Neptunus sent many to seek her out, among them a certain Delphin, who, in\n        his wandering s among the islands, came at last to the maiden, persuaded her to marry Neptunus, and himself took\n        charge of the wedding. In return for this service, Neptunus put the form of a dolphin among the\n        constellations.\"\n\nVirgil, Georgics 1. 29 ff (trans. Fairclough) (Roman bucolic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"You [Caesar praised as if he were Neptunus (Poseidon)] come as god of the boundless sea and sailors\n        worship your deity alone, while farthest Thule owns your lordship and Tethys with the dowry of all her waves\n        buys you to wed her daughter [Amphitrite].\"\n\nOppian, Halieutica 1. 38 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd A.D.) :\n        \"The Dophins : Poseidon loves them exceedingly, inasmuch as when he was seeking Amphitrite the dark-eyed\n        daughter of Nereus who fled from his embraces, Delphines (the Dolphins) marked her hiding in the halls of\n        Okeanos (Oceanus) and told Poseidon; and the god of the dark hair straightway carried off the maiden and\n        overcame her against her will. Her he made his bride, queen of the sea, and for their tidings he commended his\n        kindly attendants and bestowed on them exceeding honour for their portion.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 1353 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[Jason addresses the Argonauts whose ship is beached in the Libyan desert :] ‘They [the Libyan\n        Nymphai (Nymphs)] said that when Amphitrite had unyoked the horses from Poseidon's rolling chariot we were to\n        recompense our mother [the ship Argo] amply for what she had suffered all the long time she bore us in her womb.\n        Now I admit that the meaning of this oracle eludes me . . .’\n        The Minyai (Minyae) [Argonauts] listened with amazement to his tale. It was followed by the most astounding\n        prodigy. A great horse came bounding out of the sea, a monstrous animal, with his golden mane waving in the air.\n        He shook himself, tossing off the spray in showers. Then, fast as the wind, he galloped away.\n        Peleus was overjoyed and at once explained the portent to the others. ‘It is clear to me,’ he said,\n        ‘that Poseidon's loving wife has just unyoked his team. As for our mother, I take her to be none but the\n        ship herself. Argo carried us in her womb; we have often heard her groaning in her pain. Now, we will carry her.\n        We will hoist her on our shoulders, and never resting , never tiring, carry her across the sandy waste in the\n        track of the galloping horse. He will not disappear inland. I am sure that his hoofprints will lead us to some\n        bay that overlooks the sea.’\"\n\nBacchylides, Fragment 17 (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric IV) (Greek lyric C5th\n          B.C.) :\n        \"But sea-dwelling dolphins were swiftly carrying great Theseus to the house of his father [Poseidon], god\n        of horses, and he reached the hall of the gods. There he was awe-struck at the glorious daughters of blessed\n        Nereus, for from their splendid limbs shone a gleam as of fire, and round their hair were twirled gold-braided\n        ribbons; and they were delighting in their hearts by dancing with liquid feet. And he saw his father's dear\n        wife, august ox-eyed Amphitite, in the lovely house; she put a purple cloak about him and set on his thick hair\n        the faultless garland which once at her marriage guileful Aphrodite had given her, dark with roses [presumably\n        as a wedding gift]. Nothing that the gods wish is beyond the belief of sane mortals: he [Theseus] appeared\n        beside the slender-sterned ship. In what thoughts did he check the Knossian (Cnossian) commander [Minos] when he\n        came unwet from the sea, a miracle for all, and the gods' gifts shone on his limbs.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 17. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[Minos king of Krete (Crete)] hurled insults at him [Theseus] and denied that he was a son of Poseidon,\n        since he could not recover for him the signet-ring, which he happened to be wearing, if he threw it into the\n        sea. With these words Minos it is said to have thrown the ring, but they say that Theseus came up from the sea\n        with that ring and also with a gold crown that Amphitrite had given him.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 5 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Minos is said to have drawn a gold ring from his finger and cast it into the sea. He bade Theseus bring it\n        back, if he wanted him to believe he was a son of Neptunus [Poseidon] . . . Theseus, without any invoking of his\n        father or obligation of an oath, cast himself into the sea. And at once a great swarm of dolphins, tumbling\n        forward over the sea, led him through gently swelling waves to the Nereides. From them he brought back the ring\n        of Minos and a crown, bright with many gems, from Thetis, which she had received at her wedding as a gift from\n        Venus [Aphrodite]. Others say that the crown came from the wife [Amphitrite] of Neptunus, and Theseus is said to\n        have given it to Ariadne as a gift, when on account of his valor and courage she was given to him in\n        marriage.\"\n\nHomer, Odyssey 3. 99 (trans.
