  "content": "THE DAIMONES PROSEOOUS were six marine-deities who haunted the dark sea-caves beneath the island of Rhodes.\n\nThey once dwelt on the shore but when the new-born goddess Aphrodite attempted to land on the island they drove\n        her away. As punishment she inflicted them with a madness that caused them to rape their own mother. Poseidon\n        was so enraged by the horrendous crime, he cast them into the dark caverns beneath the isle.\n\nThe Eastern Daimones were probably identified with the Telkhines who in Diodorus'\n        account were their uncles.\n\n[1] POSEIDON & HALIA (Diodorus Siculus 5.55.4)\n        [2] ZEUS & HIMALIA (Diodorus Siculus 5.55.4)\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 55. 4 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"Poseidon, the myth continues, when he had grown to manhood, became enamoured of Halia, the sister of the\n        Telkhines (Telchines), and lying with her he begat six male children and one daughter, called Rhodos, after whom\n        the island [of Rhodes] was named . . . And while these were still young men, Aphrodite, they say, as she was\n        journeying [after her birth in the sea] from Kytherea (Cytherea) to Kypros (Cyprus) and dropped anchor near\n        Rhodes, was prevented from stopping there by the sons of Poseidon, who were arrogant and insolent men; whereupon\n        the goddess, in her wrath, brought a madness upon them, and they lay with their mother [Halia] against her will\n        and committed many acts of violence upon the natives. But when Poseidon learned of what had happened he buried\n        his sons beneath the earth, because of their shameful deed, and men called them the Eastern Demons\n        (proseoous daimones); and Halia cast herself into the sea.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 55. 5 : \n        \"And at this period [before the Great Deluge] in the eastern part of the island [of Rhodes] there sprung up\n        the Gigantes (Giants) [probably the Telkhines or Daimones Proseoous], as they were called; and at the time when\n        Zeus is said to have subdued the Titanes (Titans), he became enamoured of one of the Nymphai (Nymphs) [of the\n        island], Himalia by name.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
