  "content": "IRIS was the goddess of the rainbow and the messenger of the Olympian gods. She was often described as the\n        handmaiden and personal messenger of Hera.\n        Iris was a goddess of sea and sky--her father Thaumas \"the wondrous\" was a marine-god, and her mother\n        Elektra \"the amber\" a cloud-nymph. For the coastal-dwelling Greeks, the rainbow's arc was most often\n        seen spanning the distance beteween cloud and sea, and so the goddess was believed to replenish the rain-clouds\n        with water from the sea. Iris had no distinctive mythology of her own. In myth she appears only as an\n        errand-running messenger and was usually described as a virgin goddess. Her name contains a double meaning,\n        being connected with both the Greek word iris \"the rainbow\" and eiris\n        \"messenger.\"\n\nIris is depicted in ancient Greek vase painting as a beautiful young woman with golden wings, a herald's rod\n        (kerykeion), and sometimes a water-pitcher (oinochoe) in her hand. She was usually depicted\n        standing beside Zeus or Hera, sometimes serving nectar from her jug. As cup-bearer of the gods Iris is often\n        indistinguishable from Hebe in art.\n\n[1.1] THAUMAS & ELEKTRA (Hesiod Theogony 265, Apollodorus 1.10, Hyginus Pref, Nonnus Dionysiaca 26.350)\n        [1.2] THAUMAS (Plato Theatetus 155d, Callimachus Hymn 5,\n          Ptolemy Hephaestion 6, Ovid Met. 4.479, Vergil Aeneid 9.2, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.20)\n        [1.3] THAUMAS & OZOMENE (Hyginus Fabulae 14)\n\n[1.1] POTHOS (by Zephryos) (Alcaeus Frag 257; Eustathius on\n          Homer 555, Nonnus Dionysiaca 47.340)\n\nIRIS (Iris), a daughter of Thaumas (whence she is called Thaumantias, Virg. Aen. ix. 5) and\n        Electra, and sister of the Harpies. (Hes. Theog. 266, 780; Apollod. i. 2. § 6; Plat.\n        Theaet. p. 155. d; Plut. de Plac. Philos. iii. 5.) In the Homeric poems she appears as the\n        minister of the Olympian gods, who carries messages from Ida to Olympus, from gods to gods, and from gods to\n        men. (Il. xv. 144, xxiv. 78, 95, ii. 787, xviii. 168, Hymn. in Apoll. Del. 102, &c.) In\n        accordance with these functions of Iris, her name is commonly derived from erô eirô; so that Iris\n        would mean \"the speaker or messenger:\" but it is not impossible that it may be connected with eirô, \"I\n        join,\" whence eirênê ; so that Iris, the goddess of the rainbow, would be the joiner or conciliator,\n        or the messenger of heaven, who restores peace in nature. In the Homeric poems, it is true, Iris does not appear\n        as the goddess of the rainbow, but the rainbow itself is called iris (Il xi. 27, xvii. 547): and this\n        brilliant phenomenon in tile skies, which vanishes as quickly as it appears, was regarded as the swift minister\n        of the gods. Her genealogy too supports the opinion that Iris was originally the personification of the rainbow.\n        In the earlier poets, and even in Theocritus (xvii. 134) and Virgil (Aen. v. 610) Iris appears as a\n        virgin goddess; but according to later writers, she was married to Zephyrus, and became by him the mother of\n        Eros. (Eustath. ad Hom. pp. 391, 555; Plut. Amat. 20.) With regard to her functions, which we\n        have above briefly described, we may further observe, that the Odyssey never mentions Iris, but only Hermes as\n        the messenger of the gods: in the Iliad, on the other hand, she appears most frequently, and on the most\n        different occasions. She is principally engaged in the service of Zeus, but also in that of Hera, and even\n        serves Achilles in calling the winds to his assistance. (Il. xxiii. 199.) She further performs her\n        services not only when commanded, but she sometimes advises and assists of her own accord (iii. 122, xv. 201.\n        xviii. 197. xxiv. 74, &c.). In later poets she appears on the whole in the same capacity as in the Iliad,\n        but she occurs gradually more and more exclusively in the service of Hera, both in the later Greek and Latin\n        poets. (Callim. Hymn. in Del. 232; Virg. Aen. v. 606; Apollon. Rhod. ii. 288, 432; Ov.\n        Met. xiv. 830, &c.) Some poets describe Iris actually as the rainbow itself, but Servius (ad\n          Aen v. 610) states that the rainbow is only the road on which Iris travels, and which therefore appears\n        whenever the goddess wants it, and vanishes when it is no longer needed: and it would seem that this latter\n        notion was the more prevalent one in antiquity. Respecting the worship of Iris very few traces have come down to\n        us, and we only know that the Delians offered to her on the island of Hecate cakes made of wheat and honey and\n        dried figs. (Athen. xiv. p. 645; comp. Müller, Aegin. p. 170.) No statues of Iris have been\n        preserved, but we find her frequently represented on vases and in bas-reliefs, either standing and dressed in a\n        long and wide tunic, over which hangs a light upper garment, with wings attached to her shoulders, and carrying\n        the herald's staff in her left hand; or she appears flying with wings attached to her shoulders and sandals,\n        with the staff and a pitcher in her hands.\n\nAELLOPUS (Aellopous), a surname of Iris, the messenger of the gods, by which she is described as swift-footed\n        like a storm-wind. Homer uses the form aellopos. (Il. 409.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 265 ff (trans.

Rheia unsmiling beckoned, and the\n        Korybantes (Corybantes) served her beside the bowl of the divine table. Wondering she drank a sop of the\n        newfound wine, delighted and excited; then with heavy head the spirit told the will of Zeus to the son of Zeus :\n        ‘O mighty Dionysos! Your father bids you destroy the race of Indians, untaught of piety. Come, lift the\n        thyrsus of battle in your hands, and earnheaven by your deeds. For the immortal court of Zeus will not receive\n        you without hard work, and the Horai (Horae, Seasons) will not open the gates of Olympos to you unless you have\n        struggled for the prize. Hermeias (Hermes) hardly could win his way to heaven, and only when he had killed with\n        his rod Argos the cowherd, sparkling with eyes from his feet to the hair of his head, and when he had set Ares\n        free from prison [captured in a jar by the Aloidai (Aloadae)]. Apollon mastered Delphyne [Python], and then he\n        came to live in the sky. Even your own father, chief of the Blessed, Zeus Lord in the Highest, did not rise to\n        heaven without hard work, he the sovereign of the stars: first he must bind fast those threateners of Olympos,\n        the Titanes, and hide them deep in the pit of Tartaros. You also do your work, after Apollon, after Hermaon\n        (Hermes), and your prize for your labours will be a home in your father's heaven.’\n        With these words the goddess returned to Olympos.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 20. 188 ff : \n        \"Dionysos, did not escape the jealousy of trick-stitching Hera. Still resentful of your divine birth, she\n        sent her messenger Iris on an evil errand, mingling treacherous persuasion with craft, to bewitch you and\n        deceive your mind; and she gave her an impious poleaxe, that she might hand it to the king of Arabia, Lykourgos\n        (Lycurgus), Dryas' son. The goddess made no delay. She assumed a false pretended shape of Ares, and borrowed a\n        face like his. She threw off her embroidered saffron robes, and put on her head a helmet with nodding plume,\n        donned a delusive corselet, as the mother of battle, a corselet stained with blood, and sent froth from her grim\n        countenance, like a man, battlestirring menaces, all delusion. Then with fluent speech she mimicked the voice of\n        Enyalios [Ares] : ‘My son, scion of invincible Ares [and persuades Lykourgos to attack Dionysos] . .\n        .’\n        So he spoke, and goldenwing Iris divine smiled to hear; then went her way, paddling in the false shape of a\n        falcon . . . And Iris, by Hera's command, put the winged shoe on her feet, and holding a rod like Hermes the\n        messenger of Zeus, flew up to warn of what was coming. To Bakkhos (Bacchus) in corselet of bronze she spoke\n        deceitful words : ‘Brother, son of Zeus Allwise, put war aside, and celebrate your rites with Lykourgos, a\n        willing host . . .’\n        So she cajoled him, and the shoes carried her high into the air.\"\n\nThe appearance of Iris in Greek comedy was anticipated by her earlier appearance in the satyr-plays of the\n        tragedians.\n\nAristophanes, Birds 574 (trans. O'Neill) (Greek comedy C5th to 4th B.C.) :\n        \"Hermes is a god and has wings and flies, and so do many other gods. First of all, Nike (Victory) flies\n        with golden wings, Eros (Love) is undoubtedly winged too, and Iris is compared by Homer to a timorous\n        dove.\"\n\nAristophanes, Birds 1196 ff (trans. O'Neill) (Greek comedy C5th to 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[In this comedy the Birds have built a fortress in the air blocking the gods' access to the earth :]\n        Leader of the Chorus [of Birds] : Scan all sides with your glance. Hark! methinks I can hear the rustle of the\n        swift wings of a god from heaven.\n        (The Machine brings in Iris (Goddess of the Rainbow), in the form of a young girl.)\n        Pisthetairos (Pisthetaerus) : Hi! you woman! where, where, are you flying to? Halt, don't stir! keep motionless!\n        not a beat of your wing! (She pauses in her flight.) Who are you and from what country? You must say whence you\n        come.\n        Iris : I come from the abode of the Olympian gods.\n        Pisthetairos : What's your name, ship or head-dress?\n        Iris : I am swift Iris.\n        Pisthetairo s: Paralos or Salaminia?\n        Iris : What do you mean?\n        Pisthetairos : Let a buzzard rush at her and seize her.\n        Iris : Seize me? But what do all these insults mean?\n        Pisthetairos : Woe to you!\n        Iris : I do not understand it.\n        Pisthetairos : By which gate did you pass through the wal [of the city of the birds]l, wretched woman?\n        Iris : By which gate? Why, great gods, I don't know.\n        Pisthetairos : You hear how she holds us in derision. Did you present yourself to the officers in command of the\n        jays? You don't answer. Have you a permit, bearing the seal of the storks?\n        Iris : Am I dreaming?\n        Pisthetairos : Did you get one?\n        Iris : Are you mad?\n        Pisthetairos : No head-bird gave you a safe-conduct?\n        Iris : A safe-conduct to me. You poor fool!\n        Pisthetairos : Ah! and so you slipped into this city on the sly and into these realms of air-land that don't\n        belong to you.\n        Iris : And what other roads can the gods travel?\n        Pisthetairos : By Zeus! I know nothing about that, not I. But they won't pass this way. And you still dare to\n        complain? Why, if you were treated according to your deserts, no Iris would ever have more justly suffered\n        death.\n        Iris : I am immortal.\n        Pisthetairos : You would have died nevertheless.-Oh! that would be truly intolerable! What! should the universe\n        obey us and the gods alone continue their insolence and not understand that they must submit to the law of the\n        strongest in their due turn? But tell me, where are you flying to?\n        Iris : I? The messenger of Zeus to mankind, I am going to tell them to sacrifice sheep and oxen on the altars\n        and to fill their streets with the rich smoke of burning fat.\n        Pisthetairos : Of which gods are you speaking?\n        Iris : Of which? Why, of ourselves, the gods of heaven.\n        Pisthetairos : You, gods?\n        Iris : Are there others then?\n        Pisthetairos : Men now adore the birds as gods, and it's to them, by Zeus, that\n        they must offer sacrifices, and not to Zeus at all!\n        Iris (in tragic style) : Oh! fool! fool! fool! Rouse not the wrath of the gods, for it is terrible indeed. Armed\n        with the brand of Zeus, justice would annihilate your race; the lightning would strike you as it did Likymnios\n        and consume both your body and the porticos of your palace.\n        Pisthetairos : Here! that's enough tall talk. Just you listen and keep quiet! Do you take me for a Lydian or a\n        Phrygian and think to frighten me with your big words? Know, that if Zeus worries me again, I shall go at the\n        head of my eagles, who are armed with lightning, and reduce his dwelling and that of Amphion to cinders. I shall\n        send more than six hundred porphyrions (water-hens) clothed in leopards' skins up to heaven against\n        him; and formerly a single Porphyrion [the giant-king that attacked heaven] gave him enough to do. As for you,\n        his messenger, if you annoy me, I shall begin by getting between your thighs, and even though you are Iris, you\n        will be surprised at the erection the old man can produce; it's three times as good as the ram on a ship's\n        prow!\n        Iris : May you perish, you wretch, you and your infamous words!\n        Pisthetairos : Won't you get out of here quickly? Come, stretch your wings or look out for squalls!\n        Iris : If my father [Zeus] does not punish you for your insults . . . \n        (The Machine takes Iris away.)\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
