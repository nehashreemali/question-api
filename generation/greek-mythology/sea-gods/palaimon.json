  "content": "PALAIMON (Palaemon) was a child sea-god who, with his mother Leukothea\n          (Leucothea), came to the aid of sailors in distress .\n\nHe was originally a mortal boy named Melikertes (Melicertes) whose parents incurred the wrath of Hera for fostering the young god Dionysos. His father was driven into a murderous rage by the goddess and\n        Ino fled with Melikertes in her arms, leaping off the cliffs into the sea. The pair were transformed into\n        sea-gods and renamed Palaimon and Leukothea.\n\nPalaimon was depicted in Greco-Roman mosaic as either a dolphin-riding boy or a fish-tailed child Triton.\n\nThe name Melikertes was derived from that of the Phoenician god Melkart or Melqart. However the Greeks\n        re-interpreted this name to mean \"the honey-eater.\" The Romans identified Palaimon with Portunus their\n        god \"of the harbour.\"\n\n[1.1] ATHAMAS & INO (Apollodorus 1.80 & 3.28,\n          Hyginus Fabulae 1 & 239, Ovid Metamorphoses 4.542, Nonnus Dionysiaca 5.556)\n        [1.2] INO (Pausanias 1.44.7, Philostratus Elder\n          2.16, Virgil Georgics 1.432, Cicero De Natura Deorum 3.15)\n\nPALAEMON (Palaimôn), signifies the wrestler. A son of Athamas and Ino, was originally called Melicertes.\n        When his mother, who was driven mad by Hera, had thrown herself with her boy, who was either still alive or\n        already killed, from the Molurian rock into the sea, both became marine divinities, viz. Ino became Leucothea,\n        and Melicertes became Palaemon. (Apollod. iii. 4. § 3; Hygin. Fab. 2; Ov. Met. iv. 520,\n        xiii. 919.) According to some, Melicertes after his apotheosis was; called Glaucus (Athen. vii. p. 296),\n        whereas, according to another version, Glaucus is said to have leaped into the sea from his love of Melicertes.\n        (Athen. vii. p. 297.) The apotheosis was effected by the Nereides, who saved Melicertes, and also ordered the\n        institution of the Nemean games. The body of Melicertes, according to the common tradition, was washed by the\n        waves, or carried by dolphins into port Schoenus on the Corinthian isthmus, or to that spot on the coast\n        wheresubsequently the altar of Palaemon stood. (Paus. i. 44. § 11, ii. 1. § 3; Plut. Sympos.\n        v. 3.) There the body was found by his uncle Sisyphus, who ordered it to be carried by Donacinus and Amphimachus\n        to Corinth, and on the command of the Nereides instituted the Isthmian games and sacrifices of black bulls in\n        honour of the deified Palaemon. (Tzetz. ad Lyc. 107, 229; Philostr. Her. 19, Icon.\n        ii. 16; Paus. ii. 1. § 3; Schol. ad Eurip. Med. 1274; Eurip. Iph. Taur. 251.) On the\n        isthmus of Corinth there was a temple of Palaemon with statues of Palaemon, Leucothea, and Poseidon; and near\n        the same place was a subterraneous sanctuary, which was believed to contain the remains of Palaemon. (Paus. ii.\n        2. § 1.) In the island of Tenedos, it is said that children were sacrificed to him, and the whole worship\n        seems to have had something gloomy and orgiastic about it. (Philostr. l. c.; Hom. Od. iii. 6.) In works\n        of art Palaemon is represented as a boy carried by marine deities or dolphins. (Philostr. Icon. ii.\n        16.) The Romans identified Palaemon with their own god Portunus, or Portumnus.\n        Melicertes (Melikertês), a son of Athamas and Ino, was metamorphosed into a marine divinity, under the\n        name of Palaemon. (Apollod. i. 9. § 5.)\n        Inous, that is, the son of Ino, a name given to Melicertes and Palaemon. (Virg. Aen. v. 823,\n        Georg. i. 437.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nAeschylus, Athamas (lost play) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        Aeschylus' lost play Athamas told the story of the madness of Athamas and the flight of Ino with\n        her son Melikertes (Melicertes).\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 80 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Athamas, lord of Boiotia (Boeotia), sired by Nephele a son Phrixos (Phrixus) and a daughter Helle. Then he\n        took a second wife, Ino, by whom he had Learkhos (Learchus) and Melikertes (Melicertes).\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 28 : \n        \"Hermes took him [the infant Dionysos] to Ino and Athamas, and persuaded them to bring him up as a girl.\n        Incensed, Hera inflicted madness on them, so that Athamas stalked and slew his elder son Learkhos (Learchus) on\n        the conviction that he was a deer, while Ino threw Melikertes (Melicertes) into a basin of boiling water, and\n        then, carrying both the basin and the corpse of the boy, she jumped to the bottom of the sea. Now she is called\n        Leukothea (Leucothea), and her son is Palaimon (Palaemon): these names they receive from those who sail, for\n        they help sailors beset by storms. Also, the Isthmian games were established by Sisyphos (Sisyphus) in honor of\n        Melikertes.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 44. 7 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"There are legends about these rocks [the Molourian Rocks on the coast of Megara] . . . it is said that\n        from it Ino flung herself into the sea with Melikertes (Melicertes), the younger of his children . . . Then it\n        was that she fled to the sea and cast herself and her son from the Molourian Rock. The son, they say, was landed\n        on the Korinthian Isthmos (Corinthian Isthmus) by a dolphin, and honours were offered to Melikertes, then\n        renamed Palaimon (Palaemon), including celebration of the Isthmian games. The Molurian Rock they though sacred\n        to Leukothea and Palaimon.\"\n\nCallistratus, Descriptions 14 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C4th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[A description of an ancient Greek painting :] Athamas goaded on by madness, was shown as naked, his hair\n        reddened with blood and its locks flying in the wind. . . Ino too was present, in a state of terror, trembling\n        slightly, her face place and corpse-like though fright; and she embraced her infant child [Melikertes\n        (Melicertes)] and held her breast to its lips, letting the nurturing drops fall on the nursling. The figure of\n        Ino was hastening towards the promontory of Skeiron (Sciron) and the sea at the foot of the mountain, and the\n        breakers that were wont to surge in billows were spreading out in a hollow to receive her . . . And sea-dolphins\n        were sporting near by, coursing through the waves in the painting . . . Moreover, at the outer edges of the\n        painting an Amphitrite rose from the depths, a creature of savage and terrifying aspect who flashed from her\n        eyes a bright radiance.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 1 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Athamas, son of Aeolus, had by his wife Nebula [Nephele], a son Phrixus and a daughter Helle . . . and by\n        Ino, daughter of Cadmus, two sons, Learchus and Melicertes.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 2 :\n        \"Athamas, driven mad by Jove [Zeus], slew his son Learchus. But Ino, with Melicertes her son, threw herself\n        into the sea. Liber [Dionysos] would have her called Leucothea, and Melicertes, her son the god Palaemon, but we\n        call her Mater Matuta, and him Portunus. In his honor every fifth year gymnastic contests are held, which are\n        called Isthmian.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 4 :\n        \"Ino with the younger [son of her and Athamas], Melicertes, cast herself into the sea and was made a\n        goddess.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 243 :\n        \"Ino, daughter of Cadmus, hurled herself into the sea with her son, Melicertes.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 224 :\n        \"Mortals who were made immortal . . .

Bacchus!’; at the name of Bacchus Juno [Hera] smiled, ‘Well done, the brat you\n        fostered, to bestow a boon like that!’\n        A cliff hung by the shore; the bottom part was hollowed by the waves and formed a roof to shield the waters from\n        the storms; the top stood hard and high and faced the open sea. Here Ino climbed--her madness gave her\n        strength--and with her burden launched herself, unchecked by any thought of fear, out and away, and where she\n        fell the waves were white with spray.\n        But Venus [Aphrodite], pitying her grandchild's [Ino's] woes, so undeserved, addressed with winning words her\n        uncle: ‘Lord of waters, whose power yields to heaven alone, great Neptunus [Poseidon], what I ask is much\n        indeed, but pity those I love, now tossing in the vast Ionian sea, and make them gods to join your company . .\n        .’\n        Her prayer was granted.

Ino his mother came in like a\n        stormwind, and snatched him from the cauldron parboiled and half-consumed. Then she ran out bounding with\n        wild-roaming feet swift as the wind; she traversed the dust of the White Plain, and for that reason she was\n        named after it Leukothea (Leucothea), the White Goddess.\n        Athamas mad was out of the hall, stirring his knees like the wind and pursuing Ino over the hills in vain,--she\n        was too quick for him.\n        But when the raving husband with restless staggering foot caught her up, at that moment the unhappy woman had\n        halted by the sea which washed her foot, moaning in plaintive tones over her crying child, while she upbraided\n        Kronion (Cronion) [Zeus] and Maia's son [Hermes] his messenger : ‘A fine reward you have given me,\n        Flash-thunderbolt, for the care of Bakkhos (Bacchus)!

What mortal man will pity you, when your father has no mercy? Either sword or water shall receive\n        you: if needs must, better to perish in the sea than by the sword . . . O that Poseidon, the hospitable friend\n        of Glaukos (Glaucus), might save you, pitying your Ino as once he pitied Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon]! I fear\n        that after the fate of unburied Learkhos (Learchus) I may see you also dead, unburied, unwept, undone, panting\n        under the bloody knife of your father. Make haste! escape from mad Athamas, and then you will not see the father\n        who murdered his child, murder the mother. Receive me you too, O sea! I have done with earth. Receive Melikertes\n        also with hospitable hand, O Nereus, as you received Perseus! . . .’\n        She spoke, and with trembling feet sprang into the sea, swiftly diving with her son. Seabluehair [Poseidon]\n        opened his arms to receive Leukothea (Leucothea), and took her into the divine company in the deep waters. She\n        helps ever since the seamen who lose their way, and now she is Ino of the sea, a Nereis (Nereid) who has charge\n        of untumultuous calm.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 28 (trans.

Soon, at any rate, Palaimon (Palaemon)\n        will ride on a dolphin's back, not awake, but lying prone upon it sound asleep.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 16 :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples):] Palaimon (Palaemon). The\n        people sacrificing at the Isthmos (Isthmus), they would be the people of Korinthos (Corinth); and yonder king of\n        the people, let us consider him to be Sisyphos (Sisyphus); and this precinct of Poseidon gently resounding to\n        the murmur of the sea--for the foliage of the pines makes this music--all this, my boy, indicates the following:\n        Ino throwing herself from the land for her part becomes Leukothea (Leucothea) and one of the band of the\n        Nereides, while as for the child, the earth will claim the infant Palaimon. Already the child is putting in\n        towards shore on a dolphin obedient to his will, and the dolphin making its back level bears the sleeping child,\n        slipping noiselessly through the calm water so as not to disturb his sleep. And as he approaches, a sanctuary\n        opens in the Isthmos as the earth is split apart by Poseidon, who, I fancy, announces to Sisyphos here the\n        advent of the child and bids him offer sacrifice to him. Sisyphos is sacrificing yonder black bull which he has\n        no doubt taken from the herd of Poseidon. The meaning of the sacrifice, the garb worn by those who conducted it,\n        the offerings, my boy, and the use o the knife must be reserved for the mysterious rites of Palaimon--for the\n        doctrine is holy and altogether secret, inasmuch as Sisyphos the wise first hallowed it; for that he is a wise\n        man is shown at once, methinks, by the intent look on his face.\n        And as for the face of Poseidon . . . since he is receiving Melikertes (Melicertes) as his guest in order that\n        he may keep him on land, he smiles as the child makes harbour, and bids the Isthmos spread out its bosom and\n        become the home of Melikertes. The Isthmos (Isthmus), my boy, is painted in the form of divinity reclining at\n        full length upon the ground, and it has been appointed by nature to lie between the Aegean and the Adriatic as\n        though it were a yoke laid upon the two seas. On the right it has a youth, surely the town of Lekhaion\n        (Lechaeum) [the port of Corinth], and on the left are girls; these are the two seas (thalattai), fair\n        and quite calm, which lie alongside the land that represents the Isthmos.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn 75 to Palaemon (trans.
