  "content": "THETIS was a goddess of the sea and the leader of the fifty Nereides. Like many\n        other sea gods she possessed the gift of prophesy and power to change her shape at will.\n\nBecause of a prophesy that she was destined to bear a son greater than his father, Zeus had her marry a mortal\n        man. Peleus, the chosen groom, was instructed to ambush her on the beach, and not release his grasp of the\n        struggling goddess as she metamorphosed into a host of shapes. The couple were afterwards married in a ceremony\n        attended by all the gods of heaven. She bore a son, the celebrated hero Akhilleus (Achilles).\n\nIn her desperate attempts to protect her son during the Trojan War, Thetis called in many favours from the\n        gods. These included Hephaistos (Hephaestus) and Dionysos, both of whom she had given refuge in the sea as they\n        faced crises of youth, and Zeus, whose throne she had protected by summoning the giant Briareus-Aigaion\n        (Aegaeon) when the gods had sought to bind him.\n\nThetis's name is connected with the ancient Greek words thesis \"creation\" and\n        têthê \"nurse\".\n\nNEREUS & DORIS (Hesiod Theogony, Homer Iliad, Homeric Hymns, Pindar Odes, Alcaeus, Apollodorus,\n          Apollonius Rhodius, Ovid Metamorphoses, et al)\n\nAKHILLEUS (by Peleus) (Homer Iliad & Odyssey, Hesiod Theogony, Alcaeus, The\n          Aegimius, Apollodorus, Plato Republic 391c, Ovid Metamorphoses, et al)\n\nTHETIS (Thetis), one of the daughters of Nereus and Doris, was the wife of Peleus, by whom she became the\n        mother of Achilles. (Hom. Il. i. 538, xviii. 35, &c., 52, &c.; Hes. Theog. 244.) Later\n        writers describe her as a daughter of Cheiron (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. i. 558). According to others,\n        Peleus married Philomela, the daughter of Actor, but his friend Cheiron, wishing to render Peleus celebrated,\n        spread the report that he was married to Thetis. (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. iv. 816.) Being a\n        granddaughter of Poseidon, Catullus (64. 28) calls her Neptunine. As a marine divinity, she dwelt like\n        her sisters, the Nereids, in the depth of the sea, with her father Nereus. (Hom. Il. i. 358, xviii. 36,\n        xx. 207.) She there received Dionysus on his flight from Lycurgus, and the god, in his gratitude, presented her\n        with a golden urn. (Hom. Il. vi. 135, Od. xxiv. 75; comp. Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 273.)\n        When Hephaestus was thrown down from heaven, he was likewise received by Thetis. She had been brought up by Hera\n        (Il. xxiv. 60), and when she reached the age of maturity, Zeus and Hera gave her, against her own will,\n        in marriage to Peleus. Poseidon and Zeus himself are said by some to have sued for her hand (Pind.\n        Isthm. viii. 58), but when Themis declared that the son of Thetis would be more illustrious than his\n        father, both suitors desisted. (Pind. l. c. viii. 70; Ov. Met. xi. 225, xv. 856, xi. 350,\n        &c.; Aeschyl. Prom. 767 ; Hygin. Fab. 54 ; Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. vi. 42.) Others\n        state that Thetis rejected the offers of Zeus, because she had been brought up by Hera (Hom. Il. xxiv.\n        60; Apollon. Rhod. iv. 793); and the god, to revenge himself, decreed that she should marry a mortal. Cheiron\n        then informed his friend Peleus how he might gain possession of her, even if she should metamorphose herself;\n        for Thetis, like Proteus, had the power of assuming any form she pleased, and she had recourse to this means of\n        escaping from Peleus, but the latter did not let her go, until she again assumed her proper form. (Apollod. iii.\n        13. § 5; Pind. Nem. iii. 60; Paus. viii. 18. § l.) Others again relate, that a marine\n        divinity appeared to Peleus on Mount Pelion, and testified her love to him, but without revealing herself to\n        him. Peleus, however, who saw her playing with dolphins, recognised the goddess, and henceforth shunned her\n        presence. But she encouraged him, reminding him of the love of Eos to Tithonus, of Aphrodite to Anchises,\n        &c., and promised to present him with a son who should be more illustrious than any mortal. (Philostr.\n        Her. 19. 1.) The wedding of Peleus was honoured with the presence of all the gods. (Hom. Il.\n        xxiv. 62.) After she had become the mother of Achilles, she bestowed upon him the tenderest care and love. (Hom.\n        Il. i. 359, 500, &c., viii. 370, xviii. 73, 457; comp. Achilles.) Her prayers to Zeus for him were\n        listened to, because at one time, when Zeus was threatened by the other gods, she induced Briareus or Aegaeon to\n        come to his assistance. (Hom. Il. i. 396, &c.) Thetis had a temple (Thetideion) between Old and New\n        Pharsalus in Thessaly (Strab. ix. p. 431), and in Sparta and Messenia she was likewise worshipped. (Paus. iii.\n        14. § 4, 22. § 2.)\n\nHALOSYDNE (Halosudnê), that is, \"the seafed,\" or the sea born goddess, occurs as a surname of Amphitrite\n        and Thetys. (Hom. Od. iv. 404, Il. xx. 207.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Iliad 24. 59 ff (trans.

Then\n        she comforted him with friendly words, and said : ‘Tell me, Dionysos, why are your looks despondent? No\n        army of earthborn Arabs has conquered you, no pursuinig mortal man, you fled from no human spear; but Hera,\n        sister and consort of Zeus Kronides (Cronides), has armed herself in heaven and fought on the side of\n        Lykourgos--Hera and stubborn Ares and the brazen sky; Lykourgos the mighty was only a fourth.
