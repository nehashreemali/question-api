  "content": "PANOPEIA (Panope) was the Nereid nymph or goddess of the sea's broad panorama. She was probably associated with\n        the sighting of land and approaching storms by sailors. Her name means \"all-seeing\" from the Greek\n        words pan and ops. Panopeia was one of the few Nereides frequently mentioned as an individual.\n        She was often paired with Galateia.\n\nNEREUS & DORIS (Hesiod Theogony 260, Homer Iliad 18.37, Apollodorus 1.11, Hyginus Preface)\n\nPA′NOPE (Panopê), a daughter of Nereus and Doris (Hom.
