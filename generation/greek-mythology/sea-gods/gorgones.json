  "content": "THE GORGONES (Gorgons) were three powerful, winged daimones named Medousa (Medusa), Sthenno and\n        Euryale. Of the three sisters only Medousa was mortal. King Polydektes of Seriphos once commanded the hero Perseus to fetch her head. He accomplished this with the help of the gods who\n        equipped him with a reflective shield, a curved sword, winged boots and helm of invisibility. When he fell upon\n        Medousa and decapitated her, two creatures sprang forth from the wound--the winged horse Pegasos (Pegasus) and\n        the giant Khrysaor (Chrysaor). Perseus fled with the monster's head in a sack and her two angry sisters chasing\n        close on his heels.\n\nAccording to late classical poets, Medousa was once a beautiful woman who was transformed into a monster by\n        Athena as punishment for lying with Poseidon in her shrine. Earlier Greek writers and artists, however, simply\n        portray her as a monster born into a large family of monsters.\n\nThe three Gorgones were depicted in ancient Greek vase painting and sculpture as winged women with broad, round\n        heads, serpentine locks of hair, large staring eyes, wide mouths, lolling tongues, the tusks of swine, flared\n        nostrils, and sometimes short, coarse beards.\n        Medousa was humanised in late classical art with the face of a beautiful woman. In mosaic art her round face was\n        wreathed with coiling snakes and adorned with a pair of small wings on the brow.\n\n[1.1] PHORKYS & KETO (Hesiod\n          Theogony 270, Apollodorus 1.10)\n        [1.2] PHORKYS (Aeschylus Prometheus Bound 794, Pausanias\n          2.21.5, Nonnus Dionysiaca 24.270)\n        [2.1] GORGO & KETO (Hyginus Pref & Fabulae 151)\n\n[1.1] MEDOUSA, EURYALE, STHENNO (Hesiod Theogony 270, Pindar Pythian 12, Apollodorus\n          2.39, Hyginus Pref, Nonnus Dionysiaca 40.227)\n\n[1.1] PEGASOS, KHRYSAOR (by Poseidon) (Hesiod Theogony 278, Apollodorus\n          2.40, Lycophron 840, Hyginus Pref, Nonnus Dionysiaca 31.13)\n\nGORGO and GO′RGONES (Gorgô and Gorgones). Homer knows only one Gorgo, who, according to the Odyssey\n        (xi. 633), was one of the frightful phantoms in Hades: in the Iliad (v. 741, viii. 349, xi. 36; comp. Virg.\n        Aen. vi. 289), the Aegis of Athena contains the head of Gorgo, the terror of her enemies. Euripides\n        (Ion, 989) still speaks of only one Gorgo, although Hesiod (Theog. 278) had mentioned three\n        Gorgones, the daughters of Phorcys and Ceto, whence they are sometimes called Phorcydes or Phorcides. (Aeschyl.\n        Prom. 793, 797; Pind. Pyth. xii. 24; Ov. Met. v. 230.) The names of the three\n        Gorgones are Stheino (Stheno or Stenusa), Euryale, and Medusa (Hes. l. c.; Apollod. ii. 4. § 2),\n        and they are conceived by Hesiod to live in the Western Ocean, in the neighbourhood of Night and the Hesperides.\n        But later traditions place them in Libya. (Herod. ii. 91; Paus. ii. 21. § 6.) They are described (Scut.\n          Here. 233) as girded with serpents, raising their heads, vibrating their tongues, and gnashing their\n        teeth; Aeschylus (Prom. 794. &c., Choëph. 1050) adds that they had wings and brazen\n        claws, and enormous teeth. On the chest of Cypselus they were likewise represented with wings. (Paus. v. 18.\n        § 1.) Medusa, who alone of her sisters was mortal, was, according to some legends, at first a beautiful\n        maiden, but her hair was changed into serpents by Athena, in consequence of her having become by Poseidon the\n        mother of Chrysaor and Pegasus, in one of Athena's temples. (Hes. Theog. 287, &c.; Apollod. ii. 4.\n        § 3; Ov. Met. iv. 792; comp. Perseus.) Her head was now of so fearful an appearance, that every\n        one who looked at it was changed into stone. Hence the great difficulty which Perseus had in killing her; and\n        Athena afterwards placed the head in the centre of her shield or breastplate. There was a tradition at Athens\n        that the head of Medusa was buried under a mound in the Agora. (Paus. ii. 21. § 6, v. 12. § 2.) Athena\n        gave to Heracles a lock of Medusa (concealed in an urn), for it had a similar effect upon the beholder as the\n        head itself. When Heracles went out against Lacedaemon he gave the lock of hair to Sterope, the daughter of\n        Cepheus, as a protection of the town of Tegea, as the sight of it would put the enemy to fight. (Paus. viii. 47.\n        § 4; Apollod. ii. 7. § 3.)\n\nThe mythus respecting the family of Phorcys, to which also the Graeae, Hesperides, Scylla, and other fabulous\n        beings belonged, has been interpreted in various ways by the ancients themselves. Some believed that the\n        Gorgones were formidable animals with long hair, whose aspect was so frightful, that men were paralysed or\n        killed by it, and some of the soldiers of Marius were believed to have thus met with their death (Athen. v. 64).\n        Pliny (H. N. iv. 31) thought that they were a race of savage, swift, and hair-covered women; and\n        Diodorus (iii. 55) regards them as a race of women inhabiting the western parts of Libya, who had been\n        extirpated by Heracles in traversing Libya.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\n* Euryale may also mean \"of the wide briny sea\" from eury-, hals, an appropriate\n        name for a daughter of sea-gods.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 270 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And to Phorkys (Phorcys) Keto (Ceto) bore the Graiai (Graeae), with fair faces and gray from birth, and\n        these the gods who are immortal and men who walk on the earth call Graiai, the gray sisters, Pemphredo robed in\n        beauty and Enyo robed in saffron, and the Gorgones (Gorgons) who, beyond the famous stream of Okeanos (Oceanus),\n        live in the utmost place toward night, by the singing Hesperides : they are Sthenno, Euryale, and Medousa\n        (Medusa), whose fate is a sad one, for she was mortal, but the other two immortal and ageless both alike.\n        Poseidon, he of the dark hair, lay with one of these, in a soft meadow and among spring flowers. But when\n        Perseus had cut off the head of Medousa there sprang from her blood great Khrysaor (Chrysaor) and the horse\n        Pegasos (Pegasus) so named from the springs (pegai) of Okeanos, where she was born.\"\n\nStasinus of Cyprus or Hegesias of Aegina, Cypria Fragment 21 (from Herodian, One\n          Peculiar Diction) (trans.

And near them are their three winged sisters, the snake-haired (drakontomalloi) Gorgones\n        (Gorgons), loathed of mankind, whom no one of mortal kind shall look upon and still draw breath.

These Nymphai had in their\n        possession winged sandals and the kibisis, which they say was a knapsack. Pindar and Hesiod in the\n        Shield of Herakles, describe Perseus as follows : ‘The head of a terrible monster, Gorgo, covered\n        all his back, and a kibisis held it.’ . . . They also had the helmet of Hades . . . Approaching\n        the Nymphai (Nymphs) he received what he had come for, and he flung on the kibisis, tied the sandals on\n        his ankles, and placed the helmet on his head. With the helmet on he could see whomever he cared to look at, but\n        was invisible to others. He also received from Hermes a sickle made of adamant.\n        Perseus took flight and made his way to Okeanos (Oceanus), where he found the Gorgones (Gorgons) sleeping. Their\n        names were Stheno, Euryale and the third was Medousa (Medusa), the only mortal one: thus it was her head that\n        Perseus was sent to bring back. The Gorgones' heads were entwined with the horny scales of serpents, and they\n        had big tusks like hogs, bronze hands, and wings of gold on which they flew. All who looked at them were turned\n        to stone. Perseus, therefore, with Athene guiding his hand, kept his eyes on the reflection in a bronze shield\n        as he stood over the sleeping Gorgones, and when he saw the image of Medousa, he beheaded her. As soon as her\n        head was severed there leaped from her body the winged horse Pegasos (Pegasus) and Khrysaor (Chrysaor) the\n        father of Geryon. The father of these two was Poseidon. Perseus then placed the head in the kibisis and\n        headed back again, as the Gorgones pursued him through the air. But the helmet kept him hidden, and made it\n        impossible for them to identify him . . . \n        Athena placed the Gorgo's head in the center of her shield.

As such he names the three\n        petrifyers daughters of dangerous sea-gods. One also bears a distincty marine name, Euryale, \"she of the\n        wide, briny sea\". Later writers continue this tradition when they speak of reefs being created where\n        Perseus had set the Gorgon's head and where he had turned a sea monster to stone.\n\nIn other motifs, the Gorgon Medousa (Medusa) was a portrayed as a storm-daemon\n        whose visage was set upon the storm-bringing aigis-shield of Athene. The two ideas were probably connected, with\n        sea storms driving ships to destruction upon the reefs. Some say there was a but a single goat-like Gorgon\n        (Gorgo), a daughter of the Sun-God, who was slain by Zeus at the start of the Titan-War to form his stormy aigis\n        shield.\n\nThe Gorgones were probably also connected with Demeter Erinys (the Fury) and the three Erinyes. These\n        goddesses could bring drought, wither the crops and herald famine. In myth, the beheading of Medousa saw the\n        release of two beings--Pegasos (of the springs) and Khrysaor (golden blade). This story might have symbolised\n        the ending of drought with the release of the waters of the springs (pegai) and growth of the golden\n        (khryse) blades of grain. in Homeric poetry, Demeter was also titled Khrysaoros, further suggesting a\n        close link between the name and blades of corn.\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Manilus Astronomy 5.22.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
