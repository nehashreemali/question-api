  "content": "NEREUS was the old man of the sea, and the god of the sea's rich bounty of fish. He dwelt in the depths of the\n        Aegean with his wife Doris and fifty Nereid daughters.\n\nLike many of the other sea-gods Nereus was a master shapeshifter, and spoke with prophetic voice. It was for\n        his knowledge that Herakles once wrestled him, in search of directions to the land of the Hesperides.\n\nNereus was depicted in ancient Greek vase painting as an old man with a wooden staff accompanied by a host of\n        his Nereid daughters. Sometimes he had a coiling fish tail in place of legs (like the image right). But unlike\n        other similar gods, such as Triton and Akheloios, Nereus was almost always depicted clothed in a chiton.\n\n[1.1] PONTOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 233, Apollodorus 1.10)\n\n[1.1] THE NEREIDES (by Doris) (Hesiod Theogony 240, Homer Iliad 18.37, Apollodorus 1.11, Aelian On animals 14.28,\n          Quintus Smyrnaeus 2.433, Hyginus Pref, Pausanias 5.19, Ovid Metamorphoses 2.10, 11.60)\n        [1.2] NERITES, THE NEREIDES (by Doris) (Aelian On Animals 14.28)\n        [2.1] GLAUKOS (Euripides Orestes 362)\n\nNEREUS (Nêreus), a son of Pontus and Gaea, and husband of Doris, by whom he became the father of the 50\n        Nereides. He is described as the wise and unerring old man of the sea, at the bottom of which he dwelt (Hom.\n        Il. xviii. 141, Od. xxiv. 58; Hes. Theog. 233, &c.; Apollod. i. 2. § 6). His\n        empire is the Mediterranean or more particularly the Aegean sea, whence he is sometimes called the Aegean\n        (Apollon. Rhod. iv. 772 ; Stat. Theb. viii. 478). He was believed, like other marine divinities, to\n        have the power of prophesying the future and of appearing to mortals in different shapes, and in the story of\n        Heracles he acts a prominent part, justas Proteus in the story of Odysseus, and Glaucus in that of the Argonauts\n        (Apollod. ii. 5. § 11; Horat. Carm. i. 15). Virgil (Aen. ii. 418) mentions the trident as\n        his attribute, and the epithets given him by the poets refer to his old age, his kindliness, and his trustworthy\n        knowledge of the future. In works of art, Nereus, like other sea-gods, is represented with pointed sea-weeds\n        taking the place of hair in the eyebrows, the chin, and the breast.\n        GERON (Gerôn), that is, \"the old man;\" under this name Nereus was worshipped at Gythium in Laconia.

Spread not your nets for the denizens of the deep . . . he\n        railed at the sea, and hoary Nereus.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 22. 24 ff :\n        \"He [Dionysos] knew the deep bosom of the waters, ever since he fled from the murderous attack of Lykourgos\n        (Lycurgus), and ancient Nereus had entertained him in his billowy dwelling.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 33. 360 :\n        \"[Thetis] returned to the weedy hall of her father Nereus.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 36. 92 ff :\n        \"[Poseidon and Apollon face off against one another to do battle when the gods took sides in the battle of\n        Dionysos and his forces against the Indians :] The stormy trumpet of the sea brayed in the ears of Phoibos\n        (Phoebus) [Apollon]--a broadbeard Triton boomed with his own proper conch, like a man half-finished, from the\n        loins down a greeny fish--the Nereides shouted the battlecry--Arabian Nereus pushed up out of the sea and\n        bellowed shaking his trident.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 41. 34 :\n        \"The fishes of many colours for her [the city of Beroe (Beruit) in Lebanon] banqueting-table, which dance\n        on the table of Nereus in the brine.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 43. 253 ff :\n        \"[When Poseidon led the Sea-Gods into battle against Dionysos and his allies during the Indian War :]\n        Ancient Nereus armed himself with a watery spear, and led his regiment of daughters [the Nereides] into the\n        Euian struggle. With sea-traversing trident he leapt at the elephants, terrible to behold: many a neighbouring\n        cliff along the shore toppled sideways under the seapike of Nereus.\n        The tribes of Nereides sounded for their sire the cry of battle-triumph: unshod, half hidden in the brine, the\n        company rushed raging to combat over the sea.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 43. 286 ff :\n        \"[When Poseidon led the Sea-Gods into battle against Dionysos and his allies :] Libyan Nereus caught up his\n        conch under the water by Syrtis, and boomed on his sea-trumpet. Then one rising from the surge, and stepping on\n        land rested his left foot on a rock, and with right broke off the top of the cliff with earthshaking tread and\n        hurled it at a Mainas' (Maenad's) inviolate head.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 43. 286 ff :\n        \"[When Poseidon led the Sea-Gods into battle against Dionysos and his allies :] Nereus defending the sea\n        came on land to fight with foaming arms against a rock-loving Pan.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 43. 400 ff :\n        \"[When Poseidon married the nymph Beroe, Nereus came with a wedding-gift :] Arabian Nereus brought to the\n        bridechamber in the deep a worthy gift of love, a clever work of Hephaistos (Hephaestus), Olympian ornaments,\n        for the bride; necklace and earrings and armlets he brought and offered, all that the Lemnian craftsman had made\n        for the Nereides with inimitable workmanship in the waves--there in the midst of the brine he shook his fiery\n        anvil and tongs under the water, blowing the enclosed breath of the bellows with mimic winds, and when the\n        furnace was kindled the fire roared in the deep unquenched. Nereus then brought these gifts in great\n        variety.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionyiaca 48. 188 ff :\n        \"That was a wedding [the marriage of Dionysos and Pallene] of many songs: . . . Companies of Nereides under\n        the foothills of the neighbouring isthmus encircled Dionysos with wedding dances and warbled their lay; beside\n        the Thrakian (Thracian) Sea danced old Nereus, who once had Bromios [Dionysos] for a guest.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
