Her\n        jealous stepmother Ino tricked Athamas into offering Helle and her brother Phrixos up as a sacrifice to the\n        gods, but Nephele sent the flying, golden-fleeced ram to their\n        rescue. During their flight to safety Helle grew weary and fell from the back of the beast into the sea. Some\n        say she drowned, while others say she was rescued by Poseidon who transformed into a sea-goddess. The sea was\n        named Hellespontos \"Sea of Helle\" after her.\n\nHelle's step-mother Ino (\"of the Ionian Sea\") and half-brother Melikertes (Melicertes) were also turned into sea-gods.\n\n[1.1] ATHAMAS & NEPHELE (Hesiod\n          Catalogues Frag 38, Apollodorus 1.80, Hyginus Fabulae 1-3)\n        [1.2] ATHAMAS (Ovid Heroides 18.136, Tryphiodorus 218) \n        [1.3] NEPHELE (Ovid Metamorphoses\n          11.195)\n\n[1.1] ALMOPIA, PAIONIA (by Poseidon) (Stephanus Byzantium s.v.

When Phrixus was to be sacrificed,\n        Nephele rescued her two children, who rode away through the air upon the ram with the golden fleece, the gift of\n        Hermes, but, between Sigeium and the Chersonesus, Helle fell into the sea, which was hence called the sea of\n        Helle (Hellespont; Aeschyl. Pers. 70, 875). Her tomb was shown near Pactya, on the Hellespont.

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Athamas, lord of Boiotia (Boeotia), sired by Nephele (the Cloud) a son Phrixos (Phrixus) and a daughter\n        Helle. Then he took a second wife, Ino, by whom he had Learkhos (Learchus) and Melikertes (Melicertes). Now Ino,\n        as a plot against the children of Nephele, persuaded the women to parch the wheat, which they did without the\n        men knowing. So the earth, sown with parched wheat, failed to produce its yearly harvest. Ino persuaded the\n        messengers to report that the oracle prophesied an end to the dearth if Phrixos were to be sacrificed to Zeus.\n        When Athamas heard this and was pressured by the joint efforts of the inhabitants, he had Phrixos placed on the\n        altar. But Nephele seized both him and her daughter, and gave them a golden-fleeced ram which she had received\n        from Hermes, by which they were borne through the sky over and across the land and the sea. But as they reached\n        the sea that lies between Sigeum and the Kherronesos (Chersonese), Helle slipped into the depths; from her death\n        the sea was called the Hellespontos (Hellespont) after her.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1. 255 ff (trans.

While they were making the passage from Europe to Asia, as\n        a kind of Providence of the gods directed, on the back of a ram whose fleece was of gold (krios\n          khrysomallos), the maiden fell into the sea, which was named after her Hellespontos (Hellespont).\n        Also the account of Phrixos underwent a similar working into a myth. For, as some men say, he made his voyage\n        upon a ship which bore the head of a ram upon its bow, and Helle, being troubled with sea-sickness, while\n        leaning far over the side of the boat for this reason, fell into the sea.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 15 (trans.

Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Athamas, son of Aeolus, had by his wife Nebula (Cloud) [Nephele], a son Phrixus and a daughter\n        Helle.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 2 :\n        \"Ino, daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia, wishing to kill Phrixus and Helle, Nebula's [Nephele's] children,\n        formed a plan with the women of the entire tribe, and conspired to parch the seed grain to make it unfertile, so\n        that, when the sterility and scarcity of grain resulted, the whole state should perish, some by starvation,\n        others by sickness. With regard to this situation Athamas sent a servant to Delphi, but Ino instructed him to\n        bring back a false reply that the pestilence would end if he sacrificed Phrixus to Jove [Zeus]. When Athamas\n        refused to do this, Phrixus voluntarily and readily promised that he alone would free the state from its\n        distress. Accordingly he was led to the altar, wearing fillets of sacrifice, but he servant, out of pity for the\n        youth, revealed Ino's plans to Athamas.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 3 :\n        \"While Phrixus and Helle under madness sent by Liber [Dionysos] were wandering in a forest, Nebula\n        [Nephele] their mother is said to have come there bringing a gilded ram, offspring of Neptune [Poseidon] and\n        Theophane. She bade her children to mount it, and journey to Colchis to King Aeetes, son of Sol [Helios], and\n        there sacrifice the ram to Mars [Ares]. This they were said to have done, but when they had mounted, and the ram\n        had carried them over the sea, Helle fell from the ram; from this sea was called Hellespont.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 20 (trans.

Many have said that Helle fell into the Hellespont . . . Stirred by this report [i.e. a false accusation\n        that Phrixus assaulted his wife], Cretheus, as was fitting for one who deeply loved his wife and was king,\n        persuaded Athamas to put Phrixus to death. However, Nubes [Nephele] intervened, and rescuing Phrixus and Helle\n        his sister, put them on the ram, and bade them flee as far as they could through the Hellespont. Helle fell off\n        and paid the debt to nature, and the Hellespont was named from her name. Phrixus came to the Colchians, and, as\n        we have said, hung up the fleece of the slain ram in a temple.\"\n\nOvid, Fasti 3. 853 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The seeds were burnt by the wicked stepmother's [Ino's] trick and no customary grain had sprouted.

People, time and Ino compelled a stubborn king to endure\n        the unspeakable orders. Phrixus and his sister, headbands scarfing their brows, stand at the altars and wail\n        their joint fate. Their mother [the cloud-nymph Nephele] sees them as she hangs upon the air, and hammers her\n        naked breast in shock. She dives into the Dracon-born city [Thebes], enveloped in clouds, and snatches her\n        children away. She provides a Ram shimmering with gold for their escape: it carries the two across the wide\n        seas.

Then she lulled the waves, and looking upon the captains and their leader accosted Jason with\n        gently words : ‘Thou too art being driven from Haemonia [Thessaly] across strange seas by an unfriendly\n        kingdom at home and a destiny like mine; once more doth Fortuna (Fortune) banish the offspring of Aeolus, and\n        you, ill-starred folk, are seeking the Scythian river.
