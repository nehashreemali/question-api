  "content": "PHORKYS (Phorcys) was the ancient sea-god of the hidden dangers of the deep. He and his wife Keto (Ceto) were\n        also gods of the largest of sea creatures. Keto's name means \"whale\" or \"sea-monster\" and\n        Phorkys' perhaps means \"seal\" (phokes in Greek).\n        Their children were dangerous sea-monsters--Skylla (the crab) a monster who devoured passing sailors, Thoosa\n        (the swift) mother of the rock-tossing cyclops Polyphemos, Ladon (strong flowing) a hundred-headed sea-serpent,\n        Ekhidna (viper) a she-dragon, the Graiai (grey ones) spirits of the sea-foam, and the Gorgones (terrifying ones)\n        whose petrifying gaze probably created the dangerous rocks and reefs of the sea.\n\nPhorkys was depicted in ancient mosaic as a grey-haired, fish-tailed god, with spiky, crab-like skin and\n        crab-claw forelegs. His attribute was a torch.\n\n[1.1] PONTOS & GAIA (Hesiod Theogony 237, Apollodorus 1.10)\n\n[1.1] THE GRAIAI, THE GORGONES, EKHIDNA, DRAKON-LADON (by\n        Keto) (Hesiod Theogony 270)\n        [1.2] THE GRAIAI, THE GORGONES (Aeschylus Prometheus Bound 793)\n        [1.3] THE PHORKIDES, THE GORGONES (by Keto) (Apollodorus 1.10, Nonnus Dionysiaca 31.13)\n        [1.4] THE PHORKIDES (Pindar Pythian Ode, Hyginus Preface,\n          Ovid Metamorphoses 4.772)\n        [2.1] THOOSA (Homer Odyssey 1.70)\n        [3.1] SKYLLA (by Krataiis - Trienos) (Apollodorus E7.20)\n        [3.2] SKYLLA (by Krataiis - Hekate) (Apollonius Rhodius 4.828)\n\nPHORCUS, PHORCYS, or PHORCYN (Phorkos, Phorkus, Phorkun.). According to the Homeric poems, an old man ruling\n        over the sea, or \"the old man of the sea,\" to whom a harbour in Ithaca was dedicated. He is described as the\n        father of the nymph Thoosa (Od. i. 71, xiii. 96, 345). Later writers call him a son of Pontus and Ge,\n        and a brother of Thaumas, Nereus, Eurybia, and Ceto (Hes. Theog. 237; Apollod. i. 2. § 6). By his\n        sister Ceto he became the father of the Graeae and Gorgones (Hes. Theog. 270, &c.), the Hesperian\n        dragon (ibid. 333, &c.), and the Hesperides (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1399); and by\n        Hecate or Cratais, he was the father of Scylla. (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. iv. 828; Eustath. ad\n          Hom. p. 1714; Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 45.) Servius (ad Aen. v. 824) calls him a son of\n        Neptune and Thoosa.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, Odyssey 1. 68 ff (trans.

This was the divine and haughty Ekhidna (Echidna), and half of her is a Nymphe with a fair face and\n        eyes glancing, but the other half is a monstrous snake . . .
