  "content": "THE PYGMAIOI (Pygmies) were a tribe of diminutive African men who lived on the southernmost shores of the great\n        earth-encircling river Okeanos (Oceanus) where they were engaged in an\n        endless war with flocks migrating cranes.\n\nThe Pygmaioi were described as tiny, black-skinned men who grew to a height of one \"pygme\"--a\n        \"pygme\" being the length from a man's elbow to his nuckle-bone (approximately 1 1/2 foot).\n\nThe Pygmies were located by ancient geographers in India (eastern \"Aithiopia\") and Sub-Saharan\n        Africa (western \"Aithiopia\") at the southernmost reaches of the world.\n\n[1.1] DOROS (son of Epaphos) (Stephanus Byzantium s.v. Pygmaioi)\n\n[1.1] EPAPHOS & GAIA  (Hesiod\n          Catalogues Frag 40A)\n        [1.2] GAIA (Philostratus Elder\n          2.22)\n\n[1.1] PYGMAIOS (Stephanus Byzantium s.v. Pygmaioi)\n        [2.1] GERANA (Aelian On Animals 15.29)\n        [3.1] OINOE, NIKODAMOS, MOPSOS (Antoninus Liberalis 16)\n\nPYGMAEUS (Pugmaios), a being whose length is a pugmê, that is, from the elbow to the hand. (Eustath.\n        ad Hom. p. 372.) The Pygmaei, in the plural, is the name of a fabulous nation of dwarfs, the\n        Liliputians of antiquity, who, according to Homer, had every spring to sustain a war against the cranes on the\n        banks of Oceanus. (Hom. Il. iii. 5, &c.) They were believed to have been descended from Pygmaeus, a\n        son of Dorus and grandson of Epaphus. (Steph. Byz. s. v. Pugmaioi.) Later writers usually place them\n        near the sources of the Nile, whither the cranes are said to have migrated every year to take possession of the\n        fields of the pygmies. (Eustath. p. 372; Aristot. Hist. Animal. viii. 12; Strab. i. p. 42, xvii. p.\n        821.) The reports of them have been embellished in a variety of ways by the ancients. Hecataeus, for example,\n        related that they cut down every corn ear with an axe, for they were conceived to be an agricultural people.\n        When Heracles came into their country, they climbed with ladders to the edge of his goblet to drink from it; and\n        when they attacked the hero, a whole army of them made an assault upon his left hand, while two others made the\n        attack on his right hand. (Philostr. Icon. ii. 21.) Aristotle did not believe that the accounts of the\n        Pygmies were altogether fabulous, but thought that they were a tribe in Upper Egypt, who had exceedingly small\n        horses, and lived in caves. (Hist. Animal. viii. 14.) In later times we also hear of northern Pygmies,\n        who lived in the neighbourhood of Thule; they are described as very shortlived, small, and armed with spears\n        like needles. (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 372.) Lastly, we also have mention of Indian pygmies, who lived\n        under the earth on the east of the river Ganges, (Ctesias, Ind. ii. pp. 250, 294; Philostr. Vit.\n          Apollon. iii. 47; Plin. H. N. vi. 22.) Various attempts have been made to account for the\n        singular belief in the existence of such a dwarfish nation, but it seems to have its origin in the love of the\n        marvellous, and the desire to imagine human beings, in different climes and in different ages, to be either much\n        greater or much smaller than ourselves. (Comp. Ov. Fast. vi. 176, Met. vi. 90; Aelian,\n        Hist. An. xv. 29.)\n\nGERANA (Gerana), a Pygmean woman, and wife of their king, Nicodamas, by whom she became the mother of Mopsus\n        (according to Boeus, ap. Athen. ix. p. 393, of a tortoise). Being highly esteemed and praised for her\n        beauty among the Pygmies, she despised the gods, especially Artemis and Hera, who in revenge metamorphosed her\n        into a crane. In this state she always fluttered about the place in which her son Mopsus dwelt, until she was\n        killed by the Pygmies. This is said to have been the origin of the war between the Cranes and the Pygmies.\n        (Anton. Lib. 16, who calls her Oenoë; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1322; Ov. Met. vi. 90.)\n\nOE′NOE (Oinoê). The name given by Antoninus Liberalis (16) to a person commonly called Gerana.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHomer, The Iliad 3. 3 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"The clamour of cranes goes hight to the heavens, when the cranes escape the winter time and the rains\n        unceasing and clamorously wing their way to streaming Okeanos (Oceanus), bringing the Pygmaioi (Pygmy) men\n        bloodshed and destruction : at daybreak they bring on the baleful battle against them.\"\n\nHesiod, Catalogues of Women Fragment 40A (from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri) (trans.\n          Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.) :\n        \"To the lands of the Massagetai and of the proud Hemikunes (Hemicynes) (Half-Dog Men), of the Katoudaioi\n        (Catoudaei) (Underground-Folk) and of the feeble Pygmaioi (Pygmies); and to the tribes of the boundless\n        Melanokhrotoi (Melanchroti) (Black-Skins) and the Libys (North-Africans). Huge Gaia (the Earth) bare these to\n        Epaphos--soothsaying people, knowing seercraft by the will of Zeus the lord of oracles, but deceivers, to the\n        end that men whose thought passes their utterance might be subject to the gods and suffer harm--Aithiopes\n        (Ethiopians) and Libys (Libyans) and mare-milking Skythioi (Scythians). For verily Epaphos was the child of the\n        almighty Son of Kronos (Cronus) [Zeus], and from him sprang the dark Libys and high-souled Aithiopes, and the\n        Katoudaioi (Underground-Folk) and feeble Pygmaioi. All these are the offspring of the lord, the Loud-thunderer\n        [i.e. Zeus as the father of Epaphos].\"\n\nHesiod, Catalogues of Women Fragment 43 (from Philodemus on Piety 10) :\n        \"Nor let anyone mock at Hesiod who mentions . . . the Troglodytoi (Troglodytes) and the Pygmaioi\n        (Pygmies).\"\n\nAesop, Fables 294 (from Babrius 26) (trans. Gibbs) (Greek fable C6th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"There were some cranes who came to nibble at a field which a farmer had recently sown with wheat . . . The\n        farmer . . . began throwing rocks at the cranes, crippling a good many of them. As the cranes abandoned the\n        field they cried to one another, ‘Let's run away to the land of the Pygmaioi (Pygmies)!’\"\n\nAntoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 16 (trans. Celoria) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          : \n        \"Among the people we call Pygmaioi (Pygmies) there was born a girl called Oinoe (Oenoe) who was of flawless\n        beauty but she was graceless by nature and overweening. She cared not a rap for Artemis and Hera.\n        She was married to one of the citizens, Nikodamos (Nicodamus), a good and sensible man, and gave birth to a\n        child called Mopsos (Mopsus). And all the Pygmaioi, who loved to show kindliness, brought her many gifts to\n        celebrate the birth of the child. But Hera found fault with Oinoe for not honouring her and turned her into a\n        crane, elongated her neck, ordained that she should be a bird that flew high. She also caused war to arise\n        between her and the Pygmaioi.\n        Yearning for her child Mopsos, Oinoe flew over houses and would not go away. But all the Pygmaioi armed\n        themselves and chased her away. Because of this there arose a state of war then as well as now between the\n        Pygmaioi and the cranes.\"\n\nAelian, On Animals 15. 29 (trans. Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"As to the race of Pygmaioi (Pygmies) I have heard that they are governed in a manner peculiar to\n        themselves, and that in fact owing to the failure of the male line a certain woman became queen and ruled over\n        the Pygmaioi; her name was Gerana, and the Pygmaioi worshipped her as a god, paying her honours too august for a\n        human being. The result was, they say, that she became so puffed up in her mind that she held the goddesses of\n        no account. It was especially Hera, Athena, Artemis, and Aphrodite that, she said, came nowhere near her in\n        beauty. But she was not destined to escape the evil consequences of her diseased imagination. For in consequence\n        of the anger of Hera she changed her original form into that of a most hideous bird and became the crane of\n        today and wages war on the Pygmaioi because with their excessive honours they drove her to madness and to her\n        destruction.\"\n\nAelian, On Animals 3. 23 :\n        \"Alexandros (Alexander) of Myndos [Greek writer C1st A.D.] asserts that when they [the storks] reach old\n        age they pass to the island of Okeanos (Oceanus) and are transformed into human shape, and that this is a reward\n        for their filial piety towards their parents, since, if I am not mistaken, the gods especially desire to hold up\n        there if nowhere else a human model of piety and uprightness, for in no other country under the sun could such a\n        race continue to exist. This is in my opinion no fairy-tale, otherwise what was Alexandros' design in relating\n        such marvels when he had nothing to gain from it?\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 6. 90 (trans. Melville) (Roman poet C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Pygmaea (Pygmy) matron's doom, her pitiable doom, when Juno [Hera] won the contest and transformed her\n        to a crane and made her fight her folk, her kith and kin.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Elder, Imagines 2. 22 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] Herakles (Heracles) among\n        the Pygmaioi (Pygmies). While Herakles is asleep in Libya after conquering Antaios (Antaeus), the Pygmaioi set\n        upon him with the avowed intention of avenging Antaios; for they claim to be brothers of Antaios, high-spirited\n        fellows, not athletes, indeed, nor his equals at wrestling, but earth-born (gêgenes) and quite\n        strong besides, and when they come up out of the earth the sand billows in waves. For the Pygmaioi dwell in the\n        earth just like ants and store their provisions underground, and the food they eat is not the property of others\n        but their own and raised by themselves. For they sow and reap and ride on a cart drawn by pigmy horses, and it\n        said that they use an axe on stalks of grain, believing that these are trees. But ah, their boldness! Here they\n        are advancing against Herakles and undertaking to kill him in his sleep; though they would not fear him even if\n        he were awake. Meanwhile he sleeps on the soft sand, since weariness has crept over him in wrestling; and,\n        filled with sleep, his mouth open, he draws full breaths deep in his chest, and Hypnos (Sleep) himself stands\n        over him in visible form, making much, I think, of his own part in the fall of Herakles. Antaios also lies\n        there, but whereas art paints Herakles as alive and warm, it represents Antaios as dead and withered and\n        abandons him to Ge (Gaea, the Earth).\n        The army of the Pygmaioi envelops Herakles; while this one phalanx attacks his left hand, these other two\n        companies march against his right hand as being stronger; bowmen and a host of slingers lay siege to his feet,\n        amazed at the size of his shin; as for those who advance against his head, the Pygmaios (Pygmy) King has assumed\n        the command at this point, which they think will offer the stoutest resistance, and they bring engines of war to\n        bear against it as if it were a citadel--fire for his hair, mattocks for his eyes, doors of a sort for his\n        mouth, and these, I fancy, are gates to fasten on his nose, so that Herakles may not breathe when his head has\n        been captured. All these things are being done, to be sure, around the sleeping Herakles; but lo! he stands\n        erect and laughs at the danger, and sweeping together the hostile forces he puts them in his lion's skin, and I\n        suppose he is carrying them to Eurystheus.\"\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 7. 26 (trans. Rackham) (Roman encyclopedia C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"This tribe [the Pygmies] Homer has also recorded as being beset by cranes. It is reported that in\n        springtime their entire band, mounted on the backs of rams and she-goats and armed with arrows, goes in a body\n        down to the sea and eats the cranes' eggs and chickens, and that this outing occupies three months; and that\n        otherwise they could not protect themselves against the flocks of cranes would grow up; and that their houses\n        are made of mud and feathers and egg-shells.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 14. 33 ff (trans. Lind) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"Like Thrakian cranes, when they fly from the scourge of winter and floods of stormy rain to throw their\n        great flocks against the heads of Pygmaioi (Pygmies) round the waters of Tethys, and when with sharp beaks they\n        have destroyed that weak and helpless race, they wing their way like a cloud over the horn of Okeanos\n        (Oceanus).\"\n\nThe Pygmies were also described as an actual African tribe in various ancient geographical treatises.\n\nCtesias, Indica (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 72) (trans. Freese) (Greek\n          historian C4th B.C.) :\n        \"In the middle of India there are black men, called Pygmaioi (Pygmies), who speak the same language as the\n        other inhabitants of the country.

Their hair is very long, going down to the knees and even lower, and their beards are\n        larger than those of any other men. When their beards are full grown they leave off wearing clothes and let the\n        hair of their head fall down behind far below the knees, while their beard trails down to the feet in front.\n        When their body is thus entirely covered with hair they fasten it round them with a girdle, so that it serves\n        them for clothes. They are snubnosed and ugly. Their sheep are no bigger than lambs, their oxen, asses, horses,\n        mules, and other beasts of burden about the size of rams. Being very skilful archers, 3000 of them attend on the\n        king of India. They are very just and have the same laws as the Indians. They hunt the hare and the fox, not\n        with dogs, but with ravens, kites, crows, and eagles.\"\n\nPhilostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana 3. 45 - 47 (trans.
