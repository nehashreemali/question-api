  "content": "THE ARTABATITAI (Artabititae) were a tribe of four-legged African men who roved around on all fours like\n        animals. Their name was apparently derived from the Greek words artaô and bateô\n        which means something like \"depending on treading\"--a reference to their mode of locomotion.\n\nLike many other southern tribes they were probably derived from ancient traveller's accounts of apes or\n        monkeys.\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 6. 195 (trans. Rackham) (Roman encyclopedia C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Then come regions [in Africa] that are purely imaginary : towards the west [of the Ethiopian kingdom of\n        Meroe] are . . . the Artabatitae, who have four legs and rove about like wild animals.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
