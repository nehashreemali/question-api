  "content": "HYPERBOREA was a fabulous realm of eternal spring located in the far north beyond the home of the north wind.\n        Its people were a blessed, long-lived race untouched by war, hard toil and the ravages of old age and disease.\n\nHyperborea was usually described as a continent-bound land bordered on the north by the great, earth-encircling\n        river Okeanos (Oceanus), and on the south the peaks of the legendary\n        Rhipaion (Rhipaean) Mountains. Its main river was the Eridanos\n        whose banks were lined with amber-weeping poplar-trees and its waters home to flocks of white swans. Blessed\n        with eternal spring, the land producing two crops of grain per year, but most of the countryside was wild and\n        covered with beautiful forests--the so-called \"garden of Apollon.\"\n\nThe southern border of Hyperborea was guarded by the bitterly cold peaks of the impassable Rhipaion (Rhipaean)\n        mountains--home to Boreas (the North Wind) whose chill breath brought\n        winter to the lands of the south. Its peaks were inhabited by gold-guarding Grypes (Griffins) and its valleys by the fierce, one-eyed Arimaspoi tribe. Beneath the southern slopes lay Pterophoros--a desolate,\n        snow-covered land cursed with eternal winter.\n\nHyperborea was a theocracy ruled by three priests of the god Apollon.\n        These gigantic kings, known as the Boreades, were sons of\n        Boreas (the North Wind). Their capital contained a circular temple dedicated to the god where hecatombs (a\n        hundred-head) of asses were sacrificed in his honour. The people also celebrated their god in an eternal\n        festival of music, song and dance whose hymns were joined by the sweet song of the circling Hyperborean swans.\n\nThe realm plays a role in several myths. Phaethon tried to drive the\n        chariot of the sun but lost control and was struck down by Zeus, sending his flaming body plummeting into the\n        Hyperborean river Eridanos. His mourning sisters, the Heliades,\n        were afterwards transformed into amber-shedding poplar trees on its banks, and his grief-stricken friend Kyknos\n        (Cycnus) into a swan. Elderly Hyperboreans commemorated the event by leaping into the lake formed by Phaethon's\n        fall to be transformed into white swans.\n        Perseus later travelled to Hyperborea and was entertained by its folk when\n        he was searching for the Nymphs who guarded the treasures of the\n        gods, or else the Graiai--swan-bodied hags who could reveal the location of\n        Medousa.\n        Perseus' descendant Herakles made the same journey on two separate occassions. The first time was in his quest\n        for the golden-horned deer of Artemis which fled north during the\n        chase. The second time he sought Atlas and the golden apples of Hesperides.\n\nAnother body of stories describes Hyperboreans as pilgrim-founders of several important Greek shrines. The\n        Delians told a tale of how the pregnant goddess Leto came to the island\n        from Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves where she gave birth to Apollon with the assistance of\n        Eileithyia who was summoned from the northern realm to further the labour.\n        After this event, the Hyperboreans sent pilgrims to the island--five men and several maiden-priestesses.\n        However, after several of the maidens were either raped or\n        killed, the Hyperboreans ended the pilgrimage and instead delivered their offerings indirectly through\n        neighbouring tribes and peoples.\n        The next major shrine connected with the Hyperboreans was the oracle of Apollon at Delphoi. The second of the\n        early, mythical temples of the shrine was said to have been built by Hyperborean pilgrims out of beeswax and\n        feathers. When the army of the Gauls tried to seize the temple in historical times, phantoms of these prophets\n        were said to have appeared on the battlefield, routing the army.\n        Finally they appear in the myths of the founding of the Olympic Games. It was said that when Herakles--either\n        the Daktylos or the son of Zeus--established the festival in\n        honour of Zeus he made a pilgrimage to Hyperborea to obtain sacred wild olives for the shrine.\n        The most famous prophet of the Hyperboreans was probably Abaris who was given a magical arrow by the god Apollon\n        on which he flew around the world performing miracles. Some say this arrow was the one which Apollon had used to\n        slay the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) which had been hidden beneath a Hyperborean\n        mountain.\n\nHuman tribe descended from GAIA (Hesiod\n          Catalogues Frag 40A)\n\nHesiod, Catalogues of Women Fragment 40a (from Oxyrhynchus Papyri 1358 fr. 2) (trans.\n          Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.) :\n        \"[The winged Boreades pursued the Harpyiai (Harpies) around the world :] Round about all these [the\n        Boreades] sped in darting flight . .

Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[The captain of the Tyrrhenian pirates who captured the god Dionysos speaks :] ‘As for this fellow\n        we men will see to him: I reckon he is bound for Aigyptos (Egypt) or for Kypros (Cyprus) or to the Hyperboreans\n        or further still.’\"\n\nPindar, Pindar Pythian Ode 10. 27 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Of the fairest glories that mortals may attain, to him is given to sail to the furthest bound. Yet neither\n        ship nor marching feet may find the wondrous way to the gatherings of the Hyperborean people.\n        Yet was it with these that Perseus the warrior chief once feasted, entering their homes, and chanced upon their\n        sacrifices unto the god, those famous offerings of hecatombs of asses; for in their banquets and rich praise\n        Apollon greatly delights, and laughs to see the rampant lewdness of those brutish beasts.\n        Nor is the Mousa (Muse) a stranger to their life, but on all sides the feet of maidens dancing, the full tones\n        of the lyre and pealing flutes are all astir; with leaves of gleaming laurel bound upon their hair, they throng\n        with happy hearts to join the revel. Illness and wasting old age visit not this hallowed race, but far from toil\n        and battle they dwell secure from fate's remorseless vengeance.\n        There with the breath of courage in his heart, unto that gathering of happy men, by guidance of Athene, came\n        long ago the son of Danaë, Perseus, who slew the Gorgo [i.e. Medousa].\"\n\nPindar, Pindar, Olympian Ode 3. 12 ff :\n        \"[The Olympic Games] rites long years ago established by Herakles (Heracles), set on his brow aloft that\n        shining glory, wreathed upon his hair, of the green olive leaf; which once from Istros' (Ister's) [i.e. the\n        river Danube] shady streams Amphitryon's son brought hither, to be the fairest emblem of Olympia's Games.\n        For the Hyperborean folk, Apollon's servants, he so persuaded with fair words, when, for the all-hospitable\n        grove of Zeus, his loyal heart begged for the tree, to make shade for all men to share, and for brave deeds of\n        valorous spirits, a crown. For he had seen long since his father's [Zeus'] altars sanctified, and the light of\n        evening smiling at mid-month to the golden care of the full-orbèd moon; and of the great Games had set up\n        the contest and sacred judgment, with the rites of the four-yearly feast, on the high banks of Alpheios'\n        (Alpheus') holy river. But the land of Pelops, and the vales by Kronos' (Cronus') hill nourished no lovely\n        trees, and his eyes saw a garden spread defenceless beneath the fierce rays of the sun.\n        Then at length did his heart bid him be one, to journey to the land of Istria, where, long since, Leto's\n        daughter [Artemis], lover of horsemanship, received him. For he came from Arkadia's high peaks and winding\n        glens, by constraint of his father, to perform the bidding of Eurystheus, and bring back the Hind of the golden\n        horns . . . And in that search he saw, too, the famed land that lay behind cold Boreas (the North Wind) of bleak\n        and frozen breath; and standing there marvelled to see the trees. And in his heart a dear resolve was born, to\n        set them planted there, where ends the course twelve times encircled by the racing steeds.\"\n\nAeschylus, Libation Bearers 372 ff (trans. Weir Smyth) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"Your wish is better than gold. It surpasses great good fortune, even that of the Hyperboreans.\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 4. 13. 1 (trans. Godley) (Greek historian C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"There is also a story related in a poem by Aristeas [Greek poet C7th B.C.] son of Kaüstrobios, a man\n        of Prokonnesos. This Aristeas, possessed by Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon], visited the Issedones; beyond these (he\n        said) live the one-eyed Arimaspians, beyond whom are the Grypes (Griffins) that guard gold, and beyond these\n        again the Hyperboreans, whose territory reaches to the sea. Except for the Hyperboreans, all these nations (and\n        first the Arimaspians) are always at war with their neighbors; the Issedones were pushed from their lands by the\n        Arimaspoi (Arimaspians), and the Skythians (Scythians) by the Issedones, and the Kimmeroi (Cimmerians), living\n        by the southern sea, were hard pressed by the Skythians and left their country. Thus Aristeas' story does not\n        agree with the Skythian account about this country.\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 4. 32 - 36 :\n        \"Concerning the Hyperborean people, neither the Skythians (Scythians) nor any other inhabitants of these\n        lands tell us anything, except perhaps the Issedones. And, I think, even they say nothing; for if they did, then\n        the Skythians, too, would have told, just as they tell of the one-eyed men. But Hesiod speaks of Hyperboreans,\n        and Homer too in his poem The Epigonoi, if that is truly the work of Homer.\n        But the Delians say much more about them than any others do. They say that offerings wrapped in straw are\n        brought from the Hyperboreans to Skythia; when these have passed Skythia, each nation in turn receives them from\n        its neighbors until they are carried to the Adriatic sea, which is the most westerly limit of their journey;\n        from there, they are brought on to the south, the people of Dodona being the first Greeks to receive them. From\n        Dodona they come down to the Melian gulf, and are carried across to Euboia (Euboea), and one city sends them on\n        to another until they come to Karystos (Carystus); after this, Andros is left out of their journey, for\n        Karystians carry them to Tenos, and Tenians to Delos.Thus (they say) these offerings come to Delos.\n        But on the first journey, the Hyperboreans sent two maidens bearing the offerings, to whom the Delians give the\n        names Hyperokhe (Hyperoche) and Laodike (Laodice), and five men of their people with them as escort for safe\n        conduct, those who are now called Perpherees and greatly honored at Delos. But when those whom they sent never\n        returned, they took it amiss that they should be condemned always to be sending people and not getting them\n        back, and so they carry the offerings, wrapped in straw, to their borders, and tell their neighbors to send them\n        on from their own country to the next; and the offerings, it is said, come by this conveyance to Delos. I can\n        say of my own knowledge that there is a custom like these offerings; namely, that when the Thrakian (Thracian)\n        and Paionian (Paeonian) women sacrifice to the Royal Artemis, they have straw with them while they sacrifice.\n        \n        I know that they do this. The Delian girls and boys cut their hair in honor of these Hyperborean maidens, who\n        died at Delos; the girls before their marriage cut off a tress and lay it on the tomb, wound around a spindle\n        (this tomb is at the foot of an olive-tree, on the left hand of the entrance of the temple of Artemis); the\n        Delian boys twine some of their hair around a green stalk, and lay it on the tomb likewise.\n        In this way, then, these maidens are honored by the inhabitants of Delos. These same Delians relate that two\n        virgins, Arge and Opis, came from the Hyperboreans by way of the aforesaid peoples to Delos earlier than\n        Hyperokhe and Laodike; these latter came to bring to Eileithyia [i.e. Artemis] the tribute which they had agreed\n        to pay for easing child-bearing; but Arge and Opis, they say, came with the gods themselves [i.e. Apollon and\n        Artemis], and received honors of their own from the Delians. For the women collected gifts for them, calling\n        upon their names in the hymn made for them by Olen of Lykia (Lycia0; it was from Delos that the islanders and\n        Ionians learned to sing hymns to Opis and Arge, calling upon their names and collecting gifts (this Olen, after\n        coming from Lycia, also made the other and ancient hymns that are sung at Delos). Furthermore, they say that\n        when the thighbones are burnt in sacrifice on the altar, the ashes are all cast on the burial-place of Opis and\n        Arge, behind the temple of Artemis, looking east, nearest the refectory of the people of Keos. \n        I have said this much of the Hyperboreans, and let it suffice; for I do not tell the story of that Abaris,\n        alleged to be a Hyperborean, who carried the arrow over the whole world, fasting all the while. But if there are\n        men beyond the north wind (Boreas), then there are others beyond the south. And I laugh to see how many have\n        before now drawn maps of the world, not one of them reasonably; for they draw the world as round as if fashioned\n        by compasses, encircled by the Okeanos (Oceanus) river, and Asia and Europe of a like extent. For myself, I will\n        in a few words indicate the extent of the two, and how each should be drawn.\"\n\nPlato, Charmides 158c (trans. Lamb) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :\n        \"[If] you are sufficiently temperate, then you never had any need of the charms of Zalmoxis or of Abaris\n        the Hyperborean, and might well be given at once the remedy for the head; but if you prove to be still lacking\n        that virtue, we must apply the charm before the remedy.\" [N.B. Abaris was a fabulous prophet from the far\n        north, to whom oracles and charms were ascribed by the Greeks. Cf. Herodotus 4.36.]\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 27 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Artemis shot him [the giant Orion] as he was forcing his attention on Oupis (Opis), a\n        virgin who had come from the Hyperboreans.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 114 :\n        \"[The golden apples of the Hesperides :] These apples were not, as some maintain, in Libya, but rather were with\n        Atlas among the Hyperboreans. Ge (Gaea, the Earth) had given them to Zeus when he married Hera.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 119 :\n        \"Prometheus advised Herakles not to go after the apples [of the Hesperides] himself, but rather to relieve Atlas\n        of the celestial sphere and dispatch him. So when Herakles reached Atlas among the Hyperboreans, he remembered\n        Prometheus' advise and took over the sphere. Atlas picked three apples from the garden of the Hesperides, then\n        returned to Herakles.\" [N.B. In this passage Atlas holds the heavens aloft in Hyperborea beneath the northern\n        axis around which the stars revolve. Usually he is located in Hesperia in the west.]\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 674 ff (trans. Seaton) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And to them [Apollon] the son of Leto appeared, as he passed from Lykia (Lycia) far away to the countless\n        folk of the Hyperboreans; and about his cheeks on both sides his golden locks flowed in clusters as he\n        moved.\"\n\nApollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 594 ff :\n        \"[On their return voyage to Greece from Kolkhis (Colchis) on the Black Sea the Argonauts sail through the\n        mythically interconnected rivers of Hyperborea :] Far on sped Argo under sail, and entered deep into the stream\n        of Eridanos (Eridanus); where once, smitten on the breast by the blazing bolt, Phaethon half-consumed fell from\n        the chariot of Helios (the Sun) into the opening of that deep lake; and even now it belcheth up heavy steam\n        clouds from the smouldering wound. And no bird spreading its light wings can cross that water; but in mid-course\n        it plunges into the flame, fluttering. And all around the maidens [the Heliades], the daughters of Helios,\n        enclosed in tall poplars, wretchedly wail a piteous plaint; and from their eyes they shed on the ground bright\n        drops of amber. These are dried by the sun upon the sand; but whenever the waters of the dark lake flow over the\n        strand before the blast of the wailing wind, then they roll on in a mass into Eridanos with swelling tide. But\n        the Keltoi (Celts) have attached this story to them, that these are the tears of Leto's son, Apollon, that are\n        borne along by the eddies, the countless tears that he shed aforetime when he came to the sacred race of the\n        Hyperboreans and left shining heaven at the chiding of his father [Zeus], being in wrath concerning his son\n        [Asklepios (Asclepius)] whom divine Koronis (Coronis) bare in bright Lakereia (Lacerea) at the mouth of Amyros.\n        And such is the story told among these men. But no desire for food or drink seized the heroes nor were their\n        thoughts turned to joy. But they were sorely afflicted all day, heavy and faint at heart, with the noisome\n        stench, hard to endure, which the streams of Eridanos sent forth from Phaethon still burning; and at night they\n        heard the piercing lament of the Heliades (daughters of Helios), wailing with shrill voice; and, as they\n        lamented, their tears were borne on the water like drops of oil.\n        Thence they entered the deep stream of Rhodanos [the river Rhone] which flows into Eridanos; and where they meet\n        there is a roar of mingling waters. Now that river, rising from the ends of the earth, where are the portals and\n        mansions of Nyx (Night), on one side bursts forth upon the beach of Okeanos (Oceanus), at another pours into the\n        Ionian sea, and on the third through seven mouths sends its stream to the Sardinian sea and its limitless bay.\n        And from Rhodanos they entered stormy lakes, which spread throughout the Celtic mainland of wondrous size; and\n        there they would have met with an inglorious calamity; for a certain branch of the river was bearing them\n        towards a gulf of Okeanos.\"\n        [N.B. The Hyperborean river Eridanos flowed directly from the earth-encircling, fresh-water Okeanos-stream.]\n\nCallimachus, Hymn 4 to Delos 275 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"Thou [Delos] art famed as the most holy of islands, nurse of Apollon's youth. On thee treads not Enyo nor\n        Haides nor the horses of Ares; but every year tithes of first-fruits are sent to thee : to thee all cities lead\n        up choirs, both those cities which have cast their lots toward the East and those toward the West and those in\n        the South, and the Hyperboreans--peoples which have their homes above the northern shore--, a very long-lived\n        race. These first bring thee cornstalks and holy sheaves of corn-ears, which the Pelasgians of Dodona [i.e. the\n        famous oracle of Zeus] . . . first receive, as these offerings enter their country from afar. Next they come to\n        the Holy town and mountains of the Malian land; and thence they sail across to the goodly Lelantian plain of the\n        Abantes [i.e. the island of Euboia (Euboea)]; and then not long is the voyage from Euboia, since thy havens are\n        nigh thereto. The first to bring thee these offerings from the fair-haired Arimaspoi were Oupis (Opis) and Loxo\n        and happy Hekaerge (Hecaerge), daughters of Boreas (the North Wind), and those who then were the best of the\n        young men. And they returned no home again, but a happy fate was theirs, and they shall never be without their\n        glory. Verily the girls of Delos, when the sweet-sounded marriage hymn affrights the maidens' quarters, bring\n        offerings of their maiden hair to the maidens, while the boys offer to the young men the first harvest of the\n        down upon their cheeks.\"\n\nCallimachus, Fragment 187 (from Clement Protrept. 25) (trans. Trypanis) (Greek poet\n          C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon] visits the Hyperborean sacrifices of asses.\"\n\nCallimachus, Fragment 187 (from Scholiast on Pindar's Pythian 10. 49) :\n        \"Fat sacrifices of asses delight Phoibos (Phoebus).\"\n\nCallimachus, Fragment 215 (from Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius 4. 284) :\n        \"They [the Hyperboreans] send [offerings to Apollon at Delos] from the Rhipaion (Rhipaean) Mountains.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 2. 47. 1 - 6 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek\n          historian C1st B.C.) :\n        \"Since we have seen fit to make mention of the regions of Asia which lie to the north, we feel that it will\n        not be foreign to our purpose to discuss the legendary accounts of the Hyperboreans. Of those who have written\n        about the ancient myths, Hekataios (Hecataeus) [Greek philosopher C4th B.C.] and certain others say that in the\n        regions beyond the land of the Keltoi (Celts) there lies in Okeanos (Oceanus) an island no smaller than Sikelia\n        (Sicily). This island, the account continues, is situated in the north and is inhabited by the Hyperboreans, who\n        are called by that name because their home is beyond the point whence the north wind (Boreas) blows; and the\n        island is both fertile and productive of every crop, and since it has an unusually temperate climate it produces\n        two harvests each year.\n        Moreover, the following legend is told concerning it: Leto was born on this island, and for that reason Apollon\n        is honoured among them above all other gods; and the inhabitants are looked upon as priests of Apollon, after a\n        manner, since daily they praise this god continuously in song and honour him exceedingly. And there is also on\n        the island both a magnificent sacred precinct of Apollon and a notable temple which is adorned with many votive\n        offerings and is spherical in shape. Furthermore, a city is there which is sacred to this god, and the majority\n        of its inhabitants are players on the cithara; and these continually play on this instrument in the temple and\n        sing hymns of praise to the god, glorifying his deeds.\n        The Hyperboreans also have a language, we are informed, which is peculiar to them, and are most friendly\n        disposed towards the Greeks, and especially towards the Athenians and the Delians, who have inherited this\n        good-will from most ancient times. The myth also relates that certain Greeks visited the Hyperboreans and left\n        behind them there costly votive offerings bearing inscriptions in Greek letters. And in the same way, Abaris, a\n        Hyperborean, came to Greece in ancient times and renewed the goodwill and kinship of his people to the\n        Delians.\n        They say also that the moon, as viewed from this island appears to be but a little distance from the earth and\n        to have upon it prominences, like those of the earth, which are visible to the eye. The account is also given\n        that the god visits the island every nineteen years, the period in which the return of the stars to the same\n        place in the heavens is accomplished; and for this reason the nineteen-year period is called by the Greeks the\n        ‘year of Meton.’ At the time of this appearance of the god he both plays on the cithara and dances\n        continuously the night through from the vernal equinox until the rising of the [constellation] Pleiades,\n        expressing in this manner his delight in his successes.

Then come the Ripaean\n        Mountains [probably the Carpathians] and the region called Peterophorus (‘wing-bringers’), because\n        of the feather-like snow continually falling there; it is a part of the world that lies under the condemnation\n        of nature and is plunged in dense darkness, and occupied only by the work of frost and the chilly lurking-places\n        of Aquilo (the North Wind) [Boreas]. Behind these mountains and beyond Aquilo there dwells--if we can believe\n        it--a happy race of people called the Hyperboreans, who live to extreme old age and are famous for legendary\n        marvels. Here are believed to be the hinges on which the firmament turns and the extreme revolutions of the\n        stars, with six months' daylight and a single day of the sun in retirement, not as the ignorant have said, from\n        the spring equinox till autumn: for these people the sun rises once in the year, at midsummer, and sets once, at\n        midwinter. It is a genial region, with a delightful climate and exempt from every harmful blast. The homes of\n        the natives are the woods and groves; they worship the gods severally and in congregations; all discord and all\n        sorrow is unknown. Death comes to them only when, owing to the satiety of life, after holding a banquet and\n        anointing their old age with luxury, they leap from a certain rock into the sea: this mode of burial is the most\n        blissful. Some authorities have placed these people not in Europe but on the nearest part of the coasts of Asia,\n        because there is a race there with similar customs and a similar location, named the Attaci; others have put\n        them midway between the two suns, the sunsets of the antipodes and our sunrise, but this is quite impossible\n        because of the enormous expanse of sea that comes between. Those who locate them merely in a region having six\n        months of daylight have recorded that they sow in the morning periods, reap at midday, pluck the fruit from the\n        trees at sunset, and retire into caves for the night. Nor is it possible to doubt about this race, as so may\n        authorities state that they regularly send the first fruits of their harvests to Delos as offerings to Apollo,\n        whom they specially worship. These offerings used to be brought by virgins, who for many years were held in\n        veneration and hospitably entertained by the nations on the route, until because of a violation of good faith\n        they instituted the custom of depositing their offerings at the nearest frontiers of the neighbouring people,\n        and these of passing them on to their neighbours, and so till they finally reached Delos. Later this practice\n        itself also passed out of use.\"\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 6. 34 :\n        \"From the extreme north-north-east to the northernmost point at which the sun rises in summer there are the\n        Scythians, and outside of them and beyond the point where north-north-east begins some have placed the\n        Hyperboreans, who are said by a majority of authorities to be in Europe.
