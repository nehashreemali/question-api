  "content": "THE PANOTIOI (Panotii) were a tribe giant-eared men native to the cold islands of the far north who slept\n        snuggled up inside the flaps of their gigantic ears. According to some they also used these wing-like appendages\n        to fly.\n\nAnother tribe of giant-eared men were the similarly named Pandai of India.\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 4. 94 (trans. Rackham) (Roman encyclopedia C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Crossing the Ripaean Mountains [probably the Carpathians in central Europe] must coast to the left along\n        the shore of the northern ocean until we reach Gadis. In this direction a number of islands are reported to\n        exist [perhaps in the Baltic Sea] . . . [and] the Hippopodes on which people are born with horses' feet, which\n        gives them their Greek name; there are others called the Panotiorum (All-Ears Islands) in which the natives have\n        very large ears covering the whole of their bodies, which are otherwise left naked.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
