  "content": "THE MANDOI (Mandi) were a short-lived tribe of Indian men who grew old and wrinkled almost as soon as they were\n        born. They lived on a diet of locusts.\n\nMandi was an historical kingdom located in the foothills of the Himalayas. The ancient account, however, is\n        entirely fanciful.\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 7. 24 (trans. Rackham) (Roman encyclopedia C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Ctesias [Greek historian C5th B.C.] writes that also among a certain race of India the women bear children\n        only once in their life time, and that the children begin to turn grey directly after birth.\" [N.B. The\n        Greek phrase \"to turn grey\" means become old and wrinked.]\n\nPliny the Elder, Natural History 7. 28 :\n        \"Crates of Pergamenus [Greek scholar C2nd B.C.] tells of Indians who . . . do not exceed forty years, this\n        tribe adjoining the Macrobi (Long-Livers), whose women bear children only once. Agatharchides records this as\n        well, and also that they live on locusts, and are very swift-footed. Clitarchus [Greek historian C3rd B.C.] gave\n        them the name of Mandi; and Megasthenes [Greek historian C4th B.C.] also assigns them three hundred village, and\n        says that the women bear children at age of seven and old age comes at forty.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
