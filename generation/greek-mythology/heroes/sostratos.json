  "content": "SOSTRATOS (Sostratus) was a youth of the Akhaian (Achaean) town of Dyme loved by Herakles. He died young and\n        was interred by the hero outside the town.\n\nSostratos' name means \"Saviour of the Army\" from the Greek words sôzô and\n        stratos. It suggests he was somehow connected with the story of Herakles' war against King Augeias of Elis. Strabo mentions Herakles' was allied with the Epeians of Dyme in this\n        conflict.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 7. 17. 8 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"A little before the city of Dyme [in western Akhaia (Achaea)] there is, on the right of the road, the\n        grave of Sostratos (Sostratus). He was a native youth, loved they say by Herakles, who outliving Sostratos made\n        him his tomb and gave him some hair from his head as a primal offering. Even today there is a slab on the top of\n        the mound, with a figure of Herakles in relief. I was told that the natives also sacrifice to Sostratos as to a\n        hero.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 8. 3. 9 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Hekataios (Hecataeus) of Miletos [Greek historian C5th B.C.] says that the Epeians are a different people\n        from the Eleians; that, at any rate, the Epeians joined Herakles in his expedition against Augeas and helped him\n        to destroy both Augeas and Elis. And he says, further, that Dyme is an Epeian and an Akhaian (Achaean) city . .\n        . Although the poet [Homer] has not named Dyme, it is not unreasonable to suppose that in his time Dyme belonged\n        to the Epeians, and later to the Ionians, or, if not to them, at all events to the Akhaians who took possession\n        of their country.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
