  "content": "ENDYMION was a handsome shepherd-prince loved by the moon-goddess Selene.\n        When Zeus offered him his choice of destinies, Endymion chose immortality\n        and youth in eternal slumber. He was laid out in a cave on Mount Latmus in Karia (Caria) where his lunar lover\n        would visit him each night.\n\nIn another myth--which contradicts the first--Endymion was a king of Elis in the Greek Peloponesse who founded\n        the kingdom with a group of Aiolian (Aeolian) colonists from Thessalia (Thessaly). Zeus granted him\n        foreknowledge of his own death and, when his time had come, he set up a racecourse at Olympia and commanded his\n        sons compete for the throne. Endymion was afterwards entombed beside the starting gate.\n\nThe Eleian myths about King Endymion belong to the Greek tradition. The stories of the sleeping prince of Mount\n        Latmos in Anatolia, on the other hand, were apparently a Greek translation of stories concerning the indigenous\n        Karian moon-god Men--the Karians were a non-Greek people native to that region of Asia Minor. As the Greek\n        moon-deity was female, the story was amended somewhat.\n\nOf the three Eleian sons of Endymion, Epeios (Epeus) won the race for the throne and was crowned king of Elis.\n        The second son Paion (Paeon) departed with colonists and settled the region of Paionia, north of Mount Olympos.\n        The third son Aitolos (Aetolus) was exiled for the murder of Apis and established the kingdom of Aitolia\n        (Aetolia) on the opposite side of the Gulf of Korinthos. \n        During the reign of King Epeios, the Lydian immigrant Pelops seized control of Pisa and came to dominate most of\n        the Peloponessos. Epeios passed away childless and left the throne to his adoptive son and nephew Eleios\n        (Eleus)--son of Endymion's daughter Eurykyda (Eurycyda) by the god Poseidon. This man in turn fathered Augeias\n        (Augeas), the famous Eleian king who cheated Herakles out of his reward for cleaning the stables. Two of\n        Augeias' grandchildren eventually went on to lead troops from Elis and the neighbouring island of Doulichion\n        (now Zacynthus) to the Trojan War.\n\nIn the chronology of myth, Endymion was a contemporary of Salmoneus, Sisyphos and\n        the other sons of Aiolos (Aeolus)--who were, in fact, his uncles. When the family colonised the Peloponessos,\n        Endymion settled the lands north of the river Alpheios, and Salmoneus the lands south.\n        Endymion was a great-grandson of Deukalion (Deucalion), survivor of the Great\n        Deluge. His father was Aithlios, probably the eponymous king of the Thessalian Aithikes, a tribe of the Pindar\n        mountain range.\n        His grandson Augeias ruled Elis in the time of Herakles, while his descendants--mostly\n        great-great grandchildren--led the troops of Elis, Doulikhion, Aitolia, and Argos in the Trojan War. The most\n        famous of these was Diomedes, a direct patrilineal descendant.\n\n[1.1] AETHLIOS & KALYKE (Hesiod Catalogues Frag 8, Apollodorus 1.56)\n        [1.2] AETHLIOS (Pausanias 5.1.3)\n        [1.2] AITOLOS (Hyginus Fabulae 271)\n        [1.2] ZEUS & KALYKE (Apollodorus 1.56)\n        [2.1] ZEUS & PHOINISSA (Clement\n          Recognitions 10.21)\n\n[1.1] AITOLOS (by a Naias or Iphianassa) (Apollodorus 1.56, Strabo\n          10.3.2)\n        [1.2] AITOLOS, PAION, EPEIOS, EURYKYDA (by Asterodeia, Khromia or Hyperippe) (Pausanias 5.1.4)\n        [2.1] THE MENAI (by Selene) (Pausanias 5.1.4)\n        [3.1] NARKISSOS (by Selene) (Nonnus Dionysiaca 48.582)\n\nENDYMION (Endumiôn), a youth distinguished for his beauty, and renowned in ancient story by the perpetual\n        sleep in which he spent his life. Some traditions about Endymion refer us to Elis, and others to Caria, and\n        others again are a combination of the two. According to the first set of legends, he was a son of Aëthlius\n        and Calyce, or of Zeus and Calyce, and succeeded Aëthlius in the kingdom of Elis. (Paus. v. 1. § 2.)\n        Others again say that he expelled Clymenus from the kingdom of Elis, and introduced into the country Aeolian\n        settlers from Thessaly. (Apollod. i. 7. § 5, &c. ; Paus. v. 8. § 1.) Conon (Narrat 14)\n        calls him a son of Zeus and Protogeneia, and Hyginus (Fab. 271) a son of Aetolus. He is said to have\n        been married to Asterodia, Chromia, Hyperippe, Neïs, or Iphianassa; and Aetolus, Paeon, Epeius. Eurydice,\n        and Naxus are called his children. He was, however, especially beloved by Selene, by whom he had fifty\n        daughters. (Paus. v. 1. § 2.) He caused his sons to engage in the race-course at Olympia, and promised to\n        the victor the succession in his kingdom, and Epeius conquered his brothers, and succeeded Endymion as king of\n        Elis. He was believed to be buried at Olympia, which also contained a statue of his in the treasury of the\n        Metapontians. (Paus. vi. 19. § 8, 20. § 6.) According to a tradition, believed at Heracleia in Caria,\n        Endymion had come from Elis to mount Latmus in Caria, whence he is called the Latmian (Latmius ; Paus.\n        v. 1. § 4; Ov. Ars Am. iii. 83, Trist. ii. 299). He is described by the poets either as a\n        king, a shepherd, or a hunter (Theocrit. iii. 49, xx. 37 with the Scholiast), and while he was slumbering in a\n        cave of mount Latmus, Selene came down to him, kissed, and lay by his side. (Comp. Apollon. Rhod. iv. 57.) There\n        also he had, in later times, a sanctuary, and his tomb was shown in a cave of mount Latmus. (Paus. v. 1. §\n        4 ; Strab. xiv. p. 636.) His eternal sleep on Latmus is assigned to different causes in ancient story. Some said\n        that Zeus had granted him a request, and that Endymion begged for immortality, eternal sleep, and everlasting\n        youth (Apollod. i. 7. § 5.); others relate that he was received among the gods of Olympus, but as he there\n        fell in love with Hera, Zeus, in his anger, punished him by throwing him into eternal sleep on mount Latmus.\n        (Schol. ad Theocrit. iii. 49.) Others, lastly, state that Selene, charmed with his surpassing beauty,\n        sent him to sleep, that she might be able to kiss him without being observed by him. (Cic. Tuscal. i.\n        38.) The stories of the fair sleeper, Endymion, the darling of Selene, are unquestionably poetical fictions, in\n        which sleep is personified. His name and all his attributes confirm this opinion : Endymion signifies a being\n        that gently comes over one ; he is called a king, because he has power over all living creatures; a shepherd,\n        because he slumbered in the cool caves of mount Latmus, that is, \"the mount of oblivion.\" Nothing can be more\n        beautiful, lastly, than the notion, that he is kissed by the soft rays of the moon. (Comp. Plat. Phaed.\n        p. 72. b; Ov. Am. i. 13. 43.) There is a beautiful statue of a sleeping Endymion in the British Museum.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nHesiod, Catalogues of Women Fragment 8 (from Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodes, Arg. 4.\n          57) (trans.

And he cites as evidence of all this two inscriptions, the one at Therma in Aitolia (where it is\n        their ancestral custom to hold their elections of magistrates), engraved on the base of the statue of Aitolos\n        :--‘Founder of the country, once reared beside the eddies of the Alpheios (Alpheus), neighbor of the\n        race-courses of Olympia, son of Endymion, this Aitolos has been set up by the Aitolians as a memorial of his\n        valor to behold.’ . . . When Aitolos arrived from Elis and overpowered the Kouretes in war, they withdrew\n        into Akarnania . . . And this is evidenced also by the inscription among the Eleians, for Aitolos, it says,\n        ‘through many a toil with the spear took possession of the land of Kouretis.’\" [N.B. The\n        Kouretes were an AItolian tribe, not to be confused with the protectors of the infant Zeus.]\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 1. 3 - 9 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The Eleians we know crossed over from Kalydon (Calydon) and Aitolia (Aetolia) generally. Their earlier\n        history I found to be as follows. The first to rule in this land, they say, was Aethlios (Aethlius), who was the\n        son of Zeus and of Protogeneia, the daughter of Deukalion (Deucalion), and the father of Endymion.\n        Selene (the Moon), they say, fell in love with this Endymion and bore him fifty daughters. Others with greater\n        probability say that Endymion took a wife Asterodia--others say she was Khromia (Chromia), the daughter of\n        Itonos (Itonus), the son of Amphiktyon; others again, Hyperippe, the daughter of Arkas (Arcas)--but all agree\n        that Endymion begat Paion (Paeon), Epeios (Epeus), Aitolos (Aetolus), and also a daughter Eurykyda (Eurycyda).\n        Endymion set his sons to run a race at Olympia for the throne; Epeios won, and obtained the kingdom, and his\n        subjects were then named Epeians for the first time.\n        Of his brothers they say that Aitolos remained at home, while Paion, vexed at his defeat, went into the farthest\n        exile possible, and that the region beyond the river Axios was named after him Paionia (Paeonia). As to the\n        death of Endymion, the people of Herakleia (Heraclea) near Miletos do not agree with the Eleians for while the\n        Eleians show a tomb of Endymion, the folk of Herakleia say that he retired to Mount Latmos (Latmus) and give him\n        honor, there being a shrine of Endymion on Latmos.\n        Epeios married Anaxiroe, the daughter of Koronos (Coronus), and begat a daughter Hyrmina, but no male issue. In\n        the reign of Epeios the following events also occurred. Oinomaos (Oenomaus) was the son of Alxion . . . but\n        while lord of the land of Pisa he was put down by Pelops the Lydian, who crossed over from Asia. On the death of\n        Oinomaos, Pelops took possession of the land of Pisa and its bordering country Olympia, separating it from the\n        land of Epeios . . .\n        Aitolos, who came to the throne after Epeios, was made to flee from Peloponnesos, because the children of Apis\n        tried and convicted him of unintentional homicide. For Apis, the son of Jason, from Pallantion in Arkadia, was\n        run over and killed by the chariot of Aitolos at the games held in honor of Azan. Aitolos, son of Endymion, gave\n        to the dwellers around the Akheloios (Achelous) their name, when he fled to this part of the mainland.\n        But the kingdom of the Epeians fell to Eleios, the son of Eurykyda, daughter of Endymion and, believe the tale\n        who will, of Poseidon. It was Eleios who gave the inhabitants their present name of Eleians in place of Epeians.\n        Eleios had a son Augeas. Those who exaggerate his glory give a turn to the name Eleios and make Helios (the Sun)\n        to be the father of Augeas.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 8. 2 :\n        \"And about a generation later than Endymion, Pelops held the games in honor of Zeus Olympios (Olympian) in\n        a more splendid manner than any of his predecessors. When the sons of Pelops were scattered from Elis over all\n        the rest of Peloponnesos, Amythaon, the son of Kretheus (Cretheus), and cousin of Endymion on his father's\n        side--for they say that Aethlios too was the son of Aiolos (Aeolus), though supposed to be a son of Zeus--, held\n        the Olympian games.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 6. 19. 11 :\n        \"[Amongst the offerings dedicated at Olympia :] In the treasury of the Metapontines, which adjoins that of\n        the Selinountians, stands an Endymion; it too is of ivory except the drapery.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 6. 20. 9 :\n        \"[At Oympia site of the Olympic Games :] At the end of the stadium, where is the starting-place for the\n        runners, there is, the Eleans say, the tomb of Endymion.\"\n        [Cf.

Fairclough) (Roman bucolic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"‘Twas with gift of such snowy wool, if we may trust the tale, that Pan, Arcadia's god, charmed and\n        beguiled you, O Luna (the Moon) [Selene], calling you to the depths of the woods; nor did you scorn his\n        call.\"\n        [N.B. Virgil is probably alluding to the story of Selene's seduction by the shepherd Endymion. The name Pan is\n        likely employed metaphorically, i.e. the god of the flocks was the symbolic source of the fine fleece Endymion\n        used to entice the goddess. A vase painting depicts Endymion waving such a fleece before her chariot.]\n\nPropertius, Elegies 2. 15 (trans. Goold) (Roman elegy C1st B.C.) :\n        \"It was naked that Endymion enraptured Phoebus's sister [Luna-Selene] and naked, they say, lay with the\n        goddess.\"\n\nSeneca, Phaedra 309 ff (trans. Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) :\n        \"The radiant goddess [Luna-Selene the Moon] of the darksome sky burned with love [for Endymion] and,\n        forsaking the night, gave her gleaming chariot to her brother [Helios the sun] to guide in fashion other than\n        his own. He learned to drive the team of night and to wheel in narrower circuit, while the axle groaned beneath\n        the car's heavier weight; nor did the nights keep their accustomed length, and with belated dawning came the\n        day.\"\n\nSeneca, Phaedra 422 ff :\n        \"May no shepherd [i.e. Endymion] make boast o'er thee [Luna-Selene the Moon].\"\n\nSeneca, Phaedra 786 ff :\n        \"Looking down on thee from the starry heavens, the orb [Luna-Selene the Moon] that was born after the old\n        Arcadians will lose control of her white-shining car [for the love of a rustic like Endymion].\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 8. 28 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Latmian hunter [Endymion], while his comrades are yet scattered in troops about the glens, rests in\n        the summer shade, fit lover for a goddess, and soon Luna (the Moon) [Selene] comes with veiled horns.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 2. 325 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :\n        \"Selene, Endymion's bed-fellow.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 4. 192 ff :\n        \"[The goddess Harmonia laments her betrothal to a mortal man :] ‘I will proclaim how Orion loved Eos\n        (the Dawn), and I will recall the match of Kephalos (Cephalus); if I go to the misty sunset, my comfort is\n        Selene (the Moon) herself who felt the same for Endymion upon Latmos.’\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 4. 213 ff :\n        \"When Mene (the Moon) [Selene] saw the girl [Harmonia daughter of Aphrodite] following a stranger [her\n        bridegroom Kadmos (Cadmus)] along the shore above the sea, and boiling under fiery constraint, she reproached\n        Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite] in mocking words : ‘So you make war even upon your children, Kypris! Not even\n        the fruit of your womb is spared by the goad of love! Don't you pity the girl you bore, hardheart? What other\n        girl can you pity then, when you drag your own child into passion?--Then you must go wandering too, my darling.\n        Say to your mother, Paphian's child, \"Phaethon mocks you, and Selene puts me to shame.\" Harmonia, love-tormented\n        exile, leave to Mene her bridegroom Endymion, and care for your vagrant Kadmos.

I believe Selene bathes in the Aonian [Theban] waves on her way to Endymion's bed on Latmos, the\n        bed of a sleepless shepherd; but if she has prinked herself out for her sweet shepherd, what's the use of Asopos\n        after the Okeanos (Ocean) stream?\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 13. 553 ff :\n        \"He [Kaunos (Caunus) of Karia (Caria)] composed that tricking lovesong . . . the song about the Latmian\n        cowshed of the neversleeping herdsman, while he praised Endymion, the bride-groom of love-smitten Selene, as\n        happy in love's care on a neighbouring rock [i.e. Mount Latmos in Karia].\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 41. 339 ff :\n        \"Wise Endymion with changing bends of his fingers will calculate the three varying phases of Selene.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 42. 266 ff :\n        \"Sing Selene madly in love with Endymion.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 48. 582 ff :\n        \"There were the clustering blooms which have the name Narkissos (Narcissus) the fair youth, whom horned\n        Selene's bridegroom Endymion begat on leafy Latmos.\"\n\nFulgentius, Mythologies 2. 16 (trans.
