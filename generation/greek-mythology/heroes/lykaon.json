He sought to test the divinity of Zeus by serving the god a\n        slaughtered child--either his son Nyktimos (Nyctimus), his grandson Arkas (Arcas), or a Molossian captive. Zeus\n        was furious and overturning the table, destroyed the fifty sons of Lykaon with lightning-bolts, and transformed\n        the king into a wolf.\n\nIn the chronology of myth Lykaon was a contemporary of Deukalion (Deucalion), king\n        of Thessalia, and Kekrops (Cecrops), king of Athens. His fifty sons founded and gave\n        their names to the towns and villages of Arkadia. Lykaon was succeeded on the throne by his youngest son\n        Nyktimos or grandson Arkas. Some say that Nyktimos was preserved by Gaia\n        (the Earth) when his brothers were struck down by the lightning-bolts of Zeus, others that he was the child\n        sacrificed by Lykaon who was afterwards resurrected by the gods (cf. the story of the sacrifice and resurrection\n        of Pelops).\n\n[1.1] PELASGOS (Hesiod Catalogues Frag 31, Pausanias 8.2.1, Hyginus Fabulae 176,\n          Suidas s.v.

Others call him a son of Pelasgus by Cyllene (Schol. ad Eurip. Orest. 1642), and\n        Dionysius of Halicarnassus (i. 11, 13) distinguishes between an elder and a younger Lycaon, the former of whom\n        is called a son of Aezeus and father of Deianeira, by whom Pelasgus became the father of the younger Lycaon. The\n        traditions about him place Lycaon in very different lights, for according to some, he was a barbarian who even\n        defied the gods (Ov. Met. i. 198, &c.), while others describe him as the first civiliser of\n        Arcadia, who built the town of Lycosura, and introduced the worship of Zeus Lycaeus. It is added that he\n        sacrificed a child on the altar of Zeus, and that during the sacrifice he was changed by Zeus into a wolf (Paus.\n        viii. 2. § 1; comp. Ov. Met. i. 237). By several wives Lycaon became the father of a large number\n        of sons, some say fifty, and others only twenty-two; but neither their number nor their names are the same in\n        all accounts (Apollod., Dionys. ll. cc.; Paus. viii. 3. § 1; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 313).\n        The sons of Lycaon are said to have been notorious for their insolence and impiety, and Zeus visited them in the\n        disguise of a poor man, with a view to punish them. They invited him to a repast, and on the suggestion of one\n        of them, Maenalus, they mixed in one of the dishes set before him the entrails of a boy whom they had murdered.\n        According to Ovid Zeus was recognised and worshipped by the Arcadian people, but Lycaon, after a vain attempt to\n        kill the god, resolved to try him with the dish of human flesh (Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 481; Eratosth.\n        Catest. 8). However, Zeus pushed away the table which bore the horrible food, and the place where this\n        happened was afterwards called Trapezus. Lycaon and all his sons, with the exception of the youngest (or\n        eldest), Nyctimus, were killed by Zeus with a flash of lightning, or according to others, were changed into\n        wolves (Ov., Tzetz. ll. cc.; Paus. viii. 3. § 1). Some say that the flood of Deucalion occurred in\n        the reign of Nyctimus, as a punishment of the crimes of the Lycaonids.

Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Lykaon (Lycaon) the son of Pelasgos (Pelasgus) devised the following plans, which were more clever than\n        those of his father. He founded the city Lykosoura (Lycosura) on Mount Lykaios (Lycaeus), gave to Zeus the\n        surname Lykaios and founded the Lykaian (Lycaean) games. I hold that the Panathenian festival was not founded\n        before the Lykaian. The early name for the former festival was the Athenian, which was changed to the\n        Panathenian in the time of Theseus, because it was then established by the whole Athenian people gathered\n        together in a single city . . .\n        My view is that Lykaon was contemporary with Kekrops (Cecrops), the king of Athens, but that they were not\n        equally wise in matters of religion. For Kekrops was the first to name Zeus Hypatos (the Supreme god), and\n        refused to sacrifice anything that had life in it, but burnt instead on the altar the national cakes which the\n        Athenians still call pelanoi. But Lykaon brought a human baby to the altar of Zeus Lykaios, and\n        sacrificed it, pouring out its blood upon the altar, and according to the legend immediately after the sacrifice\n        he was changed from a man to a wolf (lykos).\n        I for my part believe this story; it has been a legend among the Arkadians from of old, and it has the\n        additional merit of probability. For the men of those days, because of their righteousness and piety, were\n        guests of the gods, eating at the same board; the good were openly honored by the gods, and sinners were openly\n        visited with their wrath . . . So one might believe that Lykaon was turned into a beast . . .\n        All through the ages, many events that have occurred in the past, and even some that occur to-day, have been\n        generally discredited because of the lies built up on a foundation of fact. It is said, for instance, that ever\n        since the time of Lykaon a man has changed into a wolf at the sacrifice to Zeus Lykaios, but that the change is\n        not for life; if, when he is a wolf, he abstains from human flesh, after nine years he becomes a man again, but\n        if he tastes human flesh he remains a beast for ever . . .

So made he merry with his impious\n        proof; but not content with this he cut the throat of a Molossian hostage sent to him, and partly softened his\n        still quivering limbs in boiling water, partly roasted them on fires that burned beneath. And when this flesh\n        was served to me on tables, I destroyed his dwelling and his worthless Household Gods, with thunder bolts\n        avenging.

His vesture separates in shaggy hair, his arms are changed to legs; and as a wolf he has the\n        same grey locks, the same hard face, the same bright eyes, the same ferocious look. Thus fell one house, but not\n        one house alone deserved to perish; over all the earth ferocious deeds prevail,--all men conspire in evil.
