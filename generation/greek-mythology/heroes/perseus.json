  "content": "PERSEUS was one of the most celebrated heroes of Greek mythology.\n\nHe was the son of the Argive princess Danae who was locked away in a bronze chamber by her father Akrisios\n        (Acrisius) who lived in fear of a prophecy that he would one day be killed by her son. The god Zeus, however,\n        infiltrated her prison in the guise of a golden shower and impreganted her. When Akrisios discovered the child,\n        he placed the two in a chest and set them adrift at the sea. They were carried safely to the island of Seriphos\n        where they were offered refuge by the kindly, fisherman Diktys.\n\nWhen Perseus was fully grown, King Polydektes (Polydectes) commanded he fetch the head of Medousa (Medusa). With the help of the gods, Perseus obtained winged\n        sandals, an invisible helm and a magical sword. He then sought out the ancient Graiai (Graeae) and stealing their single eye compelled them to reveal the\n        location of the Gorgones. Perseus approached Medousa as she slept and\n        beheaded her with eyes averted to avoid her petrifying visage.\n\nOn his journey back to Greece, Perseus came across the Aithiopian (Ethiopian) princess Andromeda chained to a\n        rock as a sacrifice to a sea-monster. He slew the beast and brought\n        her with him back to Greece as his bride.\n\nUpon reaching Seriphos, the hero turned King Polydektes to stone, and then travelled on to his grandfather's\n        kingdom to claim the throne. The old man fled in fear for his life but was later accidentally killed by Perseus\n        at the funeral games of a king with a discus throw gone awry.\n\nPerseus was the ancestor of the royal houses of Mykenai (Mycenae), Elis, Sparta, Messenia, and distant Persia.\n        His most famous descendant was Herakles.\n\nThe hero was depicted in classical art as a youth with winged boots and cap, and armed with a sickle-shaped\n        sword.\n\n[1.1] ZEUS & DANAE (Homer Iliad 14.319, Pindar Pythian 12. 16, Apollodorus 2.34, Strabo 10.5.10, Herodotus\n          6.53 & 7.61, Diodorus Siculus 4.9.1, Hyginus Fabulae 63 & 155, Ovid Metamorphoses 4.607, Nonnus\n          Dionysiaca 2.286, et al)\n\n[1.1] STHENELOS (Homer Iliad 19.97)\n        [1.1] PERSES, ALKAIOS, STHENELOS, HELEIOS, MESTOR, ELEKTRYON, GORGOPHONE (by Andromeda) (Apollodorus 2.49)\n        [1.3] PERSES (by Andromeda) (Herodotus 7.61.1)\n        [1.4] GORGOPHONE (Pausanias 3.1.4, 4.2.4, 2.21.7)\n        [1.5] KYNOUROS (Pausanias 3.2.2)\n        [1.6] ELEKTYRON (Diodorus Siculus 4.9.1)\n        [1.2] ALKAIOS, STHENELOS, AELIOS, MESTOR, ELEKTRYON (by Andromeda) (Scholiast on Hom.\n          Il. 19.115)\n        [1.3] ALKAIOS, STHENELOS, MESTOR, ELEKTRYON (by Andromeda) (Scholiast on Apoll. Rhod.\n          1.147)\n\nPERSEUS (Perseus). The famous Argive hero, was a son of Zeus and Danae, and a grandson of Acrisius (Hom.\n        Il. xiv. 310; Hes. Scut. Herc. 229). Acrisius, who had no male issue, consulted the Pythian\n        oracle, and received the answer, that if Danae should give birth to a son, he would kill his father. Acrisius,\n        accordingly, shut up his daughter in a subterraneous apartment, made of brass or stone (Soph. Ant. 947;\n        Lycoph. 838 ; Horat. Carm. iii. 16). But Zeus having metamorphosed himself into a shower of gold, came\n        down upon her through the roof of the apartment, and became by her the father of Perseus. From this circumstance\n        Perseus is sometimes called chrusopatros or aurigena (Lycoph. 838; Ov. Met. v. 250).\n        When Acrisius discovered that Danaë had given birth to a son, he threw both mother and son into a chest,\n        and put them out to sea; but Zeus caused the chest to land in the island of Seriphos, one of the Cyclades, where\n        Dictys, a fisherman, found them, and carried them to his brother, king Polydectes. According to a later or\n        Italian tradition, the chest was carried to the coast of Italy, where king Pilumnus married Danaë, and\n        founded Ardea (Virg. Aen. vii. 410; Serv. ad Aen. vii. 372); or Danaë is said to have\n        come to Italy with two sons, Argus and Argeus, whom she had by Phineus, and took up her abode on the spot where\n        Rome was afterwards built (Serv. ad Aen. viii. 345). But, according to the common story, Polydectes,\n        king of Seriphos, made Danae his slave, and courted her favour, but in vain; and in order to obtain the\n        undisturbed possession of her, he sent off Perseus, who had in the meantime grown up to manhood, to the Gorgons,\n        to fetch the head of Medusa, which he said he would give to Hippodameia as a wedding present (Tzetz. ad\n          Lyc. 838). Another account again states that Polydectes married Danaë, and caused Perseus to be\n        brought up in the temple of Athena. When Acrisius learnt this, he went to Polydectes, who, however, interfered\n        on behalf of the boy, and the latter promised not to kill his grandfather. Acrisius. however, was detained in\n        Seriphos by storms, and during that time Polydectes died. During the funeral gaines the wind carried a disk\n        thrown by Perseus against the head of Acrisius, and killed him, whereupon Perseus proceeded to Argos and took\n        possessions of the kingdom of his grandfather (Hygin. Fab. 63). But to return to the common tradition,\n        Athena, with whom Medusa had ventured to contend for the prize of beauty, first showed to Perseus the head of\n        Gorgo in images, near the town of Diecterion in Samos, and advised him to be unconcerned about the two immortal\n        Gorgons, Stheno and Euryale. Perseus then went first to the Graeae, the sisters of the Gorgons, took from them\n        their one tooth and their one eye, and did not restore them to the Graeae until they showed him the way to the\n        nymphs; or he cast the tooth and the eye into lake Triton, so that the Graeae were no longer able to guard the\n        Gorgons (Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii. 12). The nymphs provided Perseus with winged sandals, a bag, and the\n        helmet of Hades, which rendered him invisible, Hermes with a sickle, and Athena with a mirror (Hes. Scut.\n          Her. 220, 222 ; Eurip. Elect. 460; Anthol. Palat. ix. 557; comp. Hygin. Poet. Astr. ii.\n        12; Theon, ad Arat. p. 29). Being thus armed, he went to the Gorgons, who dwelt near Tartessus on the\n        coast of the Ocean, whose heads were covered, like those of serpents, with scales, and who had large tusks like\n        boars, brazen hands, and golden wings. He found them asleep, and cut off the head of Medusa, looking at her\n        figure through the mirror, for a look at the monster herself would have changed him into stone. Perseus put her\n        head into the bag which he carried on his back, and as he went away, he was pursued by the winged Gorgons (Hes.\n        Scut. Here. 230 ; Paus. v. 118. § 1). On his return he visited Aethiopia, where he saved and\n        married Andromeda, by whom he became the father of Perses, whom he left with Cepheus. During this journey\n        Perseus is also said to have come to the Hyperboreans, by whom he was hospitably received (Pind. Pyth.\n        x. 50), and to Atlas, whom, by the head of Gorgo, he changed into the mountain of the same name (Ov.\n        Met. iv. 655; Serv. ad Aen. iv. 246). Phineus, the brother of Cepheus, was likewise changed\n        into stone, and when Perseus returned to Seriphos he found his mother with Dictys in the temple, whither she had\n        fled from the embraces of Polydectes. Perseus found the latter at a repast, and metamorphosed him and all his\n        guests, and, some say, the whole island, into stone (Pind. Pyth. xii. 21; Strab. x. p. 487), and\n        presented the kingdom to Dictys. Perseus then gave the winged sandals and the helmet to Hermes, who restored\n        them to the nymphs and to Hades, and Athena received the head of Gorgo, which was put on the shield or\n        breast-plate of the goddess. Hereupon Perseus went to Argos, accompanied by Cyclopes, skilled in building\n        (Schol. ad Eurip. Or. 953), by Danaë, and Andromeda. Acrisius, remembering the oracle, escaped to\n        Larissa, in the country of the Pelasgians; but Perseus followed him, in order to persuade him to return (Paus.\n        ii. 16. § 6). Some writers state that Perseus, on his return to Argos. found Proetus who had expelled his\n        brother Acrisius, in possession of the kingdom (Ov. Met. v. 236, &c.); Perseus slew Proetus, and\n        was afterwards killed by Megapenthes, the son of Proetus, who avenged the death of his father. (Hygin.\n        Fab. 244.) Some again relate that Proetus was expelled, and went to Thebes. (Schol. ad Eurip.\n          Phoen. 1109.) But the common tradition goes on thus: when Teutamidas, king of Larissa, celebrated games\n        in honour of his guest Acrisius, Perseus, who took part in them, accidentally hit the foot of Acrisius, and thus\n        killed him. Acrisius was buried outside the city of Larissa, and Perseus, leaving the kingdom of Argos to\n        Megapenthes, the son of Proetus, received from him in exchange the government of Tiryns. According to others,\n        Perseus remained in Argos, and successfully opposed the introduction of the Bacchic orgies. (Paus. ii. 20.\n        § 3, 22. § 1 ; comp. Nonn. Dionys. xxxi. 25.) Perseus is said to have founded the towns of\n        Mideia and Mycenae. (Paus. ii. 15. § 4.) By Andromeda he became the father of Alcaeus, Sthenelus, Heleius,\n        Mestor, Electryon, Gorgophone, and Autochthe, (Apollod. ii. 4. §§ 1-5; Tzetz. ad Lyc. 494,\n        838; Ov. Met. iv. 606, &c.; Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. iv. 1091.) Perseus was worshipped as\n        a hero in several places, e.g. between Argos and Mycenae, in Seriphos, and at Athens, where he had an altar in\n        common with Dictys and Clymene. (Paus. ii. 18. § 1.) Herodotus (ii. 91) relates that a temple and a statue\n        of Perseus existed at Chemnis in Egypt, and that the country was blessed whenever he appeared.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nABAS.

These two were at odds with each other while still in the womb, and when they had grown they\n        warred over the kingdom. In the course of fighting they became the first to develop the use of shields. Akrisios\n        won and drove Proitos out of Argos. Proitos made his way to Iobates, or, according to some, to Amphianax in\n        Lykia (Lycia), and married his daughter, whom Homeros (Homer) calls Anteia, although the tragic poets call her\n        Stheneboia (Stheneboea). Proitos' father-in-law with the Lykian army conducted him home again, where he seized\n        Tiryns, which had been walled for him by the Kyklopes (Cyclopes). The two brothers then split up all of Argeia\n        [Argolis] between them and settled down, Akrisios lord of Argos, and Proitos lord of Tiryns.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 16. 2 - 3 (trans.

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer\n          C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"To Akrisios (Acrisius) and Eurydike (Eurydice), Lakedaimon's (Lacedaemon's) daughter, was born a daughter\n        Danae . . . While Akrisios was making oracular inquiry into the problem of fathering sons, the god informed him\n        that a son born of his daughter would slay him. In fear Akrisios constructed a bronze chamber beneath the earth,\n        where he kept Danae under guard. Now some say that Proitos (Proetus) seduced her, which led to the hard feelings\n        between the brothers, but others say that Zeus had sex with her by changing himself into gold that streamed in\n        through the ceiling and down into her womb. When Akrisios later learned that she had given birth to Perseus, not\n        believing that Zeus seduced her, he cast his daughter out to sea with her son on an ark. The ark drifted ashore\n        at Seriphos, where Diktys (Dictys) recovered the child and brought him up.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 63 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"Danae was the daughter of Acrisius and Aganippe. A prophecy about her said that the child she bore would\n        kill Acrisius, and Acrisius, fearing this, shut her in a stone-walled prison. But Jove [Zeus], changing into a\n        shower of gold, lay with Danae, and from this embrace Perseus was born. Because of her sin her father shut her\n        up in a chest with Perseus and cast it into the sea. By Jove's [Zeus'] will it was borne to the island of\n        Seriphus, and when the fisherman Dictys found it and broke it open, he discovered the mother and child. He took\n        them to King Polydectes, who married Danae and brought up Perseus in the temple of Minerva [Athena].\"\n\nThe story of Danae was told in several lost plays--Aeschylus' The Net-Draggers, Euripides'\n        Danae, and Sophocles' Danae.\n\nHomer, Iliad 14. 319 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n        \"Zeus who gathers the clouds answered her [Hera] : ‘. . .

He fell in love with Danae,\n        but was unable to have sex with her, now that Perseus was a grown man, so he got together his friends, Perseus\n        among them, and told them he was collecting contributions to offer for the hand of Hippodameia, daughter of\n        Oinomaos (Oenomaus). He asked for horses from the others, but, because he got no horses from Perseus and because\n        Perseus had said that he would not deny Polydektes even the Gorgo's [Medousa's] head, he assigned him the task\n        of fetching that very object.\n        So with Hermes and Athene as his guides Perseus sought out the Phorkides (daughters of Phorkys) [the Graiai\n        (Graeae)], who were named Enyo, Pephredo, and Deino. The three of them possessed only one eye and one tooth\n        among them, which they took turns using. Perseus appropriated these and when they demanded them back, he said he\n        would return them after they had directed him to the Nymphai (Nymphs). These Nymphai had in their possession\n        winged sandals and the kibisis, which they say was a knapsack.--Pindaros and Hesiodos in the Shield of\n          Herakles, describe Perseus as follows : ‘The head of a terrible monster, Gorgo, covered all his\n        back, and a kibisis held it.’ It is called a kibisis because clothing and food are placed in\n        it.--They also had the helmet of Haides. When the Phorkides had led Perseus to the Nymphai, he returned them\n        their tooth and eye. Approaching the Nymphai he received what he had come for, and he flung on the\n        kibisis, tied the sandals on his ankles, and placed the helmet on his head. With the helmet on he could\n        see whomever he cared to look at, but was invisible to others.\n        Perseus took flight and made his way to the Okeanos (Oceanus), where he found the Gorgones sleeping. Their names\n        were Stheno, Euryale, and the third was Medousa (Medusa), the only mortal one : thus it was her head that\n        Perseus was sent to bring back. The Gorgones' heads were entwined with the horny scales of serpents, and they\n        had big tusks like hogs, bronze hands, and wings of gold on which they flew. All who looked at them were turned\n        to stone. Perseus, therefore, with Athena guiding his hand, kept his eyes on the reflection in a bronze shield\n        as he stood over the sleeping Gorgones, and when he saw the image of Medousa, he beheaded her.--As soon as her\n        head was severed there leaped from her body the winged horse Pegasos (Pegasus) and Khrysaor (Chrysaor), the\n        father of Geryon. The father of these two was Poseidon.--Perseus then placed the head in the kibisis and headed\n        back again, as the Gorgones pursued him through the air. But the helmet kept him hidden, and made it impossible\n        for them to identify him.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 13 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"He is said to have come to the stars because of his nobility and the unusual nature of his conception.\n        When sent by Polydectes, son of Magnes, to the Gorgones, he received from Mercurius [Hermes], who is thought to\n        have loved him, talaria and petasus, and, in addition, a helmet which kept its wearer from\n        being seen by an enemy. So the Greeks have called it the helmet of Haides [the Unseen], though Perseus did not,\n        as some ignorant people interpret it, wear the helmet of Orcus [Haides] himself, for no educated person could\n        believe that. He is said, too, to have received from Vulcanus [Hephaistos] a knife made of adamant, with which\n        he killed Medusa the Gorgon. The deed itself no one has described. But as Aeschylus, the writer of tragedies,\n        says in his Phorcides, the Graeae were guardians of the Gorgons. We wrote about them in the first book\n        of the Genealogiae. They are thought to have had but one eye among them, and thus to have kept guard,\n        watch one taking it in her turn. This eye Perseus snatches, as one was passing it to another, and threw is in\n        Lake Tritonis. So, when the guards were blinded, he easily killed the Gorgon when she was overcome with sleep.\n        Minerva [Athena] is said to have the head on her breastplate. Euhemerus says the Gorgon was killed by\n        Minerva.\"\n\nThis part of Perseus' story was the theme of a number of lost plays including a Perseus by Pratinus of\n        Phlius, a Phorcides by Aeschylus, a Dictys by Euripides, a Perseus by Aristias of\n        Phlius, and a Phorcides by Timocles of Athens.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 274 ff (trans.

With her lay the Dark-haired One [Poseidon] in a soft meadow amid\n        spring flowers.

On his feet he had winged sandals, and his black-sheathed sword was slung across his\n        shoulders by a cross-belt of bronze. He was flying swift as thought. The head of a dreadful monster, the Gorgo,\n        covered the broad of his back, and a bag of silver--a marvel to see--contained it: and from the bag bright\n        tassels of gold hung down. Upon the head of the hero lay the dread cap of Aides (Hades) which had the awful\n        gloom of night. Perseus himself, the son of Danae, was at full stretch, like one who hurries and shudders with\n        horror. And after him rushed the Gorgones, unapproachable and unspeakable, longing to seize him : as they trod\n        upon the pale adamant, the shield rang sharp and clear with a loud clanging. Two serpents hung down at their\n        girdles with heads curved forward: their tongues were flickering, and their teeth gnashing with fury, and their\n        eyes glaring fiercely.

There was no battle when swiftshoe Perseus lifted the lifeless token of\n        victory, the snaky sheaf of Gorgon hair, relics of the head dripping drops of blood, gently wheezing a\n        half-heard hiss through the severed throats . . . Perseus fled with flickering wings trembling at the hiss of\n        mad Sthenno's hairy snakes, although he bore the cap of Haides and the sickle of Pallas [Athena], with Hermes'\n        wings though Zeus was his father; he sailed a fugitive on swiftest shoes, listening for no trumpet but [the\n        Gorgon] Euryale's bellowing--having despoiled a little Libyan hole!\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 25. 64 ff : \n        \"He [Perseus] laid ambush for the sentinel eye of Phorkys (Phorcys) [i.e. of the Graiai (Graeae)], the ball\n        of the sleepless eye that passed from hand to hand, giving each her share under the wing of sleep in turn.\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 26. 52 : \n        \"The round island of the Graiai (Graeae) [lay somewhere beyond India].\"\n\nNonnus, Dionysiaca 30. 264 ff : \n        \"Have you set foot in Libya?

He had taken the travelling eye of Phorkys' old one-eyed daughter unsleeping [the Graia\n        (Graea)]; he dived into the dangerous cave [of the Gorgones], reaped the hissing harvest by the rockside, the\n        firstfruits of curling hair, sliced the Gorgon's teeming throat and stained his sickle red. He cut off the head\n        and bathed a bloodstained in the viperish dew; then as Medousa was slain, the neck was delivered of its twin\n        birth, the Horse [Pegasos] and the Boy [Khrysaor (Chrysaor)] with the golden sword.\"\n\nSuidas s.v.

And going through a great expanse of land he saw a virgin maiden, hideous and ugly, and\n        turning aside [to speak] to her, he asked ‘what is your name?’ And she said, ‘Medousa.’\n        And cutting off her head he despatched her as he had been taught, and he hung it up, amazing and destroying all\n        who saw it.

Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        \"A fearsome snake lay in the [Libyan] sand, sheltering from the midday sun. It was too sluggish to attack a\n        man who showed now wish to harm it, or to fly at anyone who shrank away. And yet, for any creature living on the\n        face of Mother Earth, one drop of its black poison in his veins was short cut to the world below . . . For when\n        the godlike Perseus, whom his mother called Eurymedon, flew over Libye (Libya) brining the Gorgon's newly\n        severed head to the king, every drop of dark blood that fell from it to the ground produced a brood of these\n        serpents.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 4. 617 ff (trans. Brookes More) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"So mighty is the hidden power of truth, Acrisius soon lamented . . . that ever he refused to own his\n        grandson; for the one achieved high heaven, and the other, (as he bore the viperous monster-head) on sounding\n        wings hovered a conqueror in the fluent air, over sands, Libyan, where the Gorgon-head dropped clots of gore,\n        that, quickening on the ground, became unnumbered serpents; fitting cause to curse with vipers that infested\n        land. Thence wafted by the never-constant winds through boundless latitudes, now here now there, as flits a\n        vapour-cloud in dizzy flight, down-looking from the lofty skies on earth, removed far, so compassed he the\n        world. Three times did he behold the frozen Bears, times thrice his gaze was on the Crab's bent arms. Now\n        shifting to the west, now to the east, how often changed his course? Time came, when day declining, he began to\n        fear the night, by which he stopped his flight far in the west--the realm of Atlas--where he sought repose till\n        Lucifer (the Morning Star) might call Aurora's (the Dawn's) [Eos'] fires; Aurora chariot of the Day.\n        There dwelt huge Atlas, vaster than the race of man : son of Iapetus, his lordly sway extended over those\n        extreme domains, and over oceans that command their waves to take the panting coursers of the Sun, and bathe the\n        wearied Chariot of the Day. For him a thousand flocks, a thousand herds overwandered pasture fields; and\n        neighbour tribes might none disturb that land. Aglint with gold bright leaves adorn the trees,--boughs\n        golden-wrought bear apples of pure gold. And Perseus spoke to Atlas, ‘O my friend, if thou art moved to\n        hear the story of a noble race, the author of my life is Jupiter [Zeus]; if valiant deeds perhaps are thy\n        delight mine may deserve thy praise.--Behold of thee kind treatment I implore--a place of rest.’\n        But Atlas, mindful of an oracle since by Themis, the Parnassian, told, recalled these words, ‘O Atlas!\n        mark the day a son of Jupiter [Zeus] shall come to spoil; for when thy trees been stripped of golden fruit, the\n        glory shall be his.’ Fearful of this, Atlas had built solid walls around his orchard, and secured a\n        dragon, huge, that kept perpetual guard, and thence expelled all strangers from his land. Wherefore he said,\n        ‘Begone! The glory of your deeds is all pretense; even Jupiter, will fail your need.’ With that he\n        added force and strove to drive the hesitating Alien from his doors; who pled reprieve or threatened with bold\n        words. Although he dared not rival Atlas' might, Perseus made this reply; ‘For that my love you hold in\n        light esteem, let this be yours.’ He said no more, but turning his own face, he showed upon his left\n        Medusa's head, abhorrent features.--Atlas, huge and vast, becomes a mountain--His great beard and hair are\n        forests, and his shoulders and his hands mountainous ridges, and his head the top of a high peak;--his bones are\n        changed to rocks. Augmented on all sides, enormous height attains his growth; for so ordained it, ye, O mighty\n        Gods! who now the heavens' expanse unnumbered stars, on him command to rest.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
