  "content": "KEKROPS (Cecrops) was an early, earth-born king of Attika and founder the city of Athens. He was depicted as a\n        man from the waist up with a serpent's-tail in place of legs.\n\nKekrops was the first man to offer sacrifices to the goddess Athena after\n        her birth from the head of Zeus and he established her ancient shrine on the Akropolis. When Poseidon disputed her claim to the city, Kekrops was asked to adjudicate\n        and ruled in her favour. He was succeeded on the throne by Athena's foster-son, the earth-born hero Erikthonios\n        (Erichthonius).\n\n[1.1] GAIA (i.e. earth-born) (Apollodorus\n          3.14.1, Antoninus Liberalis 6, Hyginus Fabulae 48)\n        [2.1] HEPHAISTOS (Hyginus Fabulae 158)\n\n[1.1] HERSE, AGLAUROS, PANDROSOS, ERYSIKHTHON (by Agraulos) (Apollodorus\n          3.14.2)\n        [1.1] HERSE, AGLAUROS, PANDROSOS, ERYSIKHTHON (Pausanias 1.2.6)\n        [1.2] HERSE, AGLAUROS, PANDROSOS (Hyginus Fabulae 166, Ovid Metamorphoses\n          2.546)\n\nCECROPS (Kekrôps), according to Apollodorus (iii. 14. § 1, &c.) the first king of Attica, which\n        derived from him its name Cecropia, having previously borne the name of Acte. He is described as an autochthon,\n        and is accordingly called a gêgenês, the upper part of whose body was human, while the lower was\n        that of a dragon. Hence he is called diphuês or geminus. (Hygin. Fab. 48; Anton. Lib. 6;\n        Diod. i. 28; Aristoph. Vesp. 438; Ov. Met. ii. 555.) Some ancients referred the epithet\n        diphuês to marriage, of which tradition made him the founder. He was married to Agraulos, the daughter of\n        Actaeus, by whom he had a son, Erysichthon, and three daughters, Agraulos, Herse, and Pandrosos. (Apollod.\n        l. c.; Paus. i. 2. § 5.) In his reign Poseidon called forth with his trident a well on the\n        acropolis, which was known in later times by the name of the Erechthean well, from its being enclosed in the\n        temple of Erechtheus. (Paus. i. 26. § 6; Herod. viii. 55.) The marine god now wanted to take possession of\n        the country; but Athena, who entertained the same desire, planted an olivetree on the hill of the acropolis,\n        which continued to be shown at Athens down to the latest times ; and as she had taken Cecrops as her witness\n        while she planted it, he decided in her favour when the possession of Attica was disputed between her and\n        Poseidon, who had no witness to attest that he had created the well. Cecrops is represented in the Attic legends\n        as the author of the first elements of civilized life, such as marriage, the political division of Attica into\n        twelve communities, and also as the introducer of a new mode of worship, inasmuch as he abolished the bloody\n        sacrifices which had until then been offered to Zeus, and substituted cakes (pelanoi) in their stead. (Paus.\n        viii. 2. § 1; Strab. ix. p. 397; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1156.) The name of Cecrops occurs also in\n        other parts of Greece, especially where there existed a town of the name of Athenae, such as in Boeotia, where\n        he is said to have founded the ancient towns of Athenae and Eleusis on the river Triton, and where he had a\n        heroum at Haliartus. Tradition there called him a son of Pandion. (Paus. ix. 33, § 1; Strab. ix. p. 407.)\n        In Euboea, which had likewise a town Athenae, Cecrops was called a son of Erechtheus and Praxithea, and a\n        grandson of Pandion. (Apollod. iii. 15. §§ 1, 5; Paus. i. 5. § 3.) From these traditions it\n        appears, that Cecrops must be regarded as a hero of the Pelasgian race; and Müller justly remarks, that the\n        different mythical personages of this name connected with the towns in Boeotia and Euboea are only\n        multiplications of the one original hero, whose name and story were transplanted from Attica to other places.\n        The later Greek writers describe Ceerops as having immigrated into Greece with a band of colonists from Sais in\n        Egypt. (Diod. i. 29; Schol. ad Arist. Plut. 773.) But this account is rejected by some of the ancients.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 14. 1 - 2 (trans. Frazer) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Kekrops (Cecrops), a son of the soil, with a body compounded of man and serpent, was the first king of\n        Attika (Attica), and the country which was formerly called Akte (Acte) he named Kekropia (Cecropia) after\n        himself. In his time, they say, the gods resolved to take possession of cities in which each of them should\n        receive his own peculiar worship. So Poseidon was the first that came to Attika, and with a blow of his trident\n        on the middle of the acropolis, he produced a sea which they now call Erekhtheis (Erechtheis). After him came\n        Athena, and, having called on Kekrops to witness her act of taking possession, she planted an olive tree, which\n        is still shown in the Pandrosion (Pandrosium). But when the two strove for possession of the country, Zeus\n        parted them and appointed arbiters, not, as some have affirmed, Kekrops and Kranaus (Cranaus), nor yet\n        Erysikhthon (Erysichthon), but the twelve gods. And in accordance with their verdict the country was adjudged to\n        Athena, because Kekrops bore witness that she had been the first to plant the olive. Athena, therefore, called\n        the city Athens after herself, and Poseidon in hot anger flooded the Thriasian plain and laid Attika under the\n        sea.\n        Kekrops married Agraulos (Agraulus), daughter of Aktaios (Actaeus), and had a son Erysikhthon, who departed this\n        life childless; and Kekrops had daughters, Agraulos, Herse, and Pandrosos.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 14. 5 :\n        \"When Kekrops (Cecrops) died, Kranaus (Cranaus) came to the throne; he was a son of the soil, and it was in\n        his time that the flood in the age of Deukalion (Deucalion) is said to have taken place.\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 14. 6 :\n        \"Having put him [the earth-born infant Erikhthonios (Erichthonius)] in a chest, she [Athena] committed it\n        to Pandrosos, daughter of Kekrops (Cecrops).\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 8. 44. 2 (trans. Godley) (Greek historian C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"The Athenians, while the Pelasgians ruled what is now called Hellas, were Pelasgians, bearing the name of\n        Kranai (Cranae). When Kekrops (Cecrops) was their king they were called Kekropidai (sons of Kekrops), and when\n        Erekhtheus (Erechtheus) succeeded to the rule, they changed their name and became Athenians. When, however, Ion\n        son of Xouthos (Xuthus) was commander of the Athenian army, they were called after him Ionians.\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 8. 53. 1 :\n        \"The sacred precinct of Kekrops' (Cecrops') daughter Aglauros.\"\n\nThucydides, The Peloponnesian War 2. 15. 1 (Greek historian C5th B.C.) :\n        \"Under Kekrops (Cecrops) and the first kings, down to the reign of Theseus, Attika (Attica) had always\n        consisted of a number of independent townships, each with its own town-hall and magistrates.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 56. 5 - 6 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"The Heliadai (Heliadae) . . . were told by Helios that the first people to offer sacrifices to Athena\n        would ever enjoy the presence of the goddess; and the same thing, we are told, was disclosed by him to the\n        inhabitants of Attika (Attica). Men say, the Heliadai [of Rhodes], forgetting in their haste to put fire beneath\n        the victims, nevertheless laid them on the altars at the time, whereas Kekrops (Cecrops), who was king at that\n        time of the Athenians, performed the sacrifice over fire, but later than the Heliadai.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 9. 1. 18 - 20 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The account would be much longer if one should pass in review the early founders of the settlement [of\n        Athens], beginning with Kekrops (Cecrops); for all writers do not agree about them, as is shown even by the\n        names . . .\n        It suffices, then, to add thus much : According to Philokhoros (Philochorus), when the country was being\n        devastated, both from the sea by the Karians (Carians), and from the land by the Boiotians, who were called\n        Aonians, Kekrops first settled the multitude in twelve cities, the names of which were Kekropia (Cecropia),\n        Tetrapolis, Epakria (Epacria), Dekeleia (Decelea), Eleusis, Aphidna (also called Aphidnai, in the plural),\n        Thorikos (Thoricus), Brauron, Kytheros (Cytherus), Sphettos, Kephisia (Cephisia).

When he died, Kekrops\n        (Cecrops), the son-in-law of Aktaios, received the kingdom, and there were born to him daughters, Herse,\n        Aglauros and Pandrosos, and a son Erysikhthon (Erysichthon). This son did not become king of the Athenians, but\n        happened to die while his father lived, and the kingdom of Kekrops fell to Kranaus, the most powerful of the\n        Athenians.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 5. 3 :\n        \"[Near the Tholos or council-house of Athens :] I saw also among the eponymoi [i.e. the eponymous heroes of\n        Attika] statues of Kekrops (Cecrops) and Pandion, but I do not know who of those names are thus honored.
