  "content": "DAPHNIS was a Sicilian herdsman and the inventor of bucolic poetry. He pledged his love to a Naias-nymphe but, after cheating on her with another woman, was blinded and\n        fell to his death from a cliff. The bucolic poets sang of Daphnis in their idylls.\n\n[1.1] HERMES (Theocritus Idylls 1.78,\n          Parthenius 29, Aelian Miscellany 10.18)\n        [1.2] HERMES & a NYMPHE (Diodorus Siculus 4.84.2)\n        [2.1] LYKIDAS & NOMAIE (Theocritus Idylls 27.42)\n\nDAPHNIS, a Sicilian hero, to whom the invention of bucolic poetry is ascribed. He is called a son of Hermes by\n        a nymph (Diod. iv. 84), or merely the beloved of Hermes. (Aelian, V. H. x. 18.) Ovid (Met. iv.\n        275) calls him an Idaean shepherd; but it does not follow from this, that Ovid connected him with either the\n        Phrygian or the Cretan Ida, since Ida signifies any woody mountain. (Etym. Magn. s.v.) His story runs\n        as follows: The nymph, his mother, exposed him when an infant in a charming valley in a laurel grove, from which\n        he received his name of Daphnis, and for which he is also called the favourite of Apollo. (Serv. ad Virg.\n          Eclog. x. 26.) He was brought up by nymphs or shepherds, and he himself became a shepherd, avoiding the\n        bustling crowds of men, and tending his flocks on mount Aetna winter and summer. A Naiad (her name is different\n        in different writers, Echenais, Xenea, Nomia, or Lyce,--Parthen. Erot. 29; Schol. ad Theocrit.\n        i. 65, vii. 73; Serv. ad Virg. Eclog. viii. 68; Phylarg. ad Virg. Eclog. v. 20) fell in love\n        with him, and made him promise never to form a connexion with any other maiden, adding the threat that he should\n        become blind if he violated his vow. For a time the handsome Daphnis resisted all the numerous temptations to\n        which he was exposed, but at last he forgot himself, having been made intoxicated by a princess. The Naiad\n        accordingly punished him with blindness, or, as others relate, changed him into a stone. Previous to this time\n        he had composed bucolic poetry, and with it delighted Artemis during the chase. According to others, Stesichorus\n        made the fate of Daphnis the theme of his bucolic poetry, which was the earliest of its kind. After having\n        become blind, he invoked his father to help him. The god accordingly raised him up to heaven, and caused a well\n        to gush forth on the spot where this happened. The well bore the name of Daphnis, and at it the Sicilians\n        offered an annual sacrifice. (Serv. ad Virg. Ecl. v. 20.) Phylargyrius, on the same passage, states,\n        that Daphnis tried to console himself in his blindness by songs and playing on the flute, but that he did not\n        live long after; and the Scholiast on Theocritus (viii. 93) relates, that Daphnis, while wandering about in his\n        blindness, fell from a steep rock. Somewhat different accounts are contained in Servius (ad Virg.\n          Eclog. viii. 68) and in various parts of the Idyls of Theocritus.\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nParthenius, Love Romances 29 (trans. Gaselee) (Greek poet C1st B.C.) :\n        \"From the Sikelika of Timaios [historian of early Sicily, C4th-3rd B.C.].\n        In Sikelia (Sicily) was born Daphnis the son of Hermes, who was skilled in playing on the pipes and also\n        exceedingly beautiful. He would never frequent the places where men come together, but spent his life in the\n        open, both winter and summer, keeping his herds on the slopes of Aitna (Etna). The nymphe Ekhenais (Echenais),\n        so the story runs, fell in love with him, and bade him never have to do with mortal woman; if he disobeyed, his\n        fate would be to lose his eyes. For some considerable time he stood out strongly against all temptation,\n        although not a few women were madly in love with him; but at last one of the Sikelian (Sicilian) princesses\n        worked his ruin by plying him with much wine, and so brought him to the desire to consort with her. Thus he,\n        too, like Thamyras the Thrakian (Thracian), was thenceforward blind through his own folly.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 84. 1 - 4 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"At this time we shall endeavour to set forth what the myths relate concerning Daphnis. There are in\n        Sikelia (Sicily), namely, the Heraia (Heraea) Mountains, which, men say, are naturally well suited, by reason of\n        the beauty and nature and special character of the region round about, to relaxation and enjoyment in the summer\n        season. For they possess many springs of exceptionally sweet water and are full of trees of every description.\n        On them also is a multitude of great oak-trees which bear fruit of extraordinary size, since it is twice as\n        large as any that grows in other lands. And they possess as well some of the cultivated fruits, which have\n        sprung up of their own accord, since the vine is found there in profusion and tree-fruits in quantities beyond\n        telling . . .\n        It was in this region, where there were glens filled with trees and meet for a god and a grove consecrated to\n        the Nymphai (Nymphs), that, as the myths relate, he who was known as Daphnis was born, a son of Hermes and a\n        Nymphe, and he, because of the sweet bay (daphnê) which grew there in such profusion and so\n        thick, was given the name Daphnis.\n        He was reared by Nymphai, and since he possessed very many herds of cattle and gave great attention to their\n        care, he was for this reason called by the name Boukolos (Bucolus) or ‘Neatherd.’ And being endowed\n        with an unusual gift of song, he invented the bucolic or pastoral poem and the bucolic song which continues to\n        be so popular throughout Sikelia (Sicily) to the present day.\n        The myths add that Daphnis accompanied Artemis in her hunting, serving the goddess in an acceptable manner, and\n        that with his shepherd's pipe and singing of pastoral songs he pleased her exceedingly. The story is also told\n        that one of the Nymphai became enamoured of him and prophesied to him that if he lay with any other woman he\n        would be deprived of his sight; and indeed, when once he had been made drunken by a daughter of a king and had\n        lain with her, he was deprived of his sight in accordance with the prophecy delivered by the Nymphe. As for\n        Daphnis, then, let what we have said suffice.\"\n\nAelian, On Animals 11. 13 (trans. Scholfield) (Greek natural history C2nd to 3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"They say that the five hounds, Sannos, Podargos, Lampas, Alkimos (Alcimus), and Theon, kept by Daphnis the\n        neatherd of Syrakouse (Syracuse) who suffered his well-known punishment at the hands of the Nymphe, at the sight\n        of their master's misfortune chose to die after he died, having previously bewailed him deeply and shed tears in\n        abundance.\"\n\nAelian, Historical Miscellany 10. 18 (trans. Wilson) (Greek rhetorician C2nd to 3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Some say the herdsman Daphnis was the favourite boy (erômenos) of Hermes, others that he\n        was his son. He acquired his name from something that happened to him: he was the child of a Nymphe, exposed\n        after birth beside a laurel tree. The cattle he looked after were said to be sisters of Helios the Sun, recorded\n        by Homer in the Odyssey [12.127]. While was was with his flock in Sikelia (Sicily) a nymphe fell in\n        love with him; she made love to him--he was handsome, young, and just beginning to grow a beard, at the stage\n        when good-looking young men show their youth in its most attractive form, as Homer himself remarks somewhere\n        [Iliad 24.348]. She arranged that he should never approach any other woman and threatened him that he\n        was fated to lose his sight if he transgressed. They made a solemn agreement with each other in these terms.\n        Later, when a king's daughter fell in love with him, he got drunk, broke the agreement, and made advances to\n        her. That was when pastoral songs were first sung and had as their subject his misfortune in being blinded.\n        Stesikhoros (Stesichorus) of Himera began this type of lyric poetry.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 4. 275 ff (trans. Brookes More) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The amours of the shepherd Daphnis, known to many of you, I shall not relate; the shepherd Daphnis of\n        Mount Ida, who was turned to stone obdurate, for the Nymphe whose love he slighted--so the rivalry of love\n        neglected rouses to revenge.\"\n\nDaphnis was a stock character in bucolic poetry. In the Idylls of Theocritus, he is a rustic herdsman,\n        who competes with Menalkas in song. The poems contain a few mythological references:--he is described as a son\n        of Hermes, marries a Naias (Naiad-nymph), loves the girl Xenea, is blinded by the nymphe, and dies a tragic\n        death. Virgil, in his Eclogues, sings of the hero's apotheosis.\n\nTheocritus, Idylls 1. 18 & 65 - 145 (trans. Edmonds) (Greek bucolic C3rd B.C.)\n          :\n        [Synopsis : Thyrsis sings The Affliction of Daphnis, a ballad which tells how Daphnis, having vowed to\n        his first love that she should be his last, pined and died for the love of another. The ballad is divided into\n        three parts. The first part, after a complaint to the Nymphai (Nymphs) of their neglect, tells how the herds and\n        the herdsmen gathered about the dying man, and Hermes his father, and Priapos the country-god of fertility whom\n        he had flouted, came and spoke and got no answer. In the second part, the slighted Aphrodite comes, and gently\n        upbraids him, whereat he breaks silence with a threat of vengeance after death. In the third part the bequeaths\n        his pipe to Pan, ends his dying speech with an address to all Nature, and is overwhelmed at last in the river of\n        Death.]\n        \"Goatherd : But for singing, you, Thyrsis, used to sing The Affliction of Daphnis as well as any\n        man; you are no 'prentice in the art of country music . . . \n        Thyrsis (sings) : Country-song, sing country-song, sweet Moisai (Muses).\n        'Tis Thyrsis sings, of Aitna (Etna), and a rare sweet voice hath he.

Both had ruddy heads, both were striplings grown, both were players of music, and both knew how to\n        sing. Looking now towards Daphnis, Menalkas first ‘What, Daphnis,’ cries he, ‘thou watchman o'\n        bellowing kine, art thou willing to sing me somewhat? I'll warrant, come my turn, I shall have as much the\n        better of thee as I choose.’ And this was Daphnis' answer : ‘Thou shepherd o' woolly sheep, thou\n        mere piper Menalkas, never shall the likes of thee have the better of me in song, strive he never so\n        hard.’\n        Menalkas : Then will 't please you look hither?

Father and mother are both sour as can be, and tell the flock to head\n        every night.\n        Daphnis : Well, but what is't to be? and what's the winner to get for's pains?\n        Menalkas : Here's a gallant nine-stop pipe I have made, with good white beeswax the same top and bottom; this\n        I'm willing to lay, but I'll not stake what is my father's.\n        Daphnis : Marry, I have a nine-stop pipe likewise, and it like yours hath good white beeswax the same top and\n        bottom. I made it t'other day, and my finer here sore yet where a split reed cut it for me. (Each takes a\n          pipe,)\n        Menalkas : But who's to be our judge? who's to do the hearing for us?\n        Dapnnis : Peradventure that goatherd yonder, if we call him; him wi' that spotted flock-dog a-barking near by\n        the kids.\n        So the lads holla'd, and the goatherd came to hear them, the lads sang and the goatherd was fain to be their\n        judge. Lots were cast, and 'twas Menalkas Loud-o'-voice to begin the country-song and Daphnis to take him up by\n        course. Menalkas thus began:\n        Menalkas : Ye woods and waters, wondrous race, lith and listen of your grace; if e'er my son was your delight\n        feed my lambs with all your might; and if Daphnis wend this way, make his calves as fat as they.\n        Daphnis : Ye darling wells and meadows dear, sweets o' the earth, come lend an ear; if like the nightingales I\n        sing, give my cows good pasturing; and if Menalcas e'er you see, fill his block and make him glee.\n        Menalkas : Where sweet Milon trips the leas there's fuller hives and loftier trees; where'er those pretty\n        footings fall goats and sheep come twinners all; if otherwhere those feet be gone, pasture's lean and shepherd\n        lone.\n        Daphnis : Where sweet Naïs [Naiad-nymph] comes a-straying there the green meads go a-maying; where'er her\n        pathway lies along, there's springing teats and growing young; if otherwhere her gate be gone, cows are dry and\n        herd fordone.\n        Menalkas : Buck-goat, husband of the she's, hie to th' wood's infinities--nay, snubbies, hither to the spring;\n        this errand's not for your running;--go buck, and ‘Fairest Milon’ say, ‘a god kept seals' once\n        on a day.’\n        Daphnis : [Daphnis' reply is lost.]\n        Menalkas : I would not Pelops' tilth untold nor all Kroisos' (Croesus') coffered gold, nor yet t' outfoot the\n        storm-wind's breath, so I may sit this rock beneath, pretty pasture-mate, wi' thee, and gaze on the Sicilian\n        sea.\n        Daphnis : Wood doth fear the tempest's ire, water summer's drouthy fire, beasts the net and birds the snare. Man\n        the love of maiden fair; not I alone lie under ban; Zeus himself's a woman's man.\n        So far went the lads' songs by course. Now 'twas the envoy, and Menalkas thus began :\n        Menalkas : Spare, good Wolf, the goats you see, spare them dam and kid for me; ff flock is great and flockman\n        small, is't reason you should wrong us all? Come, White-tail, why so sound asleep? Good dogs wake when boys tend\n        sheep. Fear not, ewes, your fill to eat; for when the new blade sprouteth sweet, then ye shall no losers be;\n        to't, and fed you every she, feed till every udder teem store for lambs and store for cream.\n        Then Daphnis, for his envoy, lifted up his tuneful voice, singing--\n        Daphnis : Yestermorn a long-browed maid, spying from a rocky shade neat and neatherd passing by, cries\n        ‘What a pretty boy am I!’ Did pretty boy the jape repay : Nay, bent his head and went his way. Sweet\n        to hear and sweet to smell, god wot I love a heifer well, and sweet alsó 'neath summer sky to sit where\n        brooks go babbling by; but 'tis berry and bush, 'tis fruit and tree, 'tis calf and cow, wi' my kine and me.\n        So sang those two lads, and this is what the goatherd said of their songs : ‘You, good Daphnis, have a\n        sweet and delightful voice. Your singing is to the ear as honey to the lip. Here's the pipe; take it; your song\n        has fairly won it you. And if you are willing to teach me how to sing while I share pasture with you, you shall\n        have the little she-goat yonder to your school-money, and I warrant you she'll fill your pail up the brim and\n        further.’\n        At that the lad was transported, and capered and clapped hands for joy of his victory; so capers a fawn at the\n        sight of his dam. At that, too, the other's fire was utterly extinct, and his heart turned upside-down for\n        grief; so mourns a maiden that is forced against her will.\n        From that day forth Daphnis had the pre-eminence of the shepherds, insomuch that he was scarce come to man's\n        estate ere he had to wife that Naïs of whom he sang.\"\n\nTheocritus, Idylls 9 :\n        [The Third Country Singing-Match. Daphnis and Menalkas compete in a singing contest.]\n        \"Sing a country-song, Daphnis. Be you the first and Menalkas (Menalcas) follow when you have let out the\n        calves to run with the cows and the bulls with the barren heifers. As for the cattle, may they feed together and\n        wander together among the leaves and never stray alone, but do you come and sing me your song on this side, and\n        Menalkas stand for judgment against you on that. \n        Daphnis (sings) : O sweet the cry o' the calf, and sweet the cry o' the cow, and sweet he tune o' the\n        neatherd's pipe, and I sing sweet enow; and a greenbed's mine by the cool brook-side piled thick and thick with\n        many a hide from the pretty heifers wi' skin so white which the storm found browsing on the height and hurled\n        them all below : and as much reck I o' the scorching heat as a love-struck lad of his father's threat.\n        So sang me Daphnis, and then Menalkas thus :--\n        Menalkas (sings) : Aitna (Etna), mother o' mine! my shelter it is a grot, a pretty rift in a hollow\n        clift, and for skins to my bed, god wot, head and foot 'tis goats and sheep as many as be in a vision o' sleep,\n        and an oaken fire i' the winter days with chestnuts roasting at the blaze and puddings in the pot : and as\n        little care I for the wintry sky as the toothless for nuts when porridge is by.\n        Then clapped I the lads both, and then and there gave them each a gift, Daphnis a club which grew upon my\n        father's farm and e'en the same as it grew--albeit an artificer could not make one to match it--, and Menalkas a\n        passing fine conch, of which the fish when I took it among the Icarian rocks furnished five portions for five\n        mouths,--and he blew a blast upon the shell.\n        All hail, good Moisai (Muses) o' the countryside (boukolikai)! and the song I did sing that day before\n        those herdsmen, let it no longer raise pushes on the tip o' my tongue, but show it me you:\n        (the song) O cricket is to cricket dear, and ant for ant doth long, the hawk's the darling of his fere,\n        and o' me the Moise (Muse) and her song : of songs be my house the home away, for neither sleep, nor a sudden\n        spring-day, nor flowers to the bees, are as sweet as they; I love the Moise and her song : for any the Moisai be\n        glad to see, is proof agen Kirkè's (Circe's) witcheyre.\"\n\nTheocritus, Idylls 27 :\n        [The Lover's Talk.

The secret bridal over, she rose and went her ways for\n        to feed her sheep, her look shamefast but her heart glad within her; while as for him, he betook himself to his\n        herds of bulls rejoicing in his wedlock.\n        The Umpire [addresses the shepherd who has sung this song of Daphnis and Akrotime] : Here, take the pipe, thou\n        happy shepherd; 'tis thine once more; and so let's hear and consider another of the tunes of the leaders o'\n        sheep.\"\n\nTheocritus, Inscriptions 2 :\n        \"[Inscription for a picture :] These stopped reeds, this hurl-bat, this sharp javelin, this fawnskin, and\n        this wallet he used to carry apples in, are an offering unto Pan from the fair-skinned Daphnis, who piped the\n        music o' the country upon this pretty flute.\"\n\nTheocritus, Inscriptions 3 :\n        \"[Inscription for a picture :] You sleep there upon the leaf-strown earth, good Daphnis, and rest your\n        weary frame, while your netting-stakes are left planted on the hillside. But Pan is after you, and Priapos also,\n        with the yellow ivy about his jolly head; they are going side by side into your cave. Quick then, put off the\n        lethargy that is shed of sleep, and up with you and away.\"\n\nTheocritus, Inscriptions 5 :\n        \"'Fore the Nymphai (Nymphs) I pray you play me some sweet thing upon the double pipe, and I will take my\n        viol and strike up likewise, and neatherd Daphnis shall join with us and make charming music with the notes of\n        his wax-bound breath; and so standing beside the shaggy oak behind the cave, let's rob you goat-foot Pan of his\n        slumber.\"\n\nSositheus, Daphnis (lost play) (Greek drama C3rd B.C.) :\n        Sositheus--a poet of Syracuse, Athens or Alexandreia in the Troad--was the author a pastoral play entitled\n        Daphnis. Presumably it told the story of the Sicilian hero in the manner of the poet Theocritus.\n\nVirgil, Eclogues 2. 27 ff (trans. Fairclough) (Roman bucolic C1st B.C.) :\n        \"[A rustic sings to his lover :] With you for judge, I should fear not Daphnis, if the mirror never\n        lies!\" [N.B. By \"fear not Daphnis\" the rustic means his beloved would not betray him even for one\n        so handsome as the legendary Daphnis.]\n\nVirgil, Eclogues 3. 12 ff :\n        \"Damoetas : Or was it when, by these old beeches, you broke Daphnis' bow and arrows; for you were vexed,\n        spiteful Menalcas, when you saw them given to the boy, and if you hadn't hurt him somehow, you'd have\n        died.\" [N.B. Menalcus is Daphnis' rival in the Idylls of Theocritus.]\n\nVirgil, Eclogues 5. 1 - 80 :\n        \"Menalcus : Mopsus, now that we have met, good men both, you at blowing on the slender reeds, I at singing\n        verses--why don't we sit together here, where hazels mix with elms? . . .\n        Mopsus (sings) : ‘For Daphnis, cut off by a cruel death, the Nymphae wept--you hazels and rivers\n        bear witness to the Nymphae--when, clasping her son's piteous corpse, his mother cried out on the cruelty of\n        both gods and stars. On those days, Daphnis, none drove the pastured kine to the cool streams; no four-footed\n        beast tasted the brook or touched a blade of grass. Daphnis, the wild mountains and woods tell us that even\n        African lions moaned over your death. Daphnis it was that taught men to yoke Armenian tigers beneath the car, to\n        lead on the dances of Bacchus and entwine in soft leaves the tough spears. As the vine gives glory to its trees,\n        as the grape to the vines, as the bull to the herd, as the corn to rich fields, you alone give glory to your\n        people. Since the Fates bore you off, even Pales has left our fields, and even Apollo. Often in the furrows, to\n        which we entrusted the big barley grains, luckless darnel springs up and barren oat straws. Instead of the soft\n        violet, instead of the gleaming narcissus, the thistle rises up and the sharp-spiked thorn. Strew the turf with\n        leaves, shepherds, curtain the springs with shade--such honours Daphnis charges you to pay him. And build a\n        tomb, and on the tomb place, too, this verse : \"Daphnis was I amid the woods, known from here even to the\n        stars. Fair was my flock, but fairer I, their shepherd.\"’\n        Menalcas : Your lay, heavenly bard, is to me even as sleep on the grass to the weary . . . Still I will sing you\n        in turn, poorly it may be, this strain of mine, and exalt your Daphnis to the stars. Daphnis I will exalt to the\n        stars; me, too, Daphnis loved . . . \n        Menalcas (sings) : ‘Daphnis, in radiant beauty, marvels at Heaven's unfamiliar threshold, and\n        beneath his feet beholds the clouds and stars [i.e. after death he joined the gods of heaven]. Therefore frolic\n        glee seizes the woods and all the countryside, and Pan, and the shepherds, and the Dryad maids. The wolf plans\n        no ambush for the flock, and nets no snare for the stag; kindly Daphnis loves peace. The very mountains, with\n        woods unshorn, joyously fling their voices starward; the very rocks, the very groves ring out the song : \"A\n        god is he, a god, Menalcas!\" Be kind and gracious to your own! Lo here are four altars--two, see, for you,\n        Daphnis; two for Phoebus [Apollon]! Two cups, foaming with fresh milk, will I year by year set up for you, and\n        two bowls of rich olive oil; and, for my chief care, making the feast merry with wine--in winter, before the\n        hearth; in harvest time, in the shade--I will pour from goblets fresh nectar of Chian wine. Damoetas and Lyctian\n        Aegon shall sing for me, and Alphesiboeus mimic the dance of Satyri (Satyrs). These rites shall be yours for\n        ever, both when we pay our yearly vows to the Nymphs, and when we purify our fields. So long as the boar loves\n        the mountaintops, and the fish the streams; so long as the bees feed on thyme and the cicadas on dew--so long\n        shall your honour, name, and glory abide. As to Bacchus [Dionysos] and Ceres [Demeter], so to you, year after\n        year, shall the husbandmen pay their vows; you, too, shall hold them to their vows.’\"\n\nVirgil, Eclogues 7. 1 ff :\n        \"Meliboeus : Daphnis, it chanced had made his seat beneath a whispering ilex, while Corydon and Thyrsis had\n        driven their flocks together--Thyrsis his sheep, Corydon his goats swollen with milk--both in the bloom of life,\n        Arcadians both, ready in a singing match to start, ready to make reply . . . and I catch sight of Daphnis. As he\n        in turn saw me, ‘Quick,’ he cries, ‘come hither, Meliboeus; your goat and kids are safe, and\n        if you can idle awhile, pray rest beneath the shade. Hither your steers will of themselves come over the meadows\n        to drink; here Mincius fringes his green banks with waving reeds, and from the hallowed oak swarm humming\n        bees.’\"\n\nN.B. Daphnis also occurs in the refrain of Virgil's 8th Eclogue.\n\nFor more bucolic poetry see :--\n        The Idylls of Theocritus, The Poems\n          of Moschus, and Virgil's Eclogues\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
