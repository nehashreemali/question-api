  "content": "SALMONEUS was one of the seven sons of King Aiolos (Aeolus) of Thessalia who led a group of colonists to the\n        Peloponnese where he established the kingdom of Salmonia in the region later known as Pylos (in southern Elis\n        and north-western Messenia).\n\nSalmoneus was an arrogant, impious man who demanded his people worship him as the god Zeus. He impersonated the\n        deity by driving around in a chariot dragging bronze kettles to make thunder and casting torches in the air as\n        faux-lightning. Zeus was enraged and struck Salmoneus dead with a thunderbolt and laid waste to his city. Later\n        Salmoneus' grandson Neleus came to the region, claimed the throne and founded a new capital at Pylos.\n\nIn the chronology of myth Salmoneus was the great-grandson of Deukalion\n          (Deucalion), survivor of the Great Deluge.\n        His contemporaries included King Perseus of Argos and Kadmos (Cadmus) of\n        Thebes--daughters of these two hero-kings married his brothers. His nephew Endymion\n        ruled the neighbouring kingdom of Elis, north of the river Alpheios.\n        Of Salmoneus' descendants, his grandson Neleus fought a war with Herakles, and another, Pelias, commanded Jason\n        fetch the Golden Fleece.\n        His great-grandsons included the seer Melampos, and the Argonauts Jason, Akastos, Admetos, Iphiklos and\n        Periklymenos.\n        His great-grandson Nestor and many of his great-great-grandsons (i.e. the sons of the Argonauts) were leaders of\n        the Greek army at Troy.\n\n[1.1] AIOLOS (Hesiod Catalogues Frag 4, Diodorus Siculus 4.68.1, Hyginus Fabulae 60,\n          Hyginus Astronomica 2.20)\n        [1.2] AIOLOS & ENARETE (Apollodorus 1.7.3)\n        [2.1] ATHAMAS (Hyginus Astronomica 2.20)\n\n[1.1] TYRO (Homer Odyssey 11.236, Hesiod\n          Catalogues Frag 13, Strabo 8.3.32, Pausanias 10.29.7, Hyginus Fabulae 60 & 239)\n        [1.2] TYRO (by Alkidike) (Apollodorus 1.9.8,\n          Diodorus Siculus 4.68.1)\n\nSALMONEUS (Salmôneus), a son of Aeolus by Enarete, and a brother of Sisyphus. (Apollod. i. 7. § 3;\n        Schol. ad Pind. Pyth. iv. 252.) He was first married to Alcidice and afterwards to Sidero; by the\n        former wife he was the father of Tyro. (Hom. Od. xi. 235; Apollod. i. 9. § 8 ; Diod. iv. 68.) He\n        originally lived in Thessaly, but emigrated to Elis, where he built the town of Salmone. (Strab. viii. p. 356.)\n        He there went so far in his presumption and arrogance, that he deemed himself equal to Zeus, and ordered\n        sacrifices to be offered to himself; nay, he even imitated the thunder and lightning of Zeus, but the father of\n        the gods killed the presumptuous man with his thunderbolt, destroyed his town, and punished him in the lower\n        world.

He also wrote two tragedies on Tyro--Tyro\n          Keiromene (the Shorn) and Tyro Anagnorizomene ( Rediscovered)--which probably featured Salmoneus\n        or contained references to his story.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 7. 3 (trans. Frazer) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Aiolos (Aeolus) reigned over the regions about Thessalia (Thessaly) and named the inhabitants Aiolians\n        (Aeolians). He married Enarete, daughter of Deimakhos (Deimachus), and begat seven sons, Kretheus (Cretheus),\n        Sisyphos, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, Magnes, Perieres, and five daughters, Kanake (Canace), Alkyone (Alcyone),\n        Peisidike (Pisidice), Kalyke (Calyce), Perimede.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 9. 7 - 8 :\n        \"Salmoneus at first dwelt in Thessalia (Thessaly), but afterwards he came to Elis and there founded a city.\n        And being arrogant and wishful to put himself on an equality with Zeus, he was punished for his impiety; for he\n        said that he was himself Zeus, and he took away the sacrifices of the god and ordered them to be offered to\n        himself; and by dragging dried hides, with bronze kettles, at his chariot, he said that he thundered, and by\n        flinging lighted torches at the sky he said that he lightened. But Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt, and wiped\n        out the city he had founded with all its inhabitants.\n        Now Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus and Alkidice (Alcidice), was brought up by Kretheus (Cretheus), brother of\n        Salmoneus, and conceived a passion for the river Enipeus . . . Poseidon in the likeness of Enipeus lay with her,\n        and she secretly gave birth to twin sons [Neleus and Pelias].\"\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 9. 11 :\n        \"Kretheus (Cretheus) founded Iolkos (Iolcus) and married Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus, by whom he had sons,\n        Aison (Aeson), Amythaon, and Pheres.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 68. 1 - 3 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"We shall endeavour to set forth the facts concerning Salmoneus and Tyro and their descendants as far as\n        Nestor, who took part in the campaign against Troy. Salmoneus was a son of Aiolos (Aeolus), who was the son of\n        Hellen, who was the son of Deukalion (Deucalion), and settling out from Aiolis (Aeolis) with a number of\n        Aiolians he founded a city in Eleia [Elis] on the banks of the river Alpheios (Alpheus) and called it Salmonia\n        after his own name. And marrying Alkidicê (Alcidice), the daughter of Aleus, he begat by her a daughter,\n        her who was given the name Tyro, a maiden of surpassing beauty.\n        When his wife Alkidicê died Salmoneus took for a second wife Sidero, as she was called, who treated Tyro\n        unkindly, as a step-mother would. Afterwards Salmoneus, being an overbearing man and impious, came to be hated\n        by his subjects and because of his impiety was slain by Zeus with a bolt of lightning.\n        As for Tyro, who was still a virgin when this took place, Poseidon lay with her and begat two sons, Pelias and\n        Neleus. Then Tyro married Kretheus (Cretheus) and bore Amythaon and Pheres and Aison (Aeson).\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 6. 6. 4 - 5 :\n        \"Salmoneus was impious and arrogant and made it his practice to ridicule the divinity, and he declared that\n        his achievements excelled those of Zeus. Consequently he used to make a tremendous noise by means of a machine\n        he contrived and to imitate in this way peals of thunder, and he would celebrate neither sacrifices nor\n        festivals. The same Salmoneus had a daughter named Tyro, who received this name by reason of the whiteness and\n        softness of her body.\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 6. 7. 1 - 3 :\n        \"For Salmoneus, being impious and arrogant, made it his practice to ridicule the divinity and to declare\n        that his achievements excelled those of Zeus; consequently he used to make a tremendous noise by means of a\n        machine he contrived, and by imitating claps of thunder he would declare that he had thundered more loudly than\n        Zeus. Speaking generally, in his mockery of the gods he would celebrate neither sacrifices nor festivals in\n        their honour, as the other rulers were accustomed to do.\n        And there was born to him an only daughter, Tyro, to whom he thought this name was appropriate by reason of the\n        softness of her body and the whiteness of her skin. Poseidon became enamoured of this maiden because of her\n        beauty, and lying with her he begat Pelias and Neleus. And Salmoneus, not believing that it was Poseidon who had\n        taken her virginity, would not leave off ill-treating Tyro; but in the end he paid the penalty to the deity for\n        his impiety, ending his life when struck by lightning from the hand of Zeus.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 8. 3. 32 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The town of] Salmone [in Triphylia, Elis] is situated near the spring of that name from which flows the\n        Enipeus River. The river empties into the Alpheios (Alpheus), and is now called the Barnikhios (Barnichius). It\n        is said that Tyro fell in love with Enipeus : ‘She loved a river, the divine Enipeus.’ For there [in\n        southern Elis], it is said, her father Salmoneus reigned, just as Euripides also says in his Aiolos.\n        Some write the name of the river in Thessalia (Thessaly) ‘Eniseus’; it flows from Mount Othrys, and\n        receives the Apidanos, which flows down out of Pharsalos.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 10. 29. 7 :\n        \"[In a painting of the underworld by Polygnotos at Delphoi, C5th B.C. :] The daughter [Tyro] of Salmoneus\n        sitting on a rock.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 60 (trans.
