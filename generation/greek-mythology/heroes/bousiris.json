  "content": "BOUSIRIS (Busiris) was a king of Aigyptos (Egypt) who took to sacrificing foreigners to the gods when an oracle\n        revealed that this would bring an end to the eight-year drought afflicting his realm. As Herakles was travelling\n        through the region in his quest for the golden apples, he was seized by the king's men and brought before the\n        altar. Before he could be sacrificed, however, the hero broke free of his bonds and slew the barbarous king.\n\n[1.1] POSEIDON & LYSIANASSA (Apollodorus\n          2.5.11)\n        [1.2] POSEIDON & ANIPPE\n        (Plutarch Parallel Stories 38)\n        [1.3] POSEIDON (Hyginus Fabulae 56)\n\n[1.1] AMPHIDAMAS (Apollodorus 2.5.11)\n        [2.1] MELITE (Hyginus Fabulae 157)\n\nBUSIRIS (Bousiris), according to Apollodorus (ii. 5. § 11), a son of Poseidon and Lysianassa, the daughter\n        of Epaphus. Concerning this Busiris the following remarkable story is told:--Egypt had been visited for nine\n        years by uninterrupted scarcity, and at last there came a soothsayer from Cyprus of the name of Phrasius, who\n        declared, that the scarcity would cease if the Egyptians would sacrifice a foreigner to Zeus every year. Busiris\n        made the beginning with the prophet himself, and afterwards sacrificed all the foreigners that entered Egypt.\n        Heracles on his arrival in Egypt was likewise seized and led to the altar, but he broke his chains and slew\n        Busiris, together with his son Amphidamas or Iphidamas, and his herald Chalbes. (Apollod. l. c.; Schol.\n        ad Apollon. iv. 1396; comp. Herod. ii. 45; Gell. ii. 6; Macrob. Sat. vi. 7; Hygin.\n        Fab. 31.) This story gave rise to various disputes in later times, when a friendly intercourse between\n        Greece and Egypt was established, both nations being anxious to do away with the stigma it attached to the\n        Egyptians. Herodotus (l. c.) expressly denies that the Egyptians ever offered human sacrifices, and\n        Isocrates (Bus. 15) endeavours to upset the story by showing, that Heracles must have lived at a much\n        later time than Busiris. Others again said, that it was a tale invented to shew up the inhospitable character of\n        the inhabitants of the town of Busiris, and that there never was a king of that name. (Strab. xvii. p. 802.)\n\nSource: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\n\nEuripides, Busiris (lost play) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.) :\n        Euripides dramatized the story of Herakles and Bousiris in a lost satyr-play.\n\nPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 5. 11 (trans. Frazer) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Herakles (Heracles) travelled across North Africa in his quest for the golden apples of the Hesperides :]\n        After Libya he traversed Aigyptos (Egypt). That country was then ruled by Bousiris (Busiris), a son of Poseidon\n        by Lysianassa, daughter of Epaphos. This Bousiris used to sacrifice strangers on an altar of Zeus in accordance\n        with a certain oracle. For Aigyptos was visited with dearth for nine years, and Phrasios (Phrasius), a learned\n        seer who had come from Kypros (Cyprus), said that the dearth would cease if they slaughtered a stranger man in\n        honor of Zeus every year. Bousiris began by slaughtering the seer himself and continued to slaughter the\n        strangers who landed. So Herakles also was seized and haled to the altars, but he burst his bonds and slew both\n        Bousiris and his son Amphidamas.\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 2. 45. 1 - 2 (trans. Godley) (Greek historian C5th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"And the Greeks say many other ill-considered things, too; among them, this is a silly story which they\n        tell about Herakles : that when he came to Egypt, the Egyptians crowned him and led him out in a procession to\n        sacrifice him to Zeus; and for a while (they say) he followed quietly, but when they started in on him at the\n        altar, he resisted and killed them all. Now it seems to me that by this story the Greeks show themselves\n        altogether ignorant of the character and customs of the Egyptians; for how should they sacrifice men when they\n        are forbidden to sacrifice even beasts, except swine and bulls and bull-calves, if they are unblemished, and\n        geese?\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 18. 1 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"After Herakles had slain Antaios (Antaeus) [in Libya] he passed into Aigyptos (Egypt) and put to death\n        Bousiris (Busiris), the king of the land, who made it his practice to kill the strangers who visited that\n        country.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 4. 27. 2 - 3 :\n        [In this late classical rationalisation of the Hesperides myth, the nymphs are described as daughters of a local\n        king named Atlas, and the golden apples are replaced by golden sheep. Herakles travels to Egypt to rescue the\n        maidens who have been kidnapped by King Bousiris. It should be noted that this version of the story is far\n        removed from traditional Greek mythology.]\n        \"Hesperos (Hesperus) begat a daughter named Hesperis, whom he gave in marriage to his brother [Atlas] and\n        after whom the land was given the name Hesperitis; and Atlas begat by her seven daughters, who were named after\n        their father Atlantides, and after their mother, Hesperides. And since these Atlantides excelled in beauty and\n        chastity, Bousiris (Busiris) the king of the Egyptians, the account says, was seized with the desire to get the\n        maidens into his power; and consequently he dispatched pirates by sea with orders to seize the girls and deliver\n        them into his hands.\n        About this time Herakles, while engaged in the performance of his last Labour [the quest for the golden\n        ‘sheep’ of the Hesperides], slew in Libya Antaios (Antaeus), who was compelling all strangers to\n        wrestle with him, and upon Bousiris in Aigyptos (Egypt), who was sacrificing to Zeus the strangers who visited\n        his country, he inflicted the punishment which he deserved. After this Herakles sailed up Neilos (the Nile) into\n        Aithiopia (Ethiopia), where he slew Emathion, the king of the Aithiopes, who had made battle with him\n        unprovoked, and then returned to the completion of his last Labour.\"\n\nPlutarch, Life of Theseus 11. 1 (trans.
