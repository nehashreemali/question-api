When Herakles attacked the\n        kingdom, Periklymenos assumed the form of a lion, an ant, a snake, a swarm of bees and an eagle, but was\n        nevertheless vanquished by the hero.\n\nPeriklymenos was also numbered amongst the Argonauts but had no role to play in the story besides a mention in\n        the list of fifty heroes.\n\n[1.1] NELEUS & KHLORIS (Homer Odyssey 11.281, Apollodorus 1.9.9, Diodorus\n          Siculus 4.68.6, Hyginus Fabulae 10 & 14)\n        [1.2] NELEUS (Apollonius Rhodius 1.156, Ovid Metamorphoses 12.540, Valerius Flaccus\n          1.387)\n        [2.1] POSEIDON & ASTYPALE (Hyginus Fabulae\n          157)\n        [2.2] POSEIDON (Seneca Medea 634)\n\nPERICLYMENUS (Periklumenos), one of the Argonauts, was a son of Neleus and Chloris, and a brother of Nestor.\n        (Hom. Od. xi. 285 ; Apollod. i. 9. § 15; Orph. Argon. 155.) Poseidon gave him the power\n        of changing himself into different forms, and conferred upon him great strength, but he was nevertheless slain\n        by Heracles at the taking of Pylos. (Apollod. i. 9. § 9, ii. 7. § 3 ; Apollon. Rhod. i. 156 with the\n        Schol.; Ov. Met. xiii. 556, &c.; Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1685.)

Youngest daughter was she of\n        Amphion, son of Iasos, who once ruled mightily in Orkhomenos (Orchomenus) of the Minyai. And she was queen of\n        Pylos, and bore to her husband glorious children, Nestor, and Khromios (Chromius), and lordly Periklymenos\n        (Periclymenus), and besides these she bore noble Pero, a wonder to men.\"\n\nHomer, Iliad 11. 688 ff (trans.

For Herakles (Heracles) had come in his strength against us and beaten us in the years before, and\n        all the bravest among us had been killed. For we who were sons of lordly Neleus had been twelve, and now I alone\n        was left of these, and all the others had perished.’\" [N.B.

And he says as follows : ‘. . and\n        lordly Periklymenos. Happy he! For earth-shaking Poseidon gave him all manner of gifts. At one time he would\n        appear among birds, an eagle; and again at another he would be an ant, a marvel to see; and then a shining swarm\n        of bees; and again at another time a dread relentless snake.

Brookes More) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Nestor had hardly told this marvellous tale of bitter strife betwixt the Lapithae (Lapiths) and those\n        half-human, vanquished Centauri (Centaurs), when Tlepolemus [son of Heracles], incensed because no word of\n        praise was given to Hercules [Heracles], replied in this way; ‘Old sir, it is very strange, you have\n        neglected to say one good word in praise of Hercules. My father told me often, that he overcame in battle those\n        cloud born Centauri.’\n        Nestor, very loth, replied, ‘Why force me to recall old wrongs, to uncover sorrow buried by the years,\n        that made me hate your father? It is true his deeds were wonderful beyond belief, heaven knows, and filled the\n        earth with well earned praise which I should rather wish might be denied . . . Your father, I recall once\n        overthrew Messene's walls and with no cause destroyed Elis and Pylos and with fire and sword ruined my own loved\n        home. I cannot name all whom he killed. But there were twelve of us, the sons of Neleus and all warrior youths,\n        and all those twelve but me alone he killed. Ten of them met the common fate of war, but sadder was the death of\n        Periclymenus. Neptunus [Poseidon], the founder of my family, had granted him a power to assume whatever shape he\n        chose, and when he wished to lay that shape aside. When he, in vain, had been transformed to many other shapes\n        he turned into the form of that bird, which is wont to carry in his crooked talons the forked lightnings,\n        favorite bird of Jove [Zeus]. With wings and crooked bill and sharp-hooked talons, he assailed and tore the face\n        of Hercules. But, when he soared away on eagle wings up to the clouds and hovered, poised in air, that hero\n        aimed his too unerring bow and hit him where the new wing joined his side. The wound was not large, but his\n        sinews cut failed to uphold him, and denied his wings their strength and motion. He fell down to earth; his\n        weakened pinions could not catch the air. And the sharp arrow, which had lightly pierced the wing, was driven\n        upward through the side into the left part of my brother's neck. O noble leader of the Rhodian fleet, why should\n        I sing the praise of Hercules? But for my brothers I take no revenge except withholding praise of his great\n        deeds. With you, my friendship will remain secure.’\"\n\nValerius Flaccus, Argonautica 1. 387 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"[The catalogue of Argonauts :] On Hercules' [Heracles] side too Tydeus rises to his oar, and Periclymenus,\n        son of Neleus, whom small Methone and Elis rich in horses and Aulon exposed to the waves saw break his\n        adversary's face with the gauntlets.\"\n\nSeneca, Medea 634 ff (trans. Miller) (Roman tragedy C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Alcides [Heracles] laid low the sons of Aquilo [i.e. the Boreades], he slew Neptunus' [Poseidon's] son\n        [i.e. Periclymenus] wont to take upon him countless shapes.\"\n\nThe Ancient Scholia (from Frazer's notes on Apollodorus) :\n        In the verses of Hesiod quoted by the Scholiast on Ap. Rhod., Argon. i.156, Periklymenos received from\n        Poseidon the power of turning himself into an eagle, an ant, a bee, or a snake; but Herakles, so says the\n        scholiast, killed him with a blow of his club when he had assumed the form of a fly. According to another\n        account, it was in the form of a bee that Periklymenos was slain by Herakles (Eustathius on Hom. Od.\n        xi.285, pp. 1685ff.; Scholiast on Hom. Il. ii.336). Ov. Met. 12.549ff. says that Herakles shot\n        him in the shape of an eagle, and this version is followed by Hyginus, Fab. 10. Periklymenos is also\n        reported to have been able to change himself into any animal or tree he pleased (Eustathius, on Hom.\n        Od. xi.285, pp. 1685ff.; Scholiast on Hom. Od. xi.286).\n\nOther references not currently quoted here: Scholiast on Homer's Iliad 11.690, Scholiast on Apollonius\n          Rhodius' Argonautica 1.156, Eustathius on Homer's Odyssey 11.285.\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
