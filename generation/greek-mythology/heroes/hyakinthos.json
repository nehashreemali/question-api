  "content": "HYAKINTHOS (Hyacinthus) was a handsome young Spartan prince loved by the gods Apollon and Zephyros. The\n        West-Wind, however, grew jealous of his rival in love and one day, as the pair were playing discus, blew the\n        discus off course causing it to strike Hyakinthos in the head killing him. The grieving Apollon then transformed\n        the dying youth into a larkspur flower (hyakinthos in Greek) which he inscribed with the wail of\n        mourning \"AI, AI.\"\n\nThe Thessalians had their own version of Hyakinthos who they also named Hymenaios \"Of the Hymns.\" As\n        with his female counterpart, Apollon's love Daphne, the northern\n        Hyakinthos was associated with the Vale of Tempe--seat of Apollon's cult in the region. His father was named as\n        either King Magnes of Magnesia or King Pieros of Pieria who ruled the two regions adjacent to the vale. Even the\n        Spartans seemed to acknowledge this tradition when they describe their Hyakinthos as the son of the Lapith\n        princess Diomede of Thessalia.\n\nIn the chronology of myth Hyakinthos was a very early figure. His grandfather Lakedaimon (Lacedaemon) was the\n        very first king of Lakedaimonia--the Spartan kingdom--who probably reigned shortly after the Great Deluge. His\n        great-nephew Oibalos (Oebalus) was a contemporary of the Aiolides who established kingdoms throughout the\n        Peloponessos--namely Perieres, Salmoneus, Sisyphos, and Endymion.\n        According to Parthenius, Apollon's famous love Daphne was a daughter\n        of Amyklas and therefore sister of Hyakinthos.\n\n[1.1] MAGNES (Hesiod Great Eoiae Frag 16)\n        [2.1] PIEROS & KLEIO (Apollodorus\n          1.16)\n        [3.1] DIOMEDE (Hesiod Catalogues Frag 102)\n        [3.2] AMYKLAS & DIOMEDE (Apollodorus 3.116)\n        [3.3] AMYKLAS (Pausanias 3.1.3, Ovid Metamorphoses 10.162)\n        [4.1] OIBALOS (Lucian Dialogues of the Gods 16, Philostratus Elder 1.14, Hyginus\n          Fabulae 271, Ovid Metamorphoses 10.162 & 13.395)\n\n[1.1] ANTHEIS, AIGLEIS, LYTAIA, ORTHAIA (Apollodorus 3.15.8)\n        [1.2] ANTHEIS (Hyginus Fabulae 238)\n        [1.3] THE HYAKINTHIDES (Harpocration s.v Hyacinthides)\n\nHYACINTHUS (Huakinthos). 1. The youngest son of the Spartan king Amyclas and Diomede (Apollod. iii. 10. §\n        3; Paus. iii. 1. § 3, 19. § 4), but according to others a son of Pierus and Clio, or of Oebalus or\n        Eurotas (Lucian, Dial. Deor. 14; Hygin. Fab. 271.) He was a youth of extraordinary beauty, and\n        beloved by Thamyris and Apollo, who unintentionally killed him during a game of discus. (Apollod. i. 3. §\n        3.) Some traditions relate that he was beloved also by Boreas or Zephyrus, who, from jealousy of Apollo, drove\n        the discus of the god against the head of the youth, and thus killed him. (Lucian, l. c; Serv. ad\n          Virg. Eclog. iii. 63; Philostr. Imag. i.24; Ov. Met. x. 184.) From the blood of\n        Hyacinthus there sprang the flower of the same name (hyacinth), on the leaves of which there appeared the\n        exclamation of woe AI, AI, or the letter U, being the initial of Huakinthos. According to other traditions, the\n        hyacinth (on the leaves of which, howeve those characters do not appear) sprang from the blood of Ajax. (Schol.\n        ad Theocrit. x. 28; comp. Ov. Met. xiii. 395, &c., who combines both legends; Plin. H.\n          N. xxi. 28.) Hyacinthus was worshipped at Amyclae as a hero, and a great festival, Hyacinthia, was\n        celebrated in his honour.\n        2. A Lacedaemonian, who is said to have gone to Athens, and in compliance with an oracle, to have caused his\n        daughters to be sacrificed on the tomb on the Cyclops Geraestus, for the purpose of a learned of delivering the\n        city from famine and the plague, under which it was suffering during the war with Minos. His daughters, who were\n        sacrificed either to Athena or Persephone, were known in the Attic legends by the name of the Hyacinthides,\n        which they derived from their father. (Apollod. iii. 15. § 8; Hygin. Fab. 238; Harpocrat. s.\n          v.) Some traditions make them the daughters of Erechtheus, and relate that they received their name from\n        the village of Hyacinthus, where they were sacrificed at the time when Athens was attacked by the Eleusinians\n        and Thracians, or Thebans. (Suid. s.v. Parthenoi; Demosth. Epilaph. p. 1397; Lycurg. c.\n          Leocrat. 24; Cic. p. Sext. 48; Hygin. Fab. 46.) The names and numbers of the\n        Hyacinthides differ in the different writers. The account of Apollodorus is confused: he mentions four, and\n        represents them as married, although they were sacrificed as maidens, whence they are sometimes called simply\n        hai parthenoi. Those traditions in which they are described as the daughters of Erechtheus confound\n        them with Agraulos, Herse, and Pandrosos (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. i. 211), or with the Hyades.

And but that it might seem to be a waste of words, I could even\n        enumerate almost all the stars, and trees, and fountains, and rivers, which they assert to have been made of\n        men; yet, by way of example, I shall mention at least one of each class.

And they assert that almost all the stars, trees, fountains, and\n        rivers, flowers, animals, and birds, were at one time human beings.\"\n\nClement of Alexandria, Exhortation to the Greeks 2 (trans.

Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] Read the hyacinth, for\n        there is writing on it which says it sprang from the earth in honour of a beautiful youth; and it laments him at\n        the beginning of spring, doubtless because it was born from him when he died. Let no the meadow delay you with\n        the flower, for it grows here also, not different from the flower which springs from the earth. The painting\n        tells us that the hair of the youth is ‘hyacinthine,’ and that his blood, taking on life in the\n        earth, has given the flower its own crimson colour. It flows from the head itself where the discus struck it.\n        Terrible was the failure to hit the mark and incredible is the story told of Apollon; but since we are not here\n        to criticize the myths and are not ready to refuse them credence, but are merely spectators of the paintings,\n        let us examine the painting and in the first place the stand set for throwing the discus.\n        A raised thrower's stand has been set apart, so small as to suffice for only one person to stand on, and then\n        only when it supports the posterior portions and the right leg of the thrower, causing the anterior portions to\n        bend forward and the left leg to be relieved of weight; for this leg must be straightened and advanced along\n        with the right arm. As for the attitude of the man holding the discus, he must turn his head to the right and\n        bend himself over so far that he an look down at his side, and he must hurl the discus by drawing himself up and\n        putting his whole right side into the throw. Such, no doubt, was the way Apollon threw the discus, for he could\n        not have cast it in any other way; and now that he discus has stuck the youth, he lies there on the discus\n        itself--a Lakonian youth, straight of leg, not unpractised in running, the muscles of his arm already developed,\n        the fine lines of the bones indicated under the flesh; but Apollon with averted face is still on the thrower's\n        stand and he gazes down at the ground. You will say he is fixed there, such consternation has fallen upon him. A\n        lout is Zephyros (the West Wind), who was angry with Apollon and caused the discus to strike the youth, and the\n        scene seems a laughing matter to the wind and he taunts the god from his look-out. You can see him, I think,\n        with his winged temples and his delicate form; and he wears a crown of all kinds of flowers, and will soon weave\n        the hyacinth in among them.\"\n\nPhilostratus the Younger, Imagines 14 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting :] Hyakinthos (Hyacinthus). Let us ask the youth,\n        my boy, who he is and what is the reason for Apollon's presence with him, for he will not be afraid to have us,\n        at least, look at him. Well, he says that he is Hyakinthos, the son of Oibalos (Oebalus); and now that we have\n        learned this we must also know the reason for the god's presence. The son of Leto for love of the youth promises\n        to give him all he possesses for permission to associate with him; for he will teach him the use of the bow, and\n        music, and understanding the art of prophecy, and not to be unskilful with the lure, and to preside over the\n        contest of the palaestra, and he will grant to him that, riding in the chariot drawn by swans, he should visit\n        all the lands dear to Apollon. Here is the god, painted as usual with unshorn locks; he lifts a radiant forehead\n        above eyes that shine like rays of light, and with a sweet smile he encourages Hyakinthos, extending his right\n        hand with the same purpose. The youth keeps his eyes steadfastly on the ground, and they are very thoughtful,\n        for he rejoices at what he hears and tempers with modesty the confidence that is yet to come. He stands there,\n        covering with a purple mantle the left side of his body, which is also drawn back, and he supports his right\n        hand on a spear, the hip being thrown forward and the right side exposed to view, and this bare arm permits us\n        to describe what is visible. He has a slender ankle below the straight lower leg, and above the latter this\n        supple knee-joint; then come thighs not unduly developed and hip-joints which support the rest of the body; his\n        side rounds out a full-lunged chest, his arm swells in a delicate curve, his neck is moderately erect, while the\n        hair is not unkempt nor stiff from grime, but falls over his forehead and blends with the first down of his\n        beard. The discus at his feet ((lacuna)) . . about himself, and Eros (Love), who is both radiant and at just the\n        same time downcast, and Zephyros who just shows his savage eye from his place of look-out--by all this the\n        painter suggests the death of the youth, and as Apollon makes his cast, Zephyros, by breathing athwart its\n        course, will cause the discus to strike Hyakinthos.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 271 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Youths who were most handsome. Adonis, son of Cinyras and Smyrna, whom Venus [Aphrodite] loved.

Brookes More) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"You also, Amyclides [Hyacinthus son of Amyclas], would have been set in the sky! if Phoebus [Apollon] had\n        been given time which the cruel fates denied for you. But in a way you are immortal too. Though you have died.\n        Always when warm spring drives winter out, and Aries (the Ram) succeeds to Pisces (watery Fish), you rise and\n        blossom on the green turf. And the love my father had for you was deeper than he felt for others. Delphi center\n        of the world, had no presiding guardian, while the god frequented the Eurotas and the land of Sparta, never\n        fortified with walls. His zither and his bow no longer fill his eager mind and now without a thought of dignity,\n        he carried nets and held the dogs in leash, and did not hesitate to go with Hyacinthus on the rough, steep\n        mountain ridges; and by all of such associations, his love was increased. Now Titan was about midway, betwixt\n        the coming and the banished night, and stood at equal distance from those two extremes. Then, when the youth and\n        Phoebus were well stripped, and gleaming with rich olive oil, they tried a friendly contest with the discus.\n        First Phoebus, well-poised, sent it awhirl through air, and cleft the clouds beyond with its broad weight; from\n        which at length it fell down to the earth, a certain evidence of strength and skill. Heedless of danger\n        Taenarides [Hyacinthus] rushed for eager glory of the game, resolved to get the discus. But it bounded back from\n        off the hard earth, and struck full against your face, O Hyacinthus! Deadly pale the God's face went--as pallid\n        as the boy's. With care he lifted the sad huddled form.\n        The kind god tries to warm you back to life, and next endeavors to attend your wound, and stay your parting soul\n        with healing herbs. His skill is no advantage, for the wound is past all art of cure. As if someone, when in a\n        garden, breaks off violets, poppies, or lilies hung from golden stems, then drooping they must hang their\n        withered heads, and gaze down towards the earth beneath them; so, the dying boy's face droops, and his bent\n        neck, a burden to itself, falls back upon his shoulder : ‘You are fallen in your prime defrauded of your\n        youth, O Oebalides [Hyakinthos]!' Moaned Apollo. `I can see in your sad wound my own guilt, and you are my cause\n        of grief and self-reproach. My own hand gave you death unmerited--I only can be charged with your\n        destruction.--What have I done wrong? Can it be called a fault to play with you? Should loving you be called a\n        fault? And oh, that I might now give up my life for you! Or die with you! But since our destinies prevent us you\n        shall always be with me, and you shall dwell upon my care-filled lips. The lyre struck by my hand, and my true\n        songs will always celebrate you. A new flower you shall arise, with markings on your petals, close imitation of\n        my constant moans: and there shall come another to be linked with this new flower, a valiant hero shall be known\n        by the same marks upon its petals.’\n        And while Phoebus, Apollo, sang these words with his truth-telling lips, behold the blood of Hyacinthus, which\n        had poured out on the ground beside him and there stained the grass, was changed from blood; and in its place a\n        flower, more beautiful than Tyrian dye, sprang up. It almost seemed a lily, were it not that one was purple and\n        the other white. But Phoebus was not satisfied with this. For it was he who worked the miracle of his sad words\n        inscribed on flower leaves. These letters AI, AI, are inscribed on them. And Sparta certainly is proud to honor\n        Hyacinthus as her son; and his loved fame endures; and every year they celebrate his solemn festival.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 13. 395 :\n        \"From the green turf that purple flower [the hyacinth] bore, which first had sprung from wounded Oebalius\n        [Hyacinthus].
