  "content": "KYKNOS (Cycnus) and his son TENNES were two of the first champions to stand against the Greeks at Troy. Kyknos\n        was the king of Kolonai (Colonae) in the Troad and a son of the god Poseidon. At birth he was exposed by his\n        mother on the sea-shore and nurtured by gulls until some passing fishermen found and adopted him. Kyknos married\n        Prokleia, a daughter of King Laomedon of Troy, who bore him a son Tennes and daughter Hemithea--according to\n        some, the twins were actually sired by the god Apollon. After the death of his first wife, he married a woman\n        named Philonome who fell in love with her step-son Tennes. When he spurned her advances, she told her husband\n        that he had tried to seduce her, and the maddened king cast the boy and his sister adrift at sea in a chest.\n        They eventually came ashore on the nearby island of Leukophrys which Tennes renamed Tenedos after himself.\n\nWhen the Greek fleet set out for Troy, they first landed on the island of Tenedos. Thetis sent a message to\n        Akhilleus (Achilles) warning him not to slay Tennes, for this would arouse the wrath of Apollon. However the\n        messenger was lax in his duty and the warning delivered too late, for Akhilleus had already seduced Tennes'\n        sister Hemithea, brawled with the king and slain him.\n\nTennes and Hemithea were afterwards worshipped as gods of the island. They identified Hemithea with Leukothea, mother of the sea-god Palaimon. In historical times the Tenedians sacrificed infants to this\n        god--a rare example of institutionalised human sacrifice in ancient Greece.\n\nAfter the events of Tenedos the Greeks landed at Troy where Kyknos and Hektor stood as the main champions of\n        the Trojans. Poseidon had made his son Kyknos invulnerable to weapons, but after a heated battle, Akhilleus\n        managed to slay him--either with the cast of a millstone or by strangling him with the thong of his helmet. He\n        was afterwards transformed by the god into a swan (kyknos in Greek).\n\nThere were several others heroes named Kyknos in Greek mythology who were likewise associated with the swan,\n        including a son of Ares who fought Herakles in Phthiotis and a friend of Phaethon from Ligouria.\n\n[1.1] POSEIDON (Homerica Cypria Frag 1,\n          Pausanias 10.14.1, Ovid Metamorphoses 12.80, Seneca Hercules Furens 180)\n        [1.2] POSEIDON & KALYKE (Hyginus\n          Fabulae 157)\n\n[1.1] TENNES, HEMITHEA (by Prokleia) (Apollodorus E.23, Pausanias 10.14.1)\n        [1.2] TENNES, HEMITHEA (Lycophron 229)\n        [1.3] TENNES (Diodorus Siculus 5.83.1, Strabo 8.6.22)\n        [1.4] KOBIS, KORIANOS, GLAUKE (Dictys Cretensis 2.13)\n\n[1.1] KYKNOS & PROKLEIA (Apollodorus E.23, Pausanias 10.14.1)\n        [1.2] KYKNOS (Lycophron 229, Diodorus Siculus 5.83.1, Strabo 8.6.22)\n        [1.3] APOLLON (Apollodorus E.23)\n\nCYCNUS (Kyknos), a son of Poseidon by Calyce (Calycia), Harpale, or Scamandrodice. (Hygin. Fab. 157;\n        Schol. ad Pind. Ol. ii. 147; Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 233.) He was born in secret, and was exposed on\n        the sea-coast, where he was found by shepherds, who seeing a swan descending upon him, called him Cycnus. When\n        he had grown up to manhood, he became king of Colonae in Troas, and married Procleia, the daughter of Laomedon\n        or of Clytius (Paus. x. 14. § 2), by whom he became the father of Tenes and Hemithea. Dictys Cretensis (ii.\n        13) mentions different children. After the death of Procleia, he married Philonome, a daughter of Craugasus, who\n        fell in love with Tenes, her stepson, and not being listened to by him calumniated him, so that Cycnus in his\n        anger threw his son together with Hemithea in a chest into the sea. According to others Cycnus himself leaped\n        into the sea. (Virg. Aen. ii. 21.) Afterwards, when Cycnus learned the truth respecting his wife's\n        conduct, he killed Philonome and went to his son, who had landed in the island of Tenedos, and had become king\n        there. According to some traditions, Tenes did not allow his father to land, but cut off the anchor. (Conon,\n        Narrat. 28; Paus. x. 14. § 2.) In the war of the Greeks against Troy, both Cycnus and Tenes\n        assisted the Trojans, but both were slain by Achilles. As Cycnus could not be wounded by iron, Achilles\n        strangled him with the thong of his helmet, or by striking him with a stone. (Comp. Diod. v. 83; Strab. xiii. p.\n        604; Schol. ad Theocrit. xvi. 49; Dict. Cret. ii. 12, &c.; Ov. Met. xii. 144.) Ovid adds,\n        that the body of Cycnus disappeared and was changed into a swan, when Achilles came to take away his armour.\n\nTENNES (Tênnês), or Tenes, son of Cycnus, the king of Colone in Troas, and Procleia, or, according\n        to others, a son of Apollo, and brother of Hemithea. After the death of Procleia, Cycnus married Philonome, a\n        daughter of Craugasus or Tragnasus. She fell in love with her stepson; and as she was unable to win the love of\n        Tenes, she accused him before his father of improper conduct towards her. Cycnus accordingly threw both his son\n        and daughter into a chest, and exposed them on the waves of the sea. But the chest was driven on the coast of\n        the island of Leucophrys, which Tenes, after his own name, called Tenedos, after its inhabitants had chosen him\n        for their king. Cycnus at length heard of the innocence of his son, killed Philonome, and went to his children\n        in Tenedos, where both he and Tenes were slain by Achilles, who, on his voyage to Troy, made a landing on\n        Tenedos. But Tenes was afterwards worshipped as a hero in Tenedos. (Paus. x. 14. § 2 ; Diod. v. 83; Tzetz.\n        ad Lycoph. 232 ; Strab. xiv. p. 640.) According to Pausanias, Tenes did not allow his father to land in\n        Tenedos, but cut off the rope with which Cycnus had fastened his ship to the coast. (Comp. Steph. Byz. s.\n          v. Tenedos.) The death of Tenes by Achilles also is related differently, for once, it is said, when\n        Achilles was pursuing the sister of Tenes in Tenedos, Tenes, endeavouring to stop him, was slain by Achilles,\n        who did not know that Tenes was a son of Apollo. (Plut. Quaest. Graec. 28 ; Tzetz. l. c.) In\n        the temple of Tenes in Tenedos, it was not allowed to mention the name of Achilles, nor was any fluteplayer\n        permitted to enter it, because the flute-player Molpus had borne false witness against Tenes to please his\n        step-mother Philonome.

Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"After putting to sea from Aulis they [the Greek fleet] touched at Tenedos. It was ruled by Tenes, son of\n        Kyknos (Cycnus) and Prokleia (Proclia), but according to some, he was a son of Apollon. He dwelt there because\n        he had been banished by his father.\n        For Kyknos had a son Tenes and a daughter Hemithea by Prokleia, daughter of Laomedon, but he afterwards married\n        Philonome, daughter of Tragasos; and she fell in love with Tenes, and, failing to seduce him, falsely accused\n        him to Kyknos of attempting to debauch her, and in witness of it she produced a flute-player, by name\n        Eumolpos.\n        Kyknos believed her, and putting him and his sister in a chest he set them adrift on the sea. The chest was\n        washed up on the island of Leukophrys (Leucophrys), and Tenes landed and settled in the island, and called it\n        Tenedos after himself. But Kyknos afterwards learning the truth, stoned the flute-player to death and buried his\n        wife alive in the earth.\n        So when the Greeks were standing in for Tenedos, Tenes saw them and tried to keep them off by throwing stones,\n        but was killed by Akhilleus (Achilles) with a sword-cut in the breast, though Thetis had forewarned Akhilleus\n        not to kill Tenes, because he himself would die by the hand of Apollon if he slew Tenes.\"\n\nLycophron, Alexandra 229 ff (trans. Mair) (Greek poet C3rd B.C.) :\n        \"And now Palaimon (Palaemon), to whom babes are slain [i.e. the island of Tenedos], beholds the hoary\n        Titanid bride of Ogenus seething with the corded gulls [i.e. the Greek fleet].

And therewithal the wretch [Mnemon], who was not mindful to tell\n        [Akhilleus (Achilles)] the bidding of the goddess mother [Thetis] but erred in forgetfulness, shall die upon his\n        face, his breast pierced by the sword.\"\n        [N.B. According to the Scholiast on Lycophron the Greek fleet--\"corded gulls\"--sailed across the\n        sea--\"the hoary Titanid bride of Ogenos\"--and landed on the island of Tenedos where infants were\n        sacrificed to the god Palaimon. The island was inhabited by Tennes and Hemithea, children of Kyknos, king of\n        Kolonai (Colonae) in the Troad, by his first wife, Prokleia. His second wife, Philonome, abetted by the\n        flute-player, Molpos, had previously induced Kyknos to set them adrift upon the sea in an ark. Tennes, who was\n        really a son of Apollon, came to land in the island of Leukophrys, which, after his name, was thence called\n        Tenedos. When the Greeks arrived on the island, Thetis sent a messenger named Mnemon to warn Akhilleus not to\n        slay Tennes, for this would enrage Apollon. But he failed to deliver the message in time, and Akhilleus slew him\n        in anger. Later, the Greeks landed in the Troad, where Akhilleus fought and slew Kyknos, the father of the\n        Tenedians.]\n\nDiodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 83. 1 - 5 (trans. Oldfather) (Greek historian\n          C1st B.C.) :\n        \"When a considerable time had elapsed after the settlement of Lesbos, the island known as Tenedos came to\n        be inhabited in somewhat the following manner. Tennes was a son of Kyknos (Cycnus), who had been king of\n        Kolonê (Colonae) in the Troad, and was a man who had gained renown because of his high achievements.\n        Gathering together colonists and using as his base the mainland opposite to it, he seized an uninhabited island\n        called Leukophrys (Leucophrys); this island he portioned out in allotments among his followers, and he founded a\n        city on it which he named Tenedos after himself. And since he governed uprightly and conferred many benefactions\n        upon the inhabitants, during his lifetime he was in high favour, and upon his death he was granted immortal\n        honours; for they built for him a sacred precinct and honoured him with sacrifices as though he were a god, and\n        these sacrifices they have continued to perform down to modern times.\n        But we must not omit to mention what the myths of the Tenedians have to tell about Tennes, the founder of the\n        city. Kyknos his father, they say, giving credence to the unjust slanders of his wife, put his son Tennes in a\n        chest and cast it into the sea; the chest was borne along by the waves and brought to shore on Tenedos, and\n        since Tennes had been saved alive in this astonishing fashion by the providence of some one of the gods, he\n        became king of the island, and becoming distinguished by reason of the justice he displayed and his other\n        virtues, he was granted immortal honours. But it had happened, when his step-mother was slandering him, that a\n        certain flute player had borne false witness against him, and so the Tenedians passed a law that no flute player\n        should ever enter his sacred precinct.\n        And when Tennes was slain by Akhilleus (Achilles) in the course of the Trojan War, on the occasion when the\n        Greeks sacked Tenedos, the Tenedians passed a law that no man should ever pronounce the name of Akhilleus in the\n        sacred precinct of the founder of their city. Such, then, is the account which the myths give regarding Tenedos\n        and its ancient inhabitants.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 8. 6. 22 (trans. Jones) (Greek geographer C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)\n          :\n        \"And it seems, also, that there is a kinship between the peoples of Tenedos and Tenea [a town in Korinthos\n        (Corinth) on the Isthmos], through Tennes the son of Kyknos (Cycnus), as Aristotle says; and the similarity in\n        the worship of Apollon among the two peoples affords strong indications of such kinship.\"\n\nStrabo, Geography 13. 1. 46 :\n        \"[In the Troad :] After the Sigeian (Sigeum) Promontory and the Akhilleion (Achilleum) one comes to the\n        Akhaeïon (Achaeum), the part of the mainland that belongs to the Tenedians; and to Tenedos itself, which is\n        not more than forty stadia distant from the mainland. It is about eighty stadia in circumference, and has an\n        Aiolian (Aeolian) city and two harbors and a temple of Apollon Smintheus, as the poet [Homer] testifies\n        :--‘And dost rule mightily over Tenedos, O Smintheus.’ Round it lie several small islands, in\n        particular two, which are called the Kalydnai (Calydnae) and are situated on the voyage to Lekton (Lecton). And\n        some give the name Kalydna to Tenedos itself, while others call it Leukophrys. In it is laid the scene of the\n        myth of Tennes, after whom the island was named, as also that of Kyknos (Cycnus), a Thrakian by birth and,\n        according to some, father of Tennes and king of Kolonai (Colonae). Both Larisa and Kolonai used to be adjacent\n        to the Akhaeïon formerly being on the part of the mainland that belonged to the Tenedians.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 10. 14. 1 - 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The axes were dedicated [at the shrine of Delphoi] by Periklyto (Periclyto), son of Euthymakhos, a man of\n        Tenedos, and allude to an old story. Kyknos (Cycnus), they say, was a son of Poseidon, and ruled as king in\n        Kolonai (Colonae), a city in the Troad situated opposite the island Leukophrys (Leucophrys).\n        He had a daughter, by name Hemithea, and a son, called Tennes, by Prokleia (Procleia), who was a daughter of\n        Klytios (Clytius) and a sister of Kaletor (Caletor). Homer in the Iliad says that this Kaletor, as he\n        was putting the fire under the ship of Protesilaos, was killed by Aias (Ajax). Prokleia died before Kyknos, and\n        his second wife, Philonome, daughter of Kragasos (Cragasus), fell in love with Tennes. Rejected by him she\n        falsely accused him before her husband, saying that he had made love to her, and she had rejected him. Kyknos\n        was deceived by the trick, placed Tennes with his sister in a chest and launched it out to sea.\n        The young people came safely to the island Leukophrys, and the island was given its present name from Tennes.\n        Kyknos, however, was not to remain for ever ignorant of the trick, and sailed to his son to confess his\n        ignorance and to ask for pardon for his mistake. He put in at the island and fastened the cables of his ship to\n        something--a rock or a tree--but Tennes in a passion cut them adrift with an axe.\n        For this reason a by-word has arisen, which is used of those who make a stern refusal : ‘So and so has cut\n        whatever it may be with an axe of Tenedos.’ The Greeks say that while Tennes was defending his country he\n        was killed by Akhilleus. In course of time weakness compelled the people of Tenedos to merge themselves with the\n        Alexandrians on the Troad mainland.\"\n\nPlutarch, Greek Questions 28.73 (not currently quoted here) :\n        According to Frazer's commentary on Apollodorus, Plutarch describes how Thetis warned Akhilleus (Achilles) not\n        to slay Tennes and charged one of his servants to remind him of the warning. But while scouring the island,\n        Akhilleus fell for his beautiful sister and made love to her. Tennes retaliated and in the brawl which ensued\n        was slain by Akhilleus. When the hero discovered who he had slain, he killed the servant that was supposed to\n        warn him, and buried Tennes on the spot where a sanctuary was later founded for his hero-cult. This version of\n        the story differs from the one given by Apollodorus (above).\n\nCicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 15 (trans.

Frazer)\n          (Latin faux-journal C4th A.D. after Greek original C1st A.D.) :\n        \"[During the first battles of the Trojan War when the Greeks made landfall :] Achilles and Ajax the son of\n        Telamon fought with great glory, their courage sustaining and increasing the confidence of our men. They struck\n        fear into the enemy, some of whom, having dared to oppose them, soon were retreating, and all of whom finally\n        were taking to flight. Thus we, being free for a time from enemy attack, were able to draw up our ships and set\n        them safely in order. Then we chose Achilles and Ajax the son of Telamon, since they were the bravest, to guard\n        the ships and the army, stationing them at the ends of our camp to cover our flanks. When everyone was settled\n        in place, Telephus departed for home. Our army was very grateful to him for having led us to Troy.\n        Soon afterwards Cycnus surprised us with a treacherous attack. He had heard of our coming, for his kingdom was\n        not far off from Troy. His attack was made against those of our men who were preoccupied with the burial of\n        Protesilaus. These, expecting no trouble, were caught unawares and forced to flee in utter disorder. But soon\n        the rest of our men, those not entrusted with the burial, learned what was happening and came to the rescue.\n        Among these was Achilles who encountered and slew Cycnus along with countless numbers of others; thus those who\n        had fled were relieved.\n        But frequent raids by the enemy caused heavy casualties to our side and deeply disturbed our leaders. Therefore,\n        the first thing we decided to do was to attack the cities in the region near Troy with a part of our army and\n        wreak general destruction. We began with the kingdom of Cycnus and plundered the country around it. When,\n        however, we invaded and began to fire the capital, where it was said the sons of Cycnus were being reared, the\n        people, that is, the Neandrienses, offered no resistance and begged us to forbear. Weeping, they prayed on\n        bended knee, by all things human and divine, that their city be spared. They were not, they said, to be blamed\n        for the wicked acts of their evil king; they had been innocent and, after his death, had sided with us. Thus\n        they stirred us to pity and saved their city. We required, however, that they hand over the sons of the king,\n        Cobis and Corianus, along with their sister Glauce. Then we gave the girl to Ajax, in addition to this regular\n        share of the booty, a due reward for his valorous deeds. Soon afterwards the Neandrienses came to the camp and\n        sued for peace; they promised to be our allies and to do whatever we ordered.\n        When this campaign had been finished, we stormed Cilla but refrained from touching Carene, though it was near.\n        Thus we showed our gratitude for the faithful friendship of the Neandrienses, for they were lords in\n        Carene.\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 157 (trans.

Brookes More) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st\n          A.D.) :\n        \"Fame now had spread the tidings, a great fleet of Greek ships was at that time on its way, an army of\n        brave men. The Trojans stood, all ready to prevent the hostile Greeks from landing on their shores. By the\n        decree of Fate, the first man killed of the invaders' force was strong Protesilaus, by the spear of valiant\n        Hector, whose unthought-of power at that time was discovered by the Greeks to their great cost. The Phyrgians\n        also learned, at no small cost of blood, what warlike strength came from the Grecian land. The Sigean shores\n        grew red with death-blood : Cygnus (Cycnus), Neptunus' [Poseidon's] son there slew a thousand men : for which,\n        in wrath, Achilles pressed his rapid chariot straight through the Trojan army; making a lane with his great\n        spear, shaped from a Pelion tree. And as he sought through the fierce battle's press, either for Cygnus or for\n        Hector, he met Cygnus and engaged at once with him (Fate had preserved great Hector from such foe till ten years\n        from that day). Cheering his steeds, their white necks pressed upon the straining yoke, he steered the chariot\n        towards his foe, and, brandishing the spear with his strong arm, he cried, ‘Whoever you may be, you have\n        the consolation of a glorious death you die by me, Haemonian Achilles!’ His heavy spear flew after the\n        fierce words. Although the spear was whirled direct and true, yet nothing it availed with sharpened point. It\n        only bruised, as with a blunted stroke, the breast of Cygnus! ‘By report we knew of you before this\n        battle, goddess born.’ The other answered him, ‘But why are you surprised that I escape the\n        threatened wound?’ (Achilles was surprised). ‘This helmet crowned, great with its tawny horse-hair,\n        and this shield, broad-hollowed, on my left arm, are not held for help in war : they are but ornament, as Mars\n        [Ares] wears armor. All of them shall be put off, and I will fight with you unhurt. It is a privilege that I was\n        born not as you, of a Nereid but of him [Poseidon] whose powerful rule is over Nereus, his daughters and their\n        ocean.’ So, he spoke.\n        Immediately he threw his spear against Achilles, destined to pierce the curving shield through brass\n        and through nine folds of tough bull's hide. It stopped there, for it could not pierce the tenth. The hero\n        wrenched it out, and hurled again a quivering spear at Cygnus, with great strength. The Trojan stood unwounded\n        and unharmed. Nor did a third spear injure Cygnus, though he stood there with his body all exposed. Achilles\n        raged at this, as a wild bull in open circus, when with dreadful horns he butts against the hanging purple robes\n        which stir his wrath and there observes how they evade him, quite unharmed by his attack. Achilles then examined\n        his good spear, to see if by some chance the iron point was broken from it, but the point was firm, fixed on the\n        wooden shaft. ‘My hand is weak,’ he said, ‘but is it possible its strength forsook me though\n        it never has before? For surely I had my accustomed strength, when first I overthrew Lyrnessus' walls, or when I\n        won the isle of Tenedos or Thebes (then under King Eetion) and I drenched both with their own peoples' blood, or\n        when the river Caycus ran red with slaughter of its people, or, when twice Telephus felt the virtue of my spear.\n        On this field also, where such heaps lie slain, my right hand surely has proved its true might; and it is\n        mighty.’ So he spoke of strength, remembered.\n        But as if in proof against his own distrust, he hurled a spear against Menoetes, a soldier in the Lycian ranks.\n        The sharp spear tore the victim's coat of mail and pierced his breast beneath. Achilles, when he saw his dying\n        head strike on the earth wrenched the same spear from out the reeking wound, and said, ‘This is the hand,\n        and this the spear I conquered with; and I will use the same against him who in luck escaped their power; and\n        the result should favor as I pray the helpful gods.’ And, as he said such words, in haste he hurled his\n        ashen spear, again at Cygnus. It went straight and struck unshunned Resounding on the shoulder of that foe, it\n        bounced back as if it hit a wall or solid cliff. Yet when Achilles saw just where the spear struck, Cygnus there\n        was stained with blood. He instantly rejoiced; but vainly, for it was Menoetes' blood!\n        Then in a sudden rage, Achilles leaped down headlong from his lofty chariot; and, seeking his god-favored foe,\n        he struck in conflict fiercely, with his gleaming sword. Although he saw that he had pierced both shield and\n        helmet through, he did not harm the foe--his sword was even blunted on the flesh. Achilles could not hold\n        himself for rage, but furious, with his sword-hilt and his shield he battered wildly the uncovered face and\n        hollow-temples of his Trojan foe. Cygnus gave way; Achilles rushed on him, buffeting fiercely, so that he could\n        not recover from the shock. Fear seized upon Cygnus, and darkness swam before his eyes. Then, as he moved back\n        with retreating steps, a large stone hindered him and blocked his way. His back pushed against this, Achilles\n        seized and dashed him violently to the ground. Then pressing with buckler and hard knees the breast of Cygnus,\n        he unlaced the helmet thongs, wound them about the foeman's neck and drew them tightly under his chin, till\n        Cygnus' throat could take no breath of life. Achilles rose eager to strip his conquered foe but found his empty\n        armor, for the god of ocean had changed the victim into that white bird whose name he lately bore.\n        There was a truce for many days after this opening fight while both sides resting, laid aside their arms . . .\n        They talked of their own deeds and valor, all that thrilling night : and even the strength of enemies whom they\n        had met and overcome. What else could they admit or think of, while the great Achilles spoke or listened to\n        them? But especially the recent victory over Cygnus held them ardent. Wonderful it seemed to them that such a\n        youth could be composed of flesh not penetrable by the sharpest spear; of flesh which blunted even hardened\n        steel, and never could be wounded. All the Greeks, and even Achilles wondered at the thought. Then Nestor said\n        to them : ‘During your time, Cygnus has been the only man you knew who could despise all weapons and whose\n        flesh could not be pierced by thrust of sword or spear. But long ago I saw another man able to bear unharmed a\n        thousand strokes, Caeneus of Thessaly, Caeneus who lived upon Mount Othrys.’\"\n\nSeneca, Hercules Furens 180 ff (trans.
