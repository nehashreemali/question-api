  "content": "SAUROS (Saurus) was a bandit of the Ridge of Sauros near Mount Pholoe on the border between Elis and Arkadia.\n        He was slain by Herakles during the hero's quest for the Erymanthian\n          boar.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 6. 21. 3 - 4 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd\n          A.D.) :\n        \"The boundaries which now separate Arkadia (Arcadia) and Elis originally separated Arkadia from Pisa, and\n        are thus situated [on the river Erymanthos]. On crossing the river Erymanthos (Erymanthus) at what is called the\n        ridge of Sauros (Saurus) are the tomb of Sauros and a sanctuary of Herakles (Heracles), now in ruins. The story\n        is that Sauros used to do mischief to travellers and to dwellers in the neighborhood until he received his\n        punishment at the hands of Herakles. At this ridge which has the same name as the robber, a river, falling into\n        the Alpheios (Alpheus) from the south, just opposite the Erymanthos, is the boundary between the land of Pisa\n        and Arkadia; it is called the Diagon.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
