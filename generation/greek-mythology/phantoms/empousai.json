  "content": "THE EMPOUSAI (Empusae), LAMIAI (Lamiae) and MORMOLYKEIAI (Mormolyceae) were fearsome daimones which assumed the\n        forms of beautiful women to lure young men to their beds to feed on their flesh and blood. Behind the illusory\n        facade the creatures were truly demonic--the Lamia had the tail of a serpent in place of legs, while the Empousa\n        had flaming hair and two mismatched legs, one of brass, one of an ass.\n\nLater authors describe the Lamiai as ghosts (phasma) which used illusion to seduce young men. They\n        were companions of the goddess Hekate which followed her to earth from\n        the depths of the underworld.\n\nThe Empousai and Lamiai were the ancient equivalent of vampires and succubi--vampiric ghosts and demons.\n\n[1] Perhaps HEKATE\n        [2] Some were ghosts of dead women\n\n[1] ARISTONYMOS & AN ASS (Aristocles Frag, Plutarch Greek & Roman Parallel\n          Stories 29)\n\nLAMIA KORINTHIA (Corinthian Lamia) A demon which haunted the city of\n        Korinthos (Corinth), seducing and feeding upon handsome young men.\n\nLAMIA LIBYS (Libyan Lamia) A Libyan queen loved by Zeus. When her children\n        were stolen by the goddess Hera, she fell into a crazed, child-murdering frenzy and was transformed into a\n        demon.\n\nLAMIA PHILINNION The ghost of a Makedonian woman who returned from the dead\n        to seduce a young man.\n\nEMPU′SA (Empousa), a monstrous spectre, which was believed to devour human beings. It could assume\n        different forms, and was sent out by Hecate to frighten travellers. It was believed usually to appear with one\n        leg of brass and the other of an ass. (Aristoph Ran. 294, Eccles. 1094.) Whenever a traveller addressed the\n        monster with insulting words, it used to flee and utter a shrill sound. (Philostr Vit. Apoll. ii. 4.) The Lamiae\n        and Mormolyceia, who assumed the form of handsome women for the purpose of attracting young men, and then sucked\n        their blood like vampyrs and ate their flesh, were reckoned among the Empusae. (Philostr Vit. Apoll. iv. 25;\n        Suid. s. v.)\n\nLA′MIA (Lamia). In later times Lamiae were conceived as handsome ghostly women, who by voluptuous\n        artifices attracted young men, in order to enjoy their fresh, youthful, and pure flesh and blood. They were thus\n        in ancient times what the vampires are in modern legends. [p. 714] (Philostr. Vit. Apollon. iv. 25; Horat. de\n        Art. Poet. 340; Isidor. Orig. viii. 11; Apulei. Met. i. p. 57; comp. Spanheim, ad Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 67.)\n\nMORMO (Mormô), a female spectre, with which the Greeks used to frighten little children. (Aristoph.\n        Acharn. 582, Pax, 474.) Mormo was one of the same class of bugbears as Empusa and Lamia.\n\nMORMO′LYCE or MORMOLYCEION (Mormolukê, Mormolukeion), the same phantom or bugbear as Mormo, and\n        also used for the same purpose. (Philostr. V'it. Apollon. iv. 25; Menandr. Reliq. p. 145, ed. Meineke; Aristoph.\n        Thesin. 417 Strab. i. p. 19; Stob.

Oh, what a trembling the Mormo brought us\n        then, when we were little ones!--On its head were huge ears, and it walked on all fours, and changed from one\n        face to another!\"\n\nAristophanes, Frogs 288 ff (trans. O'Neill) (Greek comedy C5th to 4th B.C.)\n          :\n        \"[Comedy in which the god Dionysos travels to the underworld. He and his slave Xanthias encounter and\n        Empousa amongst the guardians of Haides after crossing Lake Akheron :]\n        Xanthias : We'd best be moving on. This is the spot where Herakles declared those savage monsters dwell . . .\n        Hallo! I hear a noise.\n        Dionysos : Where? what?\n        Xanthias : Behind us, there.\n        Dionysos : Get you behind.\n        Xanthias : No, it's in front.\n        Dionysos : Get you in front directly.\n        Xanthias : And now I see the most ferocious monster.\n        Dionysos : O, what's it like?\n        Xanthias : Like everything by turns. Now it's a bull: now it's a mule : and now the loveliest girl.\n        Dionysos : O, where? I'll go and meet her.\n        Xanthias : It's ceased to be a girl: it's a dog now.\n        Dionysos : It is Empousa!\n        Xanthias : Well, its face is all ablaze with fire.\n        Dionysos : Has it a copper leg?\n        Xanthias : A copper leg? yes, one; and one of cow dung.\n        Dionysos : O, whither shall I flee?\n        Xanthias : O, whither I?\n        Dionysos : My priest, protect me, and we'll sup together.\n        Xanthias : King Herakles [Dionysos is dressed up as Herakles], we're done for.\n        Dionysos : O, forbear, Good fellow, call me anything but that.\n        Xanthias : Well then, Dionysos.\n        Dionysos : O, that's worse again,\n        Xanthias (to the Spectre) : Aye, go thy way. O master, here, come here.\n        Dionysos : O, what's up now?\n        Xanthias : Take courage; all's serene. And, like Hegelokhos, we now may say ‘Out of the storm there comes\n        a new weather.’ Empousa's gone.\n        Dionysos : Swear it.\n        Xanthias : By Zeus she is.\n        Dionysos : Swear it again.\n        Xanthias : By Zeus.\n        Dionysos : Again.\n        Xanthias : By Zeus. O dear, O dear, how pale I grew to see her, but he, from fright has yellowed me all\n        over.\"\n\nAristophanes, Ecclesiazusae 1057 : \n        \"[A young man disparages an old woman who had tried to seduce him :] It is an Empousa with a body covered\n        with blemishes and blotches.\"\n\nAristophanes, Acharnians 582 ff : \n        \"Your terrifying armor makes me dizzy. I beg you, take away that Mormo (Bogy-Monster)!\"\n\nAristophanes, Peace 474 ff : \n        \"This is terrible! You are in the way, sitting there. We have no use for your Mormo's (Bogy-Like) head,\n        friend.\"\n\nPlato, Crito 46c (trans.

The years obliterate the inventions of the\n        imagination, but confirm the judgements of nature.\"\n\nSuidas s.v. Empuosa (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th A.D.)\n          :\n        \"Empousa (Empusa). A demonic ghost (phantasma daimonios) sent by Hekate and appearing to the\n        ill-fated.\n        [Something] which seems to change into many forms. Aristophanes in Frogs [indicates this]. [It is called]\n        Empousa from the fact that it moves on one leg (heni podizein), i.e. that its other leg is bronze. Or\n        because it used to appear from dark places to the initiated. She was also called Oinopole. But others say [that\n        it bore this name] because it changed form. It also seems to appear in the light of day, when they are offering\n        sacrifices to the dead. Some say that she is the same as Hekate. But [another name for her is] Onokole, because\n        she has an ass's leg; which they call manure (bolitinon), that is donkey manure. For bolitos\n        [is] the proper word for donkey excrement. Aristophanes in Frogs [says] : ‘by Zeus, I see a huge\n        wild beast.--What kind?--Terrible. It appears to be everywhere at once : at times it is a cow, then a mule, then\n        again a most beautiful woman.--Where is she? I'm heading towards her.--She is no longer a woman, but a dog\n        now.--It is Empousa, then.--At any rate the whole face is glowing with fire and she has a bronze\n        leg.’\"\n\nBell, Women of Classical Mythology (sourced from Aristophanes Frogs 294; Aristophanes\n          Ecclesiazusae 1094; Philostratus Life of Apollonius of Tyana 2.4 & 4.25; Suidas s.v. Empusa) :\n        \"EMPUSA was yet another female monster. She was in the train of Hecate and originally was sent out to\n        frighten travellers. She was supposed to have on leg of brass and one of an ass. This absurd combination lends a\n        certain comical effect rather than one of horror. Moreover, a traveller could rout the monster with insulting\n        words, causing her to flee with a shrill shrieking. Naughty children were threatened with visits from this\n        awkward creature.\n        But the Empusae (plural for Empusa) were not comical at all when it came to their real design--luring men,\n        especially young ones, to bed. For this purpose they could turn themselves into beautiful women, in which shape\n        they sucked the blood from their victims and ate their flesh. In this respect they were related to the Lamiae\n        and Mormolyceia.\"\n\nBell, Women of Classical Mythology (sourced from Philostratus Life of Apollonius of\n          Tyana 4.25; Horace Ars Poetica 340; Apuleias Golden Ass 1.57) :\n        \"LAMIAE, obviously related to the persona of Lamia, the fearful child-snatcher, were handsome, ghostly\n        women who by various sensuous means lured young men to their beds. There they enjoyed the fresh, youthful energy\n        of their victims, then drank their blood and ate their flesh. They were in ancient times the equivalent of\n        vampires in modern legends.\"\n\nBell, Women of Classical Mythology (sourced from Philostratus Life of Apollonius of\n          Tyana 4.25; Aristophanes Archanians 582; Aristophanes Peace 474) :\n        \"MORMO was a female spectre that the Greeks used to frighten little children.

And Apollonios realised what it was, and himself\n        heaped abuse on the Empousa and instructed his party to do the same, saying that this was the right remedy for\n        such a visitation.
