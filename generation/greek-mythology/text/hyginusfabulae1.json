  "content": "GAIUS JULIUS HYGINUS was a Latin writer who flourished in Roman Spain in the C1st AD. Two extant collections of\n        fables were attributed to him: the Fabulae (or Fables) and Astronomica (or Astronomy). The poor quality of these\n        works lead most to believe they are either wrongly attributed to this distinguished scholar or are a later\n        abridgement of his works composed by a C2nd grammarian. In spite of the poor writing style and numerous errors,\n        the works do preserve many myths and alternative versions of myths not found elsewhere.\n\nThe Myths of Hyginus, translated and edited by Mary Grant. University of Kansas Publications in Humanistic\n        Studies, no. 34. Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1960.\n\nMary Grant's translation is long out of print and second hand copies of this book are very hard to come by. The\n        work includes an introduction and copious footnotes, neither of which have not been reproduced here. Recent\n        translation of Hyginus' Astronomica can be found in the book titled Star Myths by Condos and a selection of both\n        the Fables and Astronomy are included in the Anthology of Greek Myth by T. G. Palaima (see book list right).\n\nExcerpts from the Genealogiae of Hyginus, commonly called the Fabulae Preface\n\nFrom Mist (was born) Chaos; from Chaos and Caligine: Night, Day, Erebus, Aether.\n        From Night and Erebus: Fate, Old Age, Death, Dissolution, *Continence, Sleep, Dreams, Love – that is,\n        Lysimeles, *Epiphron, Porphyrion, Epaphus, Discord, Wretchedness, Wantonness, Nemesis, Euphrosyne, Friendship,\n        Compassion, Styx; the three Fates, namely, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos; the Hesperides, Aegle, Hesperie,\n        *aerica.\n        From Aether and Day, Earth, Heaven Sea.\n        From Aether and Earth: Grief, Deceit, Wrath, Lamentation, Falsehood, Oath, Vengeance, Intemperance, Altercation,\n        Forgetfulness, Sloth, Fear, Pride, Incest, Combat, Ocean, Themis, Tartarus, Pontus; and the Titans, Briareus,\n        Gyges, Steropes, Atlas, Hyperion, and Polus, Saturn, Ops, Moneta, Dione; and three Furies – namely,\n        Alecto, Megaera, Tisiphone.\n        From Earth and Tartarus, Giants: Enceladus, Coeus, *elentes, *mophius, Astraeus, Pelorus, Pallas, Emphytus,\n        Rhoecus, *ienios, Agrius, *alemone, Ephialtes, Eurytus, *effracorydon, Themoises, Theodamas, Otus, Typhon,\n        Polybo[e}tes, *menephriarus, *abesus, *colophonus, Iapetus.\n        From Pontus and Sea, the tribes of fishes.\n        From Ocean and Tethys the Oceanides - namely *yaea Melite, Ianthe, Admete, Stilbo, Pasiphae, Polyxo, Eurynome,\n        Euagoreis, Rhodope, *lyris, Clytie, *teschinoeno, *clitenneste, Metis, Menippe, Argia.

She hid, therefore, in the palace,\n        and when an opportunity presented itself, thinking she was killing the sons of her rival, unwittingly killed her\n        own, deceived by the nurse who had put the wrong garments on them. When Themisto discovered this, she killed\n        herself.\n\nIno, daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia, wishing to kill Phrixus and Helle, Nebula’s children, formed a plan\n        with the women of the entire tribe, and conspired to parch the seed grain to make it unfertile, so that, when\n        the sterility and scarcity of grain resulted, the whole state should perish, some by starvation, others by\n        sickness. With regard to this situation Athamas sent a servant to Delphi, but Ino instructed him to bring back a\n        false reply that the pestilence would end if he sacrificed Phrixus to Jove. When Athamas refused to do this,\n        Phrixus voluntarily and readily promised that he alone would free the state from its distress. Accordingly he\n        was led to the altar, wearing fillets (of sacrifice), but the servant, out of pity for the youth, revealed\n        Ino’s plans to Athamas. The king, thus informed of the crime, gave over his wife Ino and her son\n        Melicertes to be put to death, but Father Liber cast mist around her, and saved Ino his nurse. Later, Athamas,\n        driven mad by Jove, slew his son Learchus. But Ino, with Melicertes her son, threw herself into the sea. Liber\n        would have her called Leucothea, and Melicertes, her son the god Palaemon, butwe call her Mater Matuta, and him\n        Portunus. In his honor every fifth year gymnastic contests are held, which are called Isthmian.\n\nWhile Phrixus and Helle under madness sent by Liber were wandering in a forest, Nebula their mother is said to\n        have come there bringing a gilded ram, offspring of Neptune and Theophane. She bade her children to mount it,\n        and journey to Colchis to King Aeetes, son of Sol, and there sacrifice the ram to Mars. This they were said to\n        have done, but when they had mounted, and the ram had carried them over the sea, Helle fell from the ram; from\n        this sea was called Hellespont. Phrixus, however, was carried to Colchis, where, as his mother had bidden, he\n        sacrificed the ram, and placed its gilded fleece in the temple of Mars - the very fleece which, guarded by a\n        dragon, it is said Jason, son of Aeson and Alcimede, came to secure. But Aeetes gladly welcomed Phrixus, and\n        gave him his daughter Chalciope in marriage. She later bore him children, but Aeetes feared that they would\n        drive him from his kingdom, because he had been warned by prodigies to beware of death at the hands of a\n        foreigner, a son of Aeolus. Therefore he killed Phrixus. But Phrixus’ sons – Argus, Melas, and\n        Cylindrus – took ship to go to their grandfather Athamas. They were shipwrecked, however, and Jason, on\n        his trip for the fleece, rescued them from the island of Dia, and took them back to their mother Chalciope. By\n        her favour he was recommended to her sister Medea.\n\nWhen Athamas, king in Thessaly, thought that his wife Ino, by whom he begat two sons, had perished, he married\n        Themisto, the daughter of a nymph, and had twin sons by her. Later he discovered that Ino was on Parnassus,\n        where she had gone for the Bacchic revels. He sent someone to bring her home, and concealed her when she came.\n        Themisto discovered she had been found, but didn’t know her identity. She conceived the desire of killing\n        Ino’s sons, and made Ino herself, whom she believed to be a captive, a confidant in the plan, telling her\n        to cover her children with white garments, but Ino’s with black. Ino covered her own with white, and\n        Themisto’s with dark; then Themisto mistakenly slew her own sons. When she discovered this, she killed\n        herself. Moreover, Athamas, while hunting, in a fit of madness killed his older son Learchus; but Ino with the\n        younger, Melicertes, cast herself intot he sea and was made a goddess.",
