His\n        main cult centre was at Thebes, the place of his birth in myth.\n\nIn classical art Herakles was depicted as a muscular man with a club and lion-skin cape.\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 4. 32. 1 (trans.

There are altars of Herakles and Hebe, who they think is\n        the daughter of Zeus and wife to Herakles. An altar has been built to Alkmena and to Iolaos, who shared with\n        Herakles most of his labours.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 30. 2 :\n        \"In the Akadamia [of Athens] . . . there is an altar to the Muses, and another to Hermes, and one within to\n        Athena, and they have built one to Herakles.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 1. 8. 4 :\n        \"[In Athens] is a sanctuary of Ares, where are placed two images of Aphrodite, one of Ares made by\n        Alkamenes . . .

Here is also a portrait of the hero Marathon, after whom the plain is\n        named, of Theseus represented as coming up from the underworld, of Athena and of Herakles [i.e. Herakles the\n        god, come to assist the Athenians in battle].

The Marathonians worship both those who died in\n        the fighting, calling them heroes, and secondly Marathon, from whom the parish derives its name, and then\n        Herakles, saying that they were the first among the Greeks to acknowledge him as a god.\"\n\nHerodotus, Histories 6. 108. 1 (trans.

All the works of this artist, although\n        rather uncouth to look at, are nevertheless distinguished by a kind of inspiration.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 9. 8 :\n        \"Here [near the sanctuary of Apollon Lykeios in Sikyon] there is a bronze Herakles, made by Lysippos the\n        Sikyonian, and hard by stands Hermes Agoraios (of the Market-place).\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 10. 1 :\n        \"In the gymnasium not far from the market-place [of Sikyon] is dedicated a stone Herakles made by Skopas.\n        There is also in another place a sanctuary of Herakles. The whole of the enclosure here they name Paedize; in\n        the middle of the enclosure is the sanctuary, and in it is an old wooden figure carved by Laphaes the Phliasian.\n        I will now describe the ritual at the festival. The story is that on coming to the Sikyonian land Phaistos found\n        the people giving offerings to Herakles as to a hero. Phaistos then refused to do anything of the kind, but\n        insisted on sacrificing to him as a god. Even at the present day the Sikyonians, after slaying a lamb and\n        burning the thighs upon the altar, eat some of the meat as part of a victim given to a god, while the rest they\n        offer as to a hero. The first day of the festival in honour of Herakles they name [text missing]; the second\n        they call Herakleia.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 7. 26. 6 :\n        \"Anyone who has already seen the Herakles at Sikyon would be led to conjecture that the Apollon in Aigeira\n        was also a work of the same artist, Laphaes the Phliasian.\"\n\nStatius, Silvae 3. 1. 1 (trans.

As he went out to find the lion, he came to Kleonai, where he was a guest at the home of a poor man\n        named Molorkhos. Molorkhos wanted to make an animal sacrifice, but Herakles told him to hold off for thirty\n        days, and then, if he returned safe from the hunt, to sacrifice to Zeus Soter (Saviour), but if he were dead, to\n        sacrifice to Herakles himself as a hero . . .\n        [After slaying the lion :] He then draped it over his shoulders and took it back to Kleonai. There he found\n        Molorkhos on the thirtieth day about ot offer sacrifice to him as a dead man; but he himself sacrificed instead\n        to Zeus Soter, and took the lion on to Mykenai.\"\n\nStatius, Thebaid 4. 156 ff (trans. Mozley) (Roman epic C1st A.D.) :\n        \"They [the army of the Seven against Thebes] sing the paean of Hercules and the world swept clear of\n        monsters: the god listens from afar on leafy Oeta [the scene of his apotheosis]. Nemea gives them comrades and\n        all the might that the sacred vineyards of Cleonaean Molorchus summon to war. Well known is the glory of that\n        cottage; pictured upon its willow doors are the arms of the god [Herakles] who was its guest, and in the humble\n        field 'tis shown where he laid his club, and under what holm-oak he reposed his limbs at ease, and where yet the\n        ground bears traces of his lying.\"\n\nStatius, Silvae 3. 1. 1 (trans. Mozley) (Roman poetry C1st A.D.) :\n        \"Not in Nemea or ancient Argos shall I [Herakles the god] more often dwell, or in my home at Tibur [Rome]\n        or in Gades [in Spain].\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 28. 2 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"As you go up to Mount Koryphon you see by the road an olive tree called Twisted. It was Herakles who gave\n        it this shape by bending it round with his hand, but I cannot say whether he set it to be a boundary mark\n        against the Asinaeans in Argolis, since in no land, which has been depopulated, is it easy to discover the truth\n        about the boundaries.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 32. 4 :\n        \"I remember, too, seeing the house of Hippolytos [in Troizenos]; before it is what is called the Fountain\n        of Herakles, for Herakles, say the Troizenians, discovered the water.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 2. 34. 1 :\n        \"On the coast has been founded a little town called Methana. Here there is a sanctuary of Isis, and on the\n        market-place is an image of Hermes, and also one of Herakles.\"\n\nPindar, Nemean Ode 10. 52 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :\n        \"The two brothers [the Dioskouroi], at the games of Sparta's wide-built city, joint partons with Hermes and\n        with Herakles the presidency share.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 14. 6 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"The Lakedaimonians give the name Running Course to the place where it is the custom for the young men even\n        down to the present day to practise running. As you go to this Course from the grave of the Agiadai, you see on\n        the left the tomb of Eumedes--this Eumedes was one of the children of Hippokoon - and also an old image of\n        Herakles, to whom sacrifice is paid by the Sphaireis. These are those who are just passing from youth to\n        manhood. In the Course are two gymnastic schools.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 15. 3 :\n        \"There are sanctuaries of Helene and of Herakles [in Sparta]; the former is near the grave of Alkman, the\n        latter is quite close to the wall and contains an armed image of Herakles. The attitude of the image is due,\n        they say, to the fight with Hippokoon and his sons. The enmity of Herakles towards the family of Hippokoon is\n        said to have sprung out of their refusing to cleanse him when he came to Sparta for cleansing after the death of\n        Iphitos.\n        The following incident, too, helped to begin the feud. Oionos, a stripling cousin of Herakles--he was the son of\n        Likymnios the brother of Alkmene--came to Sparta along with Herakles, and went round to view the city. When he\n        came to the house of Hippokoon, a house-dog attacked him. Oionos happened to throw a stone which knocked over\n        the dog. So the sons of Hippokoon ran out, and dispatched Oionos with their clubs.\n        This made Herakles most bitterly wroth with Hippokoon and his sons, and straightway, angry as he was, he set out\n        to give them battle. On this occasion he was wounded, and made good his retreat by stealth but afterwards he\n        made an expedition against Sparta and succeeded in avenging himself on Hippokoon, and also on the sons of\n        Hippokoon for their murder of Oionos. The tomb of Oionos is built by the side of the sanctuary of\n        Herakles.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 17. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"On the bronze [of the bronze house of Athene on the Akropolis of Sparta] are wrought in relief many of the\n        labours of Herakles and many of the voluntary exploits he successfully carried out.\"\n\nPtolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 2 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190)\n          (trans. Pearse) (Greek mythographer C1st to C2nd A.D.) :\n        \"He [Hephaestion] says that . . . Herakles, after the Nemean lion had bitten off one of his fingers had\n        only nine and that there exists a tomb erected for this detached finger; other authors say that he lost his\n        finger following a blow by a dart of a stingray and one can see at Sparta a stone lion erected on the tomb of\n        the finger and which is the symbol of the power of the hero. It is since then that stone lions have likewise\n        been erected on the tombs of other important people; other authors give different explications of the lion\n        statues.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 10. 6 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)\n          :\n        \"On the way from the Hermai the whole of the region is full of oak-trees . . . and there is a sanctuary of\n        Zeus Skotitas on the left of the road and about ten stades from it. If you go back from the sanctuary to the\n        road, advance a little and then turn again to the left, you come to an image of Herakles and a trophy, which I\n        was told Heracles raised after killing Hippokoon and his sons.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 3. 21. 8 :\n        \"The people of Gythion say that their city had no human founder, but that Herakles and Apollo, when they\n        were reconciled after their strife for the possession of the tripod, united to found the city.

The story goes that the Pythian priestess ordained that\n        Iphitos himself and the Eleans must renew the Olympic games. Iphitos also induced the Eleans to sacrifice to\n        Herakles as to a god, whom hitherto they had looked upon as their enemy.

The victors crowned by Herakles include Iolaos, who won with the mares of Herakles . . . Of Herakles\n        himself it is said that he won victories at wrestling and the pancratium.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 10. 9 :\n        \"Most of the labours of Herakles are represented at Olympia [on one of the pediments of the temple of Zeus\n        Olympios]. Above the doors of the temple is carved the hunting of the Arkadian boar, his exploit against\n        Diomedes the Thrakian, and that against Geryones at Erytheia; he is also about to receive the burden of Atlas,\n        and he cleanses the land from dung for the Eleans. Above the doors of the rear chamber he is taking the girdle\n        from the Amazon; and there are the affairs of the deer, of the bull at Knossos, of the Stymphalian birds, of the\n        Hydra, and of the Argive lion.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 13. 1 :\n        \"The sanctuary [Pelopion at Olympia] is said to have been set apart to Pelops by Herakles the son of\n        Amphitryon. Herakles too was a great-grandson of Pelops, and he is also said to have sacrificed to him into the\n        pit. Right down to the present day the magistrates of the year sacrifice to him, and the victim is a black ram.\n        No portion of this sacrifice goes to the sooth-sayer, only the neck of the ram it is usual to give to the\n        'woodman,' as he is called.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 13. 8 :\n        \"The altar of Zeus Olympios is about equally distant from the Pelopion (Temple of Pelops) and the sanctuary\n        of Hera, but it is in front of both. Some say that it was built by Herakles Idaios, others by the local heroes\n        two generations later than Herakles. It has been made from the ash of the thighs of the victims sacrificed to\n        Zeus.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 14. 1 - 2 :\n        \"The [great] altar [of Zeus] at Olympia shows another strange peculiarity, which is this. The kite, the\n        bird of prey with the most rapacious nature, never harms those who are sacrificing at Olympia. Should ever a\n        kite seize the entrails or some of the flesh, it is regarded as an unfavorable sign for the sacrificer. There is\n        a story that when Herakles the son of Alkmena was sacrificing at Olympia he was much worried by the flies. So\n        either on his own initiative or at somebody's suggestion he sacrificed to Zeus Averter of Flies, and thus the\n        flies were diverted to the other side of the Alpheios. It is said that in the same way the Eleans too sacrifice\n        to Zeus Averter of Flies, to drive1 the flies out of Olympia.\n        The Eleans are wont to use for the sacrifices to Zeus the wood of the white poplar and of no other tree,\n        preferring the white poplar, I think, simply and solely because Herakles brought it into Greece from Thesprotia.\n        And it is my opinion that when Herakles sacrificed to Zeus at Olympia he himself burned the thigh bones of the\n        victims upon wood of the white poplar. Herakles found the white poplar growing on the banks of the Akheron, the\n        river in Thesprotia.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 25. 11 :\n        \"Not far from the offering of the Akhaians [at Olympia] there is also a Herakles fighting with the Amazon,\n        a woman on horseback, for her girdle. It was dedicated by Euagoras, a Zanclaean by descent, and made by\n        Aristokles of Kydonia. Aristokles should be included amongst the most ancient sculptors, and though his date is\n        uncertain, he was clearly born before Zankle took its present name of Messene.\n        The Thasians [of the Greek island of Thasos] . . . dedicated at Olympia a Herakles, the pedestal as well as the\n        image being of bronze. The height of the image is ten cubits, and he holds a club in his right hand and a bow in\n        his left.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 5. 26. 7 :\n        \"By the smaller offerings of Mikythos [at Olympia], that were made by Dionysios, are some of the exploits\n        of Herakles, including what he did to the Nemean lion, the Hydra, the Hound of Hell, and the boar by the river\n        Erymanthos. These were brought to Olympia by the people of Herakleia [in Bithynia] when they had overrun the\n        land of the Mariandynians, their foreign neighbors.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 6. 19. 12 :\n        \"The Megarians who are neighbors of Attika built a treasury [at Olympia] and dedicated in it offerings,\n        small cedar-wood figures inlaid with gold, representing the fight of Herakles with Akheloos. The figures include\n        Zeus, Deianeira, Akheloos, Herakles, and Ares helping Akheloos. There once stood here an image of Athena, as\n        being an ally of Herakles, but it now stands by the Hesperides in the Heraion.\"\n\nPausanias, Description of Greece 6. 21. 3 :\n        \"On crossing the river Erymanthos at what is called the ridge of Sauros (Lizard) are the tomb of Sauros and\n        a sanctuary of Herakles, now in ruins sanctuary of Heracles, now in ruins. The story is that Sauros used to do\n        mischief to travellers and to dwellers in the neighborhood until he received his punishment at the hands of\n        Herakles.\"\n\nA complete bibliography of the translations quoted on this page.",
