  "content": "The Battle of Philadelphia was a battle to save Philadelphia led by Billy Batson, who was fighting Kalypso and Ladon while his family led an army of unicorns to attack the monsters. It concluded with the voluntary sacrifice of Billy Batson, who died energizing the Staff of the Gods to kill Kalypso and Ladon in their final duel in the dome.\n\nWonder Woman, knowing of Batson's sacrifice to save Philadelphia, would decide to travel to Mount Olympus to restore the power of the magical staff and bring Batson back to life. The next day, Batson's foster family, accompanied by Anthea and Shazam, traveled to Mount Olympus to lay a wake for him, burying him under the Tree of Life, with Freeman leaving a photo of him with Batson when they first met.\n\nHowever, they were soon surprised by the presence of Wonder Woman, who approached to take the staff and invoke lightning over it, restoring its power and bringing Billy Batson back to life, who came out of his burial, also restoring the powers of Anthea and the fauna of the place. Seeing Wonder Woman, Batson briefly spoke to her, trying to ask her out of it, something she refused as she withdrew. Batson then used the staff to restore his family's powers.\n\nHaving Billy Batson alive again, Amanda Waller began to take an interest in him for which she began to investigate him, considering him to join the Justice Society as he was too powerful, sending Emilia Harcourt and John Economos to Philadelphia to try to recruit him in the team.[1]",
