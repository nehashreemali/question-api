  "content": "The Rock of Eternity is a realm where the Council of Wizards formerly resided. It is said to be the source of all magic in existence. It is also where Shazam gave Billy Batson and Teth-Adam their powers, and where the statues imprisoning the Seven Deadly Sins, the Eye of Sin, and the terrarium holding Mister Mind are kept.\n\nThe Rock of Eternity was once the residence of the Council of Wizards. At some point, the wizards chose Hurut as their first champion and entrusted their powers to him for his heroic and courageous acts, allowing him to become the ruler of Kahndaq. However, Hurut would pass on his power to his father to save him.\n\nAfter Hurut was killed, Teth-Adam became ruthless and filled with revenge after his family was murdered, prompting him to unleash the Seven Deadly Sins, resulting in the deaths of many Kahndaqians and the destruction of several ancient civilizations. Therefore, the Wizards set out to stop them, but all of them were killed except Shazam, who managed to entrap the Sins within the Eye of Sin. Afterwards, Shazam sealed Teth-Adam deep within the Earth. Since then, Shazam was left old and alone and his siblings' thrones lay empty.\n\nAfter Black Adam became fallen, the wizard attempted to select a new champion, summoning each candidate to the Rock. However, the temptation of power from the Sins was too great; Thaddeus Sivana was one such rejected candidate. As an adult, Sivana figured out how to open a portal to the realm by writing a specific sequence of magical symbols. He broke into the Rock of Eternity and stole the Eye of Sin, merging the Sins with himself.\n\nWhen Billy Batson found himself on a subway train, the wizard Shazam teleported him to this realm. The wizard asked Billy to say his name, and when he did, he gained his powers. As the wizard crumbled into dust, a terrified Billy thought of the subway train on which he had arrived and was transported back to Earth.\n\nBilly, as Shazam, and Sivana returned to the realm when the latter coerced him into giving over his powers, but they were interrupted by his foster siblings. As they fled Sivana, they desperately searched for an exit, eventually ending up at a rotunda of doors, each leading to a different world. With Sivana closing in, Mary asked Billy how he left the Rock of Eternity before. Billy admitted he merely thought of where he wanted to go, so he transported them to the gentlemen's club in Philadelphia with Sivana in pursuit.[1]\n\nAfter the empowerment of the siblings and Sivana's defeat, they returned to the Rock. Billy put the Eye back and re-imprisoned the Sins. Freddy Freeman was thrilled they had found a place of their own. They proceeded to sit on six of the thrones before noticing an empty seventh throne.[2]\n\nIn order to gain entry to the Rock of Eternity, seven symbols must be repeated in a sequence of seven times on a door. Only three have been named, by Thaddeus Sivana while he was imprisoned.\n\nDirector David F. Sandberg described the Rock of Eternity as the \"biggest and most elaborate\" set that was created for Shazam!. The set was over 40 feet tall in some places, with the walls being over a hundred feet long.[3]",
