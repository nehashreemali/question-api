  "content": "Kryptonite is a glowing green, radioactive mineral from the planet Krypton that was created in the aftermath of the terraformation process of the World Engine in the Indian Ocean during the Black Zero Event. After Superman destroyed the engine, pieces of kryptonite were found in the water. The mineral's properties make it the greatest weakness of Kryptonians, as its radiation is extremely toxic, potentially deadly to them.\n\nDuring the terraforming process of the World Engine and Black Zero in the Indian Ocean and Metropolis respectively, small portions of submerged land were terraformed into large nuggets of green Kryptonite.[2]\n\nDuring the restoration of the city following the Battle of Metropolis, Lex Luthor discovered a small portion of the xenomineral, fashioned a small splinter into a scalpel blade and used it on the corpse of General Dru-Zod to test its effects on Kryptonians. Satisfied on finally discovering an exploitable physical weakness of Superman, Lex promptly funds missions to explore the World Engine's wreckage, and 18 months after its destruction, the kryptonite nugget (nicknamed \"Emerald City\" by Lex) was finally found.[3]\n\nDespite Senator Finch placing an embargo on the large kryptonite nugget from the Indian Ocean, Lex managed to ship the xenomineral to Metropolis and enlisted the armed guard of Anatoli Knyazev and his men to transport it to LexCorp Industries. Batman oversaw the shipment from afar and shot a homing beacon at the truck to track it. Later, Batman arrived in the Batmobile to steal the kryptonite nugget, dispatching the guards and chasing after the truck. However, before he could steal the kryptonite, Superman himself arrived and swiftly stopped the Batmobile in its tracks. Afterwards, an undeterred Batman infiltrated the LexCorp building and stole the kryptonite, leaving behind a batarang as a symbol.[3]\n\nAt the Batcave, Bruce Wayne then used high-powered lasers to cut through the xenomaterial. He thus transmuted the kryptonite into a sharp kryptonite-tipped spear, as well as three grenades of kryptonite-rich gas. During the battle between Batman and Superman, he shoots two gas grenades at the Man of Steel, which temporarily weakened him to human-like levels, allowing the heavily armored Batman to swiftly gain the upper hand. Finally, as Batman was about to impale Superman with his kryptonite spear, Superman and Lois managed to convince Batman to change his mind, and they proceeded to become allies, agreeing to team up against Lex Luthor, the true enemy.[3]\n\nDuring the battle against Doomsday, Superman retrieved the Kryptonite Spear left behind at the site of the previous battle, struggling to fly against the xenomineral's weakening effects. With a tremendous amount of determination and willpower, he ultimately managed. While Wonder Woman struggled to hold Doomsday at bay with her Lasso of Hestia, Batman fired a kryptonite gas grenade at the monster, managing to momentarily weaken it, thereby giving Superman the opening he needed to charge at Doomsday and deliver the killing blow with the spear, plunging it through the monster's heart. However, the dying monster, in his final moments, managed to loosen the lasso's hold on himself, and impaled Superman with his tremendously sharp and hard bone protrusion, killing the latter as well.[3]\n\nSometime after Superman's resurrection, mercenary Robert DuBois, aka Bloodsport, employed forged Kryptonite bullets to use against the Kryptonian, wounding him enough to send him to an intensive care unit, while DuBois was incarcerated at the Belle Reve Correctional Center.[4]\n\nA piece of Kryptonite was displayed at the St. Roch Museum during an exhibition of rare minerals that had been known to have fallen to the Earth.[5]\n\nThe radioactive green kryptonite xenomineral is known to be the greatest weakness of all Kryptonians, since the xenomineral's radiation is extremely toxic, potentially deadly to any of them. It does so by degrading Kryptonian cells, causing them to degenerate and decay on contact. This allowed physical damage to a Kryptonian to be possible, as well as extremely weakening their superpowers and invulnerability to almost human levels. Physical symptoms of exposure are somewhat fever-like, including nausea, weakness, dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, immense amounts of pain, and loss (or near loss) of consciousness.\n\nWounds inflicted on Kryptonians by kryptonite do not disappear when the xenomineral leaves their presence, and only direct exposure to sunlight can instantly allow a Kryptonian to recover completely from its damaging effects and these otherwise incurable wounds. Kryptonite-rich gas can significantly reduce a Kryptonian's strength, durability, resilience and mobility, causing them to move as slow as a normal human, to lose their flight and enhanced sensory abilities, as well as to be weakened enough to be incapacitated by physical attacks by someone as strong as Batman in his Armored Batsuit (only 28 times stronger than a human[6]).\n\nDespite kryptonite gas' effects only lasting a few minutes at most, the weakening effects can still linger briefly, with it therefore taking a few more minutes for a Kryptonian to fully regain his/her superpowers.",
