  "content": "A Batarang is a bat-shaped throwing weapon used by Batman as a non-lethal ranged attack alternative to firearms. Batarangs are one of the many gadgets kept in Batman's utility belt. The name \"batarang\" is a portmanteau of \"bat\" and \"boomerang,\" a similar throwing device.\n\nBatman also leaves batarangs near crime scenes after he's finished as a calling card, with a dual purpose using them as a psychological weapon against other potential wrongdoers.[1]\n\nThe vigilante Batman uses batarangs in his crusade against crime. He left one behind at the crime scene of Cesar Santos' arrest to inform the GCPD of his presence, left one at LexCorp to let their CEO know he took his kryptonite, and he later threw one into a criminal's chest during the Rescue of Martha Kent.\n\nSometime later, when Steppenwolf reappeared on Earth, Batman started assembling the Justice League by recruiting Barry Allen in Central City.\n\nBruce suddenly hurled a batarang at him, but Barry instinctively used his speed to dodge and catch it. Barry, admiring the batarang, asked Bruce if he could keep it as a souvenir.\n\nFreddy Freeman, an orphan from Philadelphia, owns a replica batarang that he keeps with other metahuman memorabilia. However, how he got it is unknown. Whilst Thaddeus Sivana attacked Billy in the Rock of Eternity, Freddy managed to throw the replica batarang at the back of Sivana's head, giving him a cut, inadvertently revealing Sivana's weakness to Billy.[2]\n\nBefore rescuing Supergirl, Batman uses his batarangs to knock out 6 Russian soldiers in the Siberian Black Site.[3]",
