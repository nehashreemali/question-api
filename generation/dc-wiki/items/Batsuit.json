  "content": "The Batsuits are Batman's assortment of tactical uniforms in his war on crime in Gotham City. Batman wears the suits to both conceal his true identity and to frighten criminals.\n\nThe Batsuit is typically used by Bruce Wayne when patrolling Gotham City, it is a technical grey tri-weave carbon fiber suit around his torso and legs, with a black hood and a large cape. His hands are protected by armored gloves and he has gauntlets on his wrists with three razor-sharp blades. The hood incorporates a robotic voice modifier to disguise the billionaire's real voice, and several retractable lenses.\n\nHis feet and shins are protected by thick black armored boots. Around his waist is his utility belt, an arsenal of gadgets including Batarangs and his grapple gun. The suit is shown to have rips, tears and such, recalling his long and violent career in fighting evil. The suit protects him and his identity, but is also a symbol of fear to his enemies.[1]\n\nWhen he managed to steal Lex Luthor's Kryptonite, Wayne prepared to face Superman, crafting a powered exoskeleton version of the Batsuit far more durable than the original version in order to withstand the Kryptonian's blows. Seemingly made of some sort of metal, this Batsuit has eyes that glow a slight blueish hue, making them visible in low light, unlike the original suit. The suit's armor and mechanisms can greatly increase effort, strain, and endurance to superhuman capabilities, making it useful in combat against opponents as powerful as Superman himself.\n\nFollowing Superman's death, Wayne updated and improved his standard Batsuit, modifying the jumpsuits into square plate shapes that protruded from the musculature and also adding an entirely new cowl with very different ears and updated gauntlets. During the War for Earth, Wayne employed this suit during the attempted ambush of Steppenwolf with the newly formed Justice League.[1]\n\nIn order to take on Steppenwolf at the Battle of Pozharnov, Wayne donned an upgraded version of the regular Batsuit, which features another layer of armor, needing to up his \"game\" to fight along his far more powerful teammates and stop the alien invasion. The suit features goggles to help him pilot the Flying Fox and lighter, more lightweight armor than the armored version to help him take a beating while still being able to move and land quick punches.[2]\n\nEventually, Wayne would utilize an adapted version of his Batsuit, which features a full grey skin suit with a blue fitted cowl attached to his cape, beneath various pieces of light armor combined and attached to his torso, arms, and legs. It features a gold tactical belt and is also capable of gliding. Wayne employed the suit during the Chase of Al Falcone.[3]\n\nIn an alternate future where Darkseid returned to Earth and took control of Superman via the Anti-Life Equation, Batman wore a modified version of the standard Batsuit featuring a beige trench coat, a black balaclava, and goggles. He was equipped with his customized assault rifle slung across his back, a pistol holstered on his right leg, and a pair of binoculars. This version lacks the black cape.[2]\n\nBruce Wayne had 7 available Batsuits to use during his career as Batman. His Batsuits and gadgets were often stored within a secure vault hidden behind a bookshelf at Wayne Manor. Eventually, Bruce decided to retire from being Batman and with that, abandoned most of his equipment.[3]\n\nOnce Bruce was persuaded by Barry Allen to come out of retirement, he equipped his primary Batsuit and helped him and his in-universe counterpart on their quest to stop General Zod. They first flew to a Siberian Black Site in order to rescue Kal-El/\"Superman\". Batman used his suit-attached Speargun to grapple him and the Barrys up to the facility. Using the suit's cape, he glided down to a lower floor while fighting a mercenary team that operated at the site. At times, he'd also use the cape as a bullet shield. Batman later glided down to an escape tunnel beneath the cell of Kara Zor-El, who was discovered instead of Kal-El.\n\nThe trio safely returned to Wayne Manor with Kara. In the bathroom, Bruce stitched up his wounds while his suit parts lied on the floor.[3]\n\nBruce later suited back up without a cowl while chatting with the Barrys. When fully suited, he flew them and Kara Zor-El to Edwards Air Force Base, where a war between Zod and the United States Military unfolded. His aircraft, the Batwing, was later attacked by Nam-Ek, forcing him to glide out. Batman eventually landed and deployed several Sticky Bombs on Nam-Ek, who then swung Bruce to the ground by his cape before being knocked unconscious by the bombs. Barry immediately ran over to check on Bruce and tried unmasking him. Though Bruce stopped him, knowing he wanted to die being Batman.[3]\n\nBruce Wayne was seen donning his Batsuit and chasing his archnemesis, the Joker, while a multiversal collision occurred around him, which ended up being reverted by Barry Allen.[3]\n\nThe Batsuits have numerous function to help Bruce in his crime fighting duties:",
