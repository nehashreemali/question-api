  "content": "The Lasso of Hestia, also known as the Lasso of Truth[1], is a magical golden lasso that is currently the signature weapon of Wonder Woman. Previously owned by the Greek goddess Hestia, it is an indestructible rope used in battle for both offensive and defensive purposes.\n\nIn addition to its abilities in battle, the lasso also compels whoever is in physical contact with it to tell only the truth when questioned. Those who try and resist experience a hot burning pain radiate from the lasso.[2]\n\nThe lasso itself is approximately twenty feet long, giving it sufficient range whilst not compromising the user's ability to wield it sufficiently.[2] However, its length can be magically extended to allow for extra range.\n\nThe lasso was presumably created sometime during the Age of Gods, and gifted to the Amazons prior to the war that ended most of them.\n\nFor millennia, the Amazons housed the lasso with their other great treasures in the armory on the island of Themyscira.[3]\n\nAfter crashing in the waters of Themyscira, Amazonian leaders used the lasso and its truth-revealing powers to question American spy Steve Trevor.\n\nDiana first took the lasso as her own when she raided the armory in preparation to head into man's world, along with the God killer and her signature shield and armor. Once there, she began to use the lasso regularly, first using it as a weapon during the Battle of Veld and during her final battle with Ares.\n\nDuring the Airfield Battle, Ares demonstrated that it is possible to resist the lasso's effect, as he did when he ignored Diana's questions and instead used his powers to show her a different \"reality\", which he considered as the truth.[3]\n\nDiana used the lasso to restrain Doomsday to be killed by Superman using the kryptonite spear in the Showdown in Gotham Port.\n\nWonder Woman would be forced to intervene in an attack caused by the Retrobots in a stadium, where she would use her lasso of truth to destroy them while collaborating with Wonderous Serena. When the heroines infiltrated S.T.A.R. Labs in search of information, Diana used her lasso to stop a retrobot that almost gave them away.[4] A short time later and after discovering who was responsible for the retrobot attacks, Wonder Woman used the Lasso of Truth to detain Doctor Cyber, and being under the power of the Lasso, Cyber was forced to reveal the location of the prisoners of their actions as well as having to reprogram the Retrobots.[5]\n\nAfter Batman chased down Al Falcone to retrieve a dangerous virus, he charged at him, who was in possession of the virus, which led them dangling over the Gotham river, as they were about to fall, Wonder Woman comes to the rescue and lifted them with the lasso. The lasso entangles Batman and Al, as well as Flash who went to help them untangle, which results them in confessing their issues and secrets.[6]\n\nWhen not in use, the lasso appears to be a regular rope made of gold; however, when in use as a weapon or truth-detector, it glows bright yellow.[3]\n\nWhen in use as a weapon, the lasso responds telepathically to its user, and acts as an extension of their body.[7] It can be used either defensively or offensively, often in a whip-like manner. For example, it can be used to bind enemies, as seen against the monster Doomsday; or to throw items and whip people away, as seen during the Battle of Veld. As an extension of its user, the lasso will go wherever they wish; the only beings seen to resist its grip have been the god Ares and the alien being known as Superman.\n\nWhile the lasso itself is 20 feet long, it can also magically extend and return as needed by the will of its user. It is extremely durable and seemingly unbreakable, as well.\n\nIn addition to use as a weapon, the lasso compels anyone who makes contact with it to tell the truth. This ability has been shown to work both actively, such in the case of Steve Trevor's interrogation by the Amazons; or passively, as when Aquaman unknowingly sat on the lasso and revealed his inner thoughts.[3][8] There appears to be no restrictions on who can wield the lasso, as human Steve Trevor once used the lasso of his own volition to promise Diana Prince he would take her to the front.\n\nThe lasso's truth-telling abilities were shown to have only a limited effect on powerful supernatural beings like Old Gods, as demonstrated by Ares during his confrontation with Diana. While bound by the lasso, Ares ignored Diana's questions and instead showed her his history and own truth, the peaceful world without humanity (although, while he didn't directly answer Diana's questions, he did reveal to her what as far as he concerned was the truth).[3]",
