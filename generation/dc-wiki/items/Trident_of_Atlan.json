  "content": "The Trident of Atlan, also known as the Sacred Trident, is an ancient Atlantean relic forged for and originally wielded by the ancient king of Atlantis, Atlan. Centuries after Atlan's exile and death, the trident was claimed by one of his descendants, Aquaman, to defeat Orm Marius and he became the new king of Atlantis.\n\nThe Trident was forged in the Kingdom of the Deserters from the steel of Poseidon for Atlan, the first ruler of Atlantis.\n\nOne day, during an experiment conducted by Atlan, the power of the trident released a powerful wave of energy that sunk Atlantis to the bottom of the ocean, mutating the citizens to be able to survive underwater.[1]\n\nFollowing the Great Fall, a guilt-ridden and horrified Atlan exiled himself to the Hidden Sea, charging the Karathen with protecting it from all but the rightful heir to the throne of Atlantis. The Karathen implies that while dead, Atlan's consciousness and spirit still lingers in his skeleton so that even if the Karathen is defeated, his skeleton will not release it until the rightful heir attempts to remove it.[1]\n\nIn 2018, following the destruction of his mother's trident, Arthur Curry traveled to the Hidden Sea to recover the Sacred Trident as the true King of Atlantis. After proving himself to the Karathen, Curry used the power of the trident to connect to all of the animals in the sea.[1]\n\nAs Orm was laying waste to the Kingdom of the Brine, Aquaman burst forth from the molten seabed riding atop of the head of the Karathen brandishing the Trident in all of its torrential glory. While all on the battlefield saw such a phenomenon take place, Ocean Master was not deterred.[1]\n\nPressing the attack with his legions just as Arthur Curry summoned an army of countless sea forms from all across the deep; including the savage Trench, to aid him in battle.[1]\n\nEven causing many a mount of his hated brother's forces to turn on their riders in the battle. In final battle while atop one of the Atlantean galleons, the two would resume the battle that took place in Atlantis some time ago. This time, Arthur had the advantage of being out in the open air, as Orm was inexperienced with fighting outside of the water. Over a long drawn-out battle with many on both Arthur and Orm's side watching, Aquaman disarms the would-be conqueror by splintering his trident with one blow; right after performing the pole arm technique Vulko taught him as a boy.[1]\n\nIn a potential future, the world fell into ruin as the entity known as Darkseid invaded the Earth and began terraforming it. He brought the war to Atlantis and impaled Arthur Curry with the trident, as he laid waste to the realm. Mera took up the trident to help save the world from the armies of Apokolips. When a mind-controlled Superman flew down to attack her and her teammates, Mera raised the trident, preparing to make her final stand. At a later point in time, the Trident could be seen in the ruins of the Justice League headquarters.[2]\n\nAtlan's Trident is an incredibly powerful weapon, which can only be handled by the true heir of Atlantis. This relic of immense importance serves as a conduit through which mariner kings can channel and greatly magnify their abilities.\n\nThrough it, any natural powers the king of Atlantis has are greatly magnified, allowing Atlan to stun the powerful New God Darkseid with a mere shockwave, and being granted possession over the full power of the seven seas and through it, their ability to command any creature amongst the vast oceans is greatly magnified. This was demonstrated when Arthur, the true heir of Atlantis, took the trident, and gained the ability to perfectly sense every creature of the ocean on the planet Earth and reach out to them all (including the savage Trench).\n\nHaving been created from an extremely dense metal, the trident is an extremely resilient weapon, which shows no apparent damage either from the ages nor after the extensive use that Atlan gave it; a prominent example of its durability and resiliency, was during Arthur's final clash with Orm: it was not only able to  break Orvax's trident, but it had the capability to shatter Orvax's trident like it was glass.\n\nIn addition, it is very likely that it is also magical in nature, like many tridents of Atlantis. An example would be when Arthur used it to conjure lightning underwater during the war against Orm's Atlantean forces.",
