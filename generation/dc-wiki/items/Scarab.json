  "content": "Khaji-Da, also known as The Scarab, is an ancient relic of alien biotechnology which, after choosing Jaime Reyes as host, turned him into the superhero Blue Beetle.\n\nBeing created as Reach technology, Khaji-Da along with other scarabs were released into space to conquer planets.[2] During Khaji-Da's interstellar journey, a member of the Green Lantern Corps collided with it,[3] sending the latter flying off course, crashing into a planet that was destroyed by the scarab, without stopping its course. Khaji-Da eventually landed on Earth in Chichen Itza during the Mayan Era.\n\nThe Scarab chose various inhabitants as hosts, whom it controlled and granted special abilities, the Mayans studied the scarab, appearing in multiple murals, while Khaji-Da remained on Earth for thousands of years. Dan Garrett eventually traveled to Chichen Itza and discovered the scarab, which fused with Garett to take him as a host. Ted Kord started a research to help him, doing several tests of what Khaji-Da would react on the human body, discovering that the only way to free himself was if Garrett died and concluded that activating it required the artifact to choose a host.\n\nUnable to activate the scarab on his own, Kord used his intellect to develop his own technology, including gadgets, tools, suits, and vehicles, to combat crime in Palmera City under the name Blue Beetle. Kord eventually decided to stop being a vigilante, disappearing from all records. Before his exile, Kord, knowing the risk of threat Khaji-Da posed, contained it in a giant orb located in a hidden area of South America.\n\nWith Ted Kord's mysterious disappearance, control of Kord Industries passed to his sister, Victoria Kord, a relentless woman who abandoned the company's philanthropic initiatives and refocused on weapons development, seeking to restore Project OMAC, a secret initiative to build cybernetically enhanced soldiers using alien technology. Victoria eventually recovered Khaji-Da from the secure warehouse in South America, with the goal of deciphering its structure, replicating it, and turning it into the basis of her private army.[2]\n\nDuring a secured containment phase within Kord Tower, Khaji-Da was subjected to invasive experimentation under the supervision of Dr. José Morales, acting under directives from Victoria Kord. The procedure sought to extract energy signatures and reverse-engineer the Scarab's biomechanical framework for the advancement of the OMAC program, an initiative designed to militarize alien technology.\n\nDr. Morales temporarily suspended the procedure to acquire sustenance from Big Belly Burger, leaving the laboratory unattended. During this interval, Jenny Kord, Ted Kord's daughter, infiltrated the tower posing as a lab technician. Using subterfuge and facial concealment, she navigated the upper-level corridors and initiated a brief encounter with Morales, during which she successfully removed her access credentials via sleight of hand.\n\nUpon accessing the laboratory, Jenny identified the Scarab, still active, though constrained by Kord Industries’ extraction apparatus, and immediately initiated a covert recovery. She secured Khaji-Da within the packaging of Dr. Morales' untouched hamburger and removed her disguise, blending into the facility’s routine foot traffic. While descending via the main elevator, she was noticed by Jaime Reyes, who was coincidentally present for a post-interview follow-up, and who began pursuing her in confusion.\n\nShortly thereafter, Morales returned to resume the extraction process, but upon discovering the Scarab’s absence, he initiated a security lockdown of Kord Tower to prevent exfiltration. Jenny Kord, aware that her time was limited and that Reyes had inadvertently become entangled, entrusted the Big Belly Burger box, containing Khaji-Da, to him. She instructed Reyes to guard it with his life, but not to open it or investigate its contents. Reluctant but eager to prove himself, Jaime Reyes complied and exited the premises, unaware of the alien weapon concealed within the fast-food container he carried.[2]\n\nThe Scarab was secured at Reyes Household, where the container was opened prematurely when Reyes' sister, Milagro Reyes, ignored Jenny’s instruction not to tamper with it. Encouraged by his family to inspect the contents, Jaime Reyes opened the containment box and discovered the alien Scarab, which responded immediately to his presence. Despite Reyes' efforts to return the object to the box, the Scarab became active, emitting a glow and transforming into a mobile form before launching itself at Reyes and initiating forced symbiosis.\n\nKhaji-Da, acting autonomously, engaged its bonding protocol and began biomechanical integration. Attempts by family members, including Rudy Reyes, to interrupt the process were met with defensive energy discharges. The Scarab penetrated Jaime’s spinal column and deployed armor plating, hoisting Reyes into the air and forming the Blue Beetle exosuit without host consent. The system then initiated a full combat readiness and flight calibration sequence, sending Reyes into uncontrolled flight through the atmosphere.\n\nDespite Jaime’s panic and verbal protests, the Scarab continued automated diagnostics, including a brief ascent into the upper atmosphere followed by a near freefall. The armor deployed its flight stabilizers and prevented lethal impact by activating wings just above the ocean surface.\n\nReyes, still disoriented and unaware of the Scarab’s purpose, attempted to negotiate with the system to return home. The Scarab misinterpreted the command, launching him at high speeds across the city and causing a collision with a bridge and several vehicles. A confrontation with an oncoming bus triggered the Scarab’s threat response subroutine, deploying an energy shield that inadvertently destroyed the vehicle. Jaime expressed horror at the destruction, unaware that the system had identified the object as a threat.\n\nFollowing the automated flight, Reyes was returned to the roof of his home in a semi-conscious state. Upon attempting to communicate with his family, he lost consciousness. When he later awoke, Reyes discovered the Scarab had embedded itself permanently into his spine. Disturbed by this revelation, he resolved to find Jenny Kord for answers, though his mother attempted to keep him at home due to the apparent danger. Jaime ultimately fled, stealing Rudy’s truck, The Taco, to locate her.[2]\n\nDuring an unsanctioned infiltration of Kord Plaza, the host Jaime Reyes, accompanied by Jenny Kord, encountered a localized broadcast disruption initiated by Rudy Reyes through a manually assembled device referred to as El Chapulín, successfully bypassing facility surveillance using an audiovisual override signal. The breach allowed them to advance into Kord Tower, and use the Ted Watch, a legacy device compatible with Kord security infrastructure, to access sealed sections of the tower.\n\nUpon exit, the group was intercepted by Ignacio Carapax, who demanded the return of Khaji-Da. As Carapax initiated physical aggression toward Reyes, the Scarab responded autonomously, generating partial armor and intercepting the blow with Reyes’ reinforced arm. Instinctive countermeasures followed, resulting in Carapax being forcibly displaced into nearby architectural structures. In retaliation, Carapax activated the OMAC prototype armor, launching a projectile toward Reyes. The Scarab deployed an energy shield, absorbing the impact.\n\nRecognizing the combat escalation, Host Reyes instructed Jenny Kord to locate Rudy Reyes while seeking cover. Despite recommendations from Khaji-Da’s tactical matrix to engage lethal arsenal systems, Reyes opted for verbal de-escalation, a request denied by Carapax, who weaponized the surrounding environment to disable the vehicle shield. After sustaining damage, Reyes authorized limited combat engagement. Khaji-Da deployed an electrical pulse discharge, followed by aerial propulsion and short-range energy blasts. Carapax was temporarily neutralized.\n\nKhaji-Da then generated dual plasma edge constructs for termination protocols; however, Reyes overrode the Scarab’s directives, expressing unwillingness to execute a disarmed opponent. The Scarab complied, recognizing the host’s ethical parameters. Jenny Kord and Rudy Reyes arrived in their vehicle to retrieve the host. Carapax, recovering, targeted the vehicle with sustained fire. Host Reyes intervened but was intercepted mid-charge. Carapax deployed a focused energy beam, forcing Reyes into a vehicle collision and severely weakening the armor’s reserves. With Carapax preparing a kill strike, Host Reyes verbally requested mercy.\n\nEl Chapulín was then launched into Carapax by Rudy and Jenny, generating a brief tactical opening. Reyes used the opportunity to retreat. Khaji-Da disengaged from armor mode during the escape, leaving Reyes in an unarmored state. In the aftermath, Host Reyes reported cognitive synchronization with the Scarab’s identity, verbally articulating the designation \"Khaji-Da\" for the first time, marking the beginning of deeper neural interface development between Scarab and host.\n\nJenny Kord returned to the Kord Estate with Jaime Reyes and Rudy Reyes to take them to the Bug Lair, where Rudy would research how to separate Reyes from Khaji-Da, discovering that it only left its host when it died, angering Reyes who decided to go for a walk. Jaime sat reflecting on the roof where he was found by Rudy, who conforted him, explaining that the universe chose him to carry the Scarab and he had to decide what to do with it, motivating him to be a hero, until he saw Victoria Kord's helicopter flying on them, deducting that she was going to his residence.[2]\n\nThe Reyes family became the target of a full-scale assault ordered by Victoria Kord, and Host Jaime Reyes, in response to locating his family in immediate danger, attempted to activate flight protocols from a static position but failed due to elevated emotional stress and incomplete neural focus. Prompted by Rudy Reyes to override hesitation, Host Reyes devised a high-risk maneuver, initiating freefall from a cliffside under the presumption that the Scarab’s defense protocols would ensure survival. The theory proved valid, and the armor deployment sequence was triggered mid-fall, transitioning into controlled aerial mobility. Upon reaching the Reyes residence, Reyes requested access to combat arsenal functions.\n\nKhaji-Da complied, initiating aerial suppression tactics to incapacitate hostile ground units. From above, Reyes communicated verbal reassurance to family members while simultaneously assessing tactical threats. Visual confirmation of ballistics proved the armor’s projectile resistance, affirming bulletproof integrity. However, enemy units were commanded to target non-combatants, so Khaji-Da immediately deployed an energy shield to protect the family cluster, responding to Reyes’ urgent plea for defensive intervention.\n\nWhile Reyes authorized arsenal use, he imposed a non-lethal constraint, and Khaji-Da adjusted combat protocol accordingly, deploying stun-grade energy cannons to disable attackers without fatal outcomes. Following perimeter suppression, Reyes instructed his family to evacuate the combat zone while the Scarab continued neutralizing hostiles. Deployment of tactical restraints (wrist-mounted smart cuffs) ensured immobilization of remaining assailants.\n\nKhaji-Da alerted Reyes to the status of Alberto Reyes, prompting him to assist, who ordered Milagro Reyes to escort their father to safety. However, airborne surveillance registered the approach of Victoria Kord’s transport helicopter. The host, registering heightened emotional distress, prepared an offensive countermeasure. Khaji-Da initialized targeting systems for potential anti-air deployment.\n\nThis process was aborted when the host became aware of Alberto Reyes experiencing a cardiac episode. Jaime abandoned all tactical actions and rushed to his father’s aid, at which point he was intercepted and incapacitated by a high-torque grappling apparatus launched from above. Immobilized and grieving, Reyes was extracted from the battlefield by Ignacio Carapax and forcibly taken aboard Victoria Kord’s aircraft.[2]\n\nStripped of his powers and restrained in a suspended rig, Jaime was subjected to a painful and invasive extraction procedure of extracting the Scarab code from his body by Victoria Kord, while Jenny and Milagro elsewhere in the compound discover Victoria's data bases stored for Project OMAC planned to have the Scarab code downloaded. As the system began severing the neural bonds between Khaji-Da and his body, Jaime entered a dissociative, dream-like near-death state, where he experiences a vision of the afterlife within the mental limbo, and reunites with his deceased father, Alberto Reyes.\n\nIn their deeply emotional encounter, Alberto told Jaime that his destiny was to share a moment with him to advise him, motivating him to fight when he understood his purpose. Khaji-Da, weakened but still connected to Jaime’s life force, responded to his will and began to reactivate when Jaime lunged towards his Blue Beetle Armor in reunion, their reconnecting brainwaves synchronizing. In real time, the Scarab’s energy surged throughout Jaime’s body, overriding the extraction process while Ignacio Carapax got the Scarab code painfully downloaded into him, upgrading his OMAC armor in the process.\n\nFully re-synchronized with the Scarab, Jaime broke free of his restraints and began making his escape after Jenny and Milagro infiltrate the compound's interior and used an explosive to blow up the machine keeping Jaime bounded. As Carapax was destroying the door, Reyes asked Khaji-Da to activate, but it reset, freaking out and starting to run when Carapax activated lasers to blow up the gate. After losing sight of him, Reyes attempted to reactivate Khaji-Da, getting frustrated as it kept rebooting.[2]\n\nKhaji-Da, now operating in full cooperation with Jaime, provided combat analysis, flight capability, and non-lethal alternatives to lethal force when Jaime hesitated to kill. While he was fighting, Reyes decided to activate pincers against them, but being knocked down by the soldiers, which Khaji-Da knocked out with a energy blast, and seeing a soldier escaping, Reyes stopped him with his pincers. Reyes was suddenly attacked by Ignacio Carapax with a cannon, who threw him out of the facility, fighting in the air.\n\nReyes asked Khaji-Da for rockets to counterattack the OMAC, shooting at it and then using swords, but getting knocked into a wall, being warned by the scarab that Carapax got stronger, running when he tried to attack him. Reyes continued to fight Carapax in the air, but when he destroyed the wings, Khaji-Da reported critical damage, with Jaime holding out until he fell to the ground. Reyes created a sword as the OMAC attacked him with an electrical lasso, hitting Reyes, who shielded himself with his pincers as the OMAC attacked him with a saw, with Khaji-Da launching a bolt of energy to push Carapax away, allowing Reyes to get up, who immediately generated a buster sword, which hit the ground to launch the OMAC away.[2]\n\nKhaji-Da issued multiple tactical alerts cautioning against reckless engagement; however, Reyes advanced with energized plasma blade constructs, engaging Carapax with emotionally driven aggression. Despite scoring successful strikes, Host Reyes was ultimately impaled by the OMAC's armor-integrated blade, resulting in a catastrophic overload of the Scarab’s regenerative subroutines. Khaji-Da, operating at reduced capacity, deployed pincer countermeasures but was forcibly repelled. The system entered critical instability as Carapax launched Reyes into the air and impacted him with force sufficient to disable both Scarab shielding and internal stabilization protocols.\n\nAt this point, Khaji-Da was unable to provide full protection, and Reyes was rendered vulnerable to further strikes. Carapax prepared to execute Host Reyes. However, the approach was interrupted by the intervention of Rudy Reyes, whose presence distracted OMAC. Reyes’ subsequent scream of anguish upon witnessing a guided missile launch, which he presumed had resulted in Rudy’s death, caused a surge in neural-emotional intensity, activating an emergency energy discharge override within the Scarab’s arsenal. Reyes launched a high-velocity retaliatory assault, leveraging aerial propulsion to overpower Carapax. Upon pinning him to the ground, Reyes removed the adversary’s helmet and prepared a final, fatal strike. Khaji-Da, recognizing the host’s escalating psychological distress, forcibly restricted the execution command.\n\nEngaging with the host, Khaji-Da asserted the non-lethal directive: “We are not killers.” In support of this ethical protocol, Khaji-Da revealed a cache of unlocked neuro-memory fragments assimilated during the preceding combat entanglement, including traumatic sequences from Carapax’s origin: Enslavement and cybernetic enhancement under Victoria Kord’s experimental directives, amputation sustained during active military engagement via a landmine, and childhood trauma, including the loss of his mother in an airstrike executed during wartime, identified as having Kord operational involvement.\n\nHost Reyes, upon full internalization of these recovered memories, recontextualized Carapax’s aggression as a construct of manipulation and systemic abuse. He deactivated his plasma constructs and chose to spare Carapax, initiating a reconciliation, affirming that it was not power, but love for his family, that defined his strength. Subsequently, Reyes observed Jenny Kord successfully destroying the databanks required to replicate the OMAC project. Despite receiving direct kill orders from Victoria Kord, Carapax stood down, turning against Victoria and initiating a self-destruct overload of his armor core, sacrificing himself to terminate her.\n\nAs the explosion triggered structural collapse, Khaji-Da coordinated with Reyes to execute a final high-jump maneuver toward the Bug Ship, piloted by Rudy Reyes, confirmed to have survived. Reyes was successfully retrieved mid-air by Jenny Kord and brought aboard.[2]\n\nThe Reyes family returned to the ashes of their home to mourn the death of Alberto Reyes, until they received a visit from Jenny Kord, who informed them that Kord Industries was in charge of the repairs. As Jenny had to leave, Jaime offered to drive her, sharing a kiss, which made Khaji-Da feel a surge of blood rush to Jaime's mid-region, but Reyes avoided that comment when Jenny asked. Khaji-Da then activated the suit, with which Jaime held her and flew her to the estate.[2]\n\nInitially Khaji-Da behaves like a normal Artificial Intelligence, largely ignoring Jaime's repeated pleads for it to stop in favor of installing and checking its own systems. Khaji-Da mostly was only concerned with keeping Jaime alive for the sake of self-preservation, initially it wrestled control of the Blue Beetle armor away from Jaime and repeatedly insisted in using lethal methods to eliminate threats to which Jaime would constantly have to argue against.\n\nOver time as Khaji-Da and Jaime's relation becomes more symbiotic the two begin to understand each other. Khaji-Da learns to understand Jaime's desire to only use the Blue Beetle to protect his loved ones, while Jaime learned to trust and cooperate with Khaji-Da in combat. When Jaime viciously attacked OMAC with full intent to kill him, mainly as revenge for his family, Khaji-Da warned him he was losing control and then recommended him to disengage, soon becoming the one who intervened and reminded Jaime that he is not a killer, and then shares Ignacio's memories with Jaime so as to make him understand that Ignacio was just as much of a victim of Victoria Kord as he was that leads to Jaime sparing his life.\n\nKhaji-Da has a somewhat dry sense of humor, it frequently replies to Jaime's moments of panics with snarky remarks and likes to show off its capabilities. It also took to speaking in Spanish occasionally and picked up on Mexican-jargon from its time with the Reyes family.",
