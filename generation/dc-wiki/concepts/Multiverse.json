  "content": "The Multiverse is the term for a series of infinite parallel realities existing separately, yet alongside one another on a continuous stream. It is the aggregate of all universes, timelines, and dimensions in existence. Together, these universes are presumed to comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, and the physical laws and constraints that govern them. The different universes within the multiverse are often referred to as \"parallel universes\", other universes\", alternate universes\", among other definitions.\n\nThe Multiverse is believed to be explained by the eternal inflation system, however, the exact nature of its existence is largely unknown to most of its inhabitants. There are numerous alternate dimensions and universes in this shared multiverse, each with their own notable differences.\n\nThe Multiverse is always in a constant state of fluctuation and every decision a person makes could potentially result in the creation of several new alternate or parallel timelines, some more similar than others. While normally separate from one another, there are ways to open portals and travel to each one of them.\n\nIn 4358 B.C., Enchantress and her brother Incubus appeared before the people of South America, in or near Peru. They used their otherworldly powers to rule over an expanse of humanity before their subjects eventually rebelled, somehow locking the beings away in the Tres Osos Caves. The pair were believed to have traveled between dimensions to arrive on the prime Earth from whatever universe they originally hailed.[1]\n\nWhen Darkseid discovered the Anti-Life Equation, he orchestrated an invasion of Earth, but he was defeated and forced to retreat by a combined army of humans, Amazons, and Atlanteans, along with the involvement of Ares, Zeus, Artemis, and Yalan Gur, a member of the Green Lantern Corps.[2]\n\nAfter a failed coup, General Zod and the Sword of Rao were sentenced by the Council of Five to 300 cycles of Somatic Reconditioning inside the Phantom Zone. However, the Destruction of Krypton released a shock wave so great that it opened the Phantom Zone, allowing the group to be freed.[3]\n\nIn November of 2015, the Flash appeared before Bruce Wayne in the Batcave in a desperate attempt to change the future. This version of the Flash came from an apocalyptic future he hoped to avoid the second time around, and in so doing, he split the timeline. This timeline was ultimately averted, due to the Flash altering reality, causing the Flashpoint event.[4]\n\nOne day, foster child Billy Batson were running away from bullies and boarded a subway train. Instead of going to the next station however, the train transported him to the Rock of Eternity, another plane of reality, by the wizard Shazam.\n\nThere, the wizard informed Billy that he is his last and only chance to find someone noble and good enough to replace him as champion. Billy reluctantly accepted the offer, and by saying the wizard's name, he received his powers and became the Champion Shazam. After this, he was then transferred back to his reality.[5]\n\nAt some point, Barry Allen wound up in the Speed Force, accidentally coming across another version of himself from Earth-1 in the process. Barry mistook Earth-1 Barry for a cosplaying fan at first, even asking him for a selfie, but soon realized he'd traveled between worlds and that the other Flash was an alternate version of himself. Earth-1 Barry thought their meeting could no longer be possible, but before he could explain the situation any further, Barry faded out while expressing his excitement, claiming that he told Victor Stone that a such a thing like the multiverse was possible.[6]\n\nEarth-1 Barry mentioned his superhero name, the Flash, while introducing himself, which seemed to inspire Barry to consider the name for himself, a name that A.R.G.U.S. had previously referred to him as in their files.[7]\n\nIn a universe where Wonderous Serena operates as superhero, the supervillain known as Doctor Cyber reprogrammed the retrobots to became corrupted, arresting anyone who was deemed to have committed a crime. Eventually they managed to create a portal capable of traveling between alternate realities, traveling to the prime universe where Serena Williams was playing a tennis match. The retrobots then interrupted the game, arresting Darius along with creating fear among the spectators. Serena Williams managed to defend herself by using her racket and helping the spectators who needed help, during the battle, Williams met Wonderous Serena upon seeing the portal, and they accidentally touch it, causing Serena Williams to travel to her reality.[8]\n\nWithin the reality of the retrobots, they kidnapped the parents of a girl named Mikayla Johnson, causing that she started running scared until she met the Serena Williams. Williams helped her to find her parents while they confronted some retrobots, however Serena decided to left Johnson at an orphanage with Kym while she continues the search.\n\nWilliams set out to find the Diana Prince of that reality after assuming she was a tennis player. Upon arriving the stadium where Diana Prince was, she was being attacked by some retrobots, so Serena helped her destroying a bot. When they met face to face, they introduced themselves when Serena asked about Wonder Woman. In that moment, some spectators began to be attacked, so Prince and Williams prepared to defend them.\n\nMeanwhile on the Earth-1, Wonderous Serena would land in the stadium where Serena Williams was, watching how Wonder Woman arrived trying to stop the retrobots. Wonderous Serena then decided to help Wonder Woman to defeat them, explaining her the intentions of the retrobots, so they would dedicate themselves to trying to destroy them in order to cross the portal that would take them back to the universe of Wonderous Serena.[9]\n\nThen they were cornered when a long amount of retrobots started to arrive from the portal, so they would decide to infiltrate the S.T.A.R. Laboratory in search of plans that would help them build a multiversal portal to travel to the Wonderous' universe, trying to prevent the retrobots that supervised the place from seeing them. Diana and Serena would manage to enter finding some information, however a retrobot would approach so Wonder Woman would stop it, this defeated retrobot would launch a shot that Wonderous Serena dodged, but causing it to fall near them exploding.[10]\n\nThe explosion of the retrobot shot caused the heroines to be teleported back to the Wonderous Serena's universe, where they met Serena Williams and Diana Prince who were confused at seeing each other but eventually explained that they were alternate versions joining forces to stop the multiversal war. Infiltrating S.T.A.R. Labs of Wonderous' universe, the heroines found Doctor Cyber, discovering that she was responsible for the retrobot invasion.\n\nCyber proceeded to attack the team in an attempt to stop them, however Cyber was distracted while explaining her crime prevention plans, being used by Williams and Prince to persuade her, and finally giving Wonder Woman the opportunity to stop her with her Lasso of Truth. Under the power of the Lasso, Cyber was forced to reveal the location of the prisoners, as well as the reprogramming of the Retrobots to help the Wonderous' universe again, marking the end of the war. Shortly after, the heroines took it upon themselves to return the prisoners to their families in their respective universes.[11]\n\nAfter dying, James Craddock was pulled to the Underworld to make a deal with some hawk-like creatures who wanted him to kill Hawkman in exchange for his return to life, but Hawkman later grabbed a piece of eternium and stuck it in Craddock's chest, returning him to the underworld.[12]\n\nUpon obtaining the Crown of Sabbac, Ishmael Gregor purposely allowed Teth-Adam to kill him so he can enter the Underworld. Once there, he encountered a group of demons who had helped forge the crown. The demons then chose Gregor as their champion to unleash hell on Earth. Gregor agreed and uttered the word \"Sabbac\" and was empowered by the demons. He was then sent back to Earth where he unleashed an undead army. Gregor was later defeated and killed by Teth-Adam.\n\nWhile being pulled from one point of the Multiverse to the next, Beast Boy saw glimpses of other universes, seeing Flash running through the city and Shazam speeding through the skies of Philadelphia.[13]\n\nAfter discovering the Chronobowl, Barry Allen traveled to the past to save his mother from her death but in doing so, created a new timeline. After being pushed out of the Chronobowl by a mysterious speedster, Barry teamed up with a younger version of himself, an older and different Batman, and Supergirl to stop Zod and the Sword of Rao.[14]\n\nBatman and Supergirl would die in battle which would cause the two Barrys to go back in time again and again to prevent their deaths. There came a point where the older Barry would realize that they could not prevent the death of his companions but his younger self would continue trying to save them, causing several universes to begin to approach his own. Eventually, the mysterious speedster who was a future version of the younger Barry and that initially attacked Barry, would return. With the 3 Barrys together, they would watch as several universes began to collide.\n\nBarry would beg Dark Flash to stop trying to save his teammates but he told him that he would not stop until he managed to fix the battle. Eventually, Dark Flash would try to kill Barry as the latter went back in time and left Nora die, but his younger self sacrificed himself, dying and eliminating Dark Flash from existence. All the universes that had collided began to fix themselves and separate so Barry which no other option, would erase the Flashpoint Timeline.[14]",
