  "content": "The Speed Force is the name given to an extra-dimensional plane of existence. Many Flashes across the Multiverse possess a connection to this plane, granting them access to their metahuman speedster powers.\n\nWhile working at the Central City Research Center as a student, one night, Barry Allen was conducting research, leaving the windows open, being close to some chemicals, until he was struck by lightning nearby a shelf of chemicals, which splashed and electrocuted him, which granted him the ability to access the Speed Force, allowing him to move, think, act and vibrate his body at inhuman speeds. With his newfound abilities, Barry decided to become a vigilante in Central City, the Flash.[1]\n\nDuring the battle, the Justice League were defeated as the Unity was successfully triggered, causing all of Earth to be destroyed. However, Flash managed to use the Speed Force and vibrate his molecules to phase and avoid the destruction, and, using all the power he can muster, ran so fast until he reversed time, successfully undoing the Unity and saving everyone on Earth.[2]\n\nAt some point after the Justice League defeated Steppenwolf, Barry Allen somehow found himself inside the Speed Force, in which he came face to face with another Barry Allen with a similar set of abilities. The two conversed for a short amount of time before Barry vanished, but not before the two managed to exchange information including their similar origins and circumstances.[3]\n\nThose with access to the Speed Force are genetically altered, acting as conduits for its energy, granting them a lean, slender build in order to adapt to their newfound speedster abilities.\n\nAccess to the Speed Force grants speedster's tremendous hypersonic speed (though from their perspective, things appear to be moving in super slow motion), the intensity of which allows them to deliver superhumanly strong blows (via the incredible momentum generated at superspeed), as well as the ability to run up and along vertical surfaces, across the surface of water, through solid matter, into other planes of frequency, and even though time.\n\nOne minor drawback born of a speedster's connection to the Speed Force, is an accelerated metabolic rate, thus requiring a speedster to consume high amounts of calories in order to function normally whenever the speed is used, as well as allowing them to heal and regenerate from any bone or flesh injuries without lingering side-effects within a short time span, even if those injuries are highly crippling/fatal. Barry described himself to Bruce as a \"Snack-Hole\" while describing his abilities.\n\nAlso, a speedster possesses agility, dexterity, balance, and bodily coordination on superhuman levels, allowing them to easily maneuver while running. Their stamina is likewise increased to withstand the stress of moving at superspeed for extended periods of time without growing tired or weak.\n\nFinally, when moving at incredible speeds, a speedster generates bolts of lightning, which can cause electronic technology nearby to short-circuit, overload or even burst into sparks. According to Amanda Waller's files, the Flash can also charge the air vortexes that he generates with Speed Force electricity, thereby further increasing his offensive and defensive capabilities.",
