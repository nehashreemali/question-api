  "content": "Metropolis is a large city in the eastern United States and is part of the District of Metropolis in Delaware. The city is famous for its forward-looking, optimistic spirit, captured in its nickname \"City of Tomorrow\". It is home to the headquarters of both the Daily Planet newspaper and global corporation LexCorp Industries. It is also home to the Kryptonian superhero known as Superman.\n\nSituated on the coast of Delaware, Metropolis is just across the bay from Gotham City, New Jersey; its sister city. Metropolis is often synonymous with the central island of New Troy, but the entire city also encompasses the boroughs of Queensland Park, Park Ridge, and Bakerline.\n\nInitially growing from the colonial outpost of Fort Hob, Metropolis was founded in 1661 by European settlers during the colonization of North America. It grew steadily to become one of the largest cities in the world, a famous tech hub and media centre.[1]\n\nIn 2013, much of Metropolis' central business district was destroyed by General Dru-Zod and the Sword of Rao in their attempt to convert Earth's atmosphere to that of Krypton's. Whole buildings were obliterated and rubble covered the area, where it was sucked up when the ship spaghettified into its black hole. However, Zod and his followers were defeated, albeit with multiple civilian and military casualties. After the crisis ended, Metropolis recovered in time and was safeguarded by their new local savior, Superman,[2] with a large statue of Superman built in the city center in a new purpose built venue called Heroes Park.[3]\n\nSince the Black Zero Event, the city was protected by Superman along with the rest of the world until his tragic death in 2015, when sacrificing himself to stop a mighty monster known as Doomsday.[4]\n\nIn 2017, when Superman was resurrected, thanks to the help of Flash, Cyborg, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Batman, he resumed his role as local superhero of Metropolis.[5]\n\nSome years later, an earthquake devastated the city. As a result, Superman intervened to help save the city's residents. The earthquake's aftereffects reminded him of what had happened during the Black Zero Event.[6]\n\nIn 2013, like in the original timeline, when Dru-Zod and the Sword of Rao set out to terraform Earth into a new Krypton, they unleashed the Black Zero on Metropolis, which began to send gravity pulses through Earth, destroying buildings, cars, and killing civilians. However, the terraformation could not be stopped unlike in the original timeline, but was also unsuccessful as the Flash erased the timeline.[7]\n\nNew Troy is the central island of Metropolis and its largest borough. It is bordered on one side by the West River and on the other side by Hob's River.\n\nPark Ridge is one of the wealthiest and most historic parts of Metropolis.[8]\n\nBakerline was historically home to Metropolis' white-collar middle-class, but has since brought in a young techie crowd employed by LexCorp and smaller competitors in the tech industry.[8]",
