  "content": "Smallville is a relatively small farming town in the U.S state of Kansas.\n\nIn 1831, Smallville was founded by an American settler named Ezra Small during the westward expansion of the United States.[1]\n\nOver a century later, a spacecraft crashed in Smallville. The ship was found by local farmer Jonathan Kent and his wife Martha. They discovered a baby in the ship and raised him as their own, naming him Clark Kent. Clark grew up in the town and his powers first manifested there. Eventually his parents revealed his alien origins after Clark used his powers to save his classmates on a flooding bus after it drove off a bridge.[2]\n\nDecades later, in 2013, General Dru-Zod and his Kryptonian forces entered Smallville in search of the growth codex. They confronted Martha Kent at her home before her son Clark Kent arrived to stop them, now wearing a blue alien suit with a cape. No longer worried about hiding his powers, Clark fought Zod, and later Faora-Ul and Nam-Ek throughout the town's center, destroying portions of it as a result. With the aid of the US military, Clark defeated the Kryptonians who temporarily retreated back into space.[2]\n\nAfter he sacrificed himself to kill the mutated Kryptonian creature Doomsday, a funeral was held for Clark Kent on the Kent Farm in Smallville. At the funeral, Martha gave Lois an envelope with an engagement ring which was to be given to her during Clark's proposal. Heartbroken, she wears the engagement ring as she drops a pile of dirt on Clark's casket.[3]\n\nAbout two years later, Flash and Cyborg were sent to retrieve Clark's body from Smallville and bring him to the Kryptonian scout ship in Metropolis. After Clark is brought back to life, he and Lois return to the Kent farm, where Clark fully regains his memories and reunites with his mom. Lois then warns him about Steppenwolf, and regretfully sends him away. After Steppenwolf is defeated, Lois, Clark and Bruce Wayne assist Martha in moving back into the farm.[4]",
