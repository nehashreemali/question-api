  "content": "Dru-Zod was a Kryptonian war criminal and the former leader of the Warrior Guild who later founded the Sword of Rao, leading them during the Kryptonian Civil War.\n\nManaging to survive the destruction of his native planet of Krypton and escaping from his Phantom Zone imprisonment, he viewed the purpose of his life to be the successful re-establishment of Krypton on another planet; Earth. Zod was the first great enemy of the hero Superman, who ultimately defeated and killed him in combat after a prolonged, devastating duel in the heart of Metropolis. During the Black Zero Event, Zod notably killed many employees of Wayne Enterprises.\n\nAfter his death, Zod's corpse was the key to the committee studying Superman, learning about the Kryptonite xenomineral being the greatest weakness of Kryptonians. The general's corpse was later acquired by the malevolent supergenius Lex Luthor, who used the corpse and his blood, to carry out an ancient and long-forbidden Kryptonian process, thereby creating the mighty and ferocious hybrid Kryptonian monstrosity, Doomsday.\n\nDru-Zod was born on the distant planet Krypton, in the huge capital megacity of Kandor, with him being genetically engineered in a Genesis Chamber as a commanding leader and fierce warrior. He was one in a long line of warriors all who served in the Kryptonian Warrior Guild, rising to the rank of general (leader of the entire guild).\n\nZod was placed in charge of the Warrior Guild on Krypton and was fiercely devoted to his duty and his people. During his tenure, he was known to have kept the city of Kandor safe from any threats. Zod also had a strong mutual respect for Jor-El, Krypton's leading scientist. The pair were friends in their youth, with them sharing a common goal of revitalizing Krypton, of turning their complacent, aging society from its self-destructive path, and igniting a new era of innovation and exploration. But in time, they had arrived at radically different visions of the future. Jor-El put his faith in science and reason, while Zod had embraced force—as well as dubious theories of eugenics.[2]\n\nBelieving the Council of Five too weak in the running of their race, Zod decided he needed to take charge to make sure Krypton survived and founded the Sword of Rao movement to sever the \"degenerative bloodlines\" and start anew on a new planet. He and a few men arrived at the legislation chamber where Jor-El was in session with them. Zod swiftly killed High Eminence Ro-Zar. He informed his former good friend Jor-El of his plans, but the latter rejected Zod, telling him it was madness. Saddened by the newfound rift with his former friend, Zod had his men take Jor-El away, whilst Zod informed the council of his plans before having his second-in-command, Faora-Ul, take them into custody.\n\nWhen told that Jor-El had escaped and also stolen the growth codex, Zod and a few men traveled to the House of El citadel, where Zod confronted Jor-El face to face as Lara Lor-Van launched Kal-El off the planet. Believing Jor-El had turned his back on him, Zod battled Jor-El, and after a hard fight, stabbed his friend with the huge blade from his armor. Saddened at what he had to do to his friend, he and his followers were arrested by loyalist forces.\n\nCaptured, Zod and his followers were put on trial before the Council of Five, with several bureaucrats and Lara Lor-Van present. High Eminence Lor-Em sentenced them to three-hundred years of somatic reconditioning inside the fearsome Phantom Zone. Zod approached Lara and declared that sending their illegal son away was not enough; that he was not safe and Zod would find him. The ship Black Zero descended on Kandor and Zod and his cohorts boarded and went through the Phantom Zone projector for their sentence.\n\nKrypton's core gave way as Jor-El had predicted, and the ripple effect of its destruction broke the boundaries of the Phantom Zone, allowing the Black Zero to escape. Seeing that their planet had been destroyed, Zod declared the Black Zero his new flagship and began searching the universe for surviving Kryptonian colonies, finding dead colonies and a world engine, which they took with them. Soon they picked up a Kryptonian beacon and followed it to the planet Earth in search of Kal-El and a new home.[3]\n\nThe Black Zero entered Earth's outer atmosphere, where General Zod used his flagship to transmit a message to the planet Earth's primitive computers, such that every device on the planet would transmit his message. He requested that they give him Kal-El, promising that otherwise, Earth would suffer consequences of apocalyptic proportions.\n\nAfter receiving a message that Kal-El was to be handed over, Zod promptly sent his second-in-command, Faora-Ul, in a dropship to pick up Kal-El and also the human Lois Lane. They were brought aboard where the Black Zero's atmosphere disrupted Kal's abilities, nullifying them. Zod had him strapped down and Jax-Ur took a sample of his blood before subjecting Kal-El and Lois to mind-probing, where Zod projected images into Kal-El's head of a fallen human race. Lois Lane, however, had brought aboard Jor-El's AI, who helped her escape and avoid capture into an escape pod that jettisoned to Earth. Whilst Zod's forces tried to recapture Lois, Kal-El used his returned strength to escape his bonds and followed Lois after receiving the encouragement of Jor-El.\n\nZod and his men boarded dropships and tracked Kal's ship to the Kent farm in Smallville, where they went to obtain the codex. They landed and were greeted by Martha Kent, who denied any knowledge of an alien named Kal-El to protect Clark. Faora found the ship in the barn, but discovered that the codex was not there. They then threatened Martha to give up its location, which she did not know. With Zod prepared to strike her, Kal-El appeared and furiously tackled Zod away, landing in downtown Smallville. Zod was still getting used to his powers under the yellow sun and with his visor damaged, his senses began to subdue him. Faora and one of Zod's soldiers arrived and began engaging Kal-El in battle before he subdued them with his experience and more solar power. Realizing that they were outmatched for the time being, Zod and his followers retreated to the Black Zero. There, they learned that the codex was not in Kal's ship as they believed, but inside his body, in his cells, which could be extracted from him, alive or dead.[3]\n\nAfter recovering aboard the Black Zero, Zod ordered the release of the world engine, which was dropped off in the south Indian Ocean before the Black Zero was taken to Metropolis. Zod ordered for them to be activated whilst he traveled to the Arctic, where he found Scout Ship 0344, and after seeing Jor-El's AI, turned it off before flying the ship to Metropolis. Kal-El, who had become known as \"Superman\", arrived after destroying the world engine, and crashed into the ship, bringing it crashing down through several buildings into the ground. Colonel Hardy then flew a USAF C-17 cargo plane containing Superman's ship along with Faora into the Black Zero, creating a singularity that sucked in the Black Zero (with Tor-An, Nam-Ek, Jax-Ur, Car-Vex, Nadira, and Gor), along with the human military plane (with Colonel Hardy, Dr. Hamilton, and Faora).[3]\n\nHaving lost all his troops in an instant as well as his sole purpose of life, an enraged General Zod engaged Superman, vowing to get revenge by killing the entire human race. After the two mighty aliens first clashed, Zod sent Superman flying right through a skyscraper, into the Wayne Financial building. There, Zod's heat vision suddenly activated, and he violently slashed the building, causing it to collapse upon them both. Superman promptly flew out, with Zod following suit, but the fallen building killed dozens of employees (including Jack O'Dwyer), much to the horror of Bruce Wayne, who witnessed it from afar. Also, Wallace Keefe would be permanently crippled, while a little girl would be orphaned following the building's collapse.[4]\n\nZod and Superman continued their ferocious battle all across Metropolis, throwing tremendously mighty punches after punch at each other, destroying more skyscrapers, before Zod tore off his armor and finally gained his ability to fly. The fight then took to the sky and temporarily in outer space, before the two came crashing back down into Metropolis Central Station, where Zod attempted to unleash his heat vision upon innocent civilians. Superman grappled Zod and tried to prevent his heat vision from reaching the civilians, but he was inevitably forced to snap Zod's neck, killing him, much to his own dismay.[3]\n\nWhen Lex Luthor entered his private rooms in his LexCorp facility, it was shown to have multiple CCTV screens, with one of them displaying the corpse of General Zod in a bodybag.[5]\n\nEighteen months after the Black Zero Event, the United States government studied the corpse of Zod in Superman's fortress in Heroes Park. While Senator June Finch rejected Lex Luthor's request to study and analyze Zod's body and the Kryptonian vessel, Senator Barrows covertly granted Lex access in a mutual relationship. During his studies, Lex discovered that exposure to Kryptonite decayed Kryptonian cells and significantly weakened Zod to mortal standards. Later, Lex cut off the fingerprints of Zod's hand with a scalpel to access the inner sanctum of the scout ship.\n\nBefore Lex initiated his scheme to propel Superman into fighting Batman, he brought Zod's corpse to the Genesis Chamber of Scout Ship 0344. Kelor warned Lex of the ban of genetic modification by the Kryptonian Law Council, but Lex ignored this and the Genesis Chamber began to genetically modify the body of Zod, combined with Lex's blood, to re-create Doomsday. Once Doomsday was turned loose, he began to ravage and attack the surrounding cities, growing only stronger from the attacks he sustained, similar to how Zod had begun to get stronger and have more access to his Kryptonian powers during his tragic duel with Kal-El. In a final faceoff, Kal was forced to strike the killing blow against Doomsday, similar to his traumatic decision to end Zod's life. Unlike in the previous battle, however, this decision proved to be fatal and with one final blow, the monster was able to finish what Zod had been unable to do: killing Jor-El's son.[4]\n\nGenetically engineered as a warrior and leader, Zod is fiercely loyal to his race and its fascist ideals. He was a highly skilled and charismatic military leader that was not afraid to act on instinct, such as when he decided to overthrow the Kryptonian Law Council.\n\nIt is implied that Zod was once a noble and more benevolent man, as he had a long-term friendship with Jor-El, and the latter claimed that he would honor the man that Zod had once been. Also, the younger Zod was somewhat innovative and idealistic, with him and Jor sharing a common goal of revitalizing Krypton, of turning their complacent, aging society from its self-destructive path, and igniting a new era of innovation and exploration.[2] However, Zod would in time develop into a far more malevolent and brutal individual (to the point that he founded the radical Sword of Rao to overthrow the government and murdered his former friend, albeit the latter with lingering remorse), an individual to whom Jor-El referred to as a \"monster.\" However, Jor-El would also later state that Superman is \"twice the man\" Zod was, even when the latter had been noble.\n\nWhile Zod did still have feelings of genuine compassion for his fellow Kryptonians (shown when he comforted Faora after Krypton's destruction, hence making him a less evil militaristic supervillain than General Ludendorff or Ares), he viewed less powerful and advanced races, such as humans, as inferior in every regard (somewhat akin to Ares' ideology), and had no qualms about mercilessly killing them \"for the greater good\" of rebuilding Krypton and his native Kryptonian race upon their planet, even begging Kal-El with a horrified look on his face about losing Krypton's only chance when he destroyed the scout ship carrying the Genesis Chamber. However, Zod even treated some of his fellow Kryptonians with disdain (most notably those with \"degenerative bloodlines\" of the Kryptonian Law Council, as well as the \"heresy\" that was the naturally born Kal-El), considering only those who shared his ideas and goals to be his true equals. He also seemed to value his friends and allies, since Zod was dismayed when Jor-El ended their long friendship, and was guilt-ridden about murdering his former friend (to the point that doing so would later haunt Zod for many years). While often calm and collected, Zod was capable of fearsome fits of rage, notably against High Eminence Lor-Em, Jor-El, and Superman.\n\nDespite his occasionally angry tone and demeanor, however, General Zod was exceptionally intelligent, with Superman, upon meeting him, concluding from Zod's facial expression that the latter was \"equally intelligent\" to Jor-El, Krypton's foremost scientist.[2] Zod's intellect mainly extends to his leadership, intimidation, tactical, and other military skills, though the thinking boundaries programmed into General Zod's engineered DNA occasionally make him imperfect in utilizing these skills. While Zod wasn't quite as debilitated by these boundaries as High Eminence Lor-Em or Ro-Zar (since unlike them, Zod was able to see how ineffective the dogmatic Kryptonian Law Council was), he, like them, also had a poor grasp at free will, was often prone to dogmatic tunnel vision, and was utterly unable to live out any lifestyle other than the one that he was born for. Hence, while this did allow Zod to both effectively lead the Sword of Rao and to come up with a strategy to restore Krypton, it also made him unable to diplomatically coexist with humanity (like Superman could), to account for Superman caring about them, or to account for Superman's innovative combat strategy (of effectively using all of the powers that Zod had not yet gained, as well as Zod's weaknesses, against him, in their first fight). Indeed, this is what allowed the free-willed Superman to defeat Zod in their first fight (despite being a far less skilled combatant), and to undermine Zod's apocalyptic World Engine strategy.\n\nGeneral Zod was also an incredibly bold and determined individual, as even when his Kryptonian Civil War coup failed, leaving him helpless and at the mercy of High Eminence Lor-Em, Zod refused to be intimidated and went so far as to mock the former and spit at the High Eminence's feet in defiance, and only silently gritted his teeth while being painfully frozen into a cryocapsule (while almost all of his other loyalists bellowed and cringed). Upon his unexpected release from the Phantom Zone, Zod, unlike Faora, refused to fall into despair, and tirelessly led his followers on a 33-year-long search for a planet suitable for terraforming, never seeming to lose hope, and still inducing fierce and unwavering loyalty from his Sword of Rao followers. Hence, due to his great willpower and determination, General Zod, unlike Superman, never experienced the weakness of mental power suppression and was at his full strength and potential upon absorbing a yellow sun's radiation. It was also through his sheer willpower that Zod eventually overcame his temporary weakness of overloaded senses within Earth's atmosphere, and swiftly mastered the power of flight.\n\nEven Lex Luthor seemed to somewhat admire General Zod, with him sadly remarking that the latter had \"[flown] too close to the sun\" while observing Zod's corpse. This is most likely since General Zod, due to his godlike power being used for malevolent purposes, perfectly represented Lex's worldview.\n\nAfter his plans were thwarted and his loyalists re-imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, Zod, having failed at what he had considered being the sole purpose of his life, became more brutal and furious than ever in his devastation, and megalomaniacally threatened to personally wipe out the entire human race of Earth in revenge as a continuation of the conquest of Earth as a new Krypton, but this time with their own hands and not caring about being left as the last Kryptonian in the universe. Since Zod had nothing left to lose, he engaged Superman in a ferocious final duel, refusing to stop unleashing his fury upon humanity, thus inevitably forcing a very reluctant Superman to kill him.\n\nKryptonian physiology: As a Kryptonian, General Zod's bone structure is almost identical to that of a human. On a planet near a red class M main-sequence star (like Krypton with its sun Rao), Zod would have physical attributes nearly identical to those of humans, but if on a planet near a yellow G-type main-sequence star (like Earth), he has many new abilities and powers, all of them far beyond the capabilities of humans and even metahumans, making him appear godlike (indeed almost matching an Old God in power). While Zod's body initially had problems adapting to the new planet's atmosphere, he was able to do so shortly before his final battle with fellow Kryptonian Superman. Due to Zod's ruthlessness and complete lack of restraint, he never withheld his tremendous power, which initially allowed him to dominate Superman (despite the latter's superior solar energy supply), with Zod claiming that he would single-handedly wipe out the entire human race. Indeed, it was mainly due to having General Zod's corpse as the genetic template that Doomsday had such unparalleled power.\n\nAs the General of the Warrior Guild, Zod originally had access to all of the weaponry the guild is equipped with, though he lost that privilege after losing the Kryptonian Civil War and getting imprisoned in the Phantom Zone. After escaping the Zone with the Black Zero, however, General Zod once against gradually became well-equipped, salvaging all the weapons he could find from the old colonial outposts of Krypton (such as Daxam), most notably, a fearsome World Engine.",
