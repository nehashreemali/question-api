  "content": "Teth-Adam is a former champion of the Council of Wizards. After his son Hurut was made the Council's champion to liberate Kahndaq, he gave his wounded father the powers of the Egyptian Gods that were bestowed on him. However, Hurut was subsequently killed by assassins of King Ahk-Ton, so Adam slaughtered his court and nearly destroyed Kahndaq itself. This led to him facing down with the Council of Wizards, nearly all of whom he killed, bar Shazam, who imprisoned him.\n\nFive thousand years later, Teth-Adam was freed by Adrianna Tomaz to once again help liberate Kahndaq, fighting Intergang forces while trying to adjust to a new age thanks to Amon Tomaz. However, due to his brutal murders, Adam became the focus of the Justice Society, who headed to Kahndaq to stop him. Adam briefly confronted them until they managed to call a truce, having to save Amon from Ishmael Gregor. During the course of the rescue, Adam had disagreements with Hawkman over how criminals should be treated. Once Amon was saved, Adam voluntarily turned himself in, feeling unworthy of Hurut's powers, and being imprisoned in the Task Force X Black Site, until being telepathically released by Kent Nelson, to help the Society kill Gregor, becoming the new hero of Kahndaq and referring to himself as Black Adam, to better suit modern times. Adam was soon threatened by Amanda Waller not to leave his nation, sending Superman to dialogue with him.\n\nTeth-Adam was born in the African nation of Kahndaq before 2600 B.C., growing up in a slave family that was constantly tortured by the nation's leaders who sent him to the mines. Due to the injustices that tormented him, Adam developed a hatred against his leaders, but he was always full of courage and bravery to attend to situations that required it. Eventually, Adam married a woman named Shiruta, who would give birth to a son, Hurut. From an early age, Adam taught his son that the world they lived in was a dangerous one, despite Hurut's wishes to improve it.[2][3]\n\nTeth-Adam headed to claim some apples in the village one day, until he was interrupted by an excited Hurut, who came running to find a trinket to give to his mother Shiruta, while Adam reminded him to return to the mines for his own safety.\n\nTeth-Adam then approached the seller to claim more than one apple, to which he initially refused, arguing that it was only one apple per worker. Adam then raised his eyebrow in astonishment, causing the seller to give him one more apple for his double work in the mines. Teth-Adam took the apple and thanked the seller before leaving with his son, and as they walked, he asked Hurut to throw away the trinket before someone noticed him.\n\nAdam noticed that his son heard how some gladiators were beating civilians, which made Hurut worried and try to do something about it; however, his father stopped him by taking him by the hand. Adam proceeded to kneel and tell him that there was nothing they could do about the dangerous world, but they should hope that one day it would improve, just not that day. Teth-Adam and Hurut then turned away from the gladiators.[3]\n\nOne morning, Adam learned that all the soldiers' whips had been destroyed, so he quickly approached Hurut and woke him up, Once he woke up, he warned him of what had happened, with a confused but relieved Hurut responding that the soldiers couldn't hurt anyone. This reply raised Adam's suspicion, causing him to call his son out.\n\nHurut then confessed to being the one who destroyed the whips, repling that he was just trying to do his own justice. Teth-Adam then told him that breaking those whips would cause the soldiers to seek more inhumane ways to mistreat all the slaves. Teth also told Hurut that the work he did was not going to be paid with food.\n\nTeth-Adam mentioned that those in power do not need weapons to exercise their interests, leading to Hurut hugged him and asking him for his forgiveness. Teth-Adam returned the hug and while he was proud of his son's sense of justice, he stated freedom was a dream and that they were not heroes.[5]\n\nSome time later, Adam and his family walked through the village to get bread, shortly afterwards, Adam and Shiruta hugged each other as their son Hurut handed his slice of bread to two hungry slaves, feeling proud of him. Shiruta then asked Teth if he had asked him to do that, to which Adam mentioned that he hadn't, and that it seemed his son's heart knew fairness as well as justice, rejoicing that perhaps there was still hope for Kahndaq.[6]\n\nWhile working in the mines, Hurut witnessed a brutal Kahndaq slaver kill a man who gave them a piece of eternium, so Adam ran to save his son from receiving the same disgrace. When the slaver threatened him with his sword, Adam replied that his son accepted the king’s mercy. Adam warned Hurut that he would not always be there to protect him.\n\nHurut responded that he did not want protection, but to be free, stating that if they fought together they could defeat the king. Adam, however, told him that the graveyards were full of fighters and asked him to stop trying to be a hero. When Adam retired to work in the mines again, Hurut grabbed the eternium and stood in front of the people, insisting that they could take on Ahk-Ton.[1]\n\nAfter the act of rebellion, Ahk-Ton ordered Hurut's execution, for which he was soon kidnapped and brought before a public execution outside his palace, while a crowd gathered to rebel against their leaders by starting a protest. In an act of desperation to save his son, Teth-Adam ran through the crowd, reaching the area where the gladiators were repressing access.\n\nTeth-Adam began to climb the stairs to the palace, facing against the gladiators whom he tried to push to get up; however, when several gladiators came against him, they repressed him by holding his hands, while a disconsolate Adam watched as Hurut was about to be executed.\n\nIn that moment, Teth-Adam witnessed how Hurut disappeared into the ashes, causing Adam confusion. Some time later, when Hurut returned as the champion, Adam discovered that he was saved by the Council of Wizards, who had bestowed him with the powers of the Egyptian Gods.[7][1] With his new gifts, Hurut freed his people from the former king of Kahndaq and went on to become the new ruler of his homeland.[2]\n\nAfter Hurut's multiple victories, Ahk-Ton sent his gladiators to attack his family, knowing that they were the ones he loved the most. The gladiators were in charge of killing Adam and Shiruta and prepared to assassinate them. After being kneeled by force with an ax above his head, Adam witnessed Shiruta's murder at the hands of the gladiators. While screaming in tragedy, he was stabbed by a gladiator and left for dead.\n\nLater, when the gladiators withdrew, Hurut appeared in the form of the champion before Adam to save him. Ultimately, Hurut took him by the hands and asked his father to say the word Shazam at the same time, receiving a lightning bolt that transferred all of Hurut's powers to Adam. After rising as the new champion, Teth-Adam witnessed Hurut smiling for being able to save him.\n\nHowever, at that same moment, Adam watched as his son was fatally wounded by an arrow from some gladiators on the roof. Furious, Adam used his powers to shock them with his lightning bolts and subsequently looked at his hand in surprise. When his son died in his arms, it generated despair in him and quickly morphed into hatred against the murderers.\n\nFilled with rage, Teth-Adam flew into the sky as he screamed with hatred in the middle of a storm, resulting in a black armor appearing all over his body, Adam convinced himself to take revenge against all the people responsible for the death of his family.[1]\n\nThis turn of events led Teth-Adam to protect Kahndaq by any means necessary, resorting to brutality and ruthlessness. This led to the inadvertent release of the Seven Deadly Sins upon Kahndaq, killing millions and causing the destruction of several other ancient civilizations during the process.[2]\n\nTaking revenge against Ahk-Ton, Teth-Adam used his powers to disrupt his former leader's castle, chasing a servant who was attempting to deliver the Crown of Sabbac to him. Arriving at the palace, Adam electrocuted the servant, disintegrating him before he could accomplish his task, and leaving the crown to fall from the throne stairs, preventing Ahk-Ton from having a chance to grab it. Ready to assassinate Ahk-Ton, Teth-Adam started to walk down the hall to Ahk-Ton's despair.\n\nFilled with anger, Adam levitated in the air and began to absorb all the energy in the palace. Despite Ahk-Ton's pleas to give him what he wanted, Adam coldly replied that this was what he wanted. He then electrocuted the entire palace and annihilated all those present, causing an explosion that destroyed the palace and its surroundings.[1]\n\nIn response to such harsh acts, the Council of Wizards was forced to declare Teth-Adam unworthy of his gained powers, eventually teleporting him to a secret cave to entomb him in a grave. Upon appearing and being surrounded by the Council of Wizards, Adam heard how they declared having chosen him recklessly. Preparing to lock him up, they began to conjure.\n\nHowever, not willing to surrender, Teth-Adam quickly tried to save himself from the wishes of the sorcerers, electrocuting them and costing each of them their lives, except for the wizard Shazam, who used all his strength with the Staff of the Gods to ultimately entomb him.[1]\n\nAdam was reported missing by the people, and his actions as the champion were recognized by the entire Kahndaqi population who considered him a hero, along with Hurut's actions as the champion being attributed to Adam. The story of Teth-Adam defeating Ahk-Ton became recognized as a myth over the years, eventually a statue was built in Kahndaq in honor of Teth-Adam, and multiple ancient texts about Adam's battle against the king were written, which were kept secret for centuries until found by A.R.G.U.S.. Since then, over the generations and with the passing of multiple invader strikes, many people have held out hope that one day the champion Teth-Adam would return to save Kahndaq.[1]\n\nFor centuries, the wizard Shazam attempted to find someone pure enough of heart to carry the mantle. In 1974, the Wizard thought he had come close with a young boy named Thaddeus Sivana. But the corruption that the Seven Sins offered tempted him, and like Teth-Adam before, he started to give in. The Wizard was thus forced to return the boy and continue the search. It was only until the modern era that the wizard Shazam would choose Billy Batson as his new champion. When bringing Batson to the Rock of Eternity, the Wizard briefly recounted the history of Teth-Adam's tragic tale, showing Batson a hologram of Teth-Adam's costly rampage across the Earth.[2]\n\nAt some point during Teth-Adam's imprisonment, the hero Doctor Fate was combatting a demon when he was forced by the demon to experience a vision that showed him of Teth-Adam sitting on a throne after having slayed all of the new and old members of the Justice Society, including Fate himself, with a demon overlooking the landscape in pleasure. In this vision, asteroids and comets were seen hurtling down to the flaming apocalyptic landscape that had formed around Teth-Adam, with the demon implying that Teth-Adam would play a big part in the ultimate defeat of the Justice Society.[6]\n\nSearching for the Crown of Sabbac, Professor Adrianna Tomaz joined her brother Karim and Ishmael Gregor to conduct an investigation in the cave where Adam had been imprisoned and retrieve the crown. However, upon arrival they were stopped by Intergang, who forced them to surrender. Under her last hopes of escaping from them, Tomaz decided to cast the spell she presumed would free Adam, succeeding to her surprise. Lightning then struck, striking the Intergang soldiers while Adam broke free, kneeling in the same position he was imprisoned in.\n\nUnder the uncertainty of the soldiers seeing Adam motionless, one of them finally decided to slowly approach him. Adam heard his footsteps and subsequently shook his head. In that, the soldier asked Adam to show him his hands; however, the moment the soldier tried to touch him, Adam quickly surprised him by grabbing his neck. He then stood up, turned, and coldly electrocuted him until his skull was burned. Adam then dropped the lifeless skeleton to the ground.\n\nThe rest of the soldiers then proceeded to shoot at Teth-Adam, to which he grabbed one of the bullets, expressing that the shots were weak magic. Adam began to rise into the air as the soldiers continued firing at him, before he ultimately decimated them.\n\nAdam then descended with his speed, quickly hitting one soldier then another, then grabbing one of them and slamming him up, so that Adam could then jump up and slam him into the ground. Adam continued to punch other soldiers with his super speed, then hovered over a stone a mercenary was sheltering behind, electrocuting the stone and consequently the soldier, before launching a lightning bolt at a soldier firing from a distance.\n\nAs the fight with Teth-Adam continued, several soldiers continued to fire at him, but Teth-Adam again threw a soldier at them, soon knocking one soldier's arm to the ground, Adam then proceeded to grab another soldier and throw him into others. A mercenary tried to launch a missile at Adam; however, he defended himself by throwing a soldier at him, generating an explosion in the cave that caused multiple stones to fall.\n\nRising back into the air, Teth-Adam saw a huge stone about to fall on Adrianna Tomaz, so in an act of heroism, Adam released a lightning bolt that destroyed the stone, saving Tomaz. Adam then continued to fly towards the surface to escape the cave. Once positioned, Adam executed a beam that destroyed the cave's stones, proceeding to escape watching the sunlight.\n\nOnce out of the cave, Teth-Adam watched as two helicopters stopped in front of him, then saw Intergang troops arrive below him. In that, one of the helicopters fired two missiles at Adam, so he quickly moved away before the missiles could hit him. He soon took the soldiers by surprise by positioning himself in front of them, watching them from the window while they were scared.\n\nTeth-Adam then flew into a wing of the helicopter and shoved it into the second helicopter, destroying them and the pilots inside. Once the explosion occurred, Adam held one of the burning helicopters and then launched it against the Intergang soldiers who were below him, watching how they tried to shoot him.\n\nWhen the helicopters hit the ground, Adam activated his speed to take care of finishing all the soldiers, descending towards the ground while the soldiers fired at him. Adam soon launched a beam from his hand that hit all the nearby soldiers, then gently touched a helicopter blade to send it into a tank.\n\nAdam continued his journey, observing Tomaz's truck in the distance, and he decided to approach it while destroying a tank in two. Adam then plucked a bomb out of the air and placed it in the mouth of a nearby soldier. Adam then, having several soldiers in front, thunderclapped his hands to generate a shock that pushed them.\n\nContinuing his flight, Teth-Adam was shot by a soldier in a tank while seeing two missiles approaching at him, so he decided to let them pass to collide with the tank. Once he took care of all the Intergang soldiers, Adam disabled his speed as the bomb blast occurred behind him along with other consequences. He slowly descended towards the ground while looking for the truck.\n\nTeth-Adam watched as Karim and Tomaz's truck stopped in front of him, then walked in front of Adrianna Tomaz's window as she raised it, seeing how they felt intimidated due to his presence. Shortly after, Karim saw a remaining Intergang soldier preparing to launch a missile at Teth-Adam, so he warned him to be careful and to observe what was behind him.\n\nTeth-Adam quickly reacted by catching the explosive with his hand, briefly analyzing that it was made of eternium, before it exploded and vaporized his hood. Teth-Adam then launched a lightning bolt that burned the soldier, killing him.\n\nFinally seeing how his body had been scarred by Eternium, Adam decided to fly to a safer place to recover, but soon fell in front of Adrianna Tomaz and Karim again, leaving a crater and Adam unconscious while emitting lightning. Teth-Adam was then transported by Karim and Tomaz to their residence, leaving him to rest in Amon Tomaz's room.[1]\n\nWhile he slept, Adam relived memories of his family's massacre, being in front of the gladiator who was going to kill his son. Adam then woke up and reacted by throwing a lightning bolt to defend himself; however, he electrocuted a wall of Amon's bedroom, much to the boy's surprise. Adam then got up from his bed and looked at Amon, only to see that a Superman poster had been set on fire on the wall.\n\nAmon told him not to worry as he could get another one; however Adam got up from the bed and healed his wound via cauterization. Once cured, Amon introducted himself and excitedly began to propose that they help each other, but Adam only asked him to move out of his way.\n\nAmon then mentioned knowing how Adam had killed Intergang's soldiers in the desert, to which Adam replied that it was because they wouldn't move out of his way. Amon, still excited, continued asking him many questions. Adam then decided to gently grab him and move him out of the way to leave. When Adam saw a mirror, he was astonished by it and moved his arm to see how it worked.\n\nWhen Amon mentioned that things had changed a lot in 5,000 years, Adam was shocked to realize how long he had been asleep. When Amon then mentioned that this was his home, Adam lamented, saying that his Kahndaq was gone. Agreeing to listen to Amon, Adam soon sat down to read a book that told the story of Teth-Adam and how he had defeated King Ahk-Ton, to which Amon showed him a picture of his statue.\n\nAmon then explained to Adam that ever since he left, Kahndaq was oppressed by multiple invaders, finally mentioning that Kahndaq wasn't free yet and that they needed a superhero to save them. Adam ended the conversation saying that he was not a hero, surprising Amon, who claimed that superheroes like Superman, Batman or Aquaman did not come to Kahndaq to save them. Adam ignored him and broke through a wall to get out of the room, pushing the chair Karim was resting on.\n\nAdam then saw a television, where he observed how a cowboy was going to shoot, so believing that it was a sorcerer's trick, Adam quickly electrocuted the television, while Karim intimidated mentioned not being a sorcerer. When Adam heard Adrianna Tomaz's voice, he recognized her, complaining that she woke him up, to which she argued that if she hadn't, they would have killed her. Adam then asked her if the tomb soldiers were her enemies.\n\nUpon mentioning that they were, Adam explained that they were already defeated and damned, Amon then told Adam that they still had many enemies, mentioning all the technology that Intergang had. Advising Amon, Adam asked him to demonstrate his strength, destroying his enemy and everything he cared about, however Adrianna stopped him asking him not to teach her son to be violent. Adam understood that she wanted Karim to teach him, mistaking him for her husband.\n\nAfter Adrianna corrected him and mentioned that her husband died, Adam expressed his condolences, then asking who he wanted to teach his son to be violent, to which Amon manifested himself in the same way. When Adrianna asked Adam to help them defeat Intergang, he refused by ignoring her and breaking a wall to get out of it. Adam soon began to float down between stairs, to which Amon followed him to continue talking with him.\n\nWhen Amon asked him if he felt any loyalty towards them, he said no, so Amon tried to convince him to become a superhero, commenting that he had to change his suit and his name, to which he told him that Teth-Adam was a very strong name. Amon however seemed old-fashioned, also proposing that he have a recurring phrase, suggesting that he could say that the Man in Black sent them. Adam then asked who the phrase would be addressed to, Amon replied that it was the demon gods.\n\nContinuing with the idea of making him famous, Amon explained that he could have a whole line of products, something that Adam refused. When Amon mentioned that all the people Adam knew had died, Adam decided to destroy the wall again by floating above the streets while the civilians looked on in confusion. Arriving in front of the statue of the city, Adam stopped to look at it, recognizing that it was made in honor of Hurut, while having again memories of his last days, saying “Forgive me” in kahndaqi.\n\nAdam soon heard Amon trying to get his attention, only to end up being captured by Intergang soldiers and his mother trying to rescue him, but getting caught as well. Adam then decided to go down and confront the soldiers, so one of them tried to hit him with a bar, however Adam did not take any damage, and before the soldier could hit him again, Adam grabbed him and threw him hard into the sea. After Amon and Adrianna took cover, the soldiers tried to shoot him.\n\nTeth-Adam then defended himself by stopping the shots with his hand. When the soldier ran out of bullets, he prepared to draw a gun while other soldiers pointed at him from behind, so taking his time, Adam stayed in a fixed position waiting for the soldier to draw the gun. Once the soldier reacted, Adam fired a lightning bolt, quickly killing all the soldiers around him.\n\nWhen Amon and Adrianna Tomaz returned to Adam, he mentioned his phase, to which Amon corrected him that he should tell the soldiers before he killed them. Adam then began to be fired upon by two soldiers from a turret, so he quickly flew towards them, grabbing them and carrying them high, preparing to drop them.[1]\n\nTeth-Adam then watched as a ship appeared in front of him, so seeing himself threatened, he launched the soldiers, making a mocking gesture to the ship's crew, and causing the hero Hawkman to go out to rescue the soldiers, leaving them free on the ground.\n\nWhen the Intergang soldiers tried to escape, Adam electrocuted them, drawing praise from the civilian population. Hearing Hawkman mention that he wanted to hold a trial against the soldiers, Adam pleaded with him to let the gods choose his judgment, noting that Hawkman did not appear to be part of Intergang. When Hawkman introduced himself as a member of the Justice Society, threatening to use force if necessary.\n\nWhen Adam replied that force was always necessary, he heard the voice of the sorcerer Doctor Fate, who mentioned that they already knew who he was and what he was capable of, asking him to kneel before them if he didn't want to die. Angry with him, Adam told him that he had been a slave, and that by being reborn as a god, he no longer knelt before anyone.\n\nTeth-Adam then proceeded to throw lightning at both of them, to which they defended themselves by invoking shields, while the fight generated panic in the population who escaped. Teth-Adam continued to electrocute them until Doctor Fate created an illusion for Adam to see the ancient Kahndaq with the houses covered with trees in its surroundings.\n\nIn the confusion of seeing the ancient villages of his nation, Adam soon saw Hawkman fly towards him, who swiftly knocked him out of the illusion and into cars, Adam then rose from the rubble to confront Hawkman, as Hawkman insisted that he say the word Shazam so they could go home, to which Adam commented that he was homeless. Hawkman then jumped up with his mace and prepared to strike Adam.\n\nHowever, Adam parried his attack by grabbing his mace, so by charging his hand with electricity, Adam proceeded to fire an energy blast at it which hit him with a nearby car. When Hawkman tried to get up, Teth-Adam briefly electrocuted him, then flew up, grabbing him and carrying him into the air, to which Hawkman began to defend himself, prompting Adam to fight him.\n\nDuring the fight, Adam attempted to electrocute Hawkman, to which Hawkman gathered the energy with his mace and blasted back, gaining a brief advantage and knocking Adam to the ground in the middle of a build. After a few moments, Adam got up annoyed as he watched Doctor Fate in the sky. In that, Adam was surrounded by a hurricane of earth caused by Cyclone that began to disarm the construction bars, which she threw against Adam, locking him up.\n\nAdam then unleashed an energy charge to get rid of them, and took to the sky again, but Hawkman tried to attack him, so Adam defended himself by grabbing him and swinging him around, until Hawkman managed to knock him to the ground. Teth-Adam soon tried to get up, but was attacked by crystalline fractals summoned by Doctor Fate, which caused him deep pain, so he tried to free himself from it.\n\nAfter the spell ended, several clones of Doctor Fate appeared to take Adam's arms trying to contain him, however he began to hit them making them disappear as other clones appeared, so Doctor Fate invoked a spell so that he could not move around a brief time, to which the clones beat him. Seeing how Hawkman had thrown a truck at him, Adam took his hand out of it and launched a lightning bolt to destroy it.\n\nAdam then saw how both Hawkman and Cyclone were heading to attack him, so in an act of rage, Adam charged up enough energy to generate an explosion that freed him from Fate's clones, pushing the Justice Society against the walls. Adam took the opportunity to rise up, however before he could escape, Adam was unexpectedly crushed by Atom Smasher.\n\nAdam then began manipulating the energy of nearby appliances to gather enough power to burst out of Atom Smasher's hand, flying quickly and hitting Atom Smasher hard in the face, causing him to pass out. In that, Teth-Adam began to be praised by the civilians of Kahndaq, who supported him and treated him as a champion, he observed them however he decided to escape, flying to the old castle of King Ahk-Ton.[1]\n\nBeing in the old castle, Adam observed the statue of his son to which Adrianna Tomaz came to talk to him, when Adam complained that Tomaz brought the Justice Society, she mentioned that they just wanted to talk, however Adam refused to listen to them. Tomaz then said how she had been told that Adam had freed Kahndaq from King Ahk-Ton, but that the Justice Society claimed that Adam came to seek revenge.\n\nHaving become uncontrollable and the Council of Wizards declaring him unworthy, locking him in his tomb, Tomaz mentioned that the people hoped that the champion of Kahndaq would return. Adam however clarified never saying he was a hero, so Tomaz tried to convince him that it didn't mean he couldn't become one, causing Adam to reflect, finally deciding to talk to the Justice Society, under the condition of killing them if they decided to fight.\n\nWhen the Justice Society entered, Hawkman asked to negotiate Adam's peaceful surrender, to which he said he was not peaceful and that he would not surrender either. Kent Nelson then rhetorically asked Adam what had given him his powers, beyond pain, causing him to agree with him, so Hawkman questioned his resistance, stating that he should not be there, Adam however mentioned that the Society should not be in Kahndaq and should be gone.\n\nHawkman provoked him by agreeing to go only if Adam was taken prisoner, so Adam threatened to destroy Adam's wings, encouraging Hawkman to fight. Tomaz however asked them to calm down, but they did not refuse to fight, causing Adam to smile. In that, Tomaz received a call from her son requesting help after Intergang was looking for him, so she desperately begged Teth-Adam to save him, Adam then reflected, agreeing to save him and jumping to save Amon.[1]\n\nAdam flew to the Tomaz residence where he watched as an Intergang soldier kidnapped Amon on a flying motorcycle, when Adam asked him to let him go, the soldier responded by throwing him off his bike, so Adam quickly flew to grab him, saving him and leaving him on safe ground. Adam then proceeded to annihilate all the soldiers that were above him causing ash between the structures.\n\nShortly after, Adam broke through a wall while holding a soldier he was preparing to punch, however Adam noticed Amon's backpack thrown on the ground, understanding in his confusion that Amon had been kidnapped again. Seeing an Intergang ship pass by on the street, Adam quickly followed it believing that they could have Amon inside, while the soldier he was holding asked him to release him, Adam then agreed, telling him to be careful with his words and then throw him away.\n\nAs he continued his chase, Adam zoomed forward to stand in front of the motorcycle, but was surprised to see that it had teleported in front of him to avoid him, so he quickly tried to catch up again as more bikes appeared and picked up speed. As the ships rounded a curve, Adam took the opportunity to electrocute a billboard, forcing them to run over it. Getting a ship to teleport, Adam zoomed in front of it to crash it, checking the capsule to find that Amon was not there.\n\nWhile Hawkman stood on top of the ships looking for Amon with infrared vision, Adam expelled him and broke the capsule in search of Amon, to which Hawkman asked him what he was doing, Adam answered his mission to which Hawkman offered to help him in exchange for not to kill people, but Adam refused to accept as he slammed a ship to the ground. Adam continued to chase the remaining ships to which he dodged Atom Smasher's hand.\n\nFollowing them to shore, Adam took a ship by surprise by flying behind a ship and pushing it off course, checking that Amon was missing, Adam grabbed the soldier and threw him, activating teleportation so he collided with him, causing an explosion as Adam flew off to chase the remaining ship. Adam followed the last ship through a desert until it boosted at super speed.\n\nAdam then continued to fly a great distance until he managed to grab the ship destroying its engine and making it crash into a field while Adam stopped it by crashing into the earth. Finally stopping the crash, Adam walked to the ship residing the capsule and seeing that Amon was not in it, so upset, he threw the ship. Seeing how the soldier ran trying to escape, Teth-Adam used his speed to appear in front of him and proceeded to throw him hard.\n\nConsecutively after, Teth-Adam saw a projection of Doctor Fate, who asked him if he had found Amon, Adam explained his situation, so Doctor Fate requested him to hand over the soldier so that he could read his mind and find Amon's location, Teth-Adam was unable to answer since he threw him, as Doctor Fate asked that he had killed he looked to his right, seeing the soldier fall, Adam simply mentioned that the soldier did not survived.[1]\n\nReturning to the Tomaz residence, Teth-Adam came in destroying the wall, to which Nelson complained ironically that in the old Kahndaq there were no doors, but when Adam said that this way he entered everywhere, Nelson mentioned that his comment had It was sarcasm. When a concerned Adrianna Tomaz asked Adam about Amon, he replied that he would find him, making the kidnappers suffer.\n\nIn that, Hawkman entered the residence with two Intergang soldiers to whom he suggested to Adam that they should interrogate them, however Tomaz began to beat the soldiers in search of answers. Heeding Hawkman, Adam decided to stop Tomaz by grabbing her arm and explaining to her that he had discovered that in the modern world, prisoners should be treated with respect. Adam then asked the soldiers if they flew, quickly grabbing them and carrying them up into the heights of a storm as Hawkman followed to stop him.\n\nThreatening to shoot them down, Adam asked the soldiers what they did with Amon. When Hawkman asked him not to drop them, Adam replied that he would only drop the last one to respond, in which one of the soldiers mentioned not knowing what happened to Amon, so Adam released him causing Hawkman to come to his rescue. The remaining soldier fearfully confessed to Adam that Amon was near the desert mines.\n\nHowever before he could finish speaking, Adam threw him off the cliff, prompting Hawkman to come to his rescue as well. Teth-Adam soon returned to the Tomaz residence, to which Kent Nelson pointed out that he had said he was not going to harm the prisoners, but Adam replied that it was sarcasm, Adam then approached Tomaz to mention Amon's location near the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.\n\nWhen Hawkman returned with the prisoners, he angrily asked Adam to stop killing people, however Adam only noted that the prisoners were fine, explaining that he hoped he would save them, get the information he needed and that no one would die. Hawkman however decided to continue confronting him by saying that there are only heroes and villains, Adam then denoted Hawkman's hypocrisy for letting criminals go free knowing that many would suffer more if they were not killed. Filled with anger, Hawkman claimed that heroes didn't kill people, so Adam approached intimidatingly to him and mentioned that he did.\n\nFed up with Adam, Hawkman activated his mallet and prepared to attack him, so Adam began to defend himself by hitting him, when Hawkman tried to hit him with the mallet, Adam teleported behind him twice, grabbing him with his leg and throwing him against the wall, believing to have defeated him. However, Hawkman got up and activated his wings, throwing some furniture at Adam which did not affect him.\n\nSeeing that Hawkman was preparing to fly towards him, Adam decided to teleport to grab his leg again, throwing him into Amon's bedroom, Adam then flew towards him and started punching him, destroying multiple posters and action figures of Amon, when Hawkman tried to hitting him, Adam dodged, grabbing him again to hit him, but seeing that he began to protect himself with his shield, Adam tried to throw a lightning bolt at him.\n\nHawkman however tried to fight Teth-Adam again, to which Adam tried to hit him, accidentally hitting the door, Adam kept trying to fight Hawkman until he hit the Crown of Sabbac, which lit up his hand with energy, seeing that they almost destroyed the crown, Hawkman decided to stop fighting and show Adam the crown, deciding to take it to the Hawk Cruiser.[1]\n\nAdam along with Tomaz and the Justice Society set out for the Al Hadidiyah Mine via the Hawk Cruiser. Inside the ship, Adam overheard the team investigating a phrase encrypted in the Crown of Sabbac, commenting that it didn't matter what it meant as it was entombed at sea, causing Hawkman to claim that it would be similar to what they would do to him burying him in the sea, however, Adam provoked him by saying that he could be buried with him.\n\nWhen Adrianna Tomaz asked that they should keep the crown, Hawkman tried to convince her that they would save Amon, to which Adam angrily mentioned that the Society just wanted to beat him, Tomaz however asked that everyone be on the same side until Amon was saved, when Hawkman told Adam that they should team up, Adam sarcastically said that he loved teams.\n\nThe team soon reached the mines so Hawkman began to explain the plan, however Adam ignored him and jumped out of the ship to head for the mines, flying over the Intergang soldiers who started shooting at him, however Adam turned away. he defended hitting all the ships until launching one against the entrance, flying with speed until an Eternium shield with which he accidentally collided.\n\nIn that, Teth-Adam met Ishmael Gregor who told him that the eternium was indestructible even for his powers, while Tomaz and the Justice Society arrived to help Adam, when Gregor pointed a gun at Amon, Adam threatened with killing them all, but Gregor insisted that he only wanted the crown.\n\nGregor then threatened to kill Amon if they didn't hand over the crown, so Adrianna prepared to hand it over, seeing how Hawkman stood in the way of Tomaz's decisions, Adam pushed him so that Tomaz could move forward, launching a lightning bolt to destroy the field of energy generated by Doctor Fate, and threatening the Justice Society that was neither his son nor his nation, so neither was their decision.\n\nAttentive to Gregor's actions, Adam flew close to the shield, seeing how Gregor received the crown and complained about Adam for joining with foreigners, Adam however asked them to let them go, to which Gregor explained that he was the last descendant of King Ahk-Ton, provoking Adam's wrath. Gregor continued to provoke Adam by mentioning how he had cried over Hurut's death, then preparing to shoot Amon.\n\nWhen Gregor pulled the trigger and the shield was disabled, Adam quickly flew to put his hand against the bullet in order to save Amon, managing to stop the assassination, Adam then in a rage activated his lightning bolts preparing to kill Ishmael who donned the crown while the Society covered the Tomaz, Adam finally generated a major explosion that destroyed the mines.\n\nAs Adrianna got up from the rubble desperately for her son's health, Adam mentioned that he was the one to blame for Amon fainting and nearly dying. Sorry for the damage he caused, Teth-Adam decided to fly back to Ahk-Ton's palace before Hawkman could grab him.[1]\n\nUpon arrival, Adam began to reflect on his son while observing the statue, until Hawkman landed to claim him for having to continue waiting for his surrender, Adam then remarked the senselessness of a fight since no one could beat him, to which Hawkman agreed. When Hawkman reminded Adam of Ishamel's words asking who Hurut was, so after a pause Adam stated that Hurut was the true champion of Kahndaq as well as his son.\n\nAdam then explained that after being chosen by the wizards, Ahk-Ton went to murder his family, transferring his powers to Adam but being killed on the spot. Narrating how he took revenge against the king, Adam expressed that his powers were not a gift, but a curse. When Hawkman identified the statue as being of Hurut, Adam mentioned that his son saved him because he dreamed of a better world, but Adam showed that the world was better with Hurut.\n\nRemorseful of his actions and not feeling worthy of his powers, Adam descended the stairs to address Hawkman, promising to say the magic word and relinquish his powers, tasking Hawkman with making sure he didn't say it again. Teth-Adam then said the word Shazam, being struck by lightning that returned him to his Kahndaqi slave form, while mentioning that some people are not meant to be heroes.\n\nAdam then surrendered, falling asleep on a stretcher and being teleported by the Justice Society to the A.R.G.U.S. Task Force X Black Site facility. Upon arrival, Adam was handed over as a prisoner and the guards took him to a capsule, putting an oxygen mask and handcuffs on him, which was encapsulated and submerged by water, preventing him from speaking.[1]\n\nAdam was later awakened by Kent Nelson who began to speak to him through a spell, informing him that the battle his son was destined to face was drawing near, and that he was the only one who could defeat the demon Sabbac, when Adam opened his eyes, he observed a projection of Doctor Fate who cast a spell to free him.\n\nThe capsule was then opened and Adam was released, who was swept through the water and soon tried to remove his mask. In that, some A.R.G.U.S. guards arrived to restrain Adam, but listening to Nelson mention that he could be the destroyer of the world or its savior, Adam took courage and rose against the guards, pushing them and kicking one to escape.\n\nContinuing on his way, Adam grabbed a baton which he hurled at another guard's head. Adam then dodged one guard, grabbing and using another as a shield while others fired at him. Throwing the soldier to the ground, Adam quickly grabbed a soldier's arm hitting him with the rifle. When another soldier tried to hit him with a bar, Adam fought back by hitting him in the head with the rifle.\n\nAs he continued to fight, Adam hit two guards over the head knocking them to the ground, soon facing a guard which he managed to knock down. With his foot hurt, Adam finished approaching the exit while taking shots, hearing Nelson mention that the world needed him, Adam soon jumped against the exit swimming through the water at speed\n\nTeth-Adam then started to take off his mask and began to float closer to the surface, remembering his family and the words of his son Hurut who told him that the world should be free asking him to say the word, Adam activated his powers again by saying Shazam, striking him with lightning which generated an explosion between the ices.\n\nHaving regained his powers, Adam flew back to Kahndaq, where he watched as Sabbac had thrown the statue of Hurut to crush the civilian population, so he quickly flew to pick it up to save the citizens, watching as Amon Tomaz celebrated until Atom Smasher he arrived to hold the statue and let him know that he would take care of it, entrusting Adam to help Hawkman.\n\nAdam then flew at Sabbac hitting him in the face and knocking him to the ground, so as he descended and saw Hawkman, Adam told Sabbac what he should do, to which Hawkman asked him to destroy him. When Sabbac rose requesting a battle of champions to decide Kahndaq's fate, Adam prepared to face him, Sabbac then fired a lightning bolt at Adam which marked wounds on his chest, worrying Adam.\n\nIn that, when Sabbac was about to hit him, Adam stopped him by grabbing his horns while they both emitted lightning, to try to stop him, Adam began to kick him however Sabbac soon hit him into the air, Adam then began to defend himself by throwing lightning at him while trying to stop him dodging his attacks. Adam then flew to grab him by the horns again electrocuting him, but Sabbac began pummeling him and shooting waves of fire at him that slowly hurt him.\n\nTeth-Adam was soon beaten by Sabbac against the castle as Sabbac reprimanded him that the wizards wasted his power on him and that he was not a hero. Seeing Hawkman behind Sabbac, Adam accepted Sabbac's words but admitted that Hawkman was, watching as Sabbac rammed a pipe into Sabbac's chest, to which Gregor tried to kill Hawkman, only to realize that it was a illusion made with the Helmet of Fate.\n\nWhen other clones prepared to hold Sabbac against the throne, Adam then took the opportunity to get behind him and electrocute his horns. Full of energy, Adam tried to control Sabbac under the guidance of Hawkman, so Adam soon flew Sabbac into the sky, Adam then prepared to kill him, mentioning his catchphrase before Adam proceeded to cut Sabbac's body in two parts, killing him and eliminating the Legions of Hell.\n\nAdam then went down to shake Hawkman's hand to get him up, as Hawkman mentioned never having thought he was happy to see him, causing Adam to smile, who mentioned getting there thanks to Nelson as he looked at the hull. Adam the watched as the Tomaz returned, while the Justice Society prepared to leave, Atom Smasher then mentioned feeling that they had made a great team, to which Adam agreed, Atom Smasher tried to continue talking with Adam, however, he soon had to withdraw.[1]\n\nAfter the Justice Society withdrew, Adam was praised by the Kahndaqi population from afar, so Adrianna Tomaz invited Teth-Adam to sit on King Ahk-Ton's former throne, suggesting that he could be their hero. Adam then took a step, sitting on the throne, settling down and grasping his hand as he pondered. When Amon asked him how he felt, he answered wrong, proceeding to jump down and break the throne.\n\nAmidst the ashes of the throne, Amon asked if Adam would eventually become Kahndaq's hero, to which Adam replied that the nation always had a hero, but they needed a protector. Adrianna then thanked Teth-Adam for saving the nation. However, he showed feeling that the name Teth-Adam was outdated, suggesting the Black Adam alias.[1]\n\nIn the aftermath of destroying Sabbac with the help of the JSA, while sitting in the throne room of Kahndaq, Black Adam met with Amanda Waller via a drone sent by A.R.G.U.S.; agitated with giving Black Adam her attention, she explained the coming consequences to his actions.\n\nWaller warned him, threatening to send people who were not from Earth to come deal with him themselves if he ever so set foot out of his country, calling it his \"prison”. Unfazed by her intimidation and cocky manner, he urged her to send them all before blowing up the drone with a strike of lightning by the palm. Before awaited him a visitor; hovering over the smoke and mist of the debris stepped out Superman, sent by Waller.\n\nSuperman then claimed that it had been a while since anyone made the world this nervous, referencing his once uneasy involvement and relationship with mankind and humanity. Saying this and knowing what Black Adam was fully capable of, Superman peacefully asked Black Adam to talk, as he stared at Superman with sinister glee and great interest as he stood his ground.[1]\n\nAdam grew up as a slave in Kahndaq, being constantly mistreated and exploited by his leaders, which generated hatred towards them, but he was always full of courage and bravery to attend to situations that required it. Raising his son Hurut, Teth-Adam always tried to protect him from any evil, teaching him from an early age that the world they lived in was a dangerous one, contrasting with his son's premature desires to improve it. At some point, when Hurut observed how some gladiators mistreated a slave, he was about to help him, however Adam stopped him and told him that they couldn't do anything about it no matter how much they wanted to. However, Teth-Adam took pride in his son's morality and sense of fairness and justice, as Adam eventually smiled as Hurut handed his slice of bread to some slaves in need, telling Shiruta that he felt there was still hope in Kahndaq.\n\nFollowing the sudden death of his wife and son at the hands of King Ahk-Ton's forces, Adam was left traumatized and filled with emotional pain, which led him to became brutal, vengeful, cold, ruthless, and aggressive after the loss of his family to Akh-Ton's forces, Adam began misusing his powers and accidentally releasing the Seven Deadly Sins upon his family's murderers and the rest of the people of Kahndaq, killing millions. Having become invincible and taking revenge on his former leaders, Adam developed a strong ego that allowed him to consider himself unable to surrender to anyone. Teth-Adam also developed a twisted sense of justice, using a methodology where the ends (protecting Kahndaq) justify the means, so Black Adam doesn't mind coldly hurting and killing people to get what he wants. All these heinous acts caused him to be declared unworthy by the Council of Wizards, who tried to bury him and revoke his powers, however, Adam completely refused to surrender, killed the Council of Wizards as well, until he was finally buried by the wizard Shazam.\n\nWaking up in a modern world, Teth-Adam had a hard time adjusting, but continuing his brutal and vengeful nature, Adam murdered every Intergang soldier who got in his way, but taking pity on Adrianna Tomaz and Karim by instinctively saving them from being killed. a stone fell on them, because his divine wisdom predicted that they would be important in the near future. After some time and finding himself in the Tomaz residence, Teth-Adam was uncomfortable with Amon Tomaz's questions, but having compassion for the child, he simply asked him to get out of his way, even remarking that he was not a hero when he asked him to save Kahndaq. Likewise, Adam in his impression with the modern world, is surprised when he finds himself with a mirror or witnesses a television, believing that it was magic from sorcerers, Adam destroyed the television, and finding himself painful that the land in which he used to life would have changed, he went out to explore Shiruta City, curious about a statue dedicated to the champion of Kahndaq. Adam also does not have caution or care for other people's property, destroying the walls of the Tomaz residence instead of using the doors, this was even led to Kent Nelson pointing it out to him.\n\nDue to the danger Teth-Adam represented in the eyes of A.R.G.U.S., the Justice Society was sent in in an attempt to stop him, to which Adam, seeing himself threatened by them and unwilling to surrender, referred to himself as a god and that he would not kneel before anyone, easily gaining the upper hand. confrontation. Annoyed with the Justice Society and especially with Hawkman, Teth-Adam even threatened to kill them if they wanted to continue fighting, when Hawkman mentioned not disagreeing with fighting, Adam smiled. As soon as Amon Tomaz was kidnapped and Adrianna begged him to save him, Teth-Adam did not hesitate to go to the rescue and save him, killing every soldier who got in his way, which led him to have an ethical conflict with Hawkman, who was trying to convince him not to kill people since it was not something heroes should do, to which Adam remarked that he would kill if necessary, causing a brief confrontation between them. Adam was also open to having a sense of humor, adopting sarcasm when Kent Nelson mocked Adam saying he wouldn't murder people, Teth-Adam was soon sarcastic by mentioning that he loved teaming up with the Justice Society, only to then attack the Al Hadidiyah Mine, ignoring Hawkman's plans.\n\nFinding himself provoked by Ishmael Gregor who mentioned being a descendant of Ahk-Ton and mocked Hurut's death, as well as shooting Amon Tomaz, Teth-Adam unleashed all his wrath on preventing Amon's death and then took revenge by murdering Ishmael. Gregor, generating an explosion that destroyed everything around him, and if the Justice Society had not intervened, the Tomaz would have died. The intentional taunting of Adam allowed Gregor to be killed just as the Crown of Sabbac was placed, traveling to the underworld to gain demonic powers. Meanwhile, Teth-Adam was completely hurt and sorry for the damage he could have caused as well as all the massacres he committed in the past, so he finally decided to renounce his powers, traveling back to the palace of King Ahk-Ton to reflect on his actions, after Hawkman demanded his surrender and no longer feeling worthy of being the champion, Adam returned to his civilian form and voluntarily surrendered upon learning that no one could defeat him, asking Hawkman to lock him up and that they ensure he does not transform again, soon imprisoning him at the Task Force X Black Site.\n\nAfter Sabbac threatened to destroy Kahndaq, Kent Nelson awakened Teth-Adam in an attempt to stop him, convincing him that despite not being chosen by the Council of Wizards, he was worthy and destined to fight Sabbac. stating that he was wrong and that the world needed him, motivating Adam to escape from his prison by fighting A.R.G.U.S. guards. Remembering his son's legacy, Adam reactivated his powers and traveled back to Kahndaq, where he demonstrated that despite having to deal with overwhelming pain, Adam still had kindness in his heart and he was truly willing to give up his powers and/or sacrifice himself to protect Kahndaq and all of its inhabitants, even at the cost of his life, saving a group of civilians from having a statue fall on them and killing Sabbac with the help of Hawkman, after the battle, Adam ended up being more empathetic towards the Justice Society, even agreeing with Atom Smasher that they made a good team. Accepting his rightful role as the hero of Kahndaq, Teth-Adam finally agreed to protect the nation, but after being goaded to sit on Ahk-Ton's former throne, he deemed it wrong due to all the former king's atrocities, destroying it. Being more open to Amon's initial proposals to become a hero, Adam agreed to change his name to Black Adam, but still maintained his ego as the most powerful being on the planet, Adam was not afraid to confront Waller when she threatened him to stay in Kahndaq, causing Superman to arrive to request to talk.",
