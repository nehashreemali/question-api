  "content": "Lord Darkseid, once known as Uxas, is an ancient and all-powerful cosmic New God warlord and conqueror who reigns over the fiery, extra-dimensional planet of Apokolips, and desires to rule Earth and the entire multiverse by harnessing the unimaginable power of the Anti-Life Equation. He is the nephew of his former herald, General Steppenwolf.\n\nBecause of this tyrannical goal, he is the greatest arch-nemesis of the Justice League, the superheroic champions of the planet Earth, the only world that was able to resist his attempts at conquest.\n\nThousands of years ago, before mighty Darkseid took the throne of Apokolips, he became obsessed with the unholy Anti-Life Equation, a transcendental mathematical formula that eradicates Free Will. After locating the Equation on the planet Earth, he traveled there with an enormous army, planning to take the power of the Equation and use the seemingly weak world as a test run for his new power.[2]\n\nUpon arrival, he gained access to the Equation, and prepared to put it to use, but unfortunately for him, the native beings of that world, four powerful races known as Humans, Atlanteans, Amazons, and Old Gods, formed their own army to protect their world, even calling in help from the Green Lantern Corps in the form of Yalan Gur. In the battle that followed, Darkseid personally led the charge of his forces and easily slaughtered countless humans, Atlanteans, and Amazons, and even managed to kill Yalan Gur after a brief bout.\n\nAs he did so, however, the Old Gods finally moved to meet Darkseid head-on. Artemis was the first to strike, shooting the warlord with two arrows; Darkseid quickly ripped one out; but before he could rip out the other, he was immediately staggered further by a shockwave from Atlan's trident. Zeus, the King of the Old Gods and leader of Earth's alliance, then stepped in to confront the Apokoliptian warlord personally; blasting him with a barrage of divine lightning, which Darkseid managed to block with his weapon, but subsequently found himself on the defensive and locked in place.\n\nSpotting an opening, Zeus's son Ares sprinted forward, launched himself into the air with his axe poised over his head, and came crashing down upon Darkseid, slicing through his opponent's weapon and cleaving open Darkseid's shoulder, forcing Darkseid to his knee. As the warlord bellowed with pain and rage, the God of War then sent the Apokoliptian flying back several feet with a vicious kick, leaving Darkseid sprawled on the ground, gravely wounded and more vulnerable than ever.\n\nJust as Ares moved to finish off the warlord, a flock of Parademons then appeared, sacrificing themselves to the Old Gods' wrath as another squad of Parademons grabbed the severely weakened Darkseid and dragged him back to his ship. With Darkseid out of action, the Apokoliptian forces buckled, splintered, and then broke altogether, forcing a general rout by the Parademons and securing a grand albeit costly victory for Earth's races, made all the more significant by the loss of the Mother Boxes when the mystics charged with protecting them were killed in the battle when the Unity was blasted apart by Zeus.[3]\n\nWith this heavy defeat on Earth, Darkseid had lost the Anti-Life Equation, millions of soldiers, and the three Mother Boxes, all in one fell swoop, all upon an anonymous, unnamed world among the countless of the Multiverse. A furious Darkseid, however, was undeterred and vowed to claim the Equation again. However, by the time he recovered from the nearly fatal injuries on Apokolips, and likely due to losing against what the Apokoliptians deemed to be a primitive planet, the position of power that he once held became almost nonexistent, and the loss of Darkseid's influence resulted in a vicious war that by the time he came into a position of power once more, thousands of years had passed, and those who had joined him on his failed crusade on Earth had all been wiped out. As a result, the exact location of Anti-Life and the planet that held it, and the whereabouts of the Mother Boxes, were lost to Darkseid, who, after ascending as the ruler of Apokolips, began a search that spanned thousands of years and the conquering of countless planets in order to find Anti-Life once more.[3]\n\nMillennia later, in 2015, the Mother Boxes began to reawaken due to Superman's death, alerting his exiled general Steppenwolf. In 2017, while in the process of gathering the Boxes to create the Unity, Steppenwolf rediscovered the Anti-Life Equation on Earth. Darkseid was later informed that Earth was not only the planet that held the Mother Boxes, but also held the Anti-Life Equation that he had failed to acquire.\n\nUpon learning this, Darkseid ordered his uncle to prepare for his arrival, and to terraform the planet with the Unity. He became stunned upon learning that Earth, the world that fought back, held the Anti-Life Equation for which he coveted, and promised redemption to his exiled minion in return for preparing the surroundings of his prize.\n\nWhile Steppenwolf managed to open a portal to summon Darkseid, he was defeated and slain by the Justice League before Darkseid could come across. He could only watch his enemies, led by Batman, see that his three Mother Boxes on Earth were disabled.[3]\n\nAn undeterred Darkseid resolved to come via \"the old ways\"; by direct warfare against Earth, tasking his servant DeSaad with preparing the Apokoliptian invading forces. Later on Earth, the Martian Manhunter formally introduced himself to Batman, warning him that Darkseid was not through with Earth yet and that they needed to find the Anti-Life Equation before he did.[3]\n\nDarkseid's existence became more well-known to certain parts of humanity. As a result, a VR video game entitled Darkseid Dance Revolution was created, and Eugene Choi owned a copy of the game.[4]\n\nEver since he was raised on Apokolips, Darkseid has been infamously known for his tremendous megalomania, seeing himself as the true ruler of the entire Multiverse. Darkseid is therefore the ultimate walking power of malevolence, terror, and destruction, expressing his power over nearly all who dare to face him. Indeed, even Wonder Woman showed fear when first learning of him.\n\nDeeming himself as the one who turned thousands of planets into dust while looking for the one planet which has already defeated him, Darkseid is incredibly formidable and held great confidence in his abilities. This was evident during his past invasions where he personally led the charge against his enemies head on before his minions would. It is unknown if Darkseid still holds the same confidence in his battle prowess after his near-death experience by the hands of Ares. After his first defeat, he had begun wearing body armor and even stopped personally leading invasions into other worlds.\n\nAdditionally, Darkseid is extremely obsessive and this prevents him from having any forbearance, especially with gaining his goals. Upon discovering the existence of the Anti-Life Equation, he developed a fanatical obsession with it and sought to expend every resource at his disposal in order to acquire this new power. However, Darkseid seems to love his family to some degree and possesses a level of mercy and forgiveness, as he did not execute Steppenwolf for his treason after he tried to amend for it by helping him take down his opposers, but rather exiled him. He was also willing to allow Steppenwolf to return to Apokolips if he could synchronize the Unity so Darkseid could arrive on Earth and claim the Anti-Life Equation.",
