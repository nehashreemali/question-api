  "content": "Maxwell \"Max\" Lord (né Lorenzano) is an opportunistic television personality and oil magnate who came across the Dreamstone in the 1980's and use it as a means to his own ends.\n\nMaxwell Lorenzano grew up in a poor household with a violent father. Induced by his father's aggressive behavior he developed as an anxious child and was prone to bed-wetting. At school, Max was frequently the subject of taunts and bullying for his comparative poverty to the other students who made fun of his tatty clothes, worn-out shoes, and small amount of food for lunch. Despite this, Max applied himself and eventually graduated high school.\n\nDue to the death of his parents and being poor, Max was forced to enter the workforce immediately after his high school graduation. He could not afford to enroll in the university, although he certainly was qualified. These experiences imbued Max with a deep motivation to achieve financial success in life.\n\nHe started his own business, Black Gold Cooperative, initially as a one-man operation and changed his name to Maxwell Lord. Gradually, Max convinced financiers, most prominently Simon Stagg from Stagg Industries to invest in his company which tasked itself with oil exploration in areas that other companies had ignored.\n\nMax did get married at one point in his life, and the marriage produced a son named Alistair. The marriage did not take root, however, and the couple separated. The separation was done on somewhat amicable terms. Max and his ex-wife share custody of their only son.[1]\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Max used his media commercials and infomercials to achieve popularity, crediting himself as the person who can make the greatest wishes of every person on Earth come true. Max eventually developed an acute persuasiveness and became known for maintaining a steady influence over people, thus increasing his commercials and his media.[1]\n\nBlack Gold Cooperative continued to portray an outward appearance of success, but it actually started becoming financially unviable due to a lack of oil discoveries. Eventually, his chief investor Simon Stagg became aware of the facts. In a confrontation with Max, Stagg accused him of managing a Ponzi scheme. Running out of legitimate options to salvage the company, Max continued his search for the legendary Dreamstone, an artifact that contained the potential power to rectify his situation.[1]\n\nLord was also a prominent philanthropist, having earned a reputation as a noted donor to multiple nonprofit organizations and charities. One such organization that Lord had bankrolled was the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Within the museum's Hall of Geology, there was at least one exhibit featuring a crystal from Lord's own collection, a fact that was advertised on the exhibit.[2]\n\nAs a result of his donations in 1984, he was invited for a tour of the museum and to observe its activities. The facilitator of his tour was Doctor Barbara Minerva. Max and Minerva bond over his tour, during the course of which, he notices the Dreamstone artifact, an item which he had been searching for some time. During the same tour, Max also encountered the Amazon known as Diana Prince.\n\nMax feigned interest in Minerva to gain control of the Dreamstone by tricking her into giving it to him under the guise that he could \"help her in her research.” Max then wishes to become the embodiment of the stone itself, granting him its wish-granting powers but at the price of draining his lifeforce with every wish he grants. Lord utilizes the power to trick people into wishing for something so he can take what he desires in return to amass wealth, fame and fortune but also leaves chaos in his path and was unable to spend as much time with his son.[1]\n\nLord's health rapidly deteriorates with every wish he grants, but despite this, Lord utilizes its power to gain access to the President who he tricks into making a wish, in exchange for his respect, influence and power so that he can gain access to a global broadcasting network project that the US has secretly been developing so he may grant wishes to the entire world. Lord rehabilitates his health by absorbing his wishers lifeforce but as a result of his global broadcast, people's wishes begin to cause instability across the globe.\n\nBarbara, who has joined forces with Lord, is transformed into Cheetah when Maxwell gifts her the rage and prowess he took from people making wishes. Diana eventually defeats Cheetah and confronts Lord who has now become too powerful to stop.\n\nUsing her Lasso of Truth, Diana communicates to the world via Lord and convinces them to renounce their wishes while she shows him a vision of his son wandering the streets as chaos ensues from his fulfillment of everyone's desires. Lord, seeing the chaos and destruction he's caused and unwilling to sacrifice his son whom he neglected for years, renounces his wish and returns to reunite with his son.[1]\n\nMax Lord is famous for being an extremely charming, charismatic, and powerful individual as well as a powerful motivational-esque speaker with addition to being highly manipulative and cunning in order to obtain what he seeks, using his vast manipulations and his influence over people to influence them into believing him and his words. Using his wealth and his media influence, Max became highly influential and manipulative over Diana Prince and Barbara Ann Minnerva. Having obtained the Dreamstone, he showed his power towards Barbara and Prince and gained himself a powerful position and influential reputation across the wide public, even over Diana as an Amazonian.\n\nDespite his many claims over his \"benefits\" for humanity and calling himself The King of Infomercials, Max is secretly an extremely greedy, ambitious, and selfish individual. He has earned a reputation for philanthropy, as seen by the special treatment the Smithsonian gave to him in honor of his past support, but it seems that is not so much of a desire to give back to the community or help the less fortunate as it is more a way to buy respect from the public at large. Beneath his good, caring, and influential facáde is a insecure and egotistical man obsessed with gaining success, power, and recognition.\n\nHis use of the Dreamstone exaggerated these traits into ruthlessness and insanity until Diana managed to get through to him by showing the extent of the damage he caused and the danger he put his son in. After this revelation, Max came to terms with his innermost fears of being seen as a failure and realized his son was more important than his own desires.",
