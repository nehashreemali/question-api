  "content": "The Enchantress was an ancient and inter-dimensional mystical being, who possessed the body of June Moone after the latter inadvertently freed her from her imprisonment. Initially under Amanda Waller's control, Enchantress was viewed as one of the candidates for Task Force X membership, but the malevolent witch swiftly escaped, freeing her brother Incubus and attempting to take over Earth with their combined mystical powers. In the end, however, Enchantress and her brother are killed by the combined efforts of Task Force X and the U.S. military during a final fight in Midway City.\n\nHailing from another dimension, Enchantress and her brother Incubus entered this plane of existence circa 4,358 B.C., over a millennium before the War of the Gods. Due to their incredible power, Enchantress and Incubus were worshiped as gods by ancient humans of Pre-Columbian South America but were ultimately betrayed by her subjects and somehow defeated and sealed away into containers, which, in turn, were placed inside a tomb of Tres Osos Caves for millennia.[1]\n\nArchaeologist Dr. June Moone was exploring a site along the long overgrown Tres Osos Caves in the north-central highlands of Peru when she fell a shaft into a cavern containing a tomb. A doll-shaped container that held the witch caught her eye and called to her, making her release the spirit of the ancient deity. The spirit then possesses June's body, inhabiting her normal self until she says the word \"Enchantress\", upon which her normal consciousness is overtaken by the ancient spirit inside.\n\nIt was not long before she came to the attention of Amanda Waller during her search for metahumans for the United States government. She sends her subordinate Colonel Rick Flag to apprehend her and watch over June. Soon after, June and Rick fall in love, fulfilling Waller's intention to attain leverage over both of them. Meanwhile, Waller sends people to locate the tomb in which June was possessed and find the spirit's \"heart\", the only thing capable of controlling it. Once in Waller's possession, she has the power to control the Enchantress.\n\nWhen Waller approaches the government for approval to form the Task Force X, June accompanies her to turn herself into the Enchantress in front of the committee to convince the members of the use of harnessing criminals and metahumans for military purposes. She uses her teleportation abilities to warp to Iran and obtain a highly sought-after file containing the Iranian nuclear arsenal inventory as a gift to impress the otherwise terrified staff. Waller is then given their authorization.[1]\n\nTo help convince Amanda Waller's decision of the team's structure, Enchantress was tasked with looking into the histories of the most prominent members for the Task Force X. Upon being summoned, the Enchantress used sorcery to glimpse the past, and revealed the secret lives of Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang and Katana, mentioning that Katana was the most suitable candidate. The Enchantress warned them that it was cruel to use the candidates despite everything they suffered, but Waller did not care and forced her to transform back into June Moone.[2]\n\nSoon after, June transforms into the Enchantress during her sleep while in Midway City. As this happened, she made Rick Flag hallucinate seeing June Moone on her deathbed, forcing him to keep his mouth shut about her plans. She teleports away to Waller's room and opens another vial, which contains the spirit of her brother Incubus. She goes to Midway City and incapacitates a man, Gerard Davis, in the subway for Incubus to use as a host once she releases him. She tells him to wait and build up his powers. When the time came, Incubus attacked the Midway City subway, absorbing many people to restore his true form and destroying trains. The efforts of the U.S. military and local police to \"contain\" him failed dramatically, with the first responders were wiped out by Incubus' tentacles.[1]\n\nWaller then sends June Moone and Rick Flag to destroy Incubus, but the attempt turns into an opportunity for Enchantress to escape and join her brother instead. Although without her heart, and thus unable to bring the full extent of her powers to bear, Enchantress is saved from an apparent death under Waller's hands and is restored to her more healthy form by her brother sharing his power with her. She is then more than capable enough to begin creating her army and an extremely powerful mystical superweapon. Stepping outside, she begins channeling arcs of lightning into the sky. While Incubus continues to wreak havoc in the city and destroy the military's attacks against them, he also contributes to the superweapon by lifting the wreckage of buildings and destroyed military equipment to the \"ring\" now hovering above Midway City. The military is soon forced to evacuate and call up the rest of the Task Force X against this new threat.\n\nHaving created monstrous Eyes of the Adversary minions by converting humans in Midway City, Enchantress dispatched them to capture Amanda Waller. After her helicopter was taken down, Incubus ordered that he be brought his sister's heart, which he proceeded to levitate into her chest. Absorbing it and the power to finally finish her weapon, Enchantress began breathing intensely, her eyes only flitting open when Waller was brought directly before her by a demon. When she refused to comply and goaded her to show her her worst, Enchantress ignored her and attached the woman to her superweapon, to destroy the armies and weapons of the modern world. Without resistance, she would be able to take over the world again.[1]\n\nOnce Task Force X arrives, Enchantress attempts to convince them to ally themselves with her to be granted their desires. She compounds her offer with telepathic visions placed into the minds of Rick Flag, Harley Quinn, Deadshot, and El Diablo, but Diablo can power through his vision, having come to terms with his accidental murder of his family. Surprised at Diablo's exceptional mental fortitude, Enchantress calls upon Incubus to force the Squad to bow to her. Enchantress watched as El Diablo transformed into a huge flaming avatar to battle her brother. Then, Rick Flag had the bomb she abandoned earlier detonate, killing both Diablo and incubus. Somewhat weakened without her brother, a devastated Enchantress reverts to her ashier previous form, to defeat the group herself.\n\nWhile the Squad was initially able to somewhat hold their own against the witch, Enchantress ultimately got tired of their resistance and telekinetically knocked their weapons away, offering them a final chance to serve her. Harley Quinn appeared interested, wondering if she could bring back the Joker, who seemed to have been killed in a helicopter crash. Enchantress claimed that she could resurrect him, and happily accepted Harley's servitude, but was subsequently taken by surprise when Harley cut out her heart with Katana's sword, giving Rick Flag and the Squad a chance to destroy the superweapon. A weakened Enchantress desperately attempted to stop Deadshot from shooting down her superweapon by giving him a vision of his daughter Zoe Lawton begging him not to make the shot. Deadshot, however, managed to tearfully power through the vision and brought the superweapon down with a single shot.[1]\n\nA fallen Enchantress begs Katana to kill and thus reunite her in death with Incubus. Flag, however, holds Katana back and orders Enchantress to return June Moone's body to her, threatening to otherwise kill her (by crushing her heart), but the witch refused. A devastated Flag recalls June's plea to kill her if that means destroying Enchantress, so he tearfully crushes Enchantress' heart, killing the witch once and for all. Moments later, June Moone emerges, ripping Enchantress' skin and clothes off of herself.[1]\n\nBecause of her \"godly\" status in the world, Enchantress developed a God-complex, having been worshiped as a deity over the years in various places. Because of this, she was very eager to conquer the modern world with her mystical powers. Her personality prior to being betrayed and imprisoned is unknown, but she was worshipped along with her brother by the global population and they work well together as leaders so it can be assumed she was a benevolent and competent ruler. Like Incubus, Enchantress was vastly confident in her ability to renew and redeem humankind and this coupled with her powers made her fearless and gave her extreme pride in her status as one of the oldest living metahumans, making her confidence reach the point of arrogance following her return and inducing her to take into account that people worshiped her. Thus, she took great pleasure in showing off her powers (such as when she treated her unwilling clash with Task Force X like it was a deadly dance) and firmly believed that it is the metahumans' destiny to inherit the Earth from their human oppressors, believing that the events of recent years are a sign that they are ready to rise against those who cage them.\n\nAlthough she did not hesitate to do what was necessary to cleanse and renew the world and thus showed no remorse for using June as a vessel or bringing down modern constructs, Enchantress only did anything harsh or questionable to serve the greater good, being aware sacrifices would have to be made for evolution, and as a result she did not exercise violence needlessly, as best shown with her ignoring Waller's taunts and simply knocking her out and throwing her aside, and even demonstrated a more tender side to her such as when she softly held Incubus as she explained what was going on, politely encouraged Task Force X to come talk to her directly, and encouraged Harley she was a woman of her word (being unaware her loyalty to her and her sentiment towards her boyfriend were both smokescreens). Because of her empathy for the descendants of her loyal subjects, Enchantress was willing to allow certain humans, provided that they were useful or amusing, such as Deadshot or Harley Quinn to have high places in her otherwise metahuman-filled ranks and even was willing to make offers to them (such as her offer to Harley to resurrect her presumed deceased lover), provided they agreed to join her and accept her as their mistress. Sadly, it was because of her mercy that she was relatively easily outsmarted by the cunning, yet far less powerful Harley Quinn, which allowed Enchantress to be defeated.\n\nInevitably, Enchantress was vastly intelligent and had a well-managed temper. Despite being around for a few weeks at best, she seemed to understand modern curse words and romantic slang. She was also cunning, creating a large army of humans whom she converted into Eyes of the Adversary, the better to bring people under her control. She also managed to use Rick Flag's love for her host, June Moone, to keep him quiet about her vanishing (to free Incubus) by showing him a vision of June dying. Her plan to free Incubus and “bolt” during the early stages of Task Force X's deployment showed her skills as a tactician.\n\nEnchantress deeply loved her brother Incubus; they are about as close as two siblings can be and shared their ambition to revolutionize society. Although she tended to be ringleader, they still did just about everything together, with her helping him adjust to the 'new world' and trusting him enough to risk her neck leaving Waller knowing he reciprocated her love and was strong enough to save her. After Incubus' death at the hands of Task Force X, she was devastated and, upon her posterior defeat, expressed a desire to be reunited with him in death.\n\nDespite coming across on several occasions as being arrogant and selfish, Enchantress ultimately always had good intentions, as she genuinely believed that the actions of her and her brother were what was best for humanity, and for the sake of recreating civilization for them after destroying the one they had replaced their own with, to in their eyes cleanse a corrupted world. She also showed an almost informal disrespect for current world leaders who had taken the earth in her absence, sexually straddling a board member, frequently giving Waller dirty looks and mockingly asking her a rhetorical question about the way her “armies” could fall, and making Rick Flag hallucinate that June Moone was on her deathbed.\n\nApart from having a condescending and almost sassy attitude around her enemies, Enchantress had also shown to have had a very mischievous side to her such as the time when she deliberately pressed the button to live explosives only seconds after Rick Flag had instructed her how to detonate them before teleporting away while laughing. As well as caressing a board member condescendingly and deliberately jump scaring Gerard Davis for seemingly no reason other than her amusement by appearing in a bathroom mirror before grabbing his head and smashing it into a mirror, all before transferring her brother's mind and soul into his body. All of this indicates that the Enchantress had a very twisted sense of humor. She even showed a childlike excitement to restore the old ways and laughs excitedly before flying into June's mouth and later looked astounded by her own physical transmutation just before the revolution began.\n\nCuriously, Enchantress refers on two occasions to intending to “wipe out” humanity despite frequently mentioning she wanted to resume her reign over them. Her reasons for such phrasing were unclear, although it is definitely possible her anger towards the people for falling without her may have simply manifested in this choice of words showing she was clearly still hurt by her past regarding whomever turned on her and her brother.\n\nHomo Magi Physiology: Enchantress is a fearsome inter-dimensional mystical being, allowing her to manipulate vast amounts of magical energies for a variety of effects, such as manipulating matter and casting powerful spells, due to these mystical abilities Amanda Waller claims that Enchantress and her brother are the most powerful metahumans that she has ever come across, with Enchantress nearly overpowering the combined might of Task Force X single-handedly. However, while extremely powerful, and although she was worshiped as a goddess by the ancient Pre-Columbian Maya and Incas, Enchantress was notably not quite as powerful as an actual Old God or as Superman.",
