  "content": "Doomsday was a mutant creature of the Kryptonian race, created by Lex Luthor with the use of the Genesis Chamber from the corpse of General Dru-Zod, in order to defeat both Batman and Superman. However, they, with the help of Wonder Woman, killed the beast, but even with its apparent death, Doosmday also killed Superman.\n\nCreated as a contingency plan for his goal of killing Superman if Batman were to fail, Lex Luthor entered the Genesis Chamber of Scout Ship 0344 using the fingerprints of General Dru-Zod and his Command Key, assuming undaunted control for his procedure. He ordered to be taught all of the knowledge from 100,000 alien worlds that the starship's archive contained. Among the tremendous amount of new knowledge Lex gained, he learned of an ancient Kryptonian monster and promptly decided to re-create it, as a final contingency plan.\n\nTo begin the lengthy process, Lex brought in Zod's corpse into the Genesis Chamber, cutting his palm, and pouring his blood onto Zod's face. The starship warned Lex that re-creating the fearsome monster was forbidden by the Kryptonian Law Council, but Lex noted that the council was long gone, along with its destroyed planet, and ordered the process to commence.[2]\n\nWhile the process was still going on, Luthor had Anatoli Knyazev kidnap Martha Kent, and then confronted Superman, presenting him with a horrible ultimatum, to force the alien superhero into a mortal duel with the equipped Batman. However, this plan ultimately failed, and Superman flew to the scout ship to confront Luthor. However, mere seconds after Superman came crashing through the starship's building (while Batman simultaneously had saved Martha Kent from Knyazev's men), the birthing process was complete, and Luthor gleefully proclaimed the monster to be \"Superman's doomsday,\" just as the massive monster smashed his way out of the Genesis Chamber's birthing matrix. Luthor gleefully added that now Superman was \"as good as dead.\"\n\nDoomsday unleashed a thunderous roar and hurled a monstrous punch at Luthor. However, the punch was intercepted by Superman, who blocked and countered with a blow of his own. The battling duo then proceeded to break out of the Fortress, continuing their mortal duel.[2]\n\nDoomsday broke free of the scout ship and leaped into Heroes Park. Superman pursued Doomsday, and the two battled, with Doomsday destroying the Superman Statue in the process. Doomsday's strength surpassed Superman's, but he had managed to hold his own and sent the creature flying into a building. Subsequently, Doomsday was fired at by military helicopters but is not harmed. He adapted to the fire and only became more durable.\n\nDoomsday was then launched into space by Superman. The US President then sent an order to shoot Doomsday down with a nuclear missile, carried out by General Swanwick. Seeing the missile approach, Superman defiantly held Doomsday still, determined to destroy the beast. The warhead hit with an explosion so gigantic, that it can be seen from Earth's surface.\n\nFalling back to Earth on Stryker's Island, Doomsday was far from dead. The explosion only made the creature stronger as his body regenerated and mutated, with the creature developing bony protrusions and a larger physique. After Doomsday saw Batman circling around him in his Batwing, he proceeded to fire his damning blasts at him which the Dark Knight was able to avoid before disappearing from sight. The Batwing would later return minutes later firing powerful ordnance at Doomsday, greatly angering him. With the Batwing flying away, Doomsday followed Batman from Stryker's Island to an abandoned port in Gotham City, eventually cornering Batman. Doomsday shot his blasts at  him but were blocked  by Wonder Woman. Recovered himself, Superman shot from Earth's orbit and  charged at Doomsday, sending the beast flying where it collided with a chemical silo, leading to a massive explosion. Not able to contain the influx of power within its body, it unleashed it as a destructive wave of energy that levelled the port, with the Trinity withstanding the blast. Emerging from the rubble and flames, Doomsday grimaced in anger, with deadly intent.\n\nSuperman and Wonder Woman then proceeded to attack Doomsday in tandem, while Batman tried to expose the monster to the Kryptonite gas. Superman then left to save Lois Lane from drowning and retrieved Batman's Kryptonite Spear. Batman was successful in exploiting Doomsday's only known vulnerability. Seeing her chance, Wonder Woman attacked and managed to cut off the creature's arm with the Sword of Athena. However, it only resulted in a tremendously sharp skeletal protrusion growing back in its place.[2]\n\nWonder Woman managed to temporarily restrain Doomsday with her lasso. Superman saw that the only way to stop Doomsday was to risk his own life. He charged at the creature, exposed to the Kryptonite himself, and impales Doomsday in the chest with the Kryptonite Spear. However, the spear did not manage to fully pierce Doomsday and he was able to impale Superman in return, piercing his chest with the bone protrusion on his arm. A mortally wounded Superman was undeterred by his impending death, and he used his last reserves of strength to further impale Doomsday and managed to fully push it through the other side, finally killing the monster, though himself dying in the process. With a final bellow of agony, the now lifeless bodies of hero and monster collapsed upon the ground.[2]\n\nDoomsday is an extremely ferocious monstrous being with an insatiable bloodlust, desire for destruction and carnage, which makes him a nearly unstoppable threat of apocalyptic proportions. However, due to Doomsday's feral mind, he, therefore, has limited intelligence, being unable to tell the difference between friend and foe, attempting to kill his creator Lex Luthor right after emerging from the Genesis Chamber, and he thus owes allegiance to no one but himself. Therefore, while incredibly dangerous, Doomsday was relatively quickly outsmarted by Batman, who baited the monster into following him, which allowed Wonder Woman to get a hold of Doomsday with her lasso, which allowed Batman to momentarily weaken the monster with a Kryptonite gas grenade, which, in turn, gave Superman the opening he needed to deliver the killing blow to Doomsday, with the Kryptonite Spear. However, Doomsday's incredible bloodlust allowed the monster to murder Superman as well, just as he was dying. It appears that Doomsday's feral rage comes from the unbridled negative and destructive emotions inherent in both Lex Luthor and General Zod.\n\nMutated Hybrid Physiology: Doomsday, due to being the genetic amalgamation of General Dru-Zod, a Kryptonian, and Lex Luthor, a human, is a terrifyingly powerful being of potentially apocalyptic proportions, thereby (along with Zeus and Darkseid) being one of the only known beings to surpass the power and might of Superman himself. Thus, Lex Luthor creates him for the sole purpose of killing Superman, naming the monster \"[Superman's] doomsday,\" and claiming that Superman was \"as good as dead\" if he were to fight Doomsday. Indeed, the monstrous juggernaut's unparalleled might forced Superman to team up against it with Wonder Woman and Batman to stand a chance, yet even that was insufficient, as Doomsday's ability to \"evolve\" and regenerate at a rapid pace made him impossible to be brought down with brute force alone, so while Superman managed to ultimately bring him down with a Kryptonite Spear, he only succeeded by dying himself in the process.",
