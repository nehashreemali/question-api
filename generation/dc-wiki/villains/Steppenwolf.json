  "content": "Steppenwolf was a powerful New God and the former herald of Darkseid, his nephew and lord of Apokolips. After betraying Darkseid to their enemies, Steppenwolf was exiled and tasked with conquering one hundred fifty thousand worlds in Darkseid's name. After the death of Superman awoke the lost Mother Boxes on Earth, Steppenwolf answered their call and arrived in Themyscira, reclaiming the box held by the Amazons, and began his conquest of the world.\n\nDuring his continued assault, Steppenwolf was opposed by the combined efforts of the Justice League, a team of the world's heroes who united together to protect the world, but soon discovered the presence of the Anti-Life Equation hidden in the world's crust and alerted the armada of Apokolips. However, with the aid of a newly resurrected Superman, Steppenwolf was unable to complete the Unity of the Mother Boxes and was slain by Wonder Woman.\n\nSteppenwolf was born on Apokolips and served as a General in the armada of Parademons led by Darkseid, his nephew and Lord. However, Steppenwolf betrayed Darkseid to enemies who wanted to seize the throne of Apokolips, but he later turned on the would-be usurpers, defeating them in the hope of correcting his error. Still, due to his betrayal, he was exiled from his home and tasked with conquering 150,000 worlds for his penance.[1]\n\nFollowing the Showdown in Gotham Port, the Mother Boxes that were lost during Darkseid's defeat by the ancient defenders of Earth awoke after sensing the death of Superman, calling out to Apokolips once more. Answering their call, Steppenwolf opened a boom tube to the box held in the Penetralium on Themyscira and arrived with a swarm of Parademons to retrieve the box.\n\nHowever, Steppenwolf was faced by Hippolyta and the Amazons, who restrained the him while the Queen escaped with the Mother Box and sunk the cage into the ocean below, but the New God quickly broke free and leaped onto the island in pursuit, killing many of the warriors with his Electro Axe before pinning the final one beneath her horse, claiming his prize as he watched Hippolyta comfort the dying warrior. As the legions of Themyscira arrived, loosing arrows at the invader, Steppenwolf lamented that the Great Darkness was upon the world before departing through a boom tube to Pozharnov, Russia, to turn it into a stronghold for his mission.\n\nSettling in a nearby nuclear silo, Steppenwolf placed the returned Mother Box within a monolith, using it to call to DeSaad, high priest and torturer of Darkseid, reporting that the world was too divided to protect itself from his forces and would soon be claimed for the Great One, as he had sent his Parademons out in search of the remaining boxes while he constructed his stronghold. Steppenwolf asked if he may make a plea to their Lord to return after he would have captured the Earth, but DeSaad rebuked him, reminding him that he still had another 50,000 worlds to capture in His name and his plea would only be heard once he was finished. Defeated, Steppenwolf reassured the world's demise, left without the protection of the Green Lantern Corps or Superman to oppose him.[1]\n\nSteppenwolf captured several Atlanteans to discover the location of the Mother Box. The Atlanteans refused to tell him, so he used a device to project their memories and discovered the location. Steppenwolf transported himself with his Boom Tube to the Atlantean Mother Box Stronghold. He killed several Atlanteans guarding the Box, and Mera used her powers over water to hold him at bay for a time. Steppenwolf was about to kill her, but Aquaman arrived and caught his axe mid-swing. While Aquaman initially had the upper hand in the following fight, Steppenwolf was able to overpower him and take the Mother Box before leaving.\n\nHe then set up the second Mother Box along with the first. After touching the second Mother Box, he received a vision similar to Darkseid's first invasion of Earth 5000 years prior and discovered that the Anti-Life Equation was on the planet. He summoned DeSaad and told him of what he had seen. Darkseid then told Steppenwolf that he would be welcomed back on Apokolips if he successfully conquered Earth and that he would arrive after the conquest to take the Anti-Life Equation for himself.[1]\n\nSteppenwolf had his Parademons take anyone with the scent of the Mother Box hostage, including Silas Stone, holding them all in an underground passage under Gotham Harbor. Steppenwolf began interrogating Howard Jensen, but Stone spoke up, causing the New God's attention to turn to him. He began the interrogations, but Cyborg intercepted him, blasting the god.\n\nWonder Woman also jumped in and Steppenwolf told his Parademons to handle the others as he would fight her alone. The two were on even terms for most of the fight; however, Steppenwolf eventually seemed to strive the Amazon princess backwards. Catching the missile fired by Cyborg in the Knightcrawler, Steppenwolf directed it towards the wall, opening a hole to the harbor and flooding the area before using a boom tube to flee.\n\nWhen the heroes awakened the Mother Box to revive Superman, Steppenwolf arrived to take it. He followed Silas Stone into S.T.A.R. Labs but was interrupted by Cyborg. The god quickly knocked the hero away as his father hit the Mother Box with a laser, dying in the process. Steppenwolf then took the final Mother Box and used a boom tube to leave, not knowing that the S.T.A.R. Labs scientist had super-heated the box so the heroes could track it.[1]\n\nAfter Batman managed to disable the barrier around Pozharnov, Steppenwolf ordered the Parademons to kill the heroes while the Unity was completed. Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Cyborg managed to get to Steppenwolf and work together to fight him. Once the battle expired a certain time, Steppenwolf knocked Wonder Woman and Aquaman back. When Wonder Woman created an opening, Cyborg got to the Unity and began hacking them.\n\nHe called the Flash to give him a boost in power, but Steppenwolf stopped him before he could give the signal. Superman then arrived and prevented Steppenwolf from killing Cyborg, and destroyed his axe. The Kryptonian began to fight Steppenwolf, and though he fought back, it was clear that he was no match for Superman, who absolutely dominated the battle, which ended with the Kryptonian cutting off one of the New God's horns with his heat vision. Before Steppenwolf was defeated, a boom tube to Apokolips opened and the Unity was completed, killing all the heroes aside from the Flash, who reversed time to give them a second chance.[1]\n\nUltimately, Steppenwolf was defeated by the combined efforts of the Justice League. Caught in the rage of his defeat, he left himself open to be impaled by Aquaman from behind. Superman then punched him to the Boom Tube and he was decapitated by Wonder Woman as he flew through, killing him and ending the invasion.\n\nAs his corpse landed on Apokolips, an enraged Darkseid stepped on his severed head, breaking off his remaining horn, and his glowing eyes power down. After the boom tube closed, DeSaad told Darkseid that he warned him that Steppenwolf would fail, to which Darkseid agreed. Yet Darkseid pointed out that even with Steppenwolf's failure, his efforts had already yielded the discovery of Anti-Life Equation's location, which meant that the forces of Apokolips would still be compelled to attempt another invasion of Earth. Thus, Darkseid ordered Desaad to ready their armada in preparation for their second invasion.[1]\n\nSteppenwolf was extremely loyal to Darkseid and feared him greatly due to the immense power he has. He would go to extreme lengths to regain his nephew's respect by assimilating and destroying tens of thousands of worlds. Though he only wished to redeem himself and be reunited back at Apokolips, Steppenwolf did display emotions of anger, humility, twisted enjoyment and even sadness. When DeSaad repeatedly interrupted and reminded Darkseid's uncle of his debt, there was visible resentment and even a moment of defiance, when Steppenwolf pointed back at DeSaad when he told him of the discovery of the Anti-Life Equation. Steppenwolf was also a raging monster who has little control over his emotions and is seen being visibly frustrated at Superman's domination over him.",
