  "content": "David Kane, also known as Black Manta, was a mercenary and the son of the late Jesse Kane. Formerly the second-in-command of a pirate crew led by his father, he came into conflict with Aquaman after the latter refused to save his father's life. Upon allying with Orm Marius of Atlantis and receiving experimental Atlantean technology, David combined the Atlantean weaponry with his own equipment to create a powerful battle suit to combat his new enemy. Despite this, he was defeated during a skirmish in Sicily, but survived and was found by Stephen Shin, a scientist obsessed with the existence of Atlantis and plotted to find a new way to kill Aquaman. He created a crew consisting of him, Dr. Shin and Stingray. They eventually find the Black Trident which results in Black Manta being possessed by Kordax.\n\nOver a period of months using the capabilities of the ancient trident, Manta secured enough Atlantean technology to repair his suit and wage a personal war against his long time nemesis, forcing Aquaman to need the help of his brother in order to defeat him. Manta's campaign ultimately culminated in a confrontation within the Lost Kingdom of Necrus. After a grueling battle between himself, Aquaman, Mera, and a reformed Orm Marius, he was finally defeated and deprived of the abilities of the Black Trident. Following the defeat of Kordax and the subsequent destruction of the Lost Kingdom, David found himself hanging from a ravine. Aquaman offered him a chance to save his life, the choice he never gave his father, but David refused, instead willingly falling to his death as he would never accept the help from the man who let his father die.\n\nDavid Kane was a pirate like his father, Jesse Kane, and at some point in time, he learned about Aquaman and wanted to encounter him. During their pirating career, he helped his father's crew steal a high-tech submarine owned by the United States Navy to aid in their operations. In 2018, their crew took over a Russian submarine and killed many sailors aboard, with David personally executing the captain. As they were celebrating their apparent victory, Jesse presented him with a special knife.\n\nInitially, David scoffed at it, calling it a piece of junk, and the love of \"[his father's] life\"; but when Jesse told him about how it belonged to his grandfather, who fought in World War II as one of the Navy's first \"frogmen\" (code-named \"Manta\" for his stealthiness), he immediately changed his mind, and accepted the blade. Suddenly, they were interrupted by Arthur Curry, known as Aquaman. David proclaimed that he expected to eventually face the Aquaman but was quickly defeated by the Atlantean and easily subdued after a brief fight.\n\nAquaman deflected a rocket from Jesse, that caused a torpedo to topple over him, trapping him as the submarine became flooded. David begged Aquaman for help but was told that they kill innocents and should not expect mercy from the ocean. David tried to save his father, but his father committed suicide by using a hand grenade. David was forced to flee and started to bear a deep grudge against Aquaman.[1][2]\n\nSometime after his father's death, David was contacted by King Orm Marius, who paid him for the staged attack his crew launched on Nereus. David demanded that Aquaman should be killed, as he was responsible for Jesse's death, but Orm shrugged it off and assured David that Aquaman wasn't one of them. Still hellbent on getting revenge on Aquaman, David allied with the Atlantean king.\n\nOrm informed David that human weaponry would be useless against Aquaman and provided him with Atlantean weaponry and was given multiple soldiers so he could launch an attack against Aquaman.\n\nDavid took the Atlantean weaponry and merged it with his diving suit, making it a specialized battle armor to fight Aquaman. In particular, David took a plasma beam cannon and installed it into his helmet, however, the helmet was melted during a test firing of the plasma beam. David made the helmet significantly bigger to circumvent the problem. Once the battle suit was completed, he painted it black and dubbed himself \"Black Manta\" in honor of his late father and family legacy.\n\nBlack Manta, along with Murk and the Men-of-War, ambushed Aquaman and Mera in Sicily, Italy. Black Manta attacked Aquaman while the soldiers chased Mera. Aquaman identified Black Manta as the same pirate from the submarine, which Black Manta confirmed. Black Manta used his enhanced strength provided by the suit and Atlantean weaponry as well as Aquaman's preference to ensure the safety of civilians to overpower and wound Aquaman numerous times,\n\nbut Aquaman ultimately managed to come out on top, damaging his suit, making it malfunction before throwing a pair of chain stone balls directly into Black Manta's helmet, causing it to explode and throwing David off a cliff.[1]\n\nUnbeknownst to Arthur or Mera, David survived, though his Black Manta suit was badly damaged from the fight. He was stranded on the ocean until Dr. Stephen Shin, a scientist obsessed with finding Atlantis, saved him. Shin asks David how he got the technology, and David says he will if he tells him how to find Arthur. David then throws the Manta Knife at a photo of a silhouetted man with a question mark reads, “Who is Aquaman?”.[1]\n\nOver the next couple of years, David would rebuild his crew, recruiting members such as Stingray from Brill's crew and Dr. Shin in his quest for vengeance against Aquaman. Using Shin's research they began scouring Ancient Atlantean sites across the globe looking for new technology that would help him rebuild his broken suit.[3]\n\nOne such expedition using Shin's research led the team to the frozen tundra of Antarctica where sensor anomalies indicated something hidden beneath the surface. David was frustrated at the lack of progress and that his quest for vengeance could not be fulfilled. While scanning the area, Shin and a colleague fell into a crevasse and were subsequently attacked by an undead creature which had been previously frozen in the ice. Only Shin survived and sent a transmission which David and his crew responded to. He sarcastically mocked Shin by asking him what happened. Him and his team then suited up to dive into the deep waters beneath them where he suspected the Atlantean Ruin to be. On their way down it was noted that these were much larger ruins than they ever had discovered before, unbeknownst to the crew they had infiltrated the Lost Kingdom of Necrus, frozen for millennia beneath the ice using a blood spell.\n\nThey were soon attacked by the same creature, killing many of them. David attempted to fight it off using his blade but it swiped him away and he fell to the bottom of the ocean floor. There upon awakening he discovered the broken pieces of the Black Trident lying on the seabed. Suddenly, a disembodied voice began communicating with him. Promising him power and a way to finally enact his vengeance upon Aquaman and his family. David took the two halves and reforged the Trident, the disembodied voice then began to possess him. Granting him a vision of the future he seeks and the figure communicating with him frozen in the ice. David soon blacked out. He woke up back in the icy cave having been rescued by Shin and his men. David woke and immediately swiped at the air with his father's knife. Only to realize there was nothing there. It was then he saw the two halves of the Trident at his feet, proving his vision to be real. Shin questioned him on his discovery to which David prompted that this will give him what he seeks. Black Manta was reborn and now possessed by the spirit of the undead Kordax, allowing him to rebuild his armor.\n\nOver the next five months, David would scour depositories of Orichalcum, an ancient mineral used by Necrus, in order to power a furnace located inside his base on the South Pacific Island of Devil's Deep all the while using the knowledge granted to him by Kordax. To that end him and his crew commandeered an ancient Atlantean Submarine and a fleet of Octobots capable of transporting the mineral. Their next target was inside the stronghold of Atlantis itself. Stingray and Stephen Shin remained onboard the Submarine while David and two crewmen took the Octobots inside the ancient refinery where the mineral was stored.\n\nThe heist was successful, but attracted the attention of Mera, Atlanna and the Atlantean guards, who pursued David and the other Octobots. The Submarine itself would come under the attention of the Atlantean Hydrocannons, but the Hydrocannons were taken out by the Submarine's sonic cannon, causing civilian casualties. The remaining Octobots loaded the Orichalcum into the Submarine after losing Atlanna, but David's Octobot was taken down by Mera, who managed to break open the windshield. But not five seconds later did David fire his suit's lasers at Mera, sending her into a rock column and severely burning her. Stephen then radioed David that the Orichalcum is secured on the Submarine, and that they should go, but David decided to kill Mera, but before he could do so, Aquaman arrived to protect his wife. David then shamed Aquaman for first taking his brother's throne, then Mera. The two then fought each other, until Stephen radioed again, warning David of the Atlantean army approaching. David then swam to the Submarine, but Aquaman followed close behind, until David ordered Stingray to fire the sonic cannon, causing Aquaman to be blasted back, as David made his escape with the Orichalcum.\n\nWhen Arthur Curry and Orm Marius came to Devil's Deep to find out where David Kane was, they were confronted by the Black Manta.\n\nOne night, while Tom Curry and his grandson, Arthur Curry Jr, were without power, Black Manta came in and ended up kidnapping Arthur Jr.\n\nBeing a pirate, David Kane was a cruel, ruthless individual who didn't hesitate to kill those who stood in his way. Initially obsessed with treasure, David was willing to conspire with King Orm and help him declare war with the surface as long as he was paid. Despite his cold nature, however, David greatly valued his family lineage, as he immediately treasured his grandfather's knife after learning about it and had a very close relationship with his father. When Jesse Kane was in danger, David desperately begged his enemy Aquaman to save him and initially refused to leave his father behind. David's vendetta against Aquaman was purely based around avenging his father's death. After Aquaman caused Jesse's death, David developed an intense hatred towards Aquaman and vowed to kill him.\n\nUpon becoming Black Manta after the death of his father, David became bloodthirsty, ruthless, and heartless; completely devoted on nothing but murdering the Aquaman at all cost. His hatred for Aquaman was so intense, he did not care if allying with Orm to kill him resulted in the surface world being sunk and humanity perishing. A world without his father meant nothing to him and rebuffed Orm's offer for a reward saying that the goal of the mission to kill Aquaman would be his reward. Black Manta never held back, as observed when he continuously attacked Aquaman until a hit was landed, leaving the Atlantean-hybrid on the defense through most of their battle and relentlessly attacking Arthur ignoring the damage his suit had taken during the battle. When having the upper-hand on Aquaman, Black Manta often taunted his mortal enemy. During the Orichalcum Heist David sarcastically remarked to Aquaman that he had stolen not only his brother's throne but his wife as well.\n\nThroughout the years David became more determined than ever to finally avenge his father. Rebuilding his crew and recruiting Dr. Shin in order to find Atlantean points of interest using his research. The partnership between Shin and Kane was intense though not without some mercy on David's part. While single minded in goal he treated his own crew amicably, relying on both Stingray and Shin in order to defend him from Aquaman during the raid on the Orichalcum vault. David was looking for a way to rebuild his battle suit in order to achieve his goal though ultimately, would go to no lengths in order to kill Aquaman once and for all, even killing his entire family.\n\nAfter receiving the Black Trident, David became possessed by the spirit of the undead King Kordax. While this greatly enhanced his physical abilities it also affected his personality. As a result he became even more bloodthirsty and barbaric. Believing absolutely that anything was worth avenging his father and killing Aquaman, even if that meant destroying the world. To that end he made a deal with the devil and began communing with Kordax who promised him the power he finally needed to achieve his goal. When granted the opportunity to inflict pain upon his enemy, David took the chance at killing Mera, knowing it would cause Aquaman pain. When realizing that a blood sacrifice was needed to release Kordax from his tomb, he kidnapped the infant son of Arthur Curry in order to cause Aquaman pain, wholly prepared to sacrifice the baby in order to gain more power. His hatred was so great that he burned down Curry's childhood home and stabbed his father, though non-lethally and kidnapped his one and only child, in order to inflict the maximum pain that he could. Once deprived of the Trident and Kordax's possession, David showed no remorse and still attempted to kill Aquaman, only to be brutally defeated by the latter. When his own life was in danger and Curry offered to save him, David refused, instead choosing to fall to his own death, preferring to die than to accept help from the man who let his father die.",
