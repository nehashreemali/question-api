  "content": "Orm Marius is the former king of Atlantis, the second son of Atlanna, and the younger half-brother of Arthur Curry. As the former ruler of Atlantis, Orm is a skilled warrior who sought to unite the Seven Kingdoms as the Ocean Master against the surface world, due to humanity's continued pollution and mistreatment of the seas throughout history. Despite his efforts, he ultimately failed to succeed in this undertaking and was finally defeated and apprehended by his half-brother, who usurped Orm's throne to become the King of Atlantis, with Marius being taken into custody and eventually imprisoned beneath the Kingdom of the Deserters. Although Marius initially attempted to escape, his efforts were gradually foiled by the Deserters, who continously kept him captive and eventually caused Marius to change his mind about his supposed destiny as ruler of Atlantis.\n\nFollowing Black Manta's search for Orichalcum, Marius was forced to escape from his prison and join Curry on his journey to stop Manta. In the midst of their journey, Marius and Curry learned to trust each other, beginning to get along better. After discovering Manta's plans to free Kordax by thawing the glaciers of Antarctica, Marius and the Atlantis army fought the undead army in the Kingdom of Necrus to save Curry  and Mera's son. With Kordax and Manta dead, Orm managed to redeem himself, accepting Curry as his brother and the true king of Atlantis, and decided to live on the surface to learn the terrestrial customs.\n\nBorn to King Orvax and Queen Atlanna of Atlantis, Orm was raised alongside Princess Mera of Xebel and became a great warrior under the guidance of chief counselor Nuidis Vulko. At some point during his childhood, Orvax discovered that Atlanna sired a half-human son before their marriage and banished her to the Trench, for which Orm placed the blame on Arthur. While Atlanna taught her second son that the land and sea could co-exist, he eventually developed a strong hatred for the surface after this event and witnessing the damage they inflict on the oceans, which poisons Atlanteans.[1] Orvax began to educate Orm, turning him into a skilled warrior who would eventually become the King of Atlantis. In the midst of his training, Orvax roughly raised Orm, preventing him from crying, as no child of his should show weakness.[2]\n\nAfter taking his father's place on the throne, Orm began devising a master plan that would both unite the seven kingdoms and destroy the surface in one fell swoop. Besides his loyal duties, Orm participated in the Atlantean war sports, becoming the undefeated champion in trident combat by winning five times throughout his youth and also earning the title of 8th Dan Nautilus in unarmed Xebel-fu combat, Orm participated in a unknown war using the trident as his own weapon, earning the Coral Heart medal and dubbed a war hero.[1]\n\nWhen the New God general Steppenwolf began to abduct Atlantean guards near the Atlantean Stronghold in the hope of finding the Atlantean Mother Box, King Orm chose to focus on fanning the war with the surface, perpetuating lies during that time. Thus, the Atlantean forces could not mount an effective defense against Steppenwolf when he finally broke into the Atlantean Stronghold with the Mother Box. However, Arthur Curry, along with the Justice League, managed to defeat Steppenwolf and save Atlantis.[3]\n\nTo carry out his plan and become Ocean Master, Orm had to obtain the support of at least four kingdoms of Atlantis, so he hired the aquatic mercenaries David and Jesse Kane to hijack a submarine and organize a fake attack. Marius, accompanied by his Vizir Nuidis Vulko, summoned King Nereus of Xebel to the Council of Kings, in order to convince him to join him. However, Nereus brought up the rumors about his half-brother's existence, causing Marius to assert his allegiance belonged to the surface.\n\nSuddenly, Kane's hijacked submarine attacked the place, and after two missiles were launched, Marius went to the rescue of Nereus, who was stuck in the rubble. Marius then mounted his Tylosaur and wielded his trident to attack the submarine, while he was saved by Nereus from being hit with another missile. Marius embedded the trident into the submarine, causing it to plummet, angering Nereus at the attack, who agreed to join Marius, helping him orchestrate several tsunami attacks towards the surface.[1]\n\nAs part of his deal with David Kane, Marius sent a unit of Men-of-War, presenting himself to him in the form of a water projection, concluding his deal and delivering his payment, however, Kane refused to accept the payment. wanting to exact revenge on Arthur Curry for letting his father die, and Marius let him know that Curry wasn't one of his own, hanging up the call.\n\nUnknowingly, his fiancée, Princess Mera, fearing war would break out, brought Curry to Atlantis, but was taken under arrest for trespassing. Curry was brought before Marius, where Marius humiliated him for being of mixed race, showing him the atrocities that humanity did to the seas. Curry however confronted Marius, urging him to face off in the Combat of Kings, and Marius agreed, in order to prove that he was the true King of Atlantis.[1]\n\nBefore facing Arthur, Marius talked with Mera, where he gave her a bracelet that belonged to Atlanna, but Mera claimed that Atlanna would not have liked her children to face each other to the death and start a war against the surface, but he mentioned that she was not there. When going out to fight, Marius told Curry the legend of the Karathen, giving him the opportunity to retire and never return to Atlantis, but he refused. When the Ring of Fire opened, Marius came out to initiate the Combat of Kings, presenting his half-brother to the people of Atlantis.\n\nMarius initiated the fight against Curry, who was using Atlanna's trident, with Marius attacking him with aquatic tactics and attempting to kill him, until both escalated the fight towards nearby structures, before descending towards the lava pit, but Curry boosted himself and pushed Curry. Marius, using his trident to throw a lava rock at him which Arthur was able to knock it over, so they both jumped, ready to hit each other.\n\nDue to the impact, Marius gained the advantage, elevating the duel towards the rocks, where he continued to fight Curry, attacking offensively. Marius soon used his trident to try to hit Curry, hitting his trident multiple times until he was destroyed. Declaring himself the true king, Marius prepared to kill Curry, but was attacked by Mera, who knocked him out of water, Marius then watched as Mera took Curry with her, angering him due to the betrayal.[1]\n\nUpset by the betrayal, Marius boarded a ship to pursue Mera and Arthur Curry, while Atlantean guards tried to shoot them, and before they crossed the border, Marius attacked the ship, redirecting its course, then passed close to it and watched in disgrace as Mera fled with Curry, watching as the border hydrocannons began to attack the fugitives, who managed to evade the rays. However, Marius led an attack on Mera's ship, which was blown off course into a nearby lava pit, plummeting and falling into the lava, and when they arrived, they only watched as the ship plunged into the lava, believing that Mera and Curry died.\n\nReturning to Atlantis, Marius continued with his plan to form an alliance with four of the Seven Kingdoms of Atlantis, so he headed for the Kingdom of the Fishermen along with Nereus and Nuidis Vulko. During the trip, Captain Murk managed to locate Atlanna's necklace that Mera was wearing in the Kingdom of the Deserters, discovering that they were still alive. With that, Marius ordered Murk to send an attack, but Nereus refused, threatening to break off their alliance if any harm fell upon Mera.\n\nVulko interrupted them to urge Marius to continue with his plan to form the alliance, which he agreed to, ordering Mera and Curry to be arrested. Before arriving in the Kingdom, Marius contacted David Kane again through the Men-of-War with a water projection, where he gave him Atlantean weaponry, including prototype armor and an experimental pistol that turned water into plasma bolts, also providing him with the soldiers, in order to kill Arthur Curry and Mera.[1]\n\nIn the Kingdom of the Fishermen, Marius, Nereus and Nuidis Vulko entered the Royal Palace of King Ricou, who expressed his dissatisfaction with the war, stating that when they decide to reveal themselves, it would be to educate the humans, but Marius called him a coward. to Ricou, imploring to join the alliance by stating that his realm was infested with poets and philosophers. Ricou took offense, trying to attack him, but Marius stepped forward, embeding his trident, killing him instantly.\n\nMarius decreed Princess Scales as his heir, asking her to prepare her army to head for the Kingdom of the Brine, in order to join their alliance by force as soon as possible. After the defeat of David Kane in Italy, Marius was informed by Vulko about Mera's location, but after Vulko expressed his loyalty to Marius, he decided to reveal to him about the betrayal he had been doing for years to the secretly training Arthur Curry to take the throne of Atlantis, so Vulko claimed that Curry was much more of a king than Marius could be, with Marius ordering Vulko to be arrested.[1]\n\nWith only the Kingdom of the Brine left to bring to heel, Orm led the full forces of Atlantis, Xebel, and the Fishermen kingdom into battle against the Brine. Before initiating the attack, Marius uttered a battle cry, proclaiming that on that day the Seven Kingdoms of Atlantis would unite, and the next they would destroy the surface, Marius proceeding to join the battle, riding a Tylosaur to attack the Brine army.\n\nMarius confronted the Brine King, who had one of his legs cut off, preparing to kill him, to which Nereus stopped him, reminding him that they would need him to complete their plan. Marius then offered the king a chance to join, but the king refused to swear allegiance to him, so Marius prepared to execute him. However, the floor of the place opened up, with the Karathen emerging from the earth's core, being ridden by Arthur Curry, who was wielding the Trident of Atlan.\n\nMarius then ordered his forces to focus their attacks on his brother, which could not against the Karathen that destroyed the Atlantean ships in its path with extreme ease, with Curry also using his powers to manipulate the sea creatures and turn them against the army. Marius was upset by his brother's attack, and approached Curry in an attempt to kill him, bumping into each other, where Marius chased Curry until he reached a platform on the surface.[1]\n\nMarius attempted to kill his half-brother, despite the latter wielding the Trident of Atlan, while the rest of the Atlantean army surfaced to watch. The two confronted each other to duel, in which Curry took the advantage by fighting with the trident, who subdued Marius towards the propellers of the platform, with Marius still refusing to cede the throne of Atlantis to him, so Arthur began to use a technique with the trident to use water as a shield and weapon. Enraged, Marius lunged at Curry, who took him down instantly, using his power to break Orvax's trident.\n\nWith Marius defeated, Curry pointed his trident at the neck of his half-brother, who asked him to kill him, however, Curry decided not to do it, stating that it did not belong to the customs of Atlantis. Surprisingly for Marius, Atlanna appeared in the middle of the fight, making him confused, who, confused, listened as his mother affirmed that both the land and the ocean were one world. Marius was then arrested by the Atlantean guard, under Nuidis Vulko's orders.[1]\n\nAfter being defeated, Orm was brought to trial in the presence of the now King Arthur Curry, Mera and the Council of Atlantis, who previously granted him the title of Ocean Master. As punishment, the Council decided to exile Orm to the Deserter Prison located in the Kingdom of the Deserters, denying him the right to any family visits and in chains, Orm was taken to the prison, where he would be guarded by the Deserter Remnants, survivors of the Sahara who, after the loss of water, fed on blood and became aggressively savage.[4]\n\nSoon afterwards, Marius was imprisoned at a secret Atlantean prison controlled by the Deserters, a race of individuals descended from the inhabitants of the Kingdom of the Deserters who had evolved with vampiric traits. The fact that Marius had previously sent his enemies to this secret prison was an ironic dynamic that Marius believed his enemies had purposefully done to punish and seek justice for his wrongdoings against them.\n\nFrom the moment Marius stepped foot in the prison, he memorized every step and detail despite having his eyesight purposefully obscured by his captors. Heat lamps designed to weaken him were placed upon him constantly dehydrating him. Yet Marius did not let these facts discourage him as he was already planning and preparing for his future escape.\n\nTo help himself prepare, Marius drew strength from memories of his father training him as a boy, while also envisioning his future plans about what he would do after breaking out. Marius also staged multiple failed \"escape attempts\" that were actually meant to help him steal and gather the material that he would need for his serious attempt at breaking out.\n\nFor over a period of several weeks or months, Marius waited, biding his time, caught up in unwanted visions and pangs of regret about the lengths he went to in his attempt to seize the Atlantean throne. Finally, when the time was right, Marius threw his plan into motion, whilst convincing himself that once he escaped and retook the throne, he would do better and try to right his wrongs.\n\nAs he was making his attempt, Marius killed and disabled a fair number of guards, evidently taking them by surprise. He capitalized on both his memories of entering the prison as well as plans for the prison facility that he learned during his time as ruler. As he finally opened the primary exit to the prison however, Marius discovered a number of armed guards awaiting him.\n\nCaught off guard, one of the guards explained that they had learned from previous escape attempts while also purposefully keeping certain secrets from the Atlantean government, mocking Marius as he did so. As the guards attacked and subdued him, Marius then seemed to come to grips with his situation, accepting the fact that he might never leave, that he was not in fact the right brother for the throne, and that he needed to suffer in order for those he had hurt to heal.[2]\n\nEver since that he was born, Orm Marius has been raised on the values of being a great king as well as been guided by Vulko to become a magnificent great warrior, allowing him to develop great skills of warfare. As Orm rose to the surface world to learn about it, he has become known to the massively great damage that the human race and the surface are causing to the Seven Seas with pollution, factories, and trash, driving him into developing a psychotic obsession to destroy them all including the surface world to save Atlantis from extinction.\n\nAfter the death of his parents, Orm has become the new king of Atlantis and began devising a wide master plan to destroy the Earth and humanity by uniting all of the kingdoms underneath the sea into a great war.\n\nRuthless, manipulative, bold and above all; powerful, arrogant and murderous, Orm has been doing multiple stages such as hiring the services of the human mercenary David Kane into killing his brother and manipulated King Nereus and others into assisting his war, becoming the \"Ocean Master\".\n\nNereus, of course, supported him but Mera has never wanted Orm as King, knowing full well his power fantasy would ruin everything he came across. Causing Orm great hatred for her, enough to send a personal detail to aid Black Manta in murdering her and Arthur behind Nereus' back; after the fact, his partner-in-crime demanded Orm bring him his daughter back unharmed. To this end, his rule can be described as both dictating and tyrannical, with a hint of hypocrisy to match as he shows no qualms in putting those who did not agree to his plans in place and even killed the Fishermen King just because he would not aid his genocidal war plans. All of this was for the ultimate goal of destroying the surface world by unleashing the wrath of the seven seas. Other contradictory evidence of his turnabout ways come in his needing a human; a race of beings whom he and his people hate with a venomous passion.\n\nTo do for him what he cannot do for himself, as was evident when enlisting the help of Black Manta to trigger his conflict or resolve things behind the backs of his people and/or confidantes. More to that point, Orm is willing to go around the backs of those whom he would call a partner to achieve his own goals, despite preaching about how he does what he does for all mariners while willingly turning his spear on anyone who dared not go along with his costly and genocidal scheme.\n\nMoreover, his blaming the half-brother whom he never really knew for their shared mother's demise. Despite it being his petty, spiteful, human-hating father and his equally bigoted subjects banishing her to the trench in the first place and not because of Arthur that they lost their beloved parent. Orm's ideal for global conflict also shows an extreme lack of hindsight or foresight on his part, as it never occurred to him that the surface dwellers had their silent guardians fighting on their behalf; few amongst who were more than powerful enough to dismantle him and his fleet of warmongers by their lonesome. Thus indicating Orm was supremely ignorant of their presence on land or egotistical to the point of suicidal overconfidence; his misguided sense of superiority making him believe Atlantis and its armies could best what are essentially Demi-Gods as easily as any surface-based military power. A testament to his phenomenal narcissism and self-righteousness reflects in how he relegates himself and his righteous rage against the surface as the Karathen, a legendary sea beast who protected the oceans at one time in Atlantis' past. Despite his many faults and fallacies, however, Orm is not purely evil by his nature, and his goal is not to seek power for himself by having Atlantis conquer Earth but instead, to save Atlantis from the damage the humans could potentially deal, in much the same way as the deceased General Dru-Zod had attempted to create a new Krypton on Earth to restore its lost way of life. Also, he genuinely loved his mother and was devastated by her execution, which made him all the more bitter towards the surface world and Arthur for the death of Atlanna ever since, as he perceived it as mostly his fault. Despite hating humans, he sympathized with the Black Manta's desire for revenge against Arthur for taking away his father. Although the sympathy he displayed could just be manipulation of a grieving Black Manta and using him as cannon fodder to kill Arthur.\n\nSpending several decades time to blame him for their mother's death, which while partially to manipulate Arthur into challenging him, was also done because he genuinely believed Arthur caused their mother's death, which succeeded in provoking his brother, who angrily challenged Orm to a duel, but even then, Arthur couldn't help but feel sympathy for Orm's pain over the loss of their mother, which led to him refusing to strike down Orm later on.\n\nDiscovering the fact that Atlanna was still alive and Arthur had rescued her was enough for Orm to accept his fate, surrender and be imprisoned for his crimes. Even though all he did was for the greater good of his people and his initial demands of Arthur killing him. Although he despised Arthur for the fact his birth caused Atlanna to be sentenced to the Trench, Orm seemed to have a level of kinship for him regardless, stating that he did not want to kill Arthur and giving him several chances to leave forever. He also looked shocked, regretful and even a bit grieving when he saw Mera's ship sinking in lava, thus believing she and Arthur are both dead. Although he does not answer when Arthur suggests they have a brotherly talk, later on, he seemed to contemplate doing so as he was taken away to be jailed.\n\nHis relationship with his father was not well-known, but it seemed Orm highly respected his father's fighting skills, describing Orvax as having been unchallenged during his reign and his trident never suffering defeat and even stating Atlanna's trident was flawed, although he still showed some respect for his mother's fighting skills by stating that her trident was nevertheless powerful. It is all but stated Orm is the result of Orvax forcing himself on Atlanna. Orm also appeared to respect his teacher Nuidis Vulko, as he sounded betrayed as he revealed to Vulko he knew of his treachery and asked his mentor why, appearing to be somewhat jealous of how Arthur was favored by Vulko and asking that he at least be given a view in his prison.\n\nAtlantean Physiology: As a high-born Atlantean, Orm possesses incredible superhuman abilities that surpass most other Atlanteans, with only other high-borns, such as his mother, Nuidis Vulko and half-brother currently being his equal in power. As a warrior prince of Atlantis, Orm was trained in the battle arts he has practiced for years to become the best.",
