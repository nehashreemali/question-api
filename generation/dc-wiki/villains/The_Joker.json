  "content": "The Joker is an infamously extreme and formidable psychopathic crime lord from Gotham City, being at the very top of the city's criminal underworld, greatly feared by all other crime bosses and criminals, including his long time rival Roman Sionis.\n\nThough he is devoid of empathy or pity for anybody taking part in his wicked schemes either by intimidation or fraud, the Joker used to adore his ex-girlfriend and former partner-in-crime Harley Quinn, doing his utmost to rescue her from Task Force X and the clutches of Amanda Waller, with eventual success. For unknown reasons, he later broke up with Harley, leaving her on her own and a target of many of his enemies.\n\nThe Joker is also the longtime archenemy of Batman, whom he considers to be his own favorite \"joke\" and the murderer of the latter's protege, Robin, alongside Harley Quinn.\n\nAbsolutely nothing, including his real name, is known about the Joker's past before the beginning of his supervillain career, though it can be surmised that he was most likely born in 1973 and grew up somewhere around Gotham City, New Jersey.[3]\n\nIt is known, however, that at one point, he fell into a boiling vat of toxic waste during a botched robbery at ACE Chemicals, permanently bleaching his skin chalk-white, turning his hair bright green and staining his lips bright red. Seeing this disfigurement, the combination of chemical exposure and brain damage via oxygen deprivation drove him completely insane, into psychosis. Thus was born the bombastic, deranged, maniacal, depraved, fearsome, and murderous man who would shortly thereafter be nicknamed \"The Joker\".\n\nBatman came into conflict with the Joker on numerous occasions, leading him to become the vigilante's greatest enemy. Upon repeated interactions, the Joker developed a sick and twisted love for the Batman, and their games together. Eventually, Batman would defeat and apprehend him, subsequently having the Joker imprisoned in Arkham Asylum for his numerous crimes.[4]\n\nIn Arkham Asylum, Joker would first meet a psychiatric intern Dr. Harleen Quinzel when he was assigned as her patient, whom he psychologically sabotaged and manipulated. She gradually fell in love with him, and the Joker got Harleen to do him favors, which was giving him first a stuffed kitten, and then a machine gun. Shortly thereafter, Joker's bizarrely dressed goons (lead by Jonny Frost) broke into Arkham Asylum, and successfully aided their boss in escaping, tying Harleen down in the process. Before leaving, however, Joker sadistically subjected Harleen to shock therapy (as a retaliation for her shock therapy leaving him \"in a black hole of rage and confusion\"), fracturing her psyche and causing intense psychological trauma. Thus resulting in her severe mental instability.[4]\n\nHarleen later chased him down on a motorcycle, and managed to get Joker to stop his Smiley Car. She nearly killed him with a gun, even shooting a man who approached them. Joker took the gun and taunted her. Harleen claimed to love him, but Joker responds by saying that he is not someone who is loved, but rather \"an idea, a state of mind, who executes [his] will according to [his] plan,\" with Harleen not being part of his plan. When Harleen still wanted to come with him, Joker took her to Ace Chemicals, where he had originally had his accident. While there, Harleen was told to say an oath and was asked if she would die for him. When she told him she would, he decided to die was too easy and asked her if she would live for him instead. She responded in the affirmative and allowed herself to fall into the vat of chemicals. Joker turned to walk away, leaving her to die, but was conflicted, changing his mind and jumping in after her, he pulled her up to the vat's surface. Joker then kissed her, and Harleen awakened. They kissed again and the Joker broke down into maniacal laughter.\n\nFrom that point on, Harleen dubbed herself \"Harley Quinn\" (donning a red-and-black Harlequin costume), and the duo of psychopathic lovers would go on many crime sprees in Gotham City together, which would often result in the duo coming into conflict with Batman, becoming (as Amanda Waller would later claim) the criminal King and Queen of the city.[4]\n\nAfter the Chemical Wedding, the reign of Harley Quinn grew in Gotham City, with Joker taking all of her credit for the robberies she had managed to commit. At some point in time, Harley dared Joker to tattoo a smiley face onto the face of a man named Happy. Joker's relationship with Harley gave her immunity over criminals and low-lives of Gotham considering the fear of Joker, including the likes of crime boss Black Mask.[4]\n\nAt some point before the Black Zero Event, the Joker managed to kill Batman's crime-fighting partner, Robin.[5] In an act of vengeance, Batman smashed Joker's teeth in, permanently damaging his smile. Batman locked him away in Arkham Asylum, but Joker eventually escaped once again and got his teeth replaced with metallic grills. To mark his change at the hands of Batman's fury, Joker got a \"Damaged\" tattooed on his forehead, permanently reminding both himself and Batman of what had occurred between them.[6] In hopes of driving his adversary further insane, Joker spray-painted \"HAHAHA JOKE'S ON YOU BATMAN\" in yellow on the Robin Suit. A devastated Batman would later place the damaged and vandalized suit in an exhibit in the Batcave.[7]\n\nThe Joker once picked Harley up from a bar as she was leaving singing, the Joker asked her if she swaved the man from the bar, to which Quinn stated that she paid, the Joker however handed her his gun to kill him despite having all the money. Unbeknownst to the Joker, Quinn only shot him in the hat letting him survive, as they escaped, the Joker asked her if it was difficult to kill him, which Quinn denied, stating that he could trust her.[8]\n\nIn 2014, Don Leo attempted to encroach on the Joker's territory in Gotham City, getting was captured by the Joker himself and taken to the Marin Hotel where the Clown Prince of Crime and his girlfriend Harley Quinn were staying. Joker taunted Don Leo and explained his plans to take over the criminal underworld with Harley at his side, preparing to brutally bash in Don Leo's skull with Harley's baseball bat, but she stopped him and gave Joker the idea to instead torture and kill Leo but leave him in one piece so that his body could send a message to other crime bosses in Gotham.\n\nLeo was killed by the Joker, who beat him to death and left a message pinned to his chest that was addressed to Don Leo's associates and read: \"Boys! You work for the Joker now!\" Later that night, the two psychopaths drove the Smiley Car to the nightclub, where to their surprise, the whole dance floor is filled with clubbers copying Joker's and Harley's appearances. Infuriated, the Joker intimidated a man named Mike who dressed like the himself until he was dissuaded by Harley as merely adoration. Mike's girlfriend claimed that the Joker and Harley Quinn are the coolest thing to hit Gotham since the appearance of Batman.[9]\n\nIn 2014, a year after the Black Zero Event, a lavish strip club owned by the Joker was visited by crime boss Monster T, whom Joker greeted, though he refused to shake his hand (as per usual, as Joker's right-hand man Jonny Frost revealed). Monster T, however, welcomed his fellow crime boss ally back, congratulating Joker on his escape. However, Monster T then took notice of the exceptionally beautiful Harley Quinn, and promptly made distasteful remarks about her, proceeding to stare with lustful desire, an act that greatly displeased the Joker. In response he called Harley over, intimidating Monster T, and making him somewhat uncomfortable by suggesting he sleep with Harley, as well as calling him a \"handsome hunka hunka\". Monster T, having picked up on Joker's displeasure, attempted to assure him that Harley was his girl and that he wanted \"no beef\". The Joker, however, was unimpressed with the man, and promptly shot Monster T in the head.\n\nLater that night, the Joker and Harley were driving down a street in Gotham, in the Smiley Car both maniacally laughing, while Batman pursued them in the Batmobile. Batman then put the Batmobile in auto-drive and jumped onto the roof of Joker's car. Joker trying to shake Batman off took a sharp turn, and despite Harley's protests that she \"can't swim\", drove the car into a river, forcing Batman to grapple off. Batman then put on a breathing mask and dove down into the river to arrest the two criminals. When he got to the car underwater, the Joker was gone and Harley was unconscious. Harley then attempted to fight off Batman with a knife before being knocked out by the latter. Batman then brought her to the Batmobile and drove her to prison.[4]\n\nEventually in 2016, after becoming increasingly bored and unhappy without Batman, who left Gotham City to begin establishing the Justice League, and, most of all, his beloved Harley Quinn, Joker, who by this point had taken to drawing an accented black smile around his mouth to keep up appearances, began deploying his numerous goons to track down her location. Eventually, Jonny Frost returned and revealed that she is imprisoned in Belle Reve supermax prison. Exuberant at the news, Joker ordered Frost to get his car, and proceeded to lie down on the floor of his chambers, amidst his collection of numerous bladed and firearm weaponry, roaring with gleeful psychopathic laughter (and washed off the black line shortly thereafter).[4]\n\nTo learn more details, Joker again deployed Jonny Frost, with the latter finding one of the Belle Reve guards, Captain Hunter Griggs, in a nightclub, and subsequently subduing him. Griggs was brought before Joker's goons, and while he remained relatively unfazed, he showed visible fear when the Joker himself entered. Joker circled Griggs, sadistically smiling at the terrified guard (in gleeful anticipation of the ruthless torture he was about to unleash upon him), implying Griggs kiss his ring, then straddling the man and suggesting he could \"tell Griggs meant it.\" He told Griggs he was \"Going to be Joker's friend.\", before gleefully claiming that he couldn't wait to \"show Griggs his toys.\"\n\nUltimately, Captain Griggs' torturous interrogation proves effective, as he revealed to Joker Amanda Waller's plan to use Harley Quinn as a member of the Task Force X (with an intended mission in Midway City), as well as the implantation of an A.R.G.U.S. nano-bomb into Harley, as an emergency contingency. Griggs ultimately agreed to lead the Joker into the facility where A.R.G.U.S.' nano-bombs are created. The Joker ultimately also forced him to return to Belle Reve and deliver a purple phone to Harley (through which he could communicate with her, via SMS) before she was deployed on the Squad's mission.[4]\n\nWhile Joker, Jonny Frost, and some of his other goons drove towards the A.R.G.U.S. facility, he had another faction of goons simultaneously kidnap the wife of Dr. Van Criss, the scientist that created the nano-bombs.\n\nWhen the security guard was unwilling to let in the truck carrying Joker and his goons in, the goon driving the truck seemingly acquiesced, and gave the guard a package to deliver - claiming that it was a gift basket for Dr. Van Criss. However, the package turned out to be a concealed bomb, which promptly killed the guard, allowing Joker and his goons to climb out of the truck and enter.\n\nDr. Van Criss initially hid behind a wall of bulletproof glass, but much to his dismay and horror, Joker promptly showed Van Criss a live feed of the latter's kidnapped wife. He then unlocked the door and let Joker's gang in, agreeing to accompany them and to personally disable Harley Quinn's nano-bomb, allowing the Joker to rescue his girlfriend. In an act of sadism, Joker picked up the nearest bit of equipment, a nano-bomb implementation gun, and shot it into Van Criss' neck.\n\nSatisfied with his progress, Joker sends Harley an SMS, letting her know that he's close.[4]\n\nLater, the welcoming helicopter arriving at the A.R.G.U.S. headquarters (for extracting Amanda Waller from the hands of Enchantress) was revealed to have been hijacked by the Joker, Jonny Frost, and his goons, and they opened fire over the Suicide Squad, while Dr. Van Criss simultaneously disabled Harley Quinn's bomb, allowing her to climb aboard the chopper (after informing her of this by SMS).\n\nThe reunited Joker and Harley Quinn happily kissed and embraced, with Harley delighted that her boyfriend dressed up for the occasion. Joker lets Harley know that he'd do anything for her, and claims to have grape soda on ice and a bearskin rug waiting for them. However, their reunion is cut short, as Joker's helicopter is shot down by Waller's agents. While Harley manages to jump out and save herself just in time, the Joker is presumed dead (along with Frost, Van Criss, and the rest on board) in the explosion of the aircraft, much to Harley's devastation.\n\nUnknown to Harley however, the Joker had managed to jump from the helicopter just in time. As he recovered from the encounter, he found humor at the sight of burning cash from a nearby bank. He resolved once more to find Harley, having long ago come to peace with the idea that she would probably be the death of him, and that he would be likely the one to strangle the life out of her.[10]\n\nWhen Harley Quinn's mind was telepathically assaulted by Enchantress, the latter implanted a vision of Harley being married to Joker, with both of them being without their dyed hair, bleached skin or tattoos, the two of them having two baby kids (a boy and a girl), and living a happy \"normal\" life in a suburban home. However, with the help of the more mentally resistant El Diablo, Harley was able to snap out of it and continue her attack against the evil army.[4]\n\nAfter the Suicide Squad had managed to defeat and kill Enchantress, her brother Incubus, and her monstrous army, they were all re-imprisoned in Belle Reve, albeit with their sentences shortened by 10 years and their cells rendered more comfortable in gratitude (with Harley notably gaining an espresso coffee machine).\n\nAll of a sudden, the Joker, now revealed to be alive and unscathed, and his goons (this time disguised as a SWAT team, with Joker's uniform bearing his name on the chest) broke into the prison, and his goons quickly broke through the lock on Harley's cage with a buzz saw. Joker then removes his mask to reveal himself and reunites with an overjoyed Harley. The reunited lovers finally embraced, with Joker telling her that they were finally going home.[4]\n\nSometime after returning home, the Joker broke up with Harley, using one of his henchmen to throw Harley out into the streets. This caused Quinn to desire shedding her former image and look for \"emancipation.\" At first, she did not reveal the breakup publicly and those few that she did tell refused to believe her, including crime boss Roman Sionis, who frequently made her feel welcome at his nightclub in the misplaced hope of brokering a deal with the Clown Prince of Crime. She then decided to go public in a big way by using a truck to ram Ace Chemicals, resulting in a massive explosion.\n\nAfter the word had gotten out that Harley and Joker had broken up, the enemies that Harley made when she was still in the relationship with Joker were no longer afraid to get their revenge on Harley, including the likes of Happy.[11]\n\nThough Harley attempted to strike out on her own, the shadow of Joker continued to loom large over her life. During Task Force X's mission to Corto Maltese, Harley threatened the Thinker by seemingly referencing Joker's use of personalized license plates.\n\nHarley was also shown to be overeager to jump into yet another problematic relationship, this time with the acting dictator of the nation despite her standing orders to treat him as an enemy. When the dictator began to reveal his plan, Harley suddenly took action and mortally wounded him, quickly causing his death. Harley's reasoning lay in the fact that she had finally learned from her prior relationships and that she had vowed to put a quick end to anyone demonstrating some of the same red flags as her previous partners had.[12]\n\nAbsolutely nothing, is known about the Joker's personality before the beginning of his supervillain career, It is known, however, that at one point, he fell into a boiling vat of toxic waste during a botched robbery at ACE Chemicals, the combination of chemical exposure and brain damage via oxygen deprivation drove him completely insane, into psychosis. Thus was born the man who would shortly thereafter be nicknamed \"The Joker\".\n\nThe Joker is an extremely malevolent and evil individual, being a complete psychopath (albeit on the high-functioning end of the spectrum) with seemingly no regard for human life, and a ruthless sadist who takes sadistic pleasure in torturing others to achieve his goals, evidenced by when he (with help from Harley Quinn) brutally murdered Robin, and left a jocular spray-painted message for Batman on the damaged Robin Suit, as well as when the Joker cruelly implanted a nano-bomb into Dr. Van Criss' neck, even after the latter had agreed to comply due to the Joker already having the man's wife hostage. His dark and twisted personality makes Joker find humor or sport in the suffering and fear of his enemies, and he is seemingly impossible to intimidate, due to his pathological fearlessness.\n\nJoker is also remarkably manipulative, easily psychologically enthralling Dr. Harleen Quinzel and commanding the respect and loyalty from all of his henchmen (who don't hesitate to break him out of Arkham Asylum), in addition to being extremely intelligent and unpredictable, thus managing to torment his nemesis for years, and catch Amanda Waller off-guard by sabotaging her A.R.G.U.S. helicopter. Also, Joker appears to be somewhat vain about his status as the king of Gotham City's criminal underworld, evidenced by him forcing the imprisoned Captain Griggs to kiss his hand, and proudly refusing to shake Monster T's hand upon meeting him. Joker also uses sexuality to intimidate and unnerve his victims, sitting on Griggs' lap and stroking him, as well as calling Monster T a \"handsome hunka hunka\" when he offered Harley to him. Joker also has a penchant for flamboyancy, lavishness, and extravagance, evident in him complimenting his bleached white skin, green hair and red lips, with black eye-liner (giving himself the appearance of a fearsome clown); his bright and flashy Smiley Car (in stark contrast to his nemesis' Batmobile), as well as the outrageous outfits that Joker sometimes has his goons wear: one of them sporting a goat's head mask, another wearing a mask of a giant eyeball, another in a full-body panda suit, and yet another dressed up in a mockery Batman outfit.\n\nDespite his psychopathic malevolence, on some level, Joker seems to reciprocate Harley Quinn's strong romantic love and infatuation in his twisted way (possibly due to her being one of the extremely few people to rival his psychopathy, with him thus feeling a kindred spirit in her), being exceptionally distressed after losing her (drawing a black smile around his mouth), being very possessive of her (promptly killing Monster T after the gangster made lustful remarks that she was a \"bad bitch\"), is desperate to rescue her from the clutches of Amanda Waller, is exuberant during their reunion, happily kissing and embracing his girlfriend, claiming that he would do anything for her, and willingly breaks into Belle Reve alongside his henchmen just to break her out. Despite these feelings, he has still been known to physically abuse her and leave her for dead when backed into a corner (such as when he left her underwater to drown). He basically views Harley more as property than someone he genuinely loves.\n\nThe only predictable aspect of the Joker's criminally insane psyche is his inherent unpredictability: Joker describes himself as \"an idea, a state of mind, who executes [his] will according to [his] plan.\" Hence, given the chance, he will kill again and again, but the how, why, when, and whom he will kill cannot be anticipated, sometimes even by genius detectives like Batman and Commissioner Gordon. His reasons and methods are not necessarily random, but are so quixotic and impulsive they may very well be.\n\nJoker is also a feared criminal in the streets of Gotham City, allowing Harley Quinn to assault people without having to worry about consequences. After the two break up, criminals of Gotham are no longer afraid to kill her one of which is Roman Sionis who wanted to kill her to prove himself.\n\nJoker, due to him being a crime boss at the very top of Gotham City's criminal underworld (thus having a penchant for having his subordinates kiss his hand), is an exceptionally powerful and influential crime boss with vast resources, owning a lavish strip club, having a collection of numerous weapons (both blades and firearms of all sizes and calibers, all lying neatly sorted on the floor of his chambers), and commanding numerous strong, flamboyantly dressed, well-armed, and fiercely loyal Joker's gang goons (lead by Joker's right-hand man Jonny Frost). Joker successfully employs this vast influence and resources of his to quickly track Harley Quinn down to the remote supermax prison of Belle Reve (across the United States from Gotham City). This, coupled with his completely unpredictable psychopathy, makes Joker a worthy opponent even for Batman himself, thus being the Dark Knight's nemesis.",
