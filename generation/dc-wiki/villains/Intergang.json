  "content": "Intergang was an international criminal and mercenary organization. Around 2021, it started taking control within the nation of Kahndaq in search of Eternium. Following the release of Teth-Adam, the organization was destroyed, freeing Kahndaq from oppression.\n\nIn 2021, the newspaper The Evergreen Sentinel contained an article reporting about Intergang's moves to assert control within Kahndaq.[1] Later that year, Integang had successfully taken control of Kahndaq, oppressing the population and exploiting the country's resources, particularly Eternium, using the Al Hadidiyah Mine as the main facility for its extraction. As a result, former university professor Adrianna Tomaz became a resistance fighter in hopes of achieving eventual freedom for Kahndaq.[2]\n\nIntergang eventually hired James Craddock to steal the eternium relic, The Champion, from a St. Roch Museum mineral show gala, fighting Hawkman directly, only to be accidentally killed by crashing with a building.[3]\n\nMercenaries in the United States stole weapons from Intergang which they planned to traffic with Novick during an encounter at a factory, Al Rothstein learned of the theft and set out to stop the mercenaries, leading them to chase him. Intergang researched the trafficking and soldiers arrived at the factory to retrieve the weapons, confronting the mercenaries and Rothstein, until Rothstein destroyed the factory.[4]\n\nA group of Intergang soldiers led by Jumbo, were supervising a ship and went to a Yurrd ship with the aim of finding an Eternium totem stolen from the St. Roch Museum, however, they were suddenly attacked by Adrianna Tomaz, who managed to escape with the totem.[3]\n\nIntergang managed to track down Adrianna Tomaz and find out that she had stolen the totem, one day while she was teaching classes at Kahndaqi University, Jumbo and his teammates caught her by surprise by interrupting the class and chasing Tomaz.[5] Eventually, Tomaz was apprehended by Intergang soldiers, being taken to a secret base where she spoke with a hologram of Mannheim, who offered her to help them find the Crown of Sabbac in exchange for her freedom, but Tomaz refused, taking for Jumbo to torture her.[4]\n\nTomaz contacted her son and Karim to search for the totem at the university, with Tomaz finding her while Karim was being held by Intergang, who they released after he handed over his shirt. Tomaz later managed to free herself from Jumbo, blowing up the base where she was stealing a hovercycle to escape, the Intergang soldiers chased her until they found the destroyed ship in the snow, learning that she had escaped, they communicated with Mannheim who ordered a search to capture her.[6] Eventually, the leader of an Intergang faction, Ishmael Gregor, found Tomaz, forming a false alliance with her in order to find the Crown of Sabbac.[2]\n\nIn Shiruta, some Intergang soldiers were inspecting cars with the aim of finding Adrianna Tomaz, at one point Karim's truck was going to be inspected by the soldiers but they were interrupted by Amon Tomaz, allowing Karim to move forward, traveling with Adrianna and their allies into the desert in search of the crown.\n\nThe next day, the team arrived at the cave where the Crown of Sabbac was located, with Ishmael Gregor secretly informing Intergang and killing Samir when he discovered it. The soldiers soon arrived at the cave, taking Karim hostage, and threatening Tomaz with murder if he did not hand over the crown.\n\nAs the soldiers prepared to kill Adrianna Tomaz, she managed to read an ancient manuscript to free the ancient champion Teth-Adam from his tomb, summoning him to everyone's surprise. When a soldier tried to stop Adam, he was electrocuted, leading the rest of the Intergang soldiers to fire at Adam, however the bullets did no damage him and Adam proceeded to brutally annihilate all the soldiers in the cave, allowing Adrianna Tomaz and Karim to escape.\n\nAs Adam left the cave, two Intergang helicopters arrived as reinforcements and tried to stop him with a missile, however he used his powers to make them crash into each other. In that, more troops of soldiers arrived that from the height Adam observed, the soldiers tried to stop Adam, but he easily killed them, electrocuting several of them and causing a great explosion that killed them. One soldier managed to survive, launching an eternium missile at him, weakening him before being killed by Adam, being helped by Adrianna and Karim.\n\nIshmael Gregor managed to survive the collapse of the cave, killing a soldier for having hit him hard and communicating with two soldiers to go look for him, mentioning that he had a new plan to get the crown. Adam's massacre against Intergang caught the attention of Amanda Waller, who contacted Carter Hall to request that the Justice Society stop him. With Adam's recovery, the Tomaz family began to beg Teth-Adam to free Kahndaq from Intergang repression.\n\nLater, Amon Tomaz began to face the Intergang soldiers whom he fearlessly confronted because he had Adam as a hero, causing several soldiers to start chasing Amon in an attempt at suppression, only for Teth-Adam appearing in front of them to defend his companions, beginning to annihilate many of the soldiers on his way to free the nation, until the Justice Society arrived to stop him.[2]\n\nWhile Teth-Adam was fighting the Justice Society, Ishmael Gregor took the opportunity to enter the Tomaz Residence in search of the Crown of Sabbac, deciding to take Amon Tomaz hostage to obtain it, with Amon calling his mother to inform her and with Teth-Adam coming to his rescue. Gregor escaped with Amon while on a hoverbike while other soldiers distracted Adam in a chase, and was killed by Adam.\n\nHawkman attempted to help Adam find Amon by requesting that he not kill any soldiers, but Adam refused as Atom Smasher and Cyclone held off some Intergang soldiers. With only one hyperspeed escaping hovercraft left, Adam flew fast enough to reach the soldier, shooting him down on a farm, discovering that Amon was not there. Having successfully escaped, Gregor kidnapped Amon Tomaz in a truck to the Al Hadidiyah Mine.\n\nLater, Hawkman took two Intergang soldiers prisoner and brought them to the Tomaz Residence, hoping to explain to Adam that it was in their best interest to keep the soldiers alive to force them to reveal information, with Adam eventually leading them up to the height and threatening to shoot them down if they didn't revealed to where Gregor had fled, leading them to know the location and find the Crown of Sabbac.[2]\n\nFollowing Gregor's plan, Intergang was ambushed by Teth-Adam who began attacking the Al Hadidiyah Mine in search of saving Amon Tomaz, killing several Intergang soldiers along the way, and was accompanied by Adrianna Tomaz and the Justice Society. Adam stopped when he found Gregor encased in an eternium shield with Amon as a hostage, with Gregor threatening to kill the kid if they didn't give him the Crown of Sabbac, prompting Adrianna to hand it over. In order to be sent to the Rock of Finality, Gregor sought to provoke Adam, revealing him to be the descendant of King Ahk-Ton and sought to redeem him by becoming the next King of Kahndaq.\n\nGregor mocked Hurut's death and shot Amon Tomaz as he disabled the shield, leading Adam to explode in rage and unleash an electrical blast at Gregor that destroyed all the mines, killing all the soldiers and destroying the organization in the process, freeing Kahndaq from its oppression.[2]",
