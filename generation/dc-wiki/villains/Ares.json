  "content": "Ares, also known as Mars, was an Old God who was commonly worshiped as the \"God of War\", and the most fearsome son of Zeus, who was worshiped by the Ancient Greek and Roman civilizations.\n\nMillenia ago, Zeus created the Amazons, as a fail-safe against Ares' power. Ares would eventually instigate the War of the Gods, successfully killing almost all other Old Gods and wounding Zeus, but was ultimately defeated and grievously wounded by the King of the Gods and was unable to stop his father from fathering Wonder Woman and creating Themyscira, leaving him temporarily incapacitated and permanently much weaker but still succeeding in becoming unopposed in his quest to destroy humanity as Zeus died from the severe wounds Ares inflicted on him after creating Themyscira.\n\nAres spent many years influencing humanity to create weapons which he hoped they would use to destroy each other. Ares would then reappear during World War I, taking the disguise of Sir Patrick Morgan, and inspiring Doctor Poison to develop a powerful and deadly gaseous weapon, which desired to use to destroy humanity, a race which he had developed bitter jealousy for. In the end, however, Ares' plans were thwarted, with Wonder Woman killing him and ending World War I and his violent influence on humanity for good.\n\nAres was born millennia ago to Zeus, King of the Old Gods, as one of the latter's many godly children. At an indeterminate point, he witnessed the creation of humanity by his father Zeus.[1]\n\nAres despised the human race that Zeus created, so he began corrupting them with war, blood-thirst, and violence. Zeus responded by creating a new race - the Amazons, who were intended to protect humanity from Ares's influence while spreading love and compassion.[1]\n\nWhen a young Darkseid first attacked Earth with his army of Parademons, Ares was able to temporarily put aside his distaste for humanity and joined forces with his father Zeus and half-sister Artemis in the battle against the alien invaders. Ares personally fought Darkseid, embedding his axe into the latter's shoulder, forcing Darkseid and the rest of his surviving forces to retreat from Earth. Afterwards, he observed the Atlanteans, humans and Amazons pick up and take charge of the remaining Mother Boxes.[2]\n\nDespite his role in saving humanity from Darkseid, Ares's disdain for the human race Zeus created would only grow with time, and Ares did his best to persuade the other Old Gods to see what he considered to be the malevolent nature within humans. When the other gods disagreed and vowed to support humanity, Ares violently rebelled, starting the War of the Gods on Olympus, which resulted in him killing off the other Old Gods for disagreeing with his bloodthirst and extremism.\n\nUltimately, after Zeus had fathered Diana (as a contingency weapon that could one day save humanity by defeating Ares) with Hippolyta, the King of the Gods fearlessly and unhesitantly confronted Ares and they fought. Although Ares was at his strongest, he found Zeus' power and skill to be too much for him to overcome and although Ares managed to inflict considerable injuries on his father, Zeus eventually won and not only did Ares fail to kill Zeus in combat, he also was severely wounded and banished from Olympus by his father. While Ares was focusing his powers to heal his grievous wounds, with the last of his divine powers, Zeus created the protected island paradise Themyscira for the Amazons to live, hidden from the God of War, thus causing Ares to now be unopposed in his quest to destroy humanity but also left much weaker and smaller permanently.[1]\n\nNow, as the sole surviving unopposed Old God, Ares again proceeded to corrupt humanity with war, determined to wipe the race out, but that ultimately proved ineffective. Hence, at some point, Ares came to Earth, disguising himself as an elderly and kindly human named \"Sir Patrick Morgan,\" and became an advocate member of the British War Council. Secretly, however, Ares supported the German General Erich Ludendorff, slyly inducing him and Dr. Isabel Maru, or Dr. Poison, to create an extremely deadly gas, which Ares intended to use for wiping out humanity for good.[1]\n\nIn 1918, Ares witnessed the arrival of Diana to London from Themyscira, but maintained his disguise, initially pretending not to know her identity. When Steve Trevor reported his discovery of Doctor Poison's notebook and the location of Ludendorff's base to the war department, the rest of the committee denied him a mission to halt their plans, earning them the ire of Diana which \"Sir Patrick\" silently observed. Ares had a word with Trevor and Diana afterward.\n\nAgainst the wishes of the committee, Ares, later on, met with Steve and the rest of his compatriots at a local bar and showed his support for a raid by providing them enough funds for a halfway transport to Belgium, earning their gratitude.\n\nSteve later decided to infiltrate a ball celebrating Ludendorff's first firing of Poison's new mustard gas formula. While relaying this information to Etta Candy, Etta relayed the information to \"Sir Patrick\", who vehemently denied him access, but was savvy enough to know that Trevor would go regardless.[1]\n\nAfter Trevor, Diana, and the rest of their Wonder Men team discovered a large bombing facility manufacturing and loading mustard gas to be used against the Allies, Ares decided to take matters into his own hands. Transporting himself to the facility, \"Sir Patrick\" finally shed his disguise and revealed himself to Diana after she killed Ludendorff, whom she falsely believed to be the God of War. He went on to agree with his half-sister's recent sentiments that humanity didn't deserve the help of the Old Gods, but instead destruction. Ares then began stating his reasoning behind everything he had done up to that point. After retrieving the God Killer sword from Ludendorff's dead body, Diana attempted to strike at him, but Ares simply held his hand out and disintegrated the weapon, stating that the sword wasn't the god-killer; Diana herself was. Ares continued to try and tempt Diana into joining his side by telling her that he wanted humanity's eradication because he saw the inherent evil in Zeus' creations, whispering into the ears of mortals who craved destruction. From his point of view, humanity itself chose to start a war with the ideas he planted in their heads; he himself had nothing to do with it. Even the influence of the Lasso of Hestia didn't dissuade him; it only furthered his resolve, as he used Zeus' lightning to warp the Lasso and show Diana vivid illusions of a world at peace through the end of humanity. Despite his efforts, Diana ultimately decided that she couldn't be a part of Ares's plan.[1]\n\nThe God of War then regrettably engaged his half-sister in combat, beginning by destroying the tower they were in and sending Diana flying. Seeing that she survived, he began telekinetically trying to slam her with metal slabs on the ground, but she dissuaded these efforts. Ares noted the naïveté of his half-sister as she tried to whip him with the Lasso of Hestia, simply creating strong winds to blow it away and dodging a slab toss by hovering in the air. He then attempted to crush Diana with an uplifted chunk of concrete, but she easily dodged and hit him with her bracelets. Tossed away, Ares stopped a box filled with explosives from reaching him, but Diana caused an explosion by simply throwing another box, temporarily incapacitating the both of them.\n\nAfter the both of them recovered, Ares began to take the fight more seriously, manipulating the metal around him into a makeshift suit of plate armor, complete with Spartan-esque helmet, and nonchalantly walked out of the inferno he was in, having revealed his true self. Diana rushed at him, Ares responding by tossing huge shards of metal and combating her with crude swords. Even as they fought, the God of War continued stating how humanity would die, with neither of them gaining an upper hand on the other until Ares choked Diana and threw her into a large tank, wrapping her with its treads.\n\nAres condescendingly threatened Diana and attempted to force her surrender, but Diana bore witness to Captain Trevor's selfless suicide by blowing up the plane of mustard gas, making her send out a shock-wave that threw Ares back. The God of War then began seeing her combat the German soldiers with great anger, and he began his platitude once again in the belief that Diana finally saw from his point of view and continuing to state humanity's weakness and rush to violence, even twisting Trevor's heroic sacrifice as him leaving Diana. She threw her fists into Ares's face, only for him to push her back and summon Dr. Poison's car, tossing the mad scientist out as use as a final counterargument to Diana. Fully angered, Diana nearly crushed Poison with a tank until she looked back at Steve's final words. Poison escaped as Diana approached her half-brother, saying that while humanity was indeed everything Ares said they were, they were also more than met the eye.\n\nAngered, Ares summoned another cadre of mighty swords and thrust himself at Diana, but every sword that attempted to reach out to her disintegrated, showing that she had finally tapped into her Old Godly power through her emotions. Determined, she released another shockwave that grounded Ares and removed his helmet. Furious, the God of War summoned a thunderbolt as he stated that humanity deserved none of Diana's love, but Diana blocked and absorbed its energies, as she countered by saying it was not about deserving her love, but about believing in a cause, with hers ultimately being love. Finally at the brink of madness because of her rejection of his cause, Ares summoned an even more powerful bolt and sent all of its intensity at his sister, who absorbed more energy thanks to her bracelets. Now overcome with surprise, Ares could only watch as she redirected the lightning bolt back at him, destroying him once and for all, and thereby ending the existence of the Old Gods.[1]\n\nAres, as the God of War, was extremely violent, bloodthirsty, selfish, sinister, and egregiously malevolent, willing to wipe out anyone who stands in the way of his ambitions.\n\nHowever, during the time of the first Invasion of Earth, Ares seemed to have been a somewhat nobler god, as despite his distaste for humanity and the other Old Gods, Ares was willing to join forces with Zeus and Artemis and even the humans and the other armies to repel the New Gods. Indeed, Ares displayed a surprising amount of valiance, as he fearlessly fought the invaders and he even went as far as to personally engage Darkseid himself without hesitation despite Darkseid's immense strength and overpower him, greatly contributing to the invasion's defeat. Ares also apparently was once somewhat loyal to and respected his father Zeus, as despite being known for being distasteful and estranged from all the other old Gods, he did not rebel for centuries, although this did not last forever as his lingering dislike of Zeus for creating humanity eventually overcame it completely.\n\nHowever, as time passed, Ares would grow less and less noble and more resentful of the humans he helped save, and when none of the other Old Gods shared his views, he ruthlessly slayed them in the War of the Gods, even attempting to kill his own father Zeus with everything he had. Ares would eventually go on to instigate the devastating World War I by manipulating both sides, again showing his hatred of humans by planning to use Dr. Poison's deadly hydrogen-based mustard gas to wipe them out. Thus, Ares was purely evil and irredeemable, as he didn't hesitate to turn against his allies when they were no longer useful to him (such as Dr. Poison), and even against his own family, murdering his own half-sister Artemis and using everything in his disposal to try to kill his father Zeus when the latter stood in Ares's way, despite having once battled Steppenwolf along with them. Indeed, Ares's loyalty was only to those that could be more useful to him than others, as he only aided the Central Powers of World War I and General Ludendorff primarily because Ludendorff shared Ares' own sadistically romantic view of war (the position that war serves a purpose of bettering individuals, and demands human sacrifices), and due to Dr. Poison's inventions offering him an easier way of wiping out much of humanity. Overall, however, Ares genuinely viewed himself as an altruist, given his belief that without humanity existing on Earth, the planet would be a paradise. He also apparently did not want to kill the Old Gods, as rather than immediately rebelling, he tried everything to persuade his kin that humanity was evil and only rebelled after they made it perfectly clear that they will forever support mankind and he even went as far as to say that he wanted the Old Gods to approve of his view of humanity when he spoke to Diana.\n\nAres was also extremely intelligent and divinely wise, given his tremendously long godly lifespan, allowing him unparalleled insight into humanity's darker traits, something no other Old God had, apart from Ares' father Zeus. Hence, even when not utilizing his divine powers, Ares was still extremely dangerous and absolutely lethal.\n\nDespite his violent and bloodthirsty nature though, Ares was a deceptive genius who could expertly hide it under a persuasive façade of calmness, kindness, perceptiveness, as well as his persuasive rhetoric, with Ares also usually not desiring to fight individuals who could be useful to him otherwise, like Wonder Woman. Indeed, while posing as the human \"Sir Patrick Morgan\", Ares deceived not only Wonder Woman, but even the highly experienced spies Steve Trevor and Sameer into believing that he was a staunch Allied Powers supporter, with him notably funding the Wonder Men for their military expedition to find and defeat General Ludendorff, with Wonder Woman never suspecting \"Sir Patrick\" until Ares willingly reveals himself to her.\n\nAres was also a phenomenal demagogue, with the usage of divinely wise and seemingly rational arguments making Ares' method even more effective. Hence, even after revealing himself and his motives to Wonder Woman, Ares claimed to be \"the God of Truth, not War\" (notably saying this while restrained by the Lasso of Hestia), and was still quite persuasive in presenting his viewpoints (him not actually being her enemy, and humanity being inherently malevolent and destructive even without his influence), to the point that it gave even the determined Wonder Woman some pause before she could even respond. As such, Ares succeeded in riling up Wonder Woman with a ferocious display of violence, and (by insulting Steve Trevor's sacrifice) almost got her to murder Dr. Poison.\n\nAres' greatest weakness was his occasional overconfidence and arrogance (much like it is for Enchantress, Erich Ludendorff, and Amanda Waller), with the God of War believing that his phenomenal divine power and ability to enhance himself from violence made him practically unbeatable. This ultimately became his downfall, as Diana was able to use her non-violent emotions of love and compassion to overpower and defeat Ares, fulfilling her role as the God Killer.\n\nOld God Physiology: As an Old God, and a son of Zeus himself, Ares is a phenomenally powerful divine being, appearing to be more powerful than even most other Old Gods. Indeed, at full power, Ares was able to seriously injure the New God Darkseid, and later, even while weakened, was still able to surpass the already tremendous might of the demigoddess Wonder Woman, his younger half-sister.\n\nAs the God of War, Ares has access to numerous divinely powerful weapons at his disposal, which he can summon at will. When in his \"Sir Patrick Morgan\" disguise, Ares is sufficiently influential and wealthy, being a member of the British War Council and having diplomatic relations, thus, he was able to easily provide funding for Steve Trevor's secret mission against General Ludendorff and Dr. Poison.",
