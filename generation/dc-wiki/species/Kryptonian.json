  "content": "Kryptonians, also known as Lorviians to the Ko'erst,[2] are a near-extinct technologically advanced species, native to the planet Krypton. The species was rendered critically endangered after almost all Kryptonians died when their main civilization center on Krypton exploded due to the instability of the planet's radioactive core.\n\nThey are morphologically and anatomically nigh-identical to humans, except for the fact that they gain incredible abilities when exposed to the radiation of a yellow star; their cells can absorb and metabolize this particular energy and harness it to perform extraordinary feats.[1]\n\nIn the early days of their civilization, the Kryptonians were a proud warrior race. One of their earliest traditions was dueling as a method of resolving disagreements. Eventually, the various Kryptonian tribes (known as Houses) united into a single nation.[1]\n\nOver the years, Kryptonians developed into an increasingly sophisticated society. Their architecture evolved alongside their technological advancements, allowing them to erect citadels throughout the planet; enormous structures capable of rooting themselves into the ground as they were built high into the skies. Kandor, the largest city on Krypton, featured multiple citadels, notably those used by the Council of Five for legislative proceedings.[1]\n\nDuring the Golden Age of Krypton, all Kryptonians lived by the Eleven Virtues, a series of doctrines that guided their morality and ambition.[3]\n\nFollowing the development of Phantom Drives, Kryptonian scientists paved the way for travel to distant planets in order to expand their influence throughout the cosmos, with some even leaving their scout ships (equipped with Genesis Chambers of their own) on these planets. In order to survive, these Kryptonian colonists utilized World Engines to alter these planets' composition, making them compatible with the newcomers.[1] However, the expansion ended milennia later and the colonial outposts were abandoned.\n\nDuring their time of expansion, the Kryptonians and the New Gods of Apokolips became enemies as the former began intergalactic exploration and colonization, resulting in a strong mutual hatred between the two races.[4]\n\nKryptonians were once born naturally, but this idea was soon discarded in the wake of advancements in genetic engineering, and they ultimately decided to control the population by growing fetuses underwater in orbs within Genesis Chambers (monitored by aquabots), which provided them with all they needed to survive until birth. They perfected this using a growth codex, which contained the genetic makeup of all Kryptonians. At that point, natural births were unheard of and population control was established.\n\nA Kryptonian scientist named Bertron created a monstrous creature that came to be known as the \"desecration without name,\" which was strictly banned from being created by the Kryptonian Law Council. This creature was never created again until Lex Luthor made one to kill the Kryptonian refugee Superman on Earth.\n\nThe Kryptonian Law Council decided to take energy from their planet's core to power their weapons and vehicles, heedless of the inevitable horrible consequences of such a choice, despite the warnings that Jor-El, the foremost scientist of the Kryptonian Thinker Guild, gave them. This rendered Krypton's core unstable, which would imminently induce it to implode, making Krypton's destruction an inevitability.[1]\n\nJor-El of the House of El and his wife, Lara Lor-Van, gave birth to a child through natural means, being the first, and last, Kryptonians to do so in centuries. They named the child Kal-El. Meanwhile, Jor-El had begun to notice the increasingly unstable core (as he had once predicted), so he resolved to speak with the law council once more, giving them one final warning of Krypton's impending destruction, letting them know that it would be completely their fault, and requesting permission to use the growth codex. However, the council hearing was ultimately cut short, interrupted by General Dru-Zod and his radical Sword of Rao loyalists invading the council. Zod proceeded to promptly murder High Eminence Ro-Zar, and attempted to recruit his former friend Jor-El to his cause of severing the \"degenerative bloodlines\" that had led Krypton to ruin. Jor-El, however, was quick to decline Zod's offer and was taken into custody by Tor-An, but, with some help from Kelex, Jor-El managed to defeat Tor-An and the other guards, and run off to retrieve the codex (with the help of his war kite H'Raka). He succeeded, and proceeded to bond the genetic information stored within the codex to the cells of his son Kal-El.[1]\n\nJor-El and Lara then tearfully parts with Kal-El, whom they place within a small starship, equipped with a Phantom Drive. Shortly thereafter, however, General Zod and the Sword of Rao arrive at the House of El citadel in order to stop Jor-El and re-obtain the Codex. Zod, making it into the citadel's interior, engaged his former friend in a vicious duel, desperate to stop him. Jor-El managed to defeat him and knocked him to the ground. Zod then proceeded to beg Lara not to launch the ship, but she ignored his pleas, desperate to send her son off to a safe world.[1]\n\nEnraged at his failure, General Zod proceeded to murder Jor-El, much to Lara's horror. Zod quickly made his way outside and proceeded to order his forces to shoot down Kal-El's ship. The order was received by one of the Sword of Rao gunships, who targeted Kal-El's ship. However, at that very moment, the Sword of Rao was finally surrounded by the Sapphire Guards, who shot down the gunship and arrested them and took them before the Law Council. Due to their crimes of murder and high treason, the Sword of Rao were sentenced to 300 cycles of Somatic Reconditioning within the fearsome Phantom Zone (aboard the Black Zero prison ship).[1]\n\nSeveral days later, Jor-El's prediction would come true, as Krypton's core finally imploded, leading to the destruction of the planet and all life living within.[1]\n\nVisually, Kryptonians are indistinguishable from humans. They evolved and adapted to survive in an atmosphere much harsher and gravity much stronger than Earth's. On their native planet, Kryptonians' natural abilities were the same as humans as Krypton revolved around the red star Rao. However, when on planets like Earth which orbits a yellow star, Kryptonians utilize solar energy on the cellular level to achieve vast superhuman powers that make them appear godlike (virtually comparable to Old Gods) to humans.\n\nIt appears that Kryptonians could also cut their hair as easily as humans while under a yellow sun. If a Kryptonian stays on a planet with a yellow sun and a nitrogen-rich atmosphere from birth, such as Superman did for the entirety of his life, their bodies will reject atmospheres similar to Krypton's, such as when Superman passed out on Zod's ship, Black Zero.\n\nSuperman and other Kryptonians are often mistaken as metahumans, but there are some reasons that disqualify them as metahumans.\n\nThe kryptonians, a race of humanoid aliens who, upon contact with yellow solar radiation, develop ridiculously superhuman powers. With Kryptonians having the source of their powers very well specified and being of a different species than humans, individuals like Superman or General Dru-Zod cannot count as metahumans, as metahumans often do not have a specific source, have many sources, or it has no source, not to mention that in essence they are still human.\n\nKryptonians have many similarities to humans.[5][6] However, their alphabet, writing system, and language are largely different from any Terran form of communication, just like their culture. Their language is named after their race, Kryptonian, though in their native tongue it is referred to as kriptan ma lumra, which literally translates to \"Krypton's communicating\".[7]\n\nKryptonian nobles usually dress in clothing that has their family emblem on the chest. In battle, they wear skin tight suits with their emblems on the chest under armor that also often has their emblem on the chest. Those outside of nobility wear the crest of their guild instead. Kryptonian women sometimes also wear earrings, like humans do.\n\nKryptonian children are genetically engineered to make Kryptonians a more efficient race. Some are engineered stronger to be better soldiers, others more intelligent to be better scientists. When the Kryptonian couple Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van conceived a child naturally, even the relatively open-minded Dru-Zod considered it blasphemy.\n\nThe Kryptonians have their own religious system, they especially worship Gods of Cold and Heat like Rao and Cythonna.\n\nKrypton's inhabitants each belong to a specific guild for which their genetics were engineered.
