  "content": "The New Gods are a spacefaring race of immortal and extremely powerful humanoid beings that are native to the extra-dimensional planet of Apokolips.\n\nDuring their \"Great Age of Expansion\", the Kryptonians would come across the New Gods of Apokolips, though their encounter would end with the two races becoming enemies.[1]\n\nThousands of years ago, Uxas invaded planet Earth in an attempt to terraform the planet into an Apokolips-like planet, and he would've succeeded if not for the intervention of the humans, Old Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, aided by the Sector's Green Lantern, Yalan Gur. After suffering a heavy blow from Zeus himself, Darkseid was forced to retreat, dragged away from the planet by his Parademons and the Apokoliptian Priests, losing three Mother Boxes in the process. After this defeat, Uxas renamed himself as Darkseid.\n\nIn 2015, Bruce Wayne had a vision of a possible future where Superman joined the New Gods and caused an apocalyptic war. This vision had Parademons in it as well.[2]\n\nShortly before being arrested, Lex Luthor learned about Steppenwolf and the Mother Boxes while being taught all the knowledge contained within Scout Ship 0344.[2]\n\nSteppenwolf arrived on Earth to reclaim the three Mother Boxes and terraform the Earth under Darkseid's orders. He faced resistance from the Amazons and Atlanteans, but easily overpowered them and reclaimed the Mother Boxes. However, before he could complete the Unity, he was confronted and defeated by the newly formed Justice League and a revived Superman.[1]\n\nThe New Gods are an advanced warrior race with access to technology beyond human understanding. They possess advanced energy weapons such as the plasma carbine or Electro Axe of Steppenwolf. However, one of its most predominant objects are the Mother Boxes, high-tech objects that allow them to open portals, known as Boom Tubes, to other places in the universe and even other universes entirely. They can also be used to repair a damaged body; Victor Stone was transformed into a cyborg by a Mother Box, replacing his damaged and missing body parts with cybernetic ones, while a deceased Superman was brought back to life.\n\nThe New Gods are much more powerful beings than humans and many other species in the universe. However, they are matched or surpassed by Kryptonians powered by solar energy and the Old Gods. They possess superhuman physical abilities, although it varies from individual to individual; while Steppenwolf possesses enough physical might to dominate such powerful beings as Wonder Woman and Aquaman, the Apokoliptian Priests were not as powerful as Steppenwolf. Despite their large size, the New Gods have incredible superhuman speed and agility that allows them to easily overcome and overwhelm other smaller and agile beings. They can also react quickly to high-speed projectiles. The New Gods are invulnerable to many forms of damage; Steppenwolf was even able to withstand the tremendous blows of demigods like Wonder Woman or Aquaman but was unable to withstand the heat vision of a solar-empowered Superman. In addition, they are immortal beings and can live forever.\n\nOnly a handful of New Gods have been seen so far, but their physical characteristics are quite varied. They can range from the size of a normal human to almost 8 feet tall. While at least one of the New Gods seen looks exactly like a human, other New Gods can have much more demonic or bestial appearances, with the strongest contrast being Steppenwolf, who towers over beings and looks otherworldly, to Granny Goodness, who has an unremarkable appearance. The only consistency between New Gods is that they're all bipedal and sapient.\n\nIt has been shown that the New Gods are able to control their Parademon minions with absolute authority in a manner similar to mind control. However, since the Parademons feed on fear, they will turn against their masters if they expose a sufficient amount of fear.[1]",
