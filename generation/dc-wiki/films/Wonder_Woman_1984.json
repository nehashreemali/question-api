  "content": "Wonder Woman 1984 (stylized as WW84) is a 2020 superhero film, based on the DC Comics superheroine of the same name.[3] Co-produced by Atlas Entertainment and The Stone Quarry and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the ninth installment in the DC Extended Universe and a stand-alone sequel to 2017's Wonder Woman. The film was released on December 25, 2020 simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max.\n\nThe film was directed by Patty Jenkins from a screenplay by Jenkins, Geoff Johns, and Dave Callaham, and a story by Jenkins and Johns. It stars Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, Kristen Wiig as Dr. Barbara Minerva/Cheetah, Pedro Pascal as Max Lord, Robin Wright as General Antiope, Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, Lilly Aspell as young Diana, Amr Waked as Emir Said Bin Abydos, Kristoffer Polaha as a handsome man, Natasha Rothwell as Dr. Carol Thomas, Ravi Patel as Frank Patel/Babajide and Oliver Cotton as Simon Stagg.\n\nA sequel was in development, but reportedly cancelled by Warner Bros in December 2022.\n\nIn 1984, Diana Prince struggles against two powerful enemies - Maxwell Lord and the Cheetah - whose ruthless ambitions threaten to destroy the world that she has sworn to protect.\n\nA young Diana Prince takes part in an athletic contest. While she takes the lead early on, she falls behind after falling off her horse. She takes a shortcut and is disqualified for cheating. Her mother and aunt teach her the importance of truth, citing the Golden Warrior Asteria as a role model to look up to.\n\nIn 1984, Prince foils a heist involving a black market of stolen antiques at a shopping mall. The FBI turns to Dr. Barbara Minerva, an insecure woman who works with Prince at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History to identify the antiques involved, where she discovers the Dreamstone. Prince unwittingly wishes for Steve Trevor's return while Barbara wishes to be like Prince. Maxwell Lord, a failing businessman, covets the stone and offers a sizable donation to the Smithsonian. During a gala, he seduces Barbara to lend him the stone, which he uses to become the embodiment of the stone itself. Meanwhile, Prince's wish is granted as Steve's mind returns and takes over another man's body.\n\nLord confronts Simon Stagg the following day and coaxes him to wish that the former achieved success, which results in Lord's company finally succeeding. After Prince shows Steve around the new world, she confronts Minerva about the Dreamstone. Discovering she gave it to Lord, Prince and Steve break into Lord's office, discovering he flew to Cairo and pursue him. Lord escapes after Prince's powers begin to diminish. They investigate the stone further and discover that with every wish, something they value is taken away, and the only way to reverse the exchange is to renounce their wish.\n\nLord begins to grant wishes in exchange for whatever he takes. After an audience with Ronald Reagan, he discovers a satellite broadcast system and he takes it in exchange for more nuclear weapons. The Russians quickly discover this and declare a nuclear war against the United States. Prince and Trevor attempt to stop Lord once again but Minerva, who refuses to give up her powers, stops the two and lets Lord escape.\n\nWith threats of a nuclear war underway and Lord reaching absolute control, Trevor convinces Prince to renounce her wish, which she reluctantly does. With her powers fully restored, she dons the armor of Asteria and confronts Minerva, who has now become an \"apex predator\". After subduing Minerva, she confronts Lord, who has already begun granting wishes around the world. He manages to hold Prince off, but Prince uses the Lasso of Truth to convince the world to renounce their wishes. While distracted, Prince uses the lasso to show Lord a vision of his son amidst the chaos which he brought upon, which finally convinces Lord to renounce his wish and reunite with his son.\n\nDuring the holidays, Prince encounters the man whose body Steve took over, complimenting an outfit which Steve himself rejected. Afterwards, Asteria is revealed to be living among mankind in secret, just as Diana has been.\n\nProduction began on June 13, 2018, with Warner Bros. releasing a press release, with filming to take place in the US, UK, and Spain.[3] It has finished filming.
