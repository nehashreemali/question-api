  "content": "Blue Beetle is a 2023 superhero film based on the DC Comics superhero of the same name. It is the fourteenth installment in the DC Extended Universe. The film was released on August 18, 2023.\n\nThe film is directed by Angel Manuel Soto, and stars Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle, Adriana Barraza as Nana Reyes, Damián Alcázar as Alberto Reyes, Elpidia Carrillo as Rocio Reyes, Bruna Marquezine as Jenny Kord, Raoul Trujillo as Ignacio Carapax/OMAC, with Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord, and George Lopez as Rudy Reyes.\n\nAfter Jaime Reyes graduates from college and returns to his hometown Palmera City, he is chosen to become a symbiotic host to the Scarab, an ancient alien biotechnological relic that grants him a powerful exoskeleton armor, turning him into the superhero Blue Beetle.\n\nIn the remote tundra of Antarctica, members of Kord Industries, led by the company's co-founder and CEO Victoria Kord, locate an ancient alien artifact known as the Scarab.\n\nMeanwhile, Jaime Reyes returns to his hometown of Palmera City after graduating from Gotham Law University, only to learn that his family is facing eviction from their home due to financial difficulties. Jaime's sister Milagro manages to get him a job at Victoria's mansion. However, both are fired after Jaime stops a confrontation between Victoria and her niece Jenny. Jenny later tells Jaime to meet her at Kord Tower the next day to discuss a \"job opportunity.\"\n\nThe next day, Jenny finds that Victoria is using the Scarab for her One Man Army Corps (OMAC) projects. She steals the Scarab and avoids security by giving it to Jaime, hidden inside a Big Belly Burger to-go box. At home, Jaime's family convinces him to open the Scarab box. When Jaime touches it, the Scarab activates and fuses with him, encasing him in an armored exoskeleton.\n\nJaime later finds Jenny for answers, rescuing her from Victoria's armed forces. She tells Jaime that the Scarab is a sentient weapon and that it has willingly chosen Jaime to be its host. With the help of Jaime's uncle Rudy, Jaime and Jenny break into Kord Tower to retrieve a smartwatch that once belonged to Jenny's father Ted, but are attacked by Victoria's bodyguard Ignacio Carapax, who has an OMAC prototype infused in his body. The Scarab, revealed to be named Khaji-Da, temporarily takes over Jaime's body and battles Carapax. Rudy and Jenny help incapacitate Carapax, then escape to Jenny's childhood home with Jaime.\n\nJenny uses Ted's watch to activate his secret laboratory and reveals to Jaime that Ted was originally a vigilante named Blue Beetle who spent his life studying Khaji-Da before mysteriously disappearing, leaving his company in Victoria's hands. When they notice Victoria's helicopter flying toward Jaime's home, Jaime summons Khaji-Da and returns to protect his family. As they escape, Jaime's father, Alberto, suffers a cardiac arrest and dies, distracting Jaime and allowing Carapax to capture him. Jaime is taken to an island fortress in Cuba, where he is strapped to a machine that downloads information from Khaji-Da to the OMACs. While unconscious, Jaime sees a vision from his father, who encourages him to embrace his destiny as the new Blue Beetle. Jaime awakens and escapes as Carapax's OMAC suit activates and evolves into a more powerful form.\n\nJenny and the Reyes family use Ted's Bugship and its weapons arsenal to storm the island. Jaime reunites with his family, then encounters Carapax and battles him. Jaime nearly kills Carapax in a rage after the latter attempted to kill Rudy, before Khaji-Da reveals to Jaime memories of Carapax's enslavement by Victoria for the OMAC experiments, including Carapax's mother's death at Victoria's hands. This leads Jaime to spare him, while Carapax rebels against Victoria and sets his OMAC suit to explode, destroying the island, himself, and Victoria with him as vengeance for his mother. As the Reyes family escapes from the island, they take time to mourn Alberto.\n\nIn the aftermath, Jenny becomes the new CEO of Kord Industries and promises to repair the damage caused to the Reyes family, helping them rebuild their home. As the neighbors gather around the remains of the Reyes family's home and provide support, Jaime kisses Jenny and then offers to fly her to the Kord Estate.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, a distorted recording is broadcast in Ted's laboratory, attempting to inform Jenny that he is alive.\n\nIn December 2018, The Wrap reported that DC and Warner Bros. were developing a Blue Beetle film, which would be the first feature film based on a Latino superhero. Mexican-born screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer was tapped to write the screenplay, with Zev Foreman as executive producer.[2]\n\nIn February 2021, The Wrap reported that Charm City Kings director Angel Manuel Soto was set to direct the film,[3]  which Soto later confirmed himself.[4] Not long after, a fan asked Soto on Twitter if Blue Beetle would be part of the DC Extended Universe, which Soto outright confirmed before later deleting the tweet.\n\nOn June 8, 2021, Los Angeles Times reported that the film is set to be an HBO Max exclusive instead of a theatrical release, along with Batgirl.[5]\n\nOn December 16, 2021, it was reported that the film will get a theatrical release instead, and will be released on August 18, 2023.[6]\n\nOn August 2, 2021, The Wrap reported that Xolo Maridueña was in talks to portray the title character in the film.[7] Later that day, Maridueña confirmed the casting on his Instagram profile.[8]\n\nOn March 8, 2022, The Wrap reported that Harvey Guillén, Bruna Marquezine and Belissa Escobedo were cast in the film.[9]\n\nOn March 18, 2022, The Wrap reported that George Lopez, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo and Damián Alcázar were cast in the film.[10]\n\nOn March 29, 2022, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Raoul Trujillo had joined the cast of the film, playing Carapax the Indestructible Man.
