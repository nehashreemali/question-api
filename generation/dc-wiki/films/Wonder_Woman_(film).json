  "content": "Wonder Woman is a 2017 superhero film based on the DC Comics superheroine of the same name. Co-produced by RatPac-Dune Entertainment, Atlas Entertainment, and Cruel and Unusual Films in association with Tencent Pictures and Wanda Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe. It was released on June 2, 2017.\n\nThe film is directed by Patty Jenkins from a screenplay by Allan Heinberg and a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, and Jason Fuchs. It stars Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, Robin Wright as General Antiope, Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, David Thewlis as Sir Patrick, Danny Huston as General Erich Ludendorff, Elena Anaya as Dr. Isabel Maru/Doctor Poison, Ewen Bremner as Charlie, Lucy Davis as Etta Candy, Lisa Loven Kongsli as Menalippe, Saïd Taghmaoui as Sameer, and Eugene Brave Rock as Chief.\n\nA sequel, Wonder Woman 1984, was released on December 25, 2020.\n\nBefore her becoming Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, when an American pilot crashes on their shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat. Fighting alongside man in a war to end all wars, Diana will discover her full powers...and her true destiny.[1]\n\nThe film begins in present-day Paris, France, where Diana Prince, curator for the Louvre's Department of Antiquities, receives a World War I-era photographic plate of her couriered by Wayne Enterprises and recalls her past.\n\nDiana was born and raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazon race created by the gods of Mount Olympus to protect humankind against the corruption of Ares, the god of war. In the distant past, Ares slew all his fellow gods, but his mortally wounded father, Zeus, struck him down. Before succumbing to his injuries, Zeus left the Amazons a weapon capable of killing his renegade son: the God Killer, which Diana believes to be a ceremonial sword. Hippolyta, Diana's mother and queen of the Amazons, believes that Ares will never return and thus forbids Diana from training as a hardened warrior, but Diana and her aunt, General Antiope, defy the queen and begin training in secret. When the two are discovered by Hippolyta, Antiope convinces her sister to allow Diana's training to continue.\n\nIn 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues Captain Steve Trevor, a pilot with the American Expeditionary Force, after his plane crashes off the coast of Themyscira. The island is soon invaded by the landing party of a German cruiser pursuing Steve. The Amazons engage and kill all the German sailors, but Antiope dies intercepting a German bullet meant for Diana. Interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia, Steve reveals that World War I is raging in the outside world and that he is an Allied spy. He stole a notebook with valuable information from the Spanish chief chemist Isabel Maru, also known as \"Doctor Poison\", who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff. Believing Ares is responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the ceremonial sword, a shield, lasso and her suit of armor and sets out on her own, in defiance of her mother, to stop Ares and end the war. She releases Steve and immediately leaves Themyscira with Steve to find and destroy Ares.\n\nWhen the two arrive in London and Diana is introduced to Etta Candy, Steve's secretary. She helps Diana acquire some contemporary clothing so she can better fit in and retain her anonymity. Steve then reports his findings to his superior officers at the war department and discovers the location of Ludendorff and the gas. He requests to be able to lead a raid on the facility but is denied by the war committee. Upon hearing this, Diana voices her outrage at the General's decision and leaves with Steve, who is planning to attack Ludendorff's location regardless.\n\nSteve takes Diana to a local tavern where he recruits the help of Sameer, an actor turned spy, and Charlie, an expert marksman, and tells them of the mission to help end the war. The group is then visited by Sir Patrick Morgan who, despite being a member of the war committee that refused the request to a raid, appears covertly supportive of the idea and helps to fund the expedition.\n\nDiana, Steve, Sameer, and Charlie travel to Belgium where they meet up with Steve's contact Chief, a Native American trader and smuggler, who joins the mission and guides them to the frontlines on the Western Front. Diana is shocked by the conditions of trench warfare, which further bolsters her desire to bring it to an end. She ignores Steve's warnings and leaves the trench to attack the German lines. She parries all the gunfire from the German soldiers with her shield and bracelets reaching the German trench, inspiring her companions and the other Allied soldiers to join the attack. They are successful in pushing the Germans back and capture the village of Weld in the process.\n\nDiana and Steve spend the night in the village with their companions, then in the morning proceed to the castle where Ludendorff is hosting a party to celebrate the firing of the new gas formula that Doctor Poison has concocted for him. To gain entry to the castle, Chief commandeers an automobile in which Steve and Sameer gain entry in disguises. Diana ignores Steve's advice to remain with Charlie and Chief and scout out the surrounding area. She also enters the castle after incapacitating an aristocratic German woman and stealing her gown as a disguise.\n\nInside the castle, Steve enters the ballroom and meets Doctor Poison and probes her for information that might be useful. However, he is rebuffed and she walks away just as Diana enters the room. She meets Ludendorff, whom she assumes to be the mortal disguise of Ares and plans to kill him before Steve intervenes and prevents her from doing so, fearful that their covers would be blown and result in their deaths too.\n\nLudendorff then fires the new gas at the battle lines from an artillery gun to the castle houses. The gas has the desired effect, killing thousands of troops from both sides and civilians as well. Horrified by the result of the gas, Diana blames Steve for letting it happen as a result of letting Ludendorff live. She rides to the complex behind the castle, pursued by Steve, where a larger supply of the gas is being loaded into a bomber plane to drop the gas on London and force the Allies to surrender.\n\nDiana fights her way inside and engages in combat with Ludendorff, temporarily bolstered with strength and energy after consuming an elixir developed for him by Doctor Poison. The two fight at the top of a communications tower while Steve and the others also gain access and plan to disable the aircraft carrying the gas. Diana beats Ludendorff in combat and kills him. Thinking his death would release the world from Ares' warmongering influence, Diana is confused that his death does not affect anyone else, seeing Steve and the others still fighting with German troops.\n\nDescending the tower, Diana notices none other than Sir Patrick Morgan inside the tower. Sir Patrick reveals himself, not Ludendorff, to be the true identity of Ares. She tries to kill him with God Killer, but the blade breaks. Ares explains that Diana is the God Killer, not the weapon, as only a god can kill another god, and that Diana is Zeus' daughter. He tells Diana his reasoning to start the war and what he hoped to gain from it. Meanwhile, Sameer informs Steve that the bombs carried on the plane are on a timer and will explode regardless of where the plane is. Sameer, Charlie, and Chief distract the remaining German personnel while Steve chases the plane and manages to enter it.\n\nDiana refutes Ares's claim that the outcome of the war would result in a better world and attacks him. The two engage in combat, fighting their way across the complex, whilst Steve manages to commandeer the now airborne bomber. He flies the plane to the near maximum altitude before shooting the gas bombs with his pistol to prevent the gas from reaching anyone else, at the cost of his own life.\n\nWitnessing Steve's selfless act, Diana is inspired to continue her fight against Ares with increased vigor. She soon gets the better of him, absorbing his attacks with her bracelets and replying to the attack with enough force to defeat him, freeing mankind from its induced aggressive compulsions thereby ending the war.\n\nDiana returns to London and meets Etta Candy during the victory celebrations. She notices a memorial wall at the heart of the celebrations, covered with photographs of deceased soldiers, and upon closer inspection sees one of Steve. She then takes a moment to reflect on her time with him in recognition of the impact he has made on her life and future and Diana looks up to the sky as closes her eyes. Back in present-day France Diana sends Bruce Wayne an email thanking him for returning the photo to her and hearing a disturbance outside she heads to the roof in her armor, leaping off her roof and into the sunset.\n\nShortly after her casting as Wonder Woman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was announced, Gal Gadot stated she had a three-film contract with Warner Bros. which also included Justice League and a solo Wonder Woman film. Sue Kroll, Warner Brothers president of worldwide marketing suggested that if this portrayal is well received, we may see Wonder Woman get her film. “That is our hope,” Kroll told the WSJ. “With the right script, that could be viable. The world is ready for her.”[2]\n\nFormer Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter has stated she would cameo in the film. Warner specifically sought a female director to helm the film, reportedly shortlisting filmmakers Lexi Alexander, Kathryn Bigelow, Mimi Leder, Michelle MacLaren and Catherine Hardwicke.[3] Michelle MacLaren was hired but left the project citing \"creative differences\". She was quickly replaced by Patty Jenkins. It was announced that the film would be known during production under the title Nightingale.[4]\n\nIt was confirmed from an article in a French magazine that Ares, the god of war, would be the main villain of the film.[5]\n\nIn the Blu-ray release of Wonder Woman, a bonus short film, entitled Etta's Mission, is included. It focuses on Etta Candy who is given a secret mission that could impact humanity's future.[6][7][8]",
