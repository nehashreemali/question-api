  "content": "Shazam! Fury of the Gods, also titled Shazam! Fury of the Kings in some foreign territories, is a 2023 superhero film, based on the DC Comics superhero of the same name. The film is a sequel to Shazam! and the twelfth installment in the DC Extended Universe. The film was released on March 17, 2023.\n\nDirected by David F. Sandberg, the film stars Zachary Levi as Shazam, Asher Angel as Billy Batson, Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy Freeman, Adam Brody as Superhero Freddy, Rachel Zegler as Anthea, Ian Chen as Eugene Choi, Ross Butler as Superhero Eugene, Jovan Armand as Pedro Peña, D.J. Cotrona as Superhero Pedro, Grace Caroline Currey as Mary Bromfield, Faithe Herman as Darla Dudley, Meagan Good as Superhero Darla, with Lucy Liu as Kalypso, with Djimon Hounsou as Shazam, and Helen Mirren as Hespera.\n\nBilly Batson and his foster siblings, who transform into superheroes by saying \"Shazam!\", are forced to get back into action and fight the Daughters of Atlas. The Shazam family must stop them from using a weapon that could destroy the world. Along the way, they have to make peace with the gods because Billy took their powers for granted.\n\nA few years after Thaddeus Sivana's defeat, Hespera and Kalypso, two of the daughters of the Titan Atlas, break into the Acropolis Museum in Athens, Greece to steal the Wizard's broken staff. The two then take it to the Wizard, imprisoned in the Gods' Realm, and force him to repair the staff and activate its powers.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Billy Batson and his \"Shazamily\" of foster siblings save people on the collapsing Benjamin Franklin Bridge, but are called out for its destruction. The group is drifting apart at home due to them growing up and having personal interests. Billy is worried about being kicked out of the Vasquez family after he ages out of the foster system. In a dream, Billy is warned by the Wizard about the Daughters, prompting the Shazamily to begin researching them.\n\nFreddy Freeman, still bullied at school, falls for a new girl named Anne, to whom he shows off his superhero self. Hespera and Kalypso arrive with the staff and steal Freddy's powers. Anne is revealed to be their youngest sister, Anthea. Billy and the Shazamily attempt to save Freddy, but the daughters kidnap him and place an indestructible dome around the city, trapping everyone inside. Freddy is imprisoned along with the Wizard in the Gods' Realm. The Daughters reveal that they want revenge because the Wizard killed their father.\n\nMeanwhile, the Shazamily enter the Rock of Eternity, where they encounter a sentient pen named \"Steve\", which they use to draft a letter to Hespera as a negotiation for Freddy's release. Billy meets Hespera, and, while the meeting is initially cordial, she and Kalypso soon fight the Shazamily. Pedro loses his powers during the fight, while Hespera is captured and taken to the Rock. Hespera easily breaks out and steals the Golden Apple, the seed of the Tree of Life. Meanwhile, Freddy and the Wizard attempt to escape the Gods' Realm with a sympathetic Anthea's help, just as Hespera returns with the Apple. The Daughters argue as Hespera and Anthea want to use the Apple to revive their realm, while Kalypso wishes to plant it on Earth to destroy it. Freddy steals the Apple but is discovered. Billy and the Shazamily show up, and Freddy reacquires his powers.\n\nBilly and the Shazamily emerge with the Wizard in the Vasquez home, where they reveal their secret identities to their foster parents. Kalypso appears with a dragon named Ladon to acquire the Apple. All but Billy lose their powers in the skirmish, while Kalypso retrieves the Apple and uses it to plant the Tree at Citizens Bank Park, which spawns monsters to attack the city. Hespera and Anthea object to their sister's destructive plan, but Kalypso mortally wounds Hespera and de-powers Anthea. Billy, in despair, asks the Wizard to take back his powers, though the Wizard assures him he is a true hero.\n\nHeeding the Wizard's words, Billy transforms and flies off to stop Kalypso, while the Shazamily enlist the help of unicorns to fend off the other monsters. Meanwhile, Billy persuades a dying Hespera to help him stop Kalypso. Realizing the dome reacts violently to his lightning, Billy lures Kalypso to the Park while Hespera shrinks the dome to contain them. Billy fights Kalypso and Ladon before killing them both by overloading the staff with electricity, destroying the Tree and Kalypso's army with them, at the cost of his own life. Hespera acknowledges Billy as a true god before succumbing to her wounds.\n\nAnthea brings Billy's grieving family to the Gods' Realm for his burial. Diana Prince, the last living being with godly powers, appears and repairs the staff, imbuing it with her power and using it to revive the Gods' Realm, Anthea's powers, and resurrect Billy. Billy in turn uses the staff to restore his siblings' powers. The Shazamily fix their home while Anthea and the Wizard take up residence on Earth.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Emilia Harcourt and John Economos attempt to recruit Billy into the Justice Society on behalf of Amanda Waller. In a post-credits scene, a still-incarcerated Sivana encounters Mister Mind once again, enraged that he has not begun enacting their plan yet.\n\nIn April 2019, The Wrap reported that New Line Cinema was developing a sequel to Shazam! with Henry Gayden returning to write the film, along with David F.
