  "content": "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a 2023 superhero film based on the DC Comics superhero of the same name. The film is the sequel to Aquaman. It is the fifteenth and final installment in the DC Extended Universe. The film was released on December 22, 2023.\n\nDirected by James Wan, the film stars Jason Momoa as King Arthur Curry/Aquaman, Patrick Wilson as Prince Orm Marius, Amber Heard as Queen Mera, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as David Kane/Black Manta, Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus, Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin, Temuera Morrison as Tom Curry, Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna, Vincent Regan as King Atlan, Indya Moore as Karshon, and Jani Zhao as Stingray. Additionally, Pilou Asbæk has been cast as Kordax.\n\nHaving failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father’s death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman’s family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.[1]\n\nFour years after becoming the King of Atlantis, Arthur Curry finds the more mundane responsibilities dull and unexciting. In the meantime Arthur has married Mera and they have a son Arthur Curry, Jr. The Council of Atlantis dismisses most of his ideas, leaving him frustrated. Arthur is also grappling with the challenges of raising Junior, while managing the kingdom. His father, Tom, primarily cares for Junior, when Arthur and Mera are absent due to Atlantean state affairs. During this time, they discover the child's ability to communicate with fish.\n\nIn Antarctica, David Kane and Stephen Shin embark on an expedition to repair the Black Manta armor using Atlantean ruins. They encounter a mysterious creature, and Kane discovers a broken Black Trident. Upon reassembling it, he is possessed by an entity promising him power in exchange for freeing it from its frozen prison.\n\nThe world faces severe climate changes, causing many natural disasters. Atlantis suffers deadly plagues, leading Curry to propose revealing Atlantis to the surface for collaboration. However, council head Karshon opposes, aligning with Orm Marius' plan to eradicate the surface. Meanwhile, Kane's army, armed with ancient Atlantean tech, steals Orichalcum, a powerful but dangerous resource, during which they also attack Atlantis. Atlanna and Mera try to stop Kane but in the confrontation Mera is severely injured.\n\nTo stop Kane, Arthur seeks Orm's help but faces challenges. They discover Kane's plan to use Orichalcum to raise the planet's temperature and release the Lost Kingdom of Necrus. Orm reveals Necrus' dark history and the role of Atlan's brother, Kordax, in turning it into a monstrous realm. Curry and Orm join forces to confront Kane.\n\nIn the final battle, Kane kidnaps Junior, leading to a confrontation in Necrus. Arthur is nearly killed by Kane, but a timely intervention by Mera, saves her husband. As Mera is taking their son to safety, Kanes launches the black trident at her, but Orm manages to intercept it. Orm becomes possessed, this leads to a confrontation between the two brothers. Ultimately Arthur convinces his brother to give up his hatred, following which Arthur and Orm face a revived Kordax. The Black Trident is shattered and Kordax is destroyed. As Necrus is collapsing Kane meets a tragic end, while the Atlanteans and Dr. Shin manage to escape to safety. Arthur and Mera decide that Orm has redeemed himself, they ask him for the time being to stay low on the surface, and the brothers reconcile. Atlantis announces itself to the surface world, seeking collaboration with the United Nations, while Marius, on Arthur's recommendations, tries a cheeseburger for the first time as he starts experiencing the world's delights.\n\nIn December 2018, The Hollywood Reporter announced via Warner Bros.
