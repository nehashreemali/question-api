  "content": "Justice League is a 2017 superhero film based on the DC Comics superhero team of the same name. Co-produced by DC Films, RatPac-Dune Entertainment, Atlas Entertainment, and Cruel and Unusual Films and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, the film is a follow-up to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe. It was released theatrically on November 17, 2017.\n\nThe film is directed by Zack Snyder from a screenplay by Chris Terrio with additional directed material and writing by Joss Whedon, and it stars Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/Flash, Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, Ray Fisher as Victor Stone/Cyborg, Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, J.K. Simmons as Commissioner James Gordon, Ciarán Hinds as Steppenwolf, Amber Heard as Mera, and Joe Morton as Silas Stone.\n\nA new version of the film featuring Snyder's material that was scrapped from the theatrical release version and none of Whedon's material, Zack Snyder's Justice League, was released on HBO Max in 2021.[1]\n\nFueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. However, despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes - Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash - it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.[2]\n\nIt has been a year since Superman's death, and the world is still mourning. Sensing humanity's fear, Apokoliptian general Steppenwolf and his army of  Parademons arrive on planet Earth to begin their hunt for the Mother Boxes through the kidnapping of several employees of S.T.A.R. Labs, which is in possession of one of the Boxes. Having investigated the kidnappings and encountered a Parademon himself in Gotham City, the billionaire vigilante Bruce Wayne has decided to move forward in recruiting his planned team of metahumans as he believes an invasion is coming.\n\nSteppenwolf and his army attack Themyscria, heavily slaughtering the Amazons and retrieving their Mother Box, prompting Queen Hippolyta to warn her daughter Diana Prince. Diana joins Wayne's group and informs him about Steppenwolf and the Mother Boxes.\n\n5000 years ago, Steppenwolf and his army invaded Earth to conquer it and terraform Earth into his Apokolips homeworld. However, the unified army of Earth, consisting of Old Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humans, and Green Lanterns defended their planet and drove him back. After his defeat, the Mother Boxes were separated and hidden in different places around the world.\n\nIn present day, the two of them fail to persuade the Atlantean Arthur Curry, who has control over the sea, and Victor Stone, who is presumed dead and half machine, but manage to recruit a young man named Barry Allen, who has the power to move in blinding velocities. Victor later joins the group after his father Silas Stone is among those kidnapped at S.T.A.R. Labs. Meanwhile, Steppenwolf attacks Atlantis and defeats Curry, retrieving the second Mother Box.\n\nThe team receives intel from Commissioner James Gordon that the Parademons are travelling underground, and conclude that Steppenwolf's army is based in an abandoned facility. While Wonder Woman and Batman hold off Steppenwolf and his army, the others manage to rescue the hostages. However, during the battle, Stone flies away and the facility floods, trapping the team and allowing Steppenwolf escapes. Curry arrives, convinced to join the team after Steppenwolf's attack on Atlantis. Stone retrieves the last Mother Box from S.T.A.R. Labs for the group to analyse. Wayne decides to use the Mother Box to resurrect Superman not only to help them fight Steppenwolf's army, but also to restore hope in humanity. Diana and Curry are hesitant about the idea, but Wayne forms a secret contingency plan.\n\nClark Kent's body is exhumed and placed in the waters of the Kryptonian ship, and Allen provides a strong energy blast to activate the Box via his speed, causing to the resurrection of Superman. Superman flies over to Heroes Park and lands groggily, however, possesses few memories as the League arrives shortly. Superman is still confused and he attacks the group after Cyborg's armor's defense system launches a projectile at him. A fight ensues and Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Cyborg attempt to restrain him, but he is quickly overpowered.  Flash tries to flank Superman, but he is able to see and match the former's speed, even landing a glancing hit. After overpowering Wonder Woman a second time, he attacks Batman. On the verge of being killed by Superman, Wayne enacts his contingency plan: Lois Lane. Superman manages to calm down and leaves with Lois to his family home where he reflects and tries to recover his memories. With the last Mother Box unguarded, Steppenwolf retrieves it with ease.\n\nWithout Superman to aid them, the League travel to a village in Russia where Steppenwolf plans to unite the boxes once again and reshape the world for his uncle and superior Darkseid, the ruler of Apokolips. The team fights their way through the Parademons to reach Steppenwolf during the harsh, destructive battle, but he overpowers the group, who are unable to buy Stone enough time to separate the Mother Boxes. Superman decides to arrive and easily overpowers Steppenwolf, later assisting Allen in evacuating the city, even carrying a large apartment building full of civilians as well as Stone in separating the Mother Boxes. The united heroes manage to defeat Steppenwolf after a fight, who, overcome with fear, is attacked by his own Parademons and thrown into a Boom Tube, ending the tyrant and sending them all to Apokolips.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Wayne reacquires the Kent Farm for Martha Kent and decides to rebuild Wayne Manor as a base of operations for the team and he and Diana agree that more heroes could join. Diana as Wonder Woman begins engaging more with the public. Allen manages to acquire a job in Central City's police department. Victor continues to explore and enhance his abilities with his father in S.T.A.R. Labs. Curry returns to Atlantis. Clark returns as a Daily Planet reporter and resumes his role as Superman.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Flash and Superman decide to race to see who is the fastest person alive. In a post-credits scene, the megalomaniac billionaire Lex Luthor escapes from prison and recruits bounty hunter Slade Wilson to form a \"league of [their] own\".\n\nAlthough Christopher Nolan was rumored to be directing Justice League,[3]\n\nNolan himself ruled it out, but later was an executive producer on the film. In June 2012, Will Beall was hired to write the screenplay for a Justice League film, in which Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman would be the main characters.[4][5] Warner Bros. announced plans for the Justice League film to have a summer 2015 release date to compete with Avengers: Age of Ultron, though they had yet to complete a script or officially hire a director.[6]\n\nMan of Steel director Zack Snyder stated, \"I don't know how 'Justice League' is going to be handled. Honestly, I don't. But 'The Man of Steel' exists, and Superman is in it. I don’t know how you’d move forward without acknowledging that,\" during an interview with the New York Post in November 2012. He also claimed that Warner Bros. expects him to \"keep them on course\" as regards to their cinematic universe.[7] The Superman villains Brainiac and Doomsday were rumored to be possible antagonists.\n\nIt was announced in October 2014 that the film would be split into two parts, the first being released in 2017 and the second in 2019.[8]\nProducer Deborah Snyder confirmed the 2 Justice League movies are not two-part films. Zack Snyder says Justice League is most influenced by Jack Kirby's \"New Gods\".\n\nIt was announced on May 22, 2017, that Joss Whedon would be stepping in to help oversee the completion of post-production and to direct the reshoots after Zack Snyder and Deborah Snyder stepped down to tend to a personal tragedy. As a result, many scenes have been left on the cutting room floor. A list of deleted scenes can be found here.[9]\n\nOn May 20, 2020, Zack Snyder announced that the director's cut of the film will be released on HBO Max in 2021.[10]\n\nA sequel was originally scheduled to be released in June 2019[11] but was subsequently delayed to accommodate the release for The Batman.[12] By March 2017, producer Charles Roven announced that Zack Snyder would direct the film.[13] In October 2017, J. K. Simmons stated that the studio was working on the script of the sequel, alongside The Batman.[14] Shortly after the release of Justice League, Henry Cavill stated that he was under contract with Warner Bros. to play Superman for one more film.[15] In December 2017, it was reported that there were \"no immediate plans\" for Zack Snyder to direct any future DC films, being relegated to an executive producer position instead. This came after a reshuffling of film production staff at Warner Bros. due to the film's mixed critical reception and disappointing financial performance.[16] By 2019, Warner Bros. had prioritized solo films over the project.\n\nAfter previously declining an offer to direct the first film,[17] Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins noted she is open to directing a Justice League sequel.[18][19][20]\n\nThough Snyder's cut of Justice League has been described by DC Films executives as \"a storytelling cul-de-sac\" with no sequels planned,[21][22] Snyder stated that he would be willing to return to direct the sequels if the studio offered him the chance.[23] In January 2021, Ray Fisher (who had a fallout with Joss Whedon, Geoff Johns, Jon Berg and current DC Films president Walter Hamada) stated that he would only be willing to reprise his role as Cyborg in a future DCEU film if Justice League Part Two were to be made by Snyder.[24] Additionally, several unconfirmed reports had stated that the sequels could still be made depending on the success of Snyder's cut.[25] However, shortly after the 'Snyder Cut' was released Warner Bros CEO Ann Sarnoff said there were no current plans in place for Snyder to return as a director/writer for future DCEU films suggesting a direct sequel to his version of Justice League remained unlikely.[26]\n\nIn August 2021, DC Films producer Charles Roven stated that a Justice League sequel was still possible, though it would be several years away.[27]",
