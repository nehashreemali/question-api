  "content": "Rosa Vasquez is the wife of Victor Vasquez[1] and the foster mother of Billy Batson and the Shazam Family.\n\nA few years younger than Victor,[2] Rosa was orphaned as a child and spent her formative years living in a series of foster homes, many of which she attempted to escape from.[3]\n\nLater on she met a fellow orphan, Victor, whom she married. They started their own household in Philadelphia where they raised their own foster family, wishing to give the children a better childhood experience than they had themselves.[3]\n\nHardly any different from her husband, Rosa is extremely compassionate and altruistic. Life as a foster child seems to have done nothing to lessen this nature of hers, as she dedicated her life to giving children a better childhood experience than the one she had.",
