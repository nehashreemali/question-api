  "content": "Carter Hall is an archaeologist, museum curator, and the leader of the Justice Society known as the superhero Hawkman, living as a reincarnation of the prince Khufu. During an exhibit at the St. Roch Museum, Hall was confronted by James Craddock, who tried to steal The Champion until he stopped him, accidentally killing him, being forced to face him as a ghost. Discovering that a dangerous threat was approaching, he decided to reform the Society, recruiting Maxine Hunkel, Albert Rothstein, and his former teammate Kent Nelson.\n\nAfter Teth-Adam was freed from Kahndaq and began brutal warfare against Intergang, Hawkman along with the re-assembled Justice Society traveled to Kahndaq to stop his actions and hand him over to A.R.G.U.S.. However, being too powerful, the team decided to make a reluctant truce with him, leading to a rivalry between Hall and Adam over their ideals of justice and heroism, but eventually joined forces to rescue Amon Tomaz. After Adam surrendered and was imprisoned, Hall along with the team tried to confront Sabbac, however they were stopped by Kent Nelson who sacrificed himself to prevent Carter's death. After Adam was released, he and the Justice Society defeated the demon, becoming allies.\n\nAt some point, Khufu was reincarnated in Carter Hall,[4] eventually becoming a vigilante under the alias of Hawkman, meeting Kent Nelson, a powerful sorcerer known as Doctor Fate,[2] and Al Pratt, a hero known as Atom Smasher,[5] in order to defend the world, Hall soon founded the Justice Society, a group of heroes formed along with Nelson and Pratt, gaining many fans in their glory days.[6] Due to the adventures they had, Hall and Nelson eventually became great friends.[7] During his time as a vigilante, Hawkman befriended Jeremy, becoming his partner. Eventually the Justice Society split up for unknown reasons, going their separate ways, while Hawkman continued his work as a vigilante with the support of Jeremy.[2]\n\nIn one comic book entitled 'United Heroes: Justice League', Hawkman was depicted alongside Justice League members Superman and Wonder Woman.[8]\n\nWhile flying operating in the sky, Hall received a call from Jeremy asking where he was causing Hawkman to let him know he was doing business as usual, Jeremy then reminded him to be at the St. Roch Museum with him at the exotic minerals exhibition, causing Hall to sigh asking if his presence was really necessary, to which Jeremy replied yes since he had promised, mentioning some of the minerals that were exhibited, so Hawkman headed to the museum.\n\nUpon arrival, he landed on the roof of the museum telling Jeremy, Hall then deactivated his hawksuit by presenting his gala suit, mentioning that he didn't want to make an impression. Following Jeremy's directions, Hall descended the stairs and entered the museum through a door that Jeremy left open for him. Upon entering, Carter heard a guide showing the uritrium trident while explaining how the Justice Society had recovered it.\n\nThe people who saw the uritrium trident commented that they had not heard from the Justice Society for years, believing that they had already been disbanded, this caused Carter to get frustrated remembering his past. Continuing his way into the museum, Hall finally met Jeremy, who in amazement showed him a relic of the place known as The Champion, while Jeremy mentioned when he dated the object, Carter watched with enthusiasm.\n\nIn that, a waiter offered Hall a capané to which he refused, while Jeremy continued explaining admired that the item was made of 1% eternium and that if the mineral was used in greater quantity the possibilities would be incredible, causing Carter to get annoyed with him for not valuing Nth metal, however Jeremy made him think about the power they might have if they used eternium in the Hawk Cruiser and in a weaponry.\n\nSuddenly an explosion would detonate in the museum, causing the alert of Jeremy and Carter. Confused by what happened, Hall saw how people panicked and began to run through the screen smoke, so he made a scream asking them to go to the emergency exit, Hall then asked Jeremy to go with them and seeing that the artifact of The Champion had been stolen, Hall escaped from the sight of the people to transform into Hawkman and chase the culprit.\n\nAfter activating his suit, Hawkman rose towards the roof breaking the glass and then went to catch the person responsible for the attack, who after seeing him began to run jumping between buildings while Hawkman flew trying to reach him until the fugitive grabbed an Intergang ship and escaped by flying at higher speed. Hawkman then continued to follow the criminal stating that he could not escape since the sky was his territory.\n\nThe criminal began to shoot Hawkman in the wings hoping to destroy them however Hawkman defended himself by putting his wings in front of his face so as not to take any damage, Hall then threw his mace into the criminal's hand to throw his weapon to the ground, the blow caused damage to his hand and his hearing making him to lose control of the ship and being about to crash, Hawkman tried to warn him to look at the road but he didn't react in time crashing and dying on the spot.\n\nIn the middle of the fire, Hawkman flew to rescue the corpse of the criminal which was on fire, so he quickly flew back to the museum where he met with Jeremy who was worried that the eternium was not there, so Hawkman annoyed made him notice that the thief was dead and that he shouldn't think only about that, seeing that Jeremy cared so much about the artifact, he gave him the bag with the destroyed pieces of The Champion, asking him to return them to the museum.\n\nAt that moment, Hawkman observed that a ghost came out of the criminal's body, notifying Jeremy, the ghost then appeared with Hawkman annoyed and mocking him, however, he did not seem to care much. Later, Hawkman returned to the St. Roch Museum where the crime scene occurred, there he was questioned by a detective, after Hawkman gave descriptions of the thief mentioning that he worked for Intergang, the detective quickly deduced that it was Jim Craddock.[2]\n\nIn that, Jeremy observed how from the pieces of the relic The Champion the figure of the ghost of Craddock appeared so that later a mist began to appear, which alerted Hawkman who quickly activated his wings in a defensive position and then realized that both Jeremy as the detective on the case had disappeared, so worried he spoke to Jeremy in case he heard him, asking him to remain calm since it was just a fog.\n\nHowever it suddenly began to freeze so Hawkman covered himself with his wings to warm up, but the Nth metal that heated them stopped working, in that Hawkman heard a scream from Jeremy asking for help so he tried to look for him. Hawkman then heard a mysterious voice to which he asked who it was, so it replied that it was the man he killed, confusing Hall who did not remember having killed someone, so the angry voice yelled at him.\n\nThe voice mentioned that if Hawkman cared about his own work he would still be alive, however Hawkman asked him to please explain who he was, in that a light began to blind Hawkman so he covered himself, only to receive attacks from ice by Jim Craddock with a machine, due to the pain he was receiving Hawkman tried to fly up, however Craddock manipulated his vision to make him fall to the ground crashing into snow.\n\nIn that, Hawkman observed the ghost and realized that it was James Craddock so the ghost told him that he was no longer that person and transforming into two forms he began to hit Hawkman breaking his helmet, the ghost then seeing the Carter Hall's face claimed to know who he was, throwing verbal attacks at him, treating him as a coward and irrelevant, teleporting him into a glass cage from which he could not get out.\n\nHall saw an illusion of Doctor Fate in front of him which told him that he could not escape, causing a confused Hawkman to address him as Kent, however this illusion did not go up to what he meant by that name, so this reminded him as they had fought together in the Justice Society, the vision then proceeded to take off his helmet showing a skull and screaming that the future was lost and then vanish, causing Hall's confusion, who whispered regret with Kent.\n\nAt that, two women created by Craddock's illusion appeared to observe Hawkman on display, returning for a moment in the actual museum exhibit the guide mentioned Hawkman's name while the other woman denoted not having heard him in years, Craddock would then introduce herself. threatening to kill the woman with a knife as Hawkman pleaded with him not to, Craddock would instead kill both women and then taunt Hawkman for not being able to do anything about it.\n\nThe ghost then killed an illusion of Jeremy while emphasizing to Hall that he couldn't even save his friends, so Hawkman in a fit of rage began pounding his display case hard, finally destroying it, while Craddock prepared to kill the hero and fulfill his deal with the demons to return to life. Hawkman with all his anger activated his armor and his mallet to attack Jim Craddock while the ghost was very convinced of defeating him.\n\nWhen Craddock approached him with his knife, Hawkman hit the criminal with his mallet causing Jim to be scared to see that despite being a ghost he could take hits, causing a sonic boom that knocked Hall to the ground. Craddock then grabbed a piece of The Champion's artifact hoping to use it to kill Hall however it caused him burns and weakened him. Hawkman then took advantage and grabbed a piece of the artifact.\n\nHawkman commented to James Craddock that he didn't kill him and that he killed himself by not listening to his warnings, Carter then proceeded to embed the piece in his chest while yelling at him that he wasn't even listening at the moment. A portal to the underworld then opened which submerged Jim as Hall retreated mentioning that he wasn't ready to die yet, finally freeing himself from Jim Craddock's spells.[2]\n\nHawkman soon returned to the crime scene at the museum and was reunited with Jeremy, happy to see that Jeremy was alive. Jeremy asked if everything was alright to which Hawkman held up a piece of the artifact and told him to believe that a piece of The Champion reacted with the spirit of Craddock sending him back to his world.\n\nJeremy didn't believe him when he told him about ghosts and thought that Hawkman just hit his head during the explosion, but Carter explained that eternium really could work miracles, which was what he needed if Craddock told the truth, since when seeing the piece he could see that a threat was approaching and that he could not defeat it alone, visualizing an image of Doctor Fate in the crystal.[2]\n\nIn search of new recruits to stop the threat, Hall began surfing the internet coming across information about the metahuman Maxine Hunkel discovering her origins, being impressed with her powers and her commitment to saving people, he eventually considered inducting her into the Justice Society. Hawkman would soon fly towards Cyclone's location while she was fighting a person who consumed the Tar drug.\n\nAfter Hunkel stopped the attacks, she began to be surrounded by multiple people who criticized her for asking her to help, so she ran into an alley. Hawkman then found her in the place and flew on top of her, causing her to be alerted by activating her powers, so Hawkman greeted her as she peacefully descended to the ground, causing Maxine to become nervous, who could not believe what she was seeing thaat her idol came to meet her.\n\nHunkel repeated Hawkman's name twice causing Hawkman to respond by saying he knew her from seeing her online, to later denote how Hunkel's powers were impressive, to which she was flattered and nervous said that it was no big deal, to which Hawkman said they were definitely impressive. Hawkman then continued talking about how the person Maxine was fighting had consumed a Tar, so he asked her if she knew something about it.\n\nSeeing that Maxine did not know what it was, Hawkman explained that it was a drug that gave the user superpowers for a limited time but that made them furious. Hawkman then proceeded to mention that she was putting together a team, then proposing to Maxine to join the Justice Society, for which she, very nervous, did not know what to answer and ended up rejecting the offer, to quickly run regretting her decision, while Hawkman looked her very confused.\n\nMaxine soon faced Detective King who consumed the substance, managing to win the confrontation, however he would threaten her with a weapon, so Hawkman, who was flying over the place, would see the situation and throw his mace, seriously hitting King's hand and causing the pistol to fall to the ground. Hawkman then proceeded to swoop down from the sky to pick one of the thugs up as he was scared to see him, Hawkman then introduced himself to Maxine again to tell her about the Justice Society and ask her if everything was alright, calling her Cyclone as she accepted to be part of the team.[6]\n\nLater, Hall discovered that Al Pratt's nephew, Albert Rothstein, had size-changing powers as well as a strong desire to become a vigilante, so Carter contacted Pratt to recruit his nephew into the Justice Society. Pratt then would end up sending his suit to Rothstein to join the team.[5]\n\nAs the last member to recruit in the team, Carter decided to team up with his old friend Kent Nelson. Carter was about to call Nelson to rejoin the team, but Nelson used his powers to predict his action and called first, causing Hall to be impressed, he then tried  to propose him returning, however Kent again deduced his proposal, surprising him for finding out, Nelson then agreed to fight side by side with Hall once more.[7]\n\nAfter the release of Teth-Adam and the massacre he caused, Hall contacted Amanda Waller who showed him footage of the event, Hall stated that Adam had to be stopped before more people were hurt, also wishing a good morning to Waller, who mentioned that the more time Adam had to adapt, the harder it would be to stop him, Hall then said that in 30 minutes they would fly to Khandaq.\n\nWhen Waller asked about the team members, Hall informed her about Maxine Hunkel and her intelligence endowed with wind powers, Waller then asked about someone who could hit, so Hall told her about Atom Smasher and his powers, but since Waller considered them rookies Hall mentioned that he recruited Kent Nelson, being confident in stopping Adam, he asked her to get a cell for him. After ending the call, Hall looked at his suit, stating that the mission was going to be fun.\n\nHall and the Society met at Hawkman's estate, preparing to take off they headed to the Hawk Cruiser as he explained the mission objective. Inside the ship, Hall told Hunkel that his ship was made of Nth metal. Carter steered the ship out of the mansion, leaving the ship on autopilot. During the trip, Hall and Nelson received information from Waller about Adam, considering him a villain. Hall taunted Nelson as he missed him saying cryptic things, as Nelson considered the plan wasn't good, Hall agreed, though he considered a bad plan better than no plan at all.\n\nAfter learning about Teth-Adam's story, Hall met with the team, explaining to Albert Rothstein that Adam was a weapon of mass destruction, and answering Hunkel's question about how to stop him, saying that they could negotiate peacefully to deactivate his powers by saying \"Shazam!\". Hall then interrupted his teammates, informing that they had already reached Kahndaq.[1]\n\nArriving at Shiruta, the team observed Adam flying and preparing to shoot down Intergang soldiers, so he quickly gave orders to Rothstein and Hunkel on what to do, but seeing that Adam threw down the soldiers, Hall quickly jumped off the Cruiser, activating his suit and heading to rescue the soldiers, but upon landing and putting them safe he received boos from the people, so Hawkman mentioned not knowing their crimes but that they would pay justice.\n\nWhen Adam descended killing the soldiers and confronted Hawkman, Hall introduced himself as a member of the Justice Society and their purpose, threatening to use force if necessary, to which Adam agreed stating that force was always necessary. After Adam rejected Nelson's offer of surrender, Adam fired lightning bolts at Nelson and Hall, so Carter took cover by activating his shield, asking Nelson to distract him.\n\nAdam was distracted with an illusion of the old Kahndaq, to which Hall took the opportunity to hit him by flying towards him and taking him out of the illusion, when Adam got up, Carter asked him to just say \"Shazam!\" to end the problem, but as Adam refused, Hall activated his mace and jumped to attack him. However, Adam parried the attack with his hand, firing a beam at Hall knocking him into a car. Recovering, Hall flew off fighting Adam, dishing out blows between them.\n\nHall then used his mallet to recharge an electric strike with Adam, allowing Nelson and Hunkel to hold him back, as he was stopped, Hall helped by launching a car at Adam who stopped it by releasing an electric shock, defeating all three. As the Atom Smasher came to smash Adam, Hall congratulated the team, but quickly went into alert seeing Adam get up, ordering Alert not to raise his fist, however Adam broke free and escaped, frustrating Hall.[1]\n\nAfter the battle, Hall argued with Nelson about how to trap Teth-Adam as he was too powerful, demanding that for the next encounter with Adam, Nelson should see the future to find out how it all ended. In that, Hall saw Nelson meeting Adrianna Tomaz, suspecting that she had the Crown of Sabbac, until Maxine Hunkel arrived to report that Adam was in Kahndaq's palace. Hall requested to go after Adam before he recovers, but received Tomaz's complaint for wanting to stop Adam and never showing up to stop the invasions in Kahndaq.\n\nHall told her that Adam wasn't a hero, something that Tomaz repressed, showing how people were glad with Adam's return. Accepting Tomaz's ideal, Hall assured her that the team came to help, but that he was forced to scold Atom Smasher when he accidentally destroyed a statue, asking Tomaz to see the crown, however he checked the backpack and saw that she didn't have it. Hall then told her the truth about the massacre in Kahndaq, stating that they wanted to prevent another massacre, convincing her to take them to Adam to talk peacefully.\n\nArriving at the palace, Hall and the Society waited for Tomaz to convince Adam to let them talk, once allowed, they entered where Hall asked Adam for a peaceful surrender, stating that Adam should not be in Kahndaq, however Adam mentioned that they were the ones who should go, something Hall accepted, but with him as a prisoner, threatening a fight that was interrupted when Tomaz notified that her son was being chased by Intergang in an attempt to get the crown.[1]\n\nAfter Adam went to Amon Tomaz's rescue, Hall and the Justice Society returned to the Hawk Cruiser attempting to help him in his pursuit with Intergang. Parking in front of some escaping hover bikes, Hawkman flew down grabbing one of the hover bikes, using his vision scanner to figure out which bike he was on, but was interrupted by Adam, Hawkman followed Adam by getting upset with him for killing people.\n\nHall proposed to help him find Amon Tomaz if he would agree to stop killing, which Adam refused as he destroyed the bike, forcing Hall to save him. In an act of desperation, Hall requested the support of Hunkel and Rothstein who came down to help, Hawkman followed Adam until he collided with Atom Smasher's hand, falling to the ground. In pain from the blow, Hall scolded Rothstein, threatening to argue when they got back to the cruiser, something that he considered fair.[1]\n\nHawkman managed to capture two soldiers whom he planned to use as prisoners to reveal information, taking them to the Tomaz residence, upon arriving, Hawkman explained to him that keeping enemies alive has advantages by being able to force them to answer his questions. When Adrianna Tomaz began beating the soldiers to make them reveal the location of her son, Hall and Nelson were surprised to see how Adam explained her that they should treat prisoners with respect.\n\nAdam would soon lift the soldiers up into the air, causing Hawkman to chase after him, threatening him not to drop them, but Adam mentioned that he would only release one, which he dropped causing Hall to come to his rescue, but he ran away. He was annoyed when he saw that the other soldier had also been thrown, going to save him. Upon landing back with the prisoners, Hawkman was angry at Adam for still wanting to kill people.\n\nHowever, Teth-Adam explained that he expected Hawkman to go to save the Intergang soldiers, explaining how technically he didn't kill anyone and got the information he needed, upset, Hawkman decided to confront Teth-Adam, interrupting Adrianna Tomaz who requested to go after her son Amon, Carter Hall then claimed that there were only heroes and villains in the world and that Adam was not a hero, but Teth-Adam denoted Carter Hall's hypocrisy for letting criminals live knowing that they can kill people. Filled with anger, Hawkman then claimed that heroes didn't kill people, so Teth-Adam approached him intimidatingly and mentioned that he did.\n\nFed up with Adam, Hawkman activated his mace and prepared to attack him, however Adam defended himself by hitting him, when Hawkman tried to hit him with the mallet, Adam teleported behind him twice, grabbing him with his leg and throwing him against the wall. Hawkman got up and activated his wings, throwing some furniture at Adam which did not affect him. Hawkman prepared to fly towards him, so Adam decided to teleport to grab his leg again, throwing him into Amon's bedroom.\n\nAdam then flew towards him and started punching him, destroying multiple posters and action figures of Amon, when Hawkman tried to hitting him, Adam dodged, grabbing him again to hit him, but seeing that he began to protect himself with his shield, Adam tried to throw a lightning bolt at him. The fight finally stopped when Hall saw that Adam was weakened by Eternium, discovering that behind Amon's crate, was the Crown of Sabbac and they took it to the Hawk Cruiser.[1]\n\nInside the ship, Hall explained that the crown was made of Eternium, listening to the message the crown contained that Life is the only path to death, something that Rothstein misinterpreted and Hall told him to shut up. Hall then argued again with Adam about imprisoning him after it's all over, asking Tomaz to give him the crown to keep her safe, however Tomaz refused and demanded everyone to work on the same side until they got Amon back.\n\nHall then proceeded to plot the course to the Al Hadidiyah Mountains, taunting Adam for having to work as a team. During the trip, Hall received a conversation from Kent Nelson who reminded him of the motto that a bad plan is better than none, to which Hall recognized that working with Adam was a bad plan, stating that he was a murderer. Nelson mentioned that they couldn't decide who lived or died, but Hall asked him what the Helmet of Fate was telling him until he deduced that someone was going to die.\n\nSuspecting it was Albert Rothstein, Hall then realized that it was himself who was going to die, but Nelson chose not to elaborate further, realizing that there was time to change the future, Hall agreed to go along with the plan. Upon arrival, Hall explained the plan to everyone on how to infiltrate the Al Hadidiyah Mine, but quickly realized that Adam went ahead and attacked the mine himself, frustrating Hall who had to scrap his plan, being annoyed as Rothstein supported Adam's idea.\n\nThe Justice Society along with Tomaz accompanied Adam to save Amon from Ishmael Gregor, who demanded the Crown of Sabbac, to which Hawkman stated that they did not have it, but Tomaz decided to give it to him to save his son, causing Hall and Nelson tried to stop her, however Adam got in the way and helped Tomaz while threatening them. When Gregor was revealed to be the last descendant of King Ahk-Ton, Hall heard about how Adam wept for Hurut.\n\nHall and the Society watched as Gregor released the trigger of his weapon to kill Amon and as Adam stopped him by launching himself and generating a huge discharge of energy, Hall then used his wings to shield Tomaz from the blast, which totally destroyed the mines that ended with Intergang. After the explosion, Hawkman and the Society met with the Tomazs, seeing how Adam left feeling guilty, so Hall decided to follow him, asking Hunkel and Rothstein to find the crown and take it to the ship.[1]\n\nHawkman arrived at the palace of Kahndaq where he demanded that Adam to surrender, but Adam reminded him that no one could stop him, with Hall convincing him that only could surrender himself, asking about Hurut. Adam explained that Hurut was the true champion of Kahndaq, who sacrificed to transfer his powers to him, surprising Hall to realize that the statue was in honor of Hurut. Adam accepted the guilty for all the damage caused and decided to surrender, Hall respected his decision as he watched Adam utter \"Shazam!\" to return to his normal form.\n\nCarrying Teth-Adam asleep on a stretcher, Hall and the team traveled on the Falcon Cruiser to the Task Force X Black Site, under an ocean in Antarctica, upon landing at the base, Hall and Kent Nelson carried Adam where they were greeted by Emilia Harcourt and a group of A.R.G.U.S. soldiers, Hall warned them to be careful with him, Harcourt then bided farewell to them and the duo boarded the cruiser to take the Tomazs back to Kahndaq.\n\nAs they flew back, Hall observed that Nelson still had premonitions, so he put the cruise on autopilot and asked him what was wrong, discovering that Nelson's vision did not change, worrying Hall that Adam was no longer a threat, demanding Nelson to know what was going to happen, where explained that Hall had to die and that everything ended with a battle.\n\nHall didn't fear the fate but Nelson did, since Hall had to free the Justice Society. Hall reminded him that they could not choose who lived or died, while Nelson told Hall about his childhood and how he saw the world change. Hall and Nelson later observed in the sensors the sudden presence of the demon Sabbac, going to Shiruta where Hall started to shoot him, however Sabbac burned the cruiser, causing them to crash to the ground.[1]\n\nManaging to survive and with his companions attacking Sabbac, Hall activated his suit and asked them to prevent Gregor from sitting on the throne of the Kahndaq Palace, Hall then lunged at Gregor and began to attack him hitting him with his mace, until Gregor hit him, so he transformed his mallet into an ax to attack him, however it disappeared. Hawkman activated his infrared vision but Sabbac took him by surprise, but Hawkman managed to stab him claiming to avenge his ship, however the demon threw him against a building.\n\nGetting up, the team gathered heading towards the Palace to fight Sabbac, however Kent Nelson activated a protective shield in the palace, preventing them from entering, making Hall cry because he had to die, ending up discovering that Nelson had to die so that Hall to live, deciding to sacrifice himself for the world while Hall desperately used the mallet to try to break the shield, ordering Hunkel and Rothstein to help him.\n\nCarter Hall continued to hit the shield to try and destroy it to no avail until it disappeared, allowing the team to enter. Hall quickly ran with the others into the palace, only to watch in agony as Nelson was killed by Sabbac, letting out a cry of sadness at losing his friend. Filled with rage, Hall, Hunkel, and Rothstein attempted to confront Gregor as he sat on the throne and summoned the Legions of Hell, and caused a massive explosion in the palace that knocked the Society out.\n\nSabbac took Hawkman into the air and began to break his wings, however Teth-Adam would arrive to stop him by punching him in the face and freeing Hall, who, rising from the rubble, asked Adam to kill Sabbac. Seeing that Adam was in trouble from his battle with Gregor, Hall found the Helmet of Fate, so he decided to use it to create a copy of himself and ram a pipe through Sabbac's back.\n\nWhen Sabbac unconsciously killed the Hawkman copy, he was confused to see it disappear, so Hall mockingly appeared behind him, mentioning that he learned that trick from Nelson, summoning several copies of himself to face and hold Gregor, allowing Adam to attack him with a lightning attack, joining forces to defeat him, with Adam finally ripping Sabbac in half and wiping out the Legions of Hell.\n\nAfter the battle, Hall was helped by Teth-Adam to get up, trusting him, Hall admitted to being happy to see him back, leaving their rivalry behind, to which Adam mentioned that he came back thanks to Nelson. Hall then took the Helmet of Fate to say goodbye to Nelson as he watched it disintegrate, accepting the death of his friend.\n\nWhen the Tomazs arrived at the Palace, Hall jokingly requested Adrianna Tomaz that she could keep Adam in check, warning that the kind of justice Adam exercised could darken the soul, to which Tomaz told him that Adam's darkness allowed him to do what other heroes couldn't, making Hall laugh, who wondered if he was right, Hall then took his leave along with the Justice Society to leave Kahndaq.[1]\n\nWith a suit of armor constructed by gravity-defying Nth metal, Hawkman combines his physical prowess with a strong sense of morality. Instilling years of knowledge and experience into the younger members of the burgeoning Justice Society, the man known as Carter Hall has fought for millennia to protect global stability–and he won’t let anything or anyone, including Black Adam, stand in his way.[9] Hawkman is a hero with a serious character who is concerned with fulfilling his duty as a vigilante, inflicting terror on his enemies and willing to protect people's lives at all costs, regardless of the individual's evil. When Jim Craddock accidentally dies and Jeremy is more concerned about recovering the stolen item, Carter rubs him about how that was the least of it since Craddock died. Hall can also be sentimental, missing his friend Kent Nelson and worrying that Jeremy wouldn't die at Craddock's hands.\n\nHall was also a very insecure person who suffers from the opinion of others despite the fact that he tries to hide it; this weakness was used by James Craddock in his spiritual version to torment Hawkman by making him relive a moment in which some people didn't even remember the hero Hawkman, Hall had a problem with Doctor Fate trying to mourn him when Craddock created an illusion. When Hawkman recruited Maxine Hunkel, he was very kind and understanding with her, understanding that she was very nervous during the first encounter and giving her a second chance to join the Justice Society.\n\nHawkman firmly believed that the world was divided into good guys and bad guys, so when he saw Teth-Adam killing Intergang soldiers, he considered him a threat and tried to do everything possible to stop him, receiving complaints from Nelson, Tomaz and Adam himself for having such binary morality. However, this did not matter much to Hall, who still distrusted Adam even after his surrender, who tried to convince him that keeping enemies alive had its advantages, having a rivalry with him, despite Adam pointing out Hall's hypocrisy in leaving criminals alive knowing that they could cause more deaths. Realizing that Adam wasn't the true threat and that they had to face Sabbac, Hall attempted to accept his fate of sacrificing himself so that Nelson would not die, due to his sentimentality, despite Nelson already stopping him. Having Adam's help in defeating Sabbac, Hawkman understood that heroes could also kill when necessary, gaining more trust in him and leaving their rivalry behind.",
