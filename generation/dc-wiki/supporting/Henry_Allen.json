  "content": "Henry Allen is the husband of Nora Allen and the father of Barry Allen. Following his wife's murder in 2004, Henry was falsely convicted of killing her and sentenced to Iron Heights Penitentiary.\n\nHenry Allen graduated from university with a doctorate, and later met Nora, whom he would later marry. and had their son Barry Allen.[1]\n\nIn 2004, Nora Allen was murdered in their home by Reverse Flash, and Henry Allen was falsely convicted for her death and sentenced to Iron Heights Penitentiary.[2] His son Barry would often visit Henry there.[3]\n\nAt Iron Heights Penitentiary, Henry was visited by his son, Barry Allen, who was obsessed with proving his father's innocence and said he would keep visiting him. Henry, however, had lost faith that he would ever be proven innocent and that he would likely spend the rest of his life in prison, and so he asked Barry to move on and not visit him again before being taken away by a guard.\n\nLater, Barry Allen was recruited as part of a team to stop Steppenwolf and the invading forces of Apokolips. During their assault, the team failed to stop the Mother Boxes from combining, leading to a chain reaction that killed the rest of the team and began to subsume and terraform the entire Earth. As the shockwaves spread out, possibly even killing Henry, Barry finished healing himself and began to run faster and faster until he went faster than the speed of light, intending to reverse time to the right moment. As he embarked on his desperate gamble, Barry recited a proud farewell to his father in case he died in his attempt, although his father was not present to hear his words. As it turned out, his farewell was not necessary, as Barry indeed managed to turn back time and help Cyborg and Superman stop the Mother Boxes from fully combining.\n\nBarry would later return to show Henry that he got a job at the Central City Police Department Crime Laboratory, to which, Henry began to shout and laugh in joy, prompting Barry to joke that he might get tased again.[3]\n\nAfter a day of helping to prevent a robbery in Gotham and a day at work, Barry would talk to his father over the phone about the CCTV footage from the day of Nora's murder, he'd been given from Bruce Wayne who'd deciphered the footage using Wayne Enterprise technology. However, since Henry was wearing a cap and didn't look up at any point, his face could not be seen from the camera meaning the footage was ultimately useless. Henry told Barry it was OK and how he'd rather be stuck in prison convincing himself his wife was still alive rather than out of prison knowing she was dead. Barry went outside his old family home and remembered the day she died in which Henry had gone out to get extra can of tomatoes from the grocery store. Eventually the call was cut off, leaving Barry to run so fast he discoverered the Chronobowl which made him wonder if he could save both his parents from their fates. Despite being warned by Bruce Wayne about the dangers of time travel, a talk with Iris West convinced him if he went back in time to the moment Nora was at the store he could both prevent her murder and Henry being wrongly accused and sent down and he wouldn't be altering time drastically.\n\nHenry Allen is an innocent man, being falsely convicted for the murder of his wife. Despite this, he wants the best for his son's future and asked him to never visit him again, though Barry still visited him.",
