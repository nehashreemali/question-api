  "content": "Iris West is a Central City journalist and former college classmate of Barry Allen. After being rescued by her old friend from a car accident, West became interested in Allen's family history and, years later, tried to help him free his father Henry Allen.\n\nIris West was born between 1997 and 1998[1] and enrolled as a journalism major at Central City College. Around 2013, West met and befriended Barry Allen from the forensic science career, unaware that Allen secretly had a crush on West, something that his father Henry Allen would later find out about.[2]\n\nIn 2017, while leaving Central Bark Doggy Day Care, she accidentally ran into Barry Allen, whom she briefly stared at, recognizing him as her former college classmate. West got into her car to leave, though it had trouble starting. When it finally started, she again briefly exchanged glances with Allen, when a food truck suddenly sped into her path, causing West's car to crash into the truck and her to be thrown out of the vehicle.\n\nSuddenly, Allen used his Speed ​​Force superpowers to rush out of the daycare, smashing the windows, and rescue West in slow motion to bring her to safety on the ground, while her vehicle fell to the other side of the track and exploded into flames, for her in a matter of seconds. Shocked and confused, West watched Allen on top of her, but upon seeing her, he instantly disappeared before her eyes, leaving West even more confused.[3]\n\nAfter graduating, West was hired as an editor at a Central City newspaper, where, still intrigued by her mysterious rescue, she became interested in Barry Allen's family tragedy story about her mother's murder. In 2022, West and a group of reporters were attending David Singh's statement outside the Central City Research Center regarding the closure of the Johnson case by the Forensic Department of the police, when West noticed Allen watching them. After Singh finished, West approached Allen and his colleagues Patty Spivot and Albert Desmond to greet him.\n\nAllen made his colleagues, who had mocked him for having only one friend from college, leave to talk to West, who mentioned that she thought he had seen him years ago, referring to the car rescue. Allen, however, quickly denied this, and West asked him about his father's case and his appeal trial. Believing it was for his story, Allen said his only official comment was that his father was innocent, with West commenting that no one would want to believe that his father killed his mother. Although West realized his offensive comment and attempted to apologize to Allen, he decided to back out of the conversation.[2]\n\nThat night, West visited Barry Allen's apartment building, just after Bruce Wayne drove away in his Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6. West commented on the vehicle, though Allen claimed it was an Uber Executive; she then asked to go up to his apartment to talk. When she entered, West was surprised to see his apartment clean, expecting to find it dirty and messy, though seconds later, a large amount of trash flew out of a closet. Despite this, Allen gave West a beer while they talked, and she again apologized for her earlier comment, believing she should have been more sensitive about the issue.\n\nAllen opened his beer and it spilled completely, though West continued to talk, focusing on Allen's history of tragedy, believing that he entered the career of forensic science to fix the flaws of the justice system. Her comment gave Allen the idea to correct that tragic event by traveling back in time, though West did not understand what Allen was saying, believing that he was going crazy. At that, Allen remembered that his mother had been murdered because his father had gone to buy a can of tomatoes, believing that if his father had not left, she would not have been murdered. Excited by his idea, Allen thanked West for the visit and quickly left his apartment, commenting that they should repeat their date, while she heard more trash falling out of another closet.[2]",
