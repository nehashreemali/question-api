  "content": "Thomas \"Tom\" Curry is the husband of Queen Atlanna and the father of Arthur Curry.\n\nDuring a storm in Amnesty Bay, Tom Curry was trying to fix a broken window in his lighthouse when he saw the unconscious body of Atlanna in the distance. Curry rescued her from the shore to take her to her house, however, when Atlanna woke up from her, she attacked Curry, believing that he was an enemy, and then passed out again from her injuries, for which Curry began to heal her. The next morning, Curry met Atlanna again after she ate one of her fish, inviting her over for tea, beginning to warm to her.\n\nOver time, Curry offered Atlanna lodging, with whom he fell in love. After a few months, Atlanna gave birth to their little son, whom they named Arthur Curry after Hurricane Arthur and in honor of the legend of King Arthur, Atlanna, believing that her young son was the one destined to one day reunite the surface and the seas, as well as become the King of Atlantis, told him stories about the legend of the Trident of Atlanna.\n\nOne day, while Atlanna was telling the story of the Trident of Atlan to little Arthur Curry, a group of Men-of-War sent by King Orvax attacked the lighthouse, due to Atlanna's defection from Atlantis, and finding herself surrounded, Atlanna decided to fight the soldiers until defeating them one by one with the help of Curry, who threw the trident at her to fight.\n\nForced to return to Atlantis to protect Thomas and Arthur, Atlanna had to say goodbye to them, while Thomas tried to talk her out of it, but Atlanna promised that she would return to them one day when it is safe, so they could be together again. For the next twenty years, Thomas began taking walks to the pier every morning, waiting for Atlanna's return, while he took care of Arthur.[1]\n\nBy 2018, Thomas had become used to his son becoming a publicly-known hero called Aquaman. While he and Arthur were drinking beer at a local bar and discussing Arthur's heroic rescue of several Russian Navy soldiers, a tough-looking group of patrons approached the two with seeming intent to pick a fight, but who rather wanted pictures with Arthur.\n\nIn the night, Tom and Arthur left the bar to go back to the lighthouse, where Thomas waited in his vehicle, while Arthur talked with Mera about stopping Orm Marius to which Arthur refused. As they were driving to the lighthouse, a gigantic wave washed up on the shoreline of Amnesty Bay, flipping the vehicle over, but luckily, Mera showed up to help Arthur and save Tom, using her hydrokinetic powers to expel the water from inside.[1]\n\nAfter Arthur defeated Orm and was crowned as the rightful King of Atlantis, Thomas walked down to the pier once more until he was surprised to Atlanna waiting for him. At the sight of his one true love, Thomas rushed up to Atlanna and happily embraced her, before they shared a kiss.[1]\n\nThomas is dedicated, compassionate and courageous. He is supportive of his son's heroics and believes in him more than Arthur did. He also loved his wife Atlanna and would wait at the pier every morning until she came back twenty years later.",
