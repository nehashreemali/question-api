  "content": "Nuidis Vulko was the chief counselor to the throne of Atlantis, and secretly served as the mentor to Aquaman. He helped Arthur and guided him down a journey alongside Mera to locate the Trident of Atlan, which allowed Arthur to defeat his half-brother Orm and become the new King of Atlantis, with Vulko feeling proud of his protégé.\n\nVulko taught young Arthur Curry much about Atlantis, such as his Atlantean heritage, and trained him in martial arts. He promised Arthur he would be able to see his mother soon when he was ready, but Arthur became frustrated after years of passing tests and being presented with more.[1][2]\n\nAfter years of training, Vulko finally revealed to frustrated Arthur that Orvax, the previous king of Atlantis, had sentenced her to the Trench upon finding out she gave birth to Arthur with a Surface dweller which was considered high treason. Before her scheduled execution, she made her trusted confidant promise to always watch over and protect her son.[2] After learning his mother's fate was kept secret from him for all his years, he angrily discarded his trident and threw it at Vulko, never seeing it again until years later.\n\nDecades later, after saving a Welsh fisherman, Arthur travelled to a particular place underwater containing a statue of King Atlan. There, he was met by Vulko, who expressed his dissatisfaction with Arthur's continued refusal to take on his royal responsibilities. Vulko further remarked that Arthur never slept in the same place twice, but continued to return to that particular place. Vulko then once more admonished Arthur, telling him that it was time to take up his mother's Trident, especially given the circumstances of the disappearing Atlanteans and the brewing blame cast by King Orm on the surface. Arthur however gave his silent refusal, causing Vulko to lose his patience and throw down Atlanna's Trident and his armor. He then mentioned that Arthur could not keep running away from his duties, before leaving Arthur to his devices.\n\nLater, when Arthur intervened in Steppenwolf's retrieval of the Atlantean Mother Box, Mera told Arthur that Vulko had informed her he might arrive.\n\nWhen Steppenwolf started synchronizing the Mother Boxes, Vulko was with Mera and a few other Atlanteans as they started to notice the effects of the Invasion.\n\nAfter the victory over Steppenwolf, Arthur met Mera and Vulko on the shores of Amnesty Bay and bade farewell, as he stated he would be going off to meet his father. Vulko's expression seemed to imply that he was proud of Arthur, and though Arthur still rejected making any commitments, he seemed to think Arthur had taken his first step to accepting destiny.[3]\n\nVulko found an artifact that might lead them to the Trident of Atlan. Both he and Mera aided Arthur in secret while staying by the side of Orm openly. However, when Orm prepares to go to war, he reveals that he has always known of Vulko's treachery over the years and imprisons him, keeping Vulko by his side as he strove to unite all the kingdoms of Atlantis for his war on the surface world.[2]\n\nDuring the attack on the Kingdom of the Brine, the battle was interrupted by Aquaman, who arose from the Hidden Sea commanding the Karathen and wielding the Trident of Atlan. Vulko then smiled, remarking that the true king had risen. As the battle moved to the surface, Mera infiltrated Orm's flagship and dispatched Vulko's guard. Vulko denied Mera's request for him to take on Orm, knowing that for Arthur to fully be accepted as king by all of Atlanteans, he has to prove his superiority and defeat Orm by himself.\n\nVulko watched with growing pride as Aquaman started to gain the upper hand over Orm and smirked when Orm was finally defeated by Aquaman using the ultimate trident technique of Atlantis Vulko had taught him in his youth. Subsequently, Vulko was surprised when a very much alive Atlanna showed up and convinced Orm to surrender. Vulko subsequently led a squad of Atlantean soldiers to greet Atlanna before ordering Orm imprisoned but added the former king at least have a view as the Atlanteans proclaim Arthur their new king.[2]\n\nVulko would later perish to global warming related issues, having a major impact on his protégé.\n\nVulko taught a young Arthur Curry about his Atlantean heritage and trained him in secret in preparation for his return to Atlantis. As Vizier of Atlantis, he is the voice of reason in Orm's court and works behind his back to stop a genocidal war. In general, he is a good-hearted man with a strong sense of justice who cares about protecting Atlantis and its people.",
