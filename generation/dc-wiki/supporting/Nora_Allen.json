  "content": "Nora Allen was the wife of Henry Allen and the mother of Barry Allen. She was killed by Reverse-Flash, with the blame being wrongly placed upon her husband, who was jailed as a result.\n\nNora met and married Henry Allen, with whom she conceived a son named Barry. On the morning of June 13, 2004, Nora went to the supermarket with Barry to buy ingredients for lunch. Upon arriving home, Nora began to cook while Barry did a task in which he needed to find all the mathematical operations whose result was 24, getting frustrated when he didn't find the solution.\n\nNora then told him that not all problems had a specific solution, claiming that he needed to give up on some occasions, asking Barry to help her cook lunch, however, to her surprise, she discovered that Barry had forgotten to take another can of tomato puree from the supermarket to prepare the pasta for lunch, calling Henry to ask him go to the supermarket to buy another. When Henry left, Nora turned up the volume on the radio and began singing and dancing to \"Pedro Navaja\" with her son, and then hugged him affectionately.[1]\n\nWhen Barry went up to his room to continue his homework, Nora remained alone in the kitchen.[1] Suddenly, Nora was brutally stabbed in the stomach with a kitchen knife by time traveler known as Reverse-Flash, who disappeared after the act.[2] Shortly after, Henry Allen returned from the supermarket to find his wife injured in the kitchen, desperately trying to help her, alerting Barry who he asked to call the ambulance immediately as Nora lay dying and eventually died in his arms.[1]\n\nFollowing her death, Henry Allen was framed for the murder and imprisoned in Iron Heights Penitentiary with a life sentence,[3] despite Barry Allen trying to prove his father's innocence for many years. Dedicated to clearing his father's name and freeing him from prison, Barry was motivated to study forensic science and criminal law at Central City University, hoping to one day free his father for a murder he did not commit.[4]\n\nAfter being overwhelmed with emotions over Nora's death, Barry went back in time to prevent her murder. Although he succeeded, a new timeline was created and an event known as Flashpoint almost caused the collapse of the Multiverse, prompting Barry to come to terms with Nora's death and reverse the changes caused to the timeline, although he was able to make a minor change, by leaving evidence that freed Henry from prison and cleared his murder charges.[1]",
