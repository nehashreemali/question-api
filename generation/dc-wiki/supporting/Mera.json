  "content": "Y'Mera Xebella Challa, simply referred to as Mera, is the daughter of King Nereus, the princess of Xebel, and the wife of Aquaman, the current king and former prince of Atlantis. She is the mother of the heir to the Atlantean throne, Arthur Curry, Jr.\n\nDuring Orm's campaign against the surface world in what would become the War for Atlantis, Mera assisted Arthur at the behest of Nuidis Vulko, despite being betrothed to Orm by her father, and helped him locate the lost Trident of Atlan in the Hidden Sea, allowing Arthur to finally usurp the throne from Orm and take his place as the rightful King of Atlantis. Mera's journey with Arthur also caused the two of them to develop romantic feelings towards each other, which culminated with the two exchanging a brief kiss during the Battle of the Brine. Some time later Arthur and Mera got married and became the parents of Arthur Curry, Jr.\n\nMera was born sometime around the year 1985 or 1986 as the daughter of King Nereus of Xebel.[2] When her parents were forced to leave her behind during the Xebel Wars, Mera was taken in by Queen Atlanna of Atlantis, who raised her alongside her own son Orm and trained her over the years as the queen's protégé.[1] Over time, Mera became a prominent military figure in Atlantis and was eventually assigned to lead the Atlantean Guards in her early adulthood.[3]\n\nHence, Mera stood guard at an Atlantean outpost when the shockwaves from Superman's death reached the Mother Box, triggering it to shudder and shake slightly. Shortly afterward, the Mother Box activated, alerting her and the remaining Xebelian soldiers nearby. As she went to investigate, a boom tube opened, from which Steppenwolf emerged, immediately attacking the Royal Guardsmen as he made his way toward his objective. As Steppenwolf neared the podium where the Mother Box sat, Mera displaced the water around him, causing him to fall to the surface below, before collapsing the water back onto him. As the New God recovered, he charged at Mera, slamming her against a nearby wall before throwing her below, knocking her unconscious.\n\nArthur then joined the battle, but was unable to prevent Steppenwolf from taking the Mother Box. Afterward, Mera creates a bubble around her and Arthur so they could talk, chastising him for finally appearing on Atlantean territory. When Arthur began to leave, Mera explained that she knew his mother, Queen Atlanna. When Arthur stated that his mother abandoned him on his father's doorstep when he was a baby, Mera tells him that Atlanna would have stayed, but she left to spare Arthur's life. She explained that Atlanna wanted to stay, and leaving Arthur and his father cost her more than he could imagine. Mera then told Arthur that he was no longer a child who couldn't defend himself, and that Steppenwolf would've been his mother's responsibility to defeat, but now the mantle passed to him.\n\nAs Steppenwolf finally began the process of uniting the three boxes, the impact of the impending unity was felt all across the globe, reaching into the stronghold that Mera, Vulko and several other individuals were gathered in.\n\nShortly after the collective triumph of the Unity of Earth's forces against Steppenwolf's army in Pozharnov, Mera and Vulko visited Arthur at Amnesty Bay to congratulate him and possibly attempt to convince him once again to take up his mother's responsibilities. But Arthur received them coldly, excusing himself by way of explaining that he had to see his father.[1]\n\nA year after the defeat of Steppenwolf, Mera left Atlantis to find Arthur Curry to tell him to come with her to Atlantis to stop Arthur's half-brother Orm from declaring war on the surface world. However, Arthur refused and left Mera as he drove home with his father Thomas Curry. Mera would save Arthur and his father from a tidal wave by using her hydrokinetic powers to move it. Arthur was then convinced to come with Mera to Atlantis.[3]\n\nMera and Arthur went to Atlantis to meet with Nuidis Vulko, Arthur's mentor, who told them the history of Atlantis and explained to them that they needed to find the Trident of Atlan in order for Arthur claim his rightful place as king. They were then suddenly ambushed by Orm's men, and Arthur held them off while Mera and Vulko escaped. Arthur was then laid unconscious and captured by Orm's men.[3]\n\nMera was in the royal box during the Duel in the Ring of Fire between Arthur and King Orm. She saved Arthur using her ship after Orm destroyed Arthur's trident. Together, they went to the Sahara desert to try to find the dead Kingdom of the Deserters in order to read the ancient artifact that held the location of the trident. After successfully locating the lost kingdom and locating the ancient piece of tech, Mera activated it once more by using her hydrokinetic powers. After they listened to the message from Atlan, Mera destroyed the ancient message container, and the two found a bottle with a map telling them to go to Sicily, Italy, where they would find the next clue.\n\nUpon their arrival in Sicily, the used the bottle to discover the way to the trident, but were attacked by Black Manta, Murk and Men-of-War. Mera fought off Murk and the Men-of-War while Arthur defeated Black Manta. They set sail and then dived through the Kingdom of the Trench and escaped through a one way portal that led to the Hidden Sea. Once through the portal, they met Atlanna, which to their shock, had survived her \"execution\" to the Trench. After Arthur survived the Karathen's test and took the Trident of Atlan from the skeleton of King Atlan, Mera witnessed his return.[3]\n\nShe would then help Arthur fight off the Men-of-War and shared a romantic kiss with him. After she informed her father that Arthur had become king, he stopped fighting. After he deposed Ocean Master and shattered his trident, she was by his side as he was hailed as king.\n\nIn the 4 years following the arrest and imprisonment of Orm, Arthur and Mera found themselves getting married and later on, Mera discovered she was pregnant. Eventually, Mera would give birth to a son named Arthur Curry, Jr. in the surf near the lighthouse, with the aid of her mother-in-law, Atlanna, while Tom filmed it. Both she and Arthur would then spend time on both land and sea, performing their duties as Atlantis' monarchs, as well as parents to Jr.\n\nDedicated and compassionate, Mera has a somewhat intimidating exterior but is still understanding (compared to other Atlanteans) and caring once she can trust someone. As Atlantean royalty, Mera was raised with a strong sense of duty to her people and country, and as such will honor her duty above her own emotions if her position requires it. For example, she was willing to marry Orm (despite her not loving him) to fulfill her duty as a Xebelian princess. Above all, however, she believes in doing what is right and ultimately best for Atlantis, which initially is why she begrudgingly works with Arthur Curry in order to prevent the harm that will come from Orm's proposed war.\n\nUpon first encounters, Mera can come off as standoffish or stubborn, but this is often a result of her determination to reach her goals. Underneath this hard exterior, Mera is actually quite selfless and caring, as seen when she saved Thomas Curry from Orm's Tsunami and tended to Arthur's wounds from his fight with Black Manta.\n\nIn her role as a warrior, Mera is also brave and quick-thinking. She led the Atlantean forces protecting their Mother Box during Steppenwolf's invasion of Earth, and also outwitted several Men-of-War after being attacked in Sicily. Outside of combat, she is also shown to be inventive in tight situations, such as when she thought to use Arthur's sweat to reactivate ancient Atlantean technology and manipulated wine with her hydrokinetic powers and was even smart enough to memorize and destroy an encoded message so that it wouldn't fall into the wrong hands, with Arthur not thinking that far ahead. As a result of this quick-thinking, however, she can also be a bit impulsive, such as when she jumped out of a plane without a parachute, intervened during the Duel in the Ring of Fire, and stole a boat from an Italian marina.\n\nMera was initially somewhat abrasive towards Arthur, notably chastising the Atlantean when he disparaged his mother Atlanna, attributing to the fact that Mera bears lingering affection for the Queen, due to the latter raising and mentoring her akin to a daughter. During their quest to find the Trident of Atlan, however, Mera noticeably began to warm up to Arthur, to the point that she instinctively reached out for his hand when there was danger seemingly present, although they quickly parted hands in embarrassment. Unfamiliar with human customs, she also displayed wide-eyed glee and childlike curiousity when exploring Sicily, mistaking a bunch of roses for food upon witnessing some inhabitants eating red food, and likewise copying them. She also retains a playful and light-hearted side in contrast to her usually standoffish disposition, notably creating water-based dolphins from a fountain and manipulating them much to the delight of a little girl. This aspect of her personality eventually drew her ever closer to the fun-seeking Arthur, with the pair almost meeting lips before being attacked by Black Manta. This underlying romantic liaison would eventually culminate in her passionately kissing Arthur, before he was to engage Orm in combat. Following Arthur's victory, Mera proudly stood alongside her newfound love with dignity and poise, as he was finally hailed King of Atlantis.\n\nNot knowing what they are, Mera seems to enjoy eating roses.[3]",
