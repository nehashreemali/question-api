  "content": "Antiope was the general of the Amazons, the sister of Hippolyta and the aunt of Diana. She was extolled by Hippolyta as the greatest warrior in the history of the Amazons. Antiope personally mentored her beloved niece, Diana in combat training for centuries leading up her death. She perished during the German invasion of Themyscira, sacrificing herself to save Diana's life during the attack.\n\nShortly after Zeus presumably created humanity, his malevolent son, Ares, attempted to corrupt them, fueling humanity with rage, hate, and bloodlust. As a result, Zeus created the Amazons as a way to help guide humanity and spread love.[1]\n\nMillennia ago, Antiope and her fellow Amazons allied themselves with the Old Gods, Mankind, the Atlanteans and the Green Lantern Corps to fight Darkseid who had come to conquer and remake the Earth into a planet similar to Apokolips. The war was eventually won by the alliance and Darkseid's army retreated, leaving the three Mother Boxes behind. The boxes were left under the control of Mankind, the Amazons and the Atlanteans.[2]\n\nAfter the attempted invasion, Ares induced war among humanity again, which lead to them warring with and enslaving the Amazons, unbeknownst to the other Old Gods. Antiope and her sister Hippolyta, however, fought back against their captor(s) and succeeded in freeing their people. Ares would soon turn on the other Gods themselves for aiding the Amazons.\n\nAres thus rebelled against his father as well as the other Old Gods for not sharing his bloodlust and anti-human sentiment, starting the devastating War of the Gods against all of them. Ares killed his divine family off one by one until only Zeus himself remained. Zeus then went on to face Ares in combat and was able to defeat and banish Ares from Olympus. In order to account for the possibility of losing his life in the war, Zeus conceived a demigod child with Antiope's sister, a child capable of one day defeating and killing Ares (therefore known as the \"Godkiller\"), a daughter named Diana.\n\nZeus, weakened, used the last of his divine powers to create the paradise island of Themyscira as a haven for the newly freed Amazons, using divine magic to conceal it from the rest of the world to ensure that the Godkiller Diana would grow up safely from Ares' reach.[1]\n\nMillennia after the War of the Gods, Antiope served under Queen Hippolyta and oversaw the military force of the Amazons as their General, alongside Lieutenant Menalippe in preparation for the eventual return of Ares. She urged Hippolyta to let Diana train her as an Amazon warrior and discover her true power. Despite her sister's disapproval, she trained Diana in secret from girlhood to her youth and constantly urged her to stop holding back. Eventually, Hippolyta discovered their training and expressed her worries about Diana's fate. Despite her frustration, Hippolyta told Antiope to train Diana harder than any Amazon before her.[1] Antiope was present for an athletic competition which she watched alongside Hippolyta. In the aftermath, she told Diana, who had competed, that there was no shame in losing to vastly superior opponents and that her chance would come someday, and discouraged the cheating that got her disqualified, wisely explaining that heroism never comes out of deceit.[3]\n\nAntiope continued to train Diana into her adulthood, mastering her warrior skills. Despite her proficiency, Antiope still managed to overpower her during a duel and chastised Diana for letting her guard down. As Antiope fought her vigorously, Diana clashed her Bracelets of Submission and created a massive shockwave, knocking Antiope back.[1]\n\nLater, as German forces invaded Themyscira in pursuit of the American spy, Steve Trevor, Antiope led the Amazons on horseback against the German attackers. After a strong start, she was disarmed of her sword and shield when a bomb threw her from her horse, but managed to annihilate many Germans on foot with arrows and assistance from Menalippe. However, during the end of the fight, Antiope saw a German soldier firing at Diana and jumped in front of the bullet to protect her. Antiope's killer would promptly be shot down by Steve. Lying on the beach, Antiope urged Diana to leave the island and defeat Ares, before passing away.[1]\n\nAntiope was an extremely capable and skilled leader, as well as an equally courageous warrior, evident in how she saved her fellow Amazons from human slavery as the War of the Gods broke out, in how she fought alongside with her Amazons sisters during the invasion of Themyscira, and in how she sacrificed her life to save Diana. She was very wise, believing there is no shame in being humiliated for biting off more than one can chew. Antiope was also quite a bit more reasonable than her sister Hippolyta, since she fully supported her niece Diana's ambition to become a great warrior, training her more intensely than any of her other protegees. Antiope also believed that deceit never begets heroism and as such seemed displeased with Hippolyta deceiving Diana about the latter's demigod heritage and \"Godkiller\" destiny, since as she lay dying, Antiope unsuccessfully attempted to tell Diana the truth. Also, Antiope bore no grudge against her beloved niece for accidentally injuring her with the Bracelets of Submission shock-wave, as she didn't hesitate to jump in front of a bullet shot at Diana, saving her niece's life. Antiope did not die in vain, however, as her sacrifice inspired Diana to finally leave the island and save \"Man's World\" from Ares.",
