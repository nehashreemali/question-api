  "content": "Atlanna is the mother of both Arthur Curry and Orm Marius, and the former queen of the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. Upon fleeing from an arranged marriage with King Orvax decades ago, Atlanna met and fell in love with Thomas Curry, whom she married later. A few years following Arthur's birth, Atlanna was forced to return to Atlantis and marry Orvax when several Men-of-War attempted to violently take her back under his orders.\n\nHowever, several years after she gave birth to her second son Orm and took in Princess Mera of Xebel as her protégé, Orvax learned of Arthur's existence, leading him to disown her as his wife and sentence her to the Trench for loving a human. Despite the odds, Atlanna was able to fight her way through the Trench and make it all the way to the Hidden Sea within the Earth's core.\n\nAfter living there alone for twenty years, Atlanna was reunited with Arthur and Mera when they came to the Hidden Sea to find Atlan's Trident. Once Arthur retrieved the Trident and defeated Orm, Atlanna returned to Maine to be with Thomas.\n\nIn 1985, Atlanna fled Atlantis as she did not want to marry Orvax as part of an arranged marriage. She met a human by the name of Thomas Curry, whom she fell in love with and married. A year later, in January, Atlanna had a child by Thomas, whom she named Arthur.[1]\n\nHowever, due to dangers that would follow her newborn son should he be discovered, Atlanna was forced to abandon him with his father,[1] an act that affected her deeply.[2][3] To ensure her child never forgot where he came from, Atlanna left him her trident as her legacy, and also composed a short letter to be given to him upon reaching a certain age.[4]\n\nReturning to Atlantis, Atlanna was forced to go through with the marriage and some time after had a son with Orvax named Orm.  it was likely the tyrannical Orvax forced himself on her to conceive Orm. During the wars in Xebel, when Mera was still a child, Atlanna took in the young princess, training her over the years.[2]\n\nEventually, when King Orvax found out about Arthur, he was overcome with jealousy and sentenced her to the Trench. Before she was sentenced, she asked for Vulko's promise that he would protect Arthur.[1]\n\nHowever, she survived by going through the maelstrom in the Kingdom of the Trench that is a one-way portal leading to the Hidden Sea. There she lived for twenty years, fashioning herself a set of grey armor that resembles the Trench creatures, attempting to obtain the Trident of Atlan which is the only way to escape, but always thwarted by its guardian, Karathen.[1]\n\nWhen Mera and Aquaman were swept apart by the maelstrom, Atlanna saved Mera from being devoured by a sea monster. Recognizing Mera, Atlanna removed her helmet, shocking Mera to see her former queen alive. Arthur approached the two and is shocked to see his mother alive and well. Atlanna and Arthur happily embraced each other as they're finally reunited after years of separation. Atlanna explained how she managed to survive her death sentence and remained trapped in the lost kingdom for years. She told Arthur not to blame himself for her situation as she made a choice to protect him and his father. When she asked about Thomas, Atlanna is moved when her son explained that his father walked to the pier and waited for her every day for the past years. Atlanna then told Aquaman what he needs to do to retrieve Atlan's trident and watched her son go through the waterfall to retrieve it. He eventually succeeded in retrieving the trident, wearing new Atleanean armor as she proudly called Arthur the true king of Atlantis.[1]\n\nAfter Aquaman defeats Orm in single combat, Orm angrily screams at Aquaman to kill him. However, Atlanna intervenes, asserting that there has been enough bloodshed already. Orm is shocked and overwhelmed at his mother's appearance, and the two share an affectionate embrace. Atlanna tells Orm that she loves him, but that he has been misguided, as the land and the sea are one. She gives his hand a final kiss as he is led away by Atlantean guards.\n\nAfter Orm's departure, Atlanna hails her son Aquaman as the new king of Atlantis.\n\nAfter Arthur's crowning as king of Atlantis, Atlanna returns to Thomas's lighthouse just as he walks down to the pier. Once he sees her, the two happily embrace and share a kiss.[1]\n\nAtlanna is a brave, fearless, and caring woman, enough so that she took in Mera, the daughter of Xebel, as her protégée. She is also strong-willed, as she ran away from Atlantis to escape an arranged marriage. When she met Thomas Curry, she attacked him at first, but upon waking the next morning, she was kind to him. She grew to love him and his world, living with him for several years and even raising their son before she returned to Atlantis.\n\nWhen Atlantis discovered where she was, Atlanna attacked and killed the guards sent to retrieve her by the king, Orvax. Although she loves Arthur more than anything, she knew that she had to return to Atlantis in order to protect him and Thomas. Additionally, though Orm is fathered by King Orvax, Atlanna still loves him, as he is also her son.",
