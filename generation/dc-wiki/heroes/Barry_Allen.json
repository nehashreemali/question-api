  "content": "Bartholomew Henry \"Barry\" Allen is the superhero famously known as the Flash, a student at Central City College, a forensic scientist of the Central City Police Department, and a member of the Justice League who was struck by lightning, gaining access to the Speed Force and the ability to think and move at incredible superhuman speeds.\n\nUsing these powers, he became a superhero in Central City, frequently apprehending criminals such as Captain Boomerang. He is also determined to clear his father Henry's name for the brutal unsolved murder of his mother Nora. He was eventually discovered by Lex Luthor and recruited by Bruce Wayne to be a member of the Justice League in order to help defend Earth, following the death of Superman. Following his recruitment to the team, Allen played a pivotal role in the Resurrection of Superman. With the team now fully assembled, he contributed to the successful assault against the forces of Apokolips' General Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons, managing to thwart the threat. Allen was subsequently hired for a position in the Central City Police Department's crime lab much to Henry's delight.\n\nYears later with Cyborg, he began experimenting with his speed until he accidentally encountered his Earth-Prime self, where he adopted his superhero alias the Flash from their brief conversation. Allen would later go with the League to help the 11th Street Kids at Coverdale Ranch fight the Butterflies and the Cow, but the 11th Street Kids had already put an end to the threat.\n\nFacing challenges as a vigilante, Allen faced off rudely against Girder, failing, so he sought help from Batman, who gave him a new suit and helped him unleash a sonic blast to defeat his enemy. Allen suffered from stress at work due to taunts from his colleagues Albert Desmond and Patty Spivot until receiving advice from Henry, managing to control his slur to defeat Tarpit. Now a famous hero, Allen dealt with the pressure, regaining hope and self-confidence to defeat the Top. Allen later fought alongside Aquaman and Wonder Woman and helped defeat Charybdis and the Aquamarines,\n\nStill saddened by Henry's wrongful arrest, Allen, despite warnings from Wayne and his love interest Iris West, traveled back in time, preventing Nora's murder, though ended up trapped in an alternate 2013 known as Flashpoint, encountering a younger version of himself, helping him gain his powers, but losing his own just as General Dru-Zod attacked, causing Allen and his younger self to ally with an alternate Bruce Wayne and Kara Zor-El to stop Zod with no success before being confronted by Dark Flash, a shadowy future version of his younger self, who tried to save his world, endangering the Multiverse. Following his younger self's sacrifice to erase the Dark Flash from existence, Allen reversed his mistake, returning to his new present for his father's release and ended up encountering another alternate Bruce Wayne.\n\nBartholomew Henry \"Barry\" Allen was born around March 19, 1995 in Central City, Ohio to Nora and Henry Allen.[1] During his childhood, Allen often played in the yard, running around while his parents watched,[2] and formed a strong bond with his mother, who often called him \"monkey\" and even gave him a stuffed monkey.\n\nIn 2004, Allen accompanied Nora to the supermarket but forget to buy a can of tomato, with which Nora made her favorite sauce, before returning home to do a mathematical equations assignment, becoming frustrated by not knowing how to solve it. He explained his situation to Nora for not finding a solution, he would receive advice from his mother which was that not every problem has a solution and sometimes you just have to let go. Because he forgot the tomato can, Nora entrusted Henry to look for a can only for Allen to start to play with his parents in the kitchen before starting to dance and play with his mother to the rhythm of the song Pedro Navaja.\n\nSome time later, inside his room, Allen tried to solve his math problem before hearing a scream from the kitchen, being quickly called by Henry, whom he saw through the window and in horror, Allen saw his bloodied mother, receiving Henry's request for help to call the police. Because no one believed that it was another individual who killed his mother because he was a minor, Henry was wrongly framed by the police, sentencing him to a life sentence in Iron Heights Penitentiary.[1]\n\nGrowing up, Allen was teased by his classmates because Henry was framed as a murderer.[1] Motivate, he began studying criminal law at Central City College in hopes of one day clearing his father's name and freeing him from prison, visiting him occasionally to talk about the jobs he was getting.[3] During his studies, Allen befriended and fell in love with his classmate Iris West, who also had an attraction for him.[1]\n\nWhile working at the Central City Research Center as a student, one night, Allen was conducting research, leaving the windows open, being close to some chemicals, until he was struck by lightning which granted him the ability to access the Speed Force, allowing him to move, think, act and vibrate his body at inhuman speeds. With his newfound abilities, Allen decided to become a vigilante in Central City, using a heat-resistant silicon and quartz base to make a special suit for himself to keep his identity a secret.[1][3][4]\n\nIn 2013, Allen was adding the final details to his suit, before General Dru-Zod and the Sword of Rao began terraforming the Earth with the World Engine, so Allen went to Metropolis to help the people. unsuccessfully, watching as a child tried to help his injured father and managed to save the kid, however, he was unable to rescue his father, using his speed to prevent a vehicle from falling on them. The event left Allen traumatized after Superman defeated Zod and began taking his vigilante actions more seriously, modifying his suit.[1]\n\nIn 2015, Allen was buying food at a grocery store when he heard a robber pointing and threatening a cashier at the counter with his gun. With his super speed, Allen ran towards him and pushed him in one-thirtieth of a second, while his trail of electric rays caused the lights to flicker momentarily. Lex Luthor, in his investigation to prove the existence of Metahumans, obtained security camera recordings of the event.[5]\n\nAfter a series of robberies carried out by Australian criminal George Harkness caught Allen's attention, Harkness was successfully arrested on their first encounter, but tricked Allen into being released by convincing him that he had, in fact, impersonated him. In his next encounter, Boomerang managed to knock out Flash and tie him to a rocket that he sent into Earth's atmosphere. Fortunately, Flash managed to free himself from the rocket as it began to descend, and proceeded to capture Harkness.[6]\n\nWhile planning a series of multiple robberies at the Central City Diamond Exchange with an associate, Harkness betrayed him by throwing a boomerang at him to knock him out, taking all of his merchandise with him. At that, Flash appeared in front of the criminal, mentioning the dishonor that existed in Harkness. With that said, Allen proceeded to knock him down and leave for him to be arrested and sent to Belle Reve Federal Penitentiary.[7]\n\nIn 2017, in order to get a new job to pay his tuition at Central City College, Allen headed to Central Bark Doggy Day care. On the bus on the way, Allen was delayed due to an old woman who was counting the coins for her fare to get on, so a desperate Allen begged to let him get on. As he entered the store, recanting his delay, Allen tried to pet a dog that proceeded to bark at him, before briefly bumping into Iris West, with whom he exchanged glances for a few moments.\n\nWhen he approached the worker, Allen attempted to explain the reason for his tardiness in a comical manner, before handing her his tousled and destroyed resume, while continuing to watch West through the window. After the worker asked Allen about his experience for the employment, West, about to leave in her car, suddenly crashed into a truck driven by a distracted driver, throwing her from her vehicle. Immediately, Allen activated his super speed, broke his sneakers and ran through and breaking the glass of the place.\n\nUpon being in front of West, Allen carefully observed and caressed her face, before observing a floating sausage and proceeding to put it in his pocket. He then grabbed her arms and slowly carried her to a safe area so that she would be safe as the car fell on its side and overturned, exploding. Upon reconsideration, West watched in amazement as Allen, who, frightened, returned to the premises and was observed by the worker calmly giving snacks to the dogs, much to her dismay.[3]\n\nAllen visited Henry in prison to talk about his new job, but he was upset because he had four jobs that weren't useful. Allen reminded him that he required money to get his degree in criminal law, even though his father admitted his guilt. Father and son began to argue until they both joined hands, as Henry gave Allen advice on how to let go of the past to create his future. Shortly afterward the guards took Henry to his cell. Allen kept thinking about his father's phrase.\n\nUpon reaching his hideout, Allen turned on the lights, but was surprised by Bruce Wayne, who came to recruit him. To hide his identity, Allen tried to trick Wayne, since he had broken into his house without permission. Allen tried to lie about his suit by lying that he practiced ice skating and mentioned that he had various skills, but Wayne knew he was lying. When Wayne threw a batarang, Allen used his powers and observed the batarang, which caused him to discover that Wayne was actually Batman.\n\nSurprised, Allen admitted that he had speed powers. While Wayne offered him to join his team of super people, he immediately accepted, since he needed friends, and asked Wayne if he could keep his batarang. The duo left the lair with pizza and Allen was surprised as they were going on a jet. Allen asked Wayne about his power, which he responded with \"I'm rich\".\n\nAfter landing in Gotham City, Allen and Wayne met up with Diana Prince, who was actually Wonder Woman. After being introduced by Wayne, Allen was surprised by Prince and made a fool of her upon meeting her. Allen, Wayne and Prince saw the Bat Signal, something that made Allen excited, since it was Wayne's signal, but he acted discreetly so that Wayne's secret identity would not be revealed.[3]\n\nAfter donning their suits, Allen, Bruce Wayne, and Diana Prince met with Commissioner James Gordon, who informed them of the kidnapping of several scientists. Prince revealed that the Parademons were responsible and Allen was frightened by the creatures. The group was shocked to see Victor Stone, a young man with cybernetic enhancements, arrive. When Batman found out that Steppenwolf was hiding on Stryker's Island, he, Wonder Woman, and Stone left for it, leaving Allen alone. Shocked, Allen told Gordon that they were rude for leaving out of nowhere and quickly left to follow them.\n\nOnce on the island, Allen and the group began to investigate the place to find Steppenwolf. Allen felt the need to catch him and Wonder Woman advised him that they should work together, but Allen went ahead to cross the bridge. Upon seeing Steppenwolf, Allen was frightened by the sight of him and mentioned that he missed Superman very much, since he could beat him.\n\nWhen Stone, Wonder Woman, and Batman faced the Parademons, Allen also faced the aliens and was upset that they were not fighting together. Allen was ordered by Batman to help the kidnapped people and led all the scientists to the exit. Using his speed, Allen and Stone successfully got all the scientists out and then returned to the tunnel with the others.\n\nUpon returning, Allen saw Wonder Woman lose her sword, so Allen froze time to give her her sword back to confront Steppenwolf, but because he was distracted, Allen tripped, causing time to return to normal. Upon getting up, Allen was taken by Parademons, who wanted to kill him, but Wonder Woman appeared to save Allen.\n\nBadly injured, Allen and Batman helped each other, but they realized that Steppenwolf opened the docks of Gotham City, causing a flood, and both had to flee until Aquaman appeared to control the water, something that surprised Allen. The group took the opportunity to escape on the Knightcrawler. Upon leaving, Allen, Wayne, Diana and Curry discussed the Mother Boxes. Allen and the team learned that Steppenwolf had two, which were taken from Themyscira and Atlantis and now there was only one left, but Stone appeared with the third, since he had it.[3]\n\nThe next day, Allen and the team went to Wayne Aerospace Hangar to discuss the Mother Box that Victor Stone had. While discussing how to destroy the artifact, Allen suggested destroying it with flamethrowers, but Stone explained that the box was indestructible. The group learned how Stone gained his cybernetic enhancements from his father, Silas Stone, who had acquired the box. Realizing that the Mother Box could resurrect people, Allen and the team considered reviving Superman, as he would be the only person to stop Steppenwolf.\n\nWhile Bruce Wayne repaired their vehicles, Allen and the rest of the team were sent to dig up Clark Kent's body at the Smallville Cemetery. Allen and Stone were tasked with excavating Kent's grave. While working, Allen spoke to Stone about his interest in Diana Prince. Upon finding the coffin, Allen, Stone, Prince, and Arthur Curry placed the coffin in the van to meet up with Wayne.\n\nIn order to infiltrate S.T.A.R. Labs, Allen had to change into a soldier's suit to get in, but first he argued with Curry about his hatter. After successfully getting in, using the name \"Wesley Rowe\", Allen and the team infiltrated Scout Ship 0344 to revive Kent. Because there was no power left, Allen offered to use his ability to rewind time to do so, but things might get out of hand. Allen prepared to run, but Stone said something, which Allen didn't hear, so he started the plan and rewound time to power the Mother Box successfully, although he fell unconscious.\n\nAllen, Wonder Woman, Stone and Aquaman exited the ship and happily watched as Kent had been revived, but he began to see them in strange shapes. When Stone accidentally attacked Kent, Allen watched as Kent began to attack them. Allen stopped time and tried to stop Kent, but Kent had detected him, and attacked him instantly. He tried to fight back, but was shot down by Kent, who tried to kill everyone.\n\nThe team took it upon themselves to protect the civilians while they fought Kent, but despite their best efforts, Kent defeated them all and then confronted Wayne, whom he recognized. After Kent flew away with Lois Lane, Allen saw Aquaman, who blamed him for what happened. Allen apologized to him, as he had no idea what was going to happen.[3]\n\nUpon seeing Steppenwolf's Boom Tube, Allen, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman sprang into action to stop the alien, but Steppenwolf had escaped with the last Mother Box. Allen helped Victor Stone up, and learned that Silas Stone was dead. The group mourned Silas' death and discovered that he sacrificed himself so that the last box could be marked, thus stopping Steppenwolf. Allen was shocked to discover that Batman had one satellite, but he confessed that he had six, something that shocked Allen even more.\n\nThe team arrived at the Batcave, where they met Alfred Pennyworth. Allen and the others discovered that Steppenwolf was hiding in Pozharnov in a radiation facility, something that Allen saw as dangerous. Realizing that they would die fighting Steppenwolf, Allen worried that the enemy had destroyed many protectors of other worlds, but Wayne motivated everyone, since he never faced them united. Thanks to Wayne's words, Allen and the team became the Justice League. Later, Allen and Curry talked about Stone's current state, and how they could help him.\n\nAllen and the league entered the Flying Fox to reach Pozharnov. While flying, Allen and the league discussed the plan on how they would defeat Steppenwolf. Allen and Stone would team up to destroy the boxes, and Allen joked that they would use the power of love, but in reality he was to create a energy surge to prevent the boxes from syncronizing together, so Stone could destroy the boxes. With everything set, the League was ready to stop Steppenwolf.[3]\n\nBefore arriving at Pozharnov, Allen began to pray and prepare for the big decisive fight. Allen and the Justice League got off the Flying Fox, but Batman stayed on the ship to destroy the force field. Allen worried about Batman, who asked the others to go inside Pozharnov, as he would distract the Parademons. Upon entering, the league joined Batman to fight the creatures together.\n\nIn order for Victor Stone to merge with the unit, Allen began to run to give him energy, but he couldn't hold on for long. Allen kept running until he was shot by a Parademon and revealed to Batman that he only needed a few seconds to recover. Allen tried to speed up his healing, but he was still dealing with the pain.\n\nSuddenly, Allen watched as the Mother Boxes merged to create the Unity, which brought about the arrival of Darkseid, who used it to destroy the entire planet in the form of Apokolips, but he was able to vibrate his molecules and phase through the destruction, and realized that he must break the speed of light to save everyone. While running within the Speed ​​Force, Allen remembered Henry, as he wanted to be remembered as one of the bests of the best. Allen managed to go back in time to make physical contact with Stone, and thus destroy the Mother Boxes with the help of Superman, and successfully prevented Darkseid's arrival.\n\nAfter Aquaman and Wonder Woman killed Steppenwolf, Allen and his teammates encountered Darkseid, who was upset by Steppenwolf's failure, before the portal closed. With victory won, the League left the base and watched as the Flying Fox arrived for them. Allen and Stone fist-bumped and everyone looked at each other, as they now had a new world to live in.[3] At some point after the battle, Allen told Wayne about the time regression he made to avoid the Unity.[1]\n\nDetermined to investigate and stop crime in Central City, Barry joined as a forensic scientist at the Central City Police Department. Upon receiving the job, Barry met with his father in prison to inform him of his new job as a scientist, mentioning that he now \"had one foot in the door.\" Henry laughed at the term his son used before congratulating him on his new job; Barry thanked him for all his help.\n\nFinally being at peace with himself knowing that his father was proud of him, Flash began to run pleasantly through the streets of Central City, feeling happy to now be in charge of defending his city. Now with his new job, Barry could investigate and stop various crimes legally and officially. There, he met his co-workers Patty Spivot and Albert Desmond, as well as his professor and boss, Dr. David Singh, to whom he brought coffee every day. Barry regularly went to Filby's Café, where Sara had prepared her sandwich for him before he went to work.\n\nBelieving that something like the Multiverse was possible, Allen, with the help of Victor Stone, managed to travel through the Speed ​​Force to a parallel universe, where he encountered an alternate version of himself. Shocked, the two had a brief conversation in which his alternate self revealed himself to be named Barry Allen like him, as well as explaining his name under the alias \"Flash\". Confused, Allen was shocked at this when his counterpart stated that such an encounter could not be possible.\n\nEven more confused, Allen asked why that wasn't possible now, only for the doppelgänger to be puzzled as he realized that Allen was unaware of the Multiversal Crisis. At that, Allen began to fade away as he remembered that Stone had already stated that that was indeed possible, before returning to his universe. There, Allen, inspired by his alternate self's alias, adopted his superhero name and began calling himself the Flash.[8]\n\nIn January 2021, Leota Adebayo informed her boss and mother Amanda Waller about the current crisis point with the Butterfly alien invasion. She suggested that Waller calls in the Justice League. Flash, along with Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and Superman, did eventually get informed about the crisis and managed to make it to the site of Coverdale Ranch just as the Peacemaker and the rest of the 11th Street Kids were heading out of the site. Peacemaker told the Justice League that they were late and mocked Aquaman about the rumors of him having intercourse with fish which made him express his distaste for the rumor, leading Flash to jokingly say that it was not a rumor, much to his teammate's irritation.[9]\n\nMonths later, Flash continued his work as a vigilante, discovering an arms deal orchestrated by Vincent Inzerillo and Broome at Sally's Showcase Amusement Park, hearing that by not being in Gotham City, Batman would not be able to stop them, so he surprised the dealers, commenting on not being a fan of guns, and introduced himself as the Flash, taunting Vincent that Batman would be angry to find out that he went to Central City, before beginning to dodge the other criminals.\n\nThanks to his speed, Flash was able to hold off the criminals until Vincent called Girder, impressing Flash, who joked about how the mob was transporting a \"living metal wall\", but he sidelined Girder to try to stop Vincent and Broome. Flash confronted Girder, landing some blows, causing Flash great pain, receiving a heavy blow from Girder. Defeated, Flash became frustrated by his failed fight, suffering in agony from his ribs.[2]\n\nAllen took a coffee break as he strolled the streets of Central City, checking in with his colleague Patty Spivot for the delivery of his paperwork to the lab with Albert Desmond, promising to arrive early until he saw the door to the bank vault fly and, closed his call with Spivot to dodge it. With his speed, Flash quickly saved a civilian to return to his hideout to search for his suit.\n\nHeading to the bank, Flash apologized for delaying a team, finding several guards dead, and was surprised by Girder. Flash tried to resist in the fight and mocked him for trying to rob a bank, but Girder confessed not wanting to steal money, as he just wanted him dead. Despite having thrown several things at him, Flash got tired of not hurting him, and Girder squeezed him hard to try to kill him, destroying his suit a little, although Flash luckily managed to free himself, fleeing from the villain to seek help.[2]\n\nSeeking help to strengthen his powers, Flash traveled to Gotham City to seek help from Bruce Wayne, stopping The Jacks, mockingly apologizing to the leader of the criminal gang as he needed to speak to Batman. Meeting with the vigilante, Flash explained his beef against Girder, who easily defeated him twice and Batman agreed to teach Flash how to fight, who thanked him for agreeing, heading to the Batcave, while Batman arrested The Jacks.\n\nInside the Batcave, Allen greeted Alfred Pennyworth, discovering that he was working with micro-compression technology to create a new, stronger suit for him and saw Wayne arrive, asking him to learn Judo or Krav Maga, which Wayne denied in order to teach him the basics. Beginning his training, Allen read Ted Grant's Boxing Guide, telling Wayne the reason why he decided to help people after losing his mother and his father's imprisonment, before beginning his fight with Wayne, dodging his attacks.\n\nWhile bragging that he was stronger by being fast, Allen was hit several times by Wayne, who humiliated Allen to unleash his inner fury, causing Allen to run fast enough, destroying a boxing bag and his glove, surprising both, starting to discuss how to master his new skill with some practice. Despite Wayne's warnings, Allen tried his sonic punch again, destroying a hatch in the Batcave, angering Wayne, apologizing to him for going too far.[2]\n\nAfter preparing, Flash and Batman prepared to stop Girder, who was attacking the Central City Police Department, so Flash headed first, saving some guards until being confronted by Girder, taking several damage again while Batman protected the rest of the civilians. Giving up, Allen confessed that Flash had left because he couldn't stop Girder, but Batman gave him advice because it was only the beginning of his story, giving him a special ring with a new suit made by him and Alfred Pennyworth.\n\nRunning at maximum speed to save Batman, Flash remembered his childhood, the death of his mother, the arrest of his father and the Battle of Pozharnov against the Parademons, noting that all these events were helpful for his start as a hero, opening his ring, unlocking his new suit and attacking Girder on his head. With his new suit, Flash bragged about being the greatest hero ever seen, fighting Girder while talking to him about his deal with Vincent Inzerillo for the well-being of his father and attempted to offer his help to the criminal.\n\nFlash took Girder to a part of the city where there would be no injuries, considering that their confrontation will be different than the last two times, running at high speed to charge his sonic blow into his chest, damaging his steel skin, as well as than to his fists, pain that Flash expressed, finally defeating Girder. Watching Girder's arrest, Flash thanked Batman for all his help, thanking him for the comfort of the suit and how he learned to control his punch.\n\nWhen Batman asked if he needed anything else, Flash asked his friend for one last favor, which was to contribute money for Girder's Father's cure as he felt sorry for him, a favor that Batman accepted. Days later, Flash went to Iron Heights Penitentiary, meeting with Girder to inform him that his father was in good health, revealing that he only wanted good for everyone, even people like him, even though Girder tried to kill him several times, since Flash had hope with him, an act that Girder appreciated.\n\nShortly after, Flash went to a rooftop, meeting Wayne again, who was surprised to see him saving the world now as a more mature hero and Flash expressed his happiness for his new stage as a vigilante because he will be able to help more people in need because he will not never run away again, before witnessing an explosion in the city. At Wayne's suggestion to go ahead, Flash prepared to arrest the perpetrators.[2] Shortly after, Allen would go to Wayne, whom he gave a USB, to ask for his help and use Wayne Enterprises' technology to prove that Henry was in the store during Nora's murder.[1]\n\nUpon learning of a drug shipment at the Central City docks, which was linked to the Monteleone Crime Family, Flash delayed arriving at work to confront the criminal organization, taking down the vast majority of the thugs, leaving only one thug, politely asking him to drop his gun, though the thug unsuccessfully attempted to kill him and ended up taking the thug down. With his duty completed, Flash contacted the Central City Police Department to take the criminals away, quickly leaving so as not to be late.\n\nMaking it to the Central City Research Center, Allen was able to get ready, greeting his colleagues Patty Spivot and Albert Desmond, who chided him for his tardiness, though Allen claimed he was delayed because of his neighbor's dog, receiving a lecture from Spivot about how his job was getting harder since the Flash's appearance. Allen asked for his share of the work, however, Spivot revealed that they finished his paperwork for him and left him with no cases to solve, frustrating Allen, receiving an order from a mocking Desmond to bring his burgers to Big Belly Burger and bring several boxes to the files room.\n\nAllen attempted to carry the boxes to the files room, which he didn't know where it was as he dealt with his problems between his job, his duty as the Flash, and Henry's liberation, causing him to bump into his professor David Singh. When he ran into Singh, Allen apologized about his regular tardiness, listening to Singh talk about how he would have to be removed from his internship program if he continued to miss, something Allen clearly understood, before seeing a live chase. To his surprise, Allen saw his hand begin to act strange, deciding to leave without the boxes to deal with the threat.[10]\n\nArriving just in time to the Central City Police Department's chase against the Monteleone Crime Family, Flash assisted the cops in pursuing the criminals, wondering the point of robbing a truck for no money until being ambushed by the powerful Tarpit and his oil powers, causing Flash to unsuccessfully try to evade his attacks while suffering due to his injuries, stating that he must finish off Tarpit in order to get back to work, becoming stressed out by all the situations happening to him, causing him to phase out again and his hands to pass through the ground, confusing him and Tarpit, who thought Flash was mocking him.\n\nFlash attempted to control his newfound power as Tarpit prepared to kill him, however, Flash was able to get his hands out in time, managing to weaken Tarpit, crashing into a couple's car, asking them to escape to a safe place until he accidentally blew up the car when he tried to run, growing frustrated at not being able to control his vibrations, realizing that Tarpit and his subordinates had already escaped, so he headed towards his hideout to understand his new abilities.[10]\n\nBack in his hideout, Allen began recording audio to begin experimenting with his newfound derangement, realizing that he vibrated when his molecules turned into solid matter, researching that he could make an object explode if his molecules were fully excited and attempted to find a way to control his vibrations so as not to hurt anyone before receiving a message from David Singh and when trying to take his phone, Allen accidentally destroyed it, so he met up with Singh in his office, where he was harassed by Albert Desmond. Since he did not know what was wrong with him, Singh told Allen that he would have to remove him from the intern program if he continued like this, worrying Allen, receiving advice from Singh to ask for advice from someone who understands him.\n\nAllen headed to Iron Heights Penitentiary to talk to Henry about how he couldn't control his body, calling himself an idiot for not balancing his job as a forensic intern, his \"part-time job\", and his desire to free his body, thinking all the stress would kill him, but Henry told him that he should take all his problems at once and not so fast, despite Allen claiming that his job was important and began to worry about not achieving his goals, starting to vibrate again. After his father told him that he should focus on one goal, Allen placed his hand on the glass to feel his father, managing to stop vibrating and thanked Henry for the inspiring advice.[10]\n\nAfter leaving Iron Heights Penitentiary, Allen received a call from David Singh before seeing something was going on, so following Henry's advice, Allen decided to do his duty as the Flash, taking his suit out of the ring to head to the Central City Bridge, meeting up with Tarpit again, whom he unsuccessfully attempted to calm down. Flash was tasked with saving the civilians when Tarpit threw a car, containing a mother and her son, so Flash looked for a way to help them after seeing that the car was stuck and by controlling his phase shift, he was able to save the mother and her son, phase shifting them through the car, celebrating for controlling his power.\n\nAfter getting all the civilians to safety, Flash finally confronted Tarpit, showing him what he was capable of, running at high speed, dodging his attacks and then delivering a super sonic blast that destroyed his chest, mocking how Tarpit was trapped on the bridge, though Tarpit prepared another trick, launching another attack on a cable on the bridge, which Flash was able to repair and destroy the boat Tarpit was going to escape in. Running quickly through the water, Flash was able to create a giant wave against Monteleone, causing him to melt and watched as Tarpit's brother Jack Monteleone was arrested alongside him, mockingly bidding farewell to his enemy.\n\nAllen changed back into his civilian clothes as he could now take care of his work, knowing that he would have another chance to pursue his studies. Over the next few days, Allen was able to quickly complete the cases sent by David Singh, thus redeeming his late arrivals by receiving new cases to investigate. A week later, Allen returned to Iron Heights to tell Henry of his progress in receiving better cases, gladdening his father who was happy that he had time to visit him as Allen claimed that he will always have time to see him and they joined hands again before Allen returned to the lab.\n\nMuch to the surprise of his colleagues, Allen arrived at the lab early, proving that he managed to complete all of his cases, bragging to Patty Spivot and Albert Desmond, who reacted with amazement to see that he also completed their work, as well as bringing breakfast, earning Singh's respect and accepting the request to take the files to the Central City Police Department. As he walked through the streets, Allen noticed that there was a crime in progress and after remembering his father, he enlisted to stop a robbery at Isotope Secure Data Solutions, leaving after leaving a sticker on the thieves.[10]\n\nWeeks later, Allen learned of an attack on Central City Advanced Robotics and headed to the scene to rescue a group of scientists, who were then attacked by the out-of-control robot, X-51. Flash was able to rescue the scientists before confronting X-51, dodging him at top speed until finding a way to defeat him, snatching the thing that was making X-51 go out of control, discovering that it was a technological spinning top, being informed by the scientists that the same person also stole weapons and Flash did not consider the criminal a threat, mentioning that he probably will not return after his failure.\n\nFollowing his victory, Allen went to Iron Heights Penitentiary to tell Henry how he continued to solve important cases involving the Flash, stating that with all his effort, he could eventually become a forensic for the Central City Police Department, having faith that when that happens, he will be able to get his father out of prison, though Henry mentioned that quite a few people have tried to help with his case to no avail, frustrating Allen when he stressed that he started studying forensic science to help people like him, despite Henry trying to explain to him the difference between helping people and helping himself. Allen bid his father farewell to him and returned to work, smiling as a child praised the Flash, something that encouraged Allen.[11]\n\nAt the criminology lab, Allen continued to research the technological spinning top he obtained from Central City Advanced Robotics while arguing with Albert Desmond over who should investigate the case before an earthquake shook the entire building, being alerted by David Singh that a lunatic was throwing bombs all over Central City and under the excuse of helping the others in the building, Allen put on his suit to find the person responsible. Seeing civilians in danger, Flash tried to help them, however, a large blizzard sent Flash flying through the air.\n\nFlash realized that the one responsible for the attacks was Roscoe Dillon, who threatened all of the city's civilians and former employers to pay him a billion dollars or he would destroy the entire city until Flash stood up, threatening Dillon to surrender, claiming that the battle would be over sooner than he thought, which Dillon understood, attacking Flash with his tops while flying around in a tornado, causing Flash to receive several attacks from Dillon, who became known as \"Top\", due to trying to dodge his explosives and being thrown towards the same mother and son he previously encountered, stopping so they wouldn't get hurt, but the mother scolded him for nearly killing them.\n\nWhen Top showed up, claiming that their fight wasn't over and mentioning that it was time to make history, Flash discovered that Top had implanted giant spinning tops so that he could continue his threat until he received his money, angering Flash, who tried to attack him again to defeat him once and for all, failing in his attempt to hit him and being defeated by Top. Flash, unable to move, listened to Top force him to surrender and reveal his true identity within 24 hours, taunting Flash as he returned to his hideout to find out how he could defeat him and save the city.[11]\n\nReturning to his hideout, Allen continued his recordings to find a way to save people when he faced the Top in 19 hours, thinking that his speed could kill people, deciding to start training and reinforce his skills. Using several mannequins and a training field, Flash ran between the mannequins to dodge the civilians at the moment that Top attacked him with his tops, practicing with various circumstances and testing his skills, but due to losing concentration, Flash destroyed the mannequins, worrying when they began to vibrate uncontrollably, filling him with fear of killing everyone if he did not control his powers.\n\nAllen returned to Iron Heights Penitentiary to ask Henry for advice, telling him that all of Central City would be destroyed by Top if Flash failed to do his best, stating to his father that he worked with Flash on several cases, mentioning his concern for the fate of the city, which Henry acknowledged with Allen referencing that the city would be in less trouble without Flash and Allen commented that he didn't know what to tell him to not give up. During the talk, Allen received some great advice from Henry, considering him to be the bravest person he knows, telling him that he never gave up and neither should Flash, regardless of how risky the threat to save the city is, advice that Allen appreciated in order to become more confident in himself.[11]\n\nLeaving Iron Heights Penitentiary, Allen walked through the streets, making another recording as he thought about revealing his identity to everyone to prevent everyone in Central City from dying if he fought the Top, choosing between him or the city, ending his recording before watching Top threaten Mayor Thompson over the news, watching in happiness as everyone in the city loved him as their hero, inspiring Allen to continue his work as a hero, landing a surprise blow on Dillon as he watched David Singh, Patty Spivot, and Albert Desmond cheer him on in excitement and grew worried when tops began spinning, being challenged by Top to a duel, one which Flash accepted.\n\nMuch to his foe's surprise, Flash was able to outspeed him by once again controlling his phase shift, hitting Top with several attacks, unleashing his fury as Flash mocked him, as he possessed new tricks, tricking Top with illusions of himself and Flash was able to destroy the tops launched by Top, protecting the civilians. Seeing that Top was exhausted, Flash tried to offer his help, asking that they could save the city together, considering him a great scientist, but Top refused the offer, creating a giant whirlwind to finish him off, though Flash was able to defeat him, allowing Top to be arrested and then took it upon himself to destroy all of the giant tops, saving the city, and ended up falling into the streets, accidentally destroying half of them.\n\nAfter saving the city, Flash was reunited with the mother and son he saved, who thanked him for protecting the city once again, sharing a hug with the boy, saying goodbye to his fans. With his suit on, Flash entered Henry's cell, who was surprised to see him enter, while Flash told him about how he saw him on the news fail against Top the first time, but stated that thanks to his son's advice, he was able to get better and save the civilians, shaking hands with his father, starting to cry when Henry gave him a great speech. Touched, Flash said goodbye to his father, not realizing that he discovered his identity, to continue with his adventures, now with his new experience as a hero.[11] Eventually, Allen rented an apartment, leaving his hideout.[1]\n\nWhen the Aquamarines hijack the Wayne Foundation conference, the Justice League comes to the rescue, with Flash saving the scientists from the mercenaries' bullets, teaming up with Aquaman and Wonder Woman, explaining about the expulsion of the criminals from the navy and his attempt to steal the Meta-Bomb, a bomb from Apokolips that would reprogram the DNA of metahumans, killing them along with several innocents in the process. Flash offered to take the bomb to Antarctica, however, Aquaman chose to throw it far away, preventing the bomb from affecting people. After tying up the Aquamarines, Flash played with Atlan's trident and together with Diana, he reacted with surprise about Arthur and Mera's wedding.[12]\n\nBefore leaving for the Central City Research Center, Allen went to Filby's Café to buy his breakfast due to his low metabolism, being served by Sara's understudy, who was late due to various anecdotes, before receiving a call of Alfred Pennyworth, trying to deny any mission, but was informed that a failed robbery occurred at the Gotham General Hospital, although Allen suggested calling other members of the Justice League such as Superman or Wonder Woman, who were indisposed, being him his last option to help Batman.\n\nAllen ended the call after accepting Alfred's request, asking the understudy how long it would take with the sandwich, realizing that it was taking a long time due to his anecdotes, frustrating Allen and he decided to go to the bathroom to leave the cafeteria in his suit, getting ready. to go to the rescue, however, he was interrupted by a group of fans and tried to ask a fan for his chocolate to calm his metabolism until Alfred put him in contact with Batman to help him in Gotham. Annoyed by his fans, Flash returned to his starting position, running quickly, traversing all of Central City to arrive to Gotham City.\n\nUpon arrival, Flash watched as the hospital began to collapse, endangering several civilians and took it upon himself to rescue several people from a fatal fall, asking Batman why he was not there, discovering that he was sent to protect civilians in the hospital while Batman pursued Al Falcone, who stole a deadly virus and caused the hospital to explode. When the hospital's pipe burst, Flash headed down to the basement, fixing the pipes, and venting his frustration to Alfred for being considered \"the League's janitor\", a role he refused to continue in order to keep cleaning up the messes.\n\nFlash thought his job was over as he watched his speed get slower until he saw the east wing begin to collapse, acknowledging that Alfred was right, seeing a nurse and several babies fall from the sky. Quickly, Flash activated his speed to move in slow motion, but because he didn't eat anything, his speed was slowing down, worrying about the infants in danger. Flash was able to mobilize towards a food machine to feed himself, managing to get back faster, saving the babies, the nurse and a therapy dog, placing them on a stretcher to carry them to safety, making Alfred proud, and pulling a baby out of a microwave to give it to the nurse.\n\nAfter recommending the nurse find a therapist for the experience, Flash headed to the Gotham bridge, meeting up with Batman and Wonder Woman, who had managed to catch Falcone, receiving a compliment from Wonder Woman on his new suit. Flash watched as Batman told the truth about him being bound by the Lasso of Hestia and tried to help his friend, but was embarrassed in front of Wonder Woman by revealing that he never had sex, making the trio uncomfortable. After Wonder Woman left, Flash said goodbye to Batman and returned to Filby's Café, receiving the sandwich and leaving the place in frustration at the worker for the delay.[1]\n\nAfter having breakfast, Allen headed towards the Central City Research Center, where Patty Spivot and Albert Desmond began to mock him for his tardiness. Allen ran into David Singh, who before letting him speak, made clumsy excuses for his tardiness, but Allen tried to lie, presenting case files, frustrating Singh by resuming cases that had been going on for three months, berating Allen for not advance. After being scolded, Allen was motivated by Singh, seeing his potential as a forensic and asking to bring coffee, a request that Allen believed was a joke until he realized that Singh was serious.\n\nAllen proceeded to work in the lab until he was called by Spivot and Desmond, who showed Singh's interview about the Johnson case to Allen, even though he continued investigating the evidence, leaving in frustration, while his colleagues mocked him, berating them for not taking the cases seriously. During the discussion, Iris West recognized Allen, who was nervously surprised to see her again after school and asked Spivot and Desmond to leave when they made fun of his few friends, telling West about his work at the research center, proceeding to walk with West.\n\nIn the middle of the talk, Allen heard West claim that they saw each other years ago, so Allen clarified that he had not seen her since college, hiding about his past rescue. Allen spoke to West about Henry's appeal for the next day, discovering that West was a reporter, asking if she wanted his opinion because she was a reporter or friend, however, Allen claimed that Henry was innocent and not responsible for Nora's murder. and tried to clarify that what was important was what really happened, although West awkwardly tried to apologize for not trusting him, but Allen chose to withdraw due to his situation.[1]\n\nReturning to his apartment, Allen found an envelope sent by Bruce Wayne, who returned the USB, asking for forgiveness because the camera could not identify Henry's face in the store. After watching the video, Allen received a call from Henry, talking about his few outings and his brief meeting with Iris West, surprising Henry, who asked Allen to take her out on a date. However, Allen told Henry that in the store video, he never showed his face, suggesting holding another appeal trial, however, Henry refused, stating that tomorrow's appeal would be the final attempt, preferring to continue in Iron Heights Penitentiary than to be free and know that Nora was dead.\n\nOverwhelmed by the thought that his father could not be free, Allen put on his suit, running to his old house, where, while Henry remembered the beautiful family life, he silently observed the day when Nora sent Henry to the store a can of tomatoes, the last time he played with her and the moment she was murdered by an unknown subject, with Henry asking Allen to find the police. Allen shed tears after remembering his childhood, before the call between him and Henry ended, so Allen decided to vent all his frustrations by starting to run through Central City.\n\nAllen ran at full speed, surpassing his limits and entering the Speed Force, where his reality began to slowly warp until he was able to enter the Chronobowl, a temporal plane of the Speed Force. Surprised, Flash watched as memories of his day manifested themselves, from him going to Filby's Café, his rescue of the babies at Gotham General Hospital, and his late arrival at the Central City Research Center. Flash stopped running and tried to understand his stay, peeking his head into an area of the Chronobowl, briefly traveling back in time when he rescued the babies and quickly walking away, discovering that he can travel in time.[1]\n\nAfter leaving the Chronobowl, Allen met with Bruce Wayne near his apartment, telling him about his time travel, comparing the event to how he did it in Pozharnov, but Wayne recognized that Allen's new ability could be risky due to major changes to the timeline by a butterfly effect, although Allen claimed that he could save Nora, as could Wayne's parents. Despite the possibility, Wayne advised Allen not to relive his wounds and learn to heal, mentioning that Allen should not let his tragedy define him, making Allen reflect, who invited Wayne to a dinner, an offer he rejected, commenting that they would go another time.\n\nBefore entering his apartment, Allen saw Iris West appear, expressing his fascination with Wayne's car and he commented that it was an Uber. When West asked to speak with him, Allen quickly cleaned his apartment, welcoming West, who watched in surprise as several of Allen's objects fell. Allen offered West a beer, but without having any, he wandered over to the neighboring apartment, stealing a couple of beers and sat across from West, listening to his apology for not being sensitive to his case, while Allen responded nervously. During the talk, Allen told West that he was studying forensic criminology to fix the system to free Henry and prove his innocence, a sentiment that West shared.\n\nAllen began to think that he may be able to fix what happened, just by warning him of what is going to happen, confusing West. While thinking with West, Allen searched for a way to save Nora, remembering that she sent Henry to buy the can of tomatoes before the real murderer entered the house and using that theory, Allen realized that he could make Nora had the tomato can to keep Henry at home, since he wouldn't have to be seen, thanking West for the suggestion. Allen left the apartment to carry out his plan, but returned briefly, mentioning his liking for the date they had, suggesting they should eventually have another one.[1]\n\nFollowing the orchestrated plan, Allen ran at full speed to re-enter the Chronobowl, traveling back in time, passing through different events such as the Resurrection of Superman, his recruitment into the Justice League, his early days as the Flash and the taunts he received for Nora's murder until finally stopping when he arrived to 2004, entering the store to look for Nora. Allen found Nora, silently greeting her and adding the can of tomatoes into the shopping cart, bidding farewell to his mother, before quickly retreating to avoid being noticed.\n\nAllen returned to the Chronobowl, watching the timeline begin to shift after saving Nora, watching his life change with joy, with Henry and Nora staying together through Allen's happy times from childhood, holidays, and into adulthood, being raised by both parents. However, Allen suddenly noticed the presence of a dark speedster in the Chronobowl, confusing Allen, but before he could react, the dark speedster attacked him, pushing him from the Chronobowl and sending Allen to an alternate 2013 in this new timeline.\n\nRealizing he was in his house, Allen found a way to remove his suit before entering, stealing the clothes from an elderly couple and slowly entering the residence, approaching the kitchen, where he surprised Nora, leaving Allen overwhelmed to see her alive, being greeted by his mother and Henry, who were shocked by his new appearance. Allen shared an emotional hug with Nora, expressing his love for her, before being sent to take a shower. Sneaking around, Allen saw his parents happily living together and arguing over Henry calling Allen \"old\", while he watched in happiness that he was able to get his family back.[1]\n\nAfter taking a shower, Allen went to the lunch table with Nora and Henry, eating spaghetti with them and questioning Nora with rhetorical questions about how she's been since 2004 while hyperactively suggesting they do family activities. Henry asked Allen about how he was doing at Central City College, which confused Allen, who lied that he was doing great, listening to Nora's advice and Henry's suggestion to ask Iris West out. Suddenly, during the talk, Allen confusedly watched a younger version of himself coming to the house in the window, making up an excuse to his parents to leave, claiming he was going to shit outside the house.\n\nAllen ambushed his younger self with his speed, using a pair of underwear to conceal his identity, cornering him outside the house and attempted to interrogate him about what year he was in, but his younger self was able to unmask him, scaring his younger self into believing that Allen had stolen his face. Paralyzed, Allen questioned his younger self about his age, revealing himself to be eighteen, before passing out in front of Allen, who, with no choice, carried him to his room, telling him about his time travel and expressing his confusion at not being in the future, just as no two versions of themselves should exist in the same reality.\n\nHis younger self became excited about his destiny as a superhero, a job that Allen complained about the consequences of and was forced to quickly put pillows around his younger self so that he would not call Nora. While using his powers, Allen saw his younger self's family photos and the use he gave to the stuffed animal that Nora gave him, \"Monkey\". Allen showed frustration at his younger self's comments, realizing why everyone complains about his jokes and asked him not to remember their encounter so as not to screw up the future and tried to come up with ideas to make him forget it. Due to his younger self's excessive comments, Allen opted to hit him, however, he stopped after learning that he would go out with West that night.\n\nEventually, Allen decided to return to the future, wishing his younger self luck and ordering him not to make any changes in the timeline until a storm occurred. Thanks to his younger self, Allen learned that the day was September 29, revealing to him that it was the day they gained their speed powers, telling his younger self that in his reality, he was at the Central City Research Center in his first year and got his powers, deducing that if his younger self doesn't gain them, he will lose his way back to the future. Despite his younger self wanting to go on the date with West and still being shocked at gaining powers, Allen forced him to go along in order to ensure his speed and not change the future.[1]\n\nWith only eight minutes until the accident occurs, Allen and his younger self head to the Central City Research Center and to get inside, Allen carries his younger self into the center, astonishing him at Allen's ability, which he briefly explained, to silently walk past the night guards, managing to phase out again and enter the lab, though they realized they could get in through the door. Allen then prepared his younger self in the position he was originally in on the day of the accident, opening the windows he had opened just in the nick of time.\n\nAllen placed his younger self near the chemicals in a chair, as it was in that position that the lightning struck him, terrifying the younger self of being electrocuted and becoming even more worried knowing that he should be electrocuted when the chemicals are affected by the lightning. Out of his younger self's fear, Allen began to argue with him for showing cowardice, but during the argument, the lightning eventually struck the chemicals, affecting his younger self as well as Allen, who lost a tooth in the progress, and both Allens fell to the floor. Luckily for him, Allen was able to wake up in time, watching as his younger self's back regenerated, relieving himself that the plan worked.\n\nConfused, Allen believed the missing tooth was his younger self's, but later learned that it was his own and used superglue to put it back in its place, before leaving due to the arrival of the guards, forcing both of them to hide in their attempt to escape, while he carried his younger self. Allen tried to phase through the walls without success and then tried to run at top speed, only to realize that he had just lost his powers after being hit by the beam, overwhelming him for being slow and somehow the two Allens managed to escape without being seen by the guards, wearily returning to the younger self's apartment, which was ordered by Nora.\n\nAllen sat with his younger self, explaining that the accident gave him powers, but concurrently, he lost his own, thinking about how he would return to the future now that he is not connected to the Speed ​​Force, however, the younger self became excited about his new powers, leaving the apartment to run around Central City, frustrating Allen. With concern, Allen saw an accident occur, watching his younger self arrive naked and explained him about friction in clothing, as well as his metabolism and learning to vibrate, although the younger self was a fast learner, easily distracted. Allen tried to explain to his younger self how his suit worked and opted to begin training tomorrow when his younger self fell asleep.[1]\n\nThe next day, Allen and his younger self went to Central City Park, where he lent his ring to his younger self to use his suit and prevent him from dying during his training, explaining the micro-compression function of the ring, which the younger self used to release the suit, quickly putting it on, commenting that it was tight in his dick, a sentiment that Allen shared, but decided not to continue talking about it. Allen theorized that if he manages to train his younger self, he could recreate the Chronobowl and be able to go back to the future, a reference that his younger self compared to the homonymous film, stating that Eric Stoltz acted amazingly, although Allen stated that the protagonist was Michael J. Fox.\n\nSuddenly, several people around began to worry, so Allen and his younger self decided to investigate what was happening, discovering through a report that the Black Zero was seen on the coast of Australia, disturbing Allen after remembering the attack of Dru-Zod in his timeline. The Allens entered a bar to watch the news, before a blackout occurred and Zod's message began to broadcast, who was looking for Superman, a threat that Allen recognized, taking a drink before leaving with his younger self and explaining him about Zod's threat.\n\nAllen told his younger self about Clark Kent's history as Superman, his confrontation with Zod during the Battle of Metropolis and Zod's attempt to terraform the Earth to turn it into a new Krypton, but Superman defeated him, although the attack caused several losses of innocent lives, forcing Allen to have to confess to his younger self about how he was present at the invasion, limiting himself to saving a child who saw his father die. Alarmed by the upcoming threat, Allen suggested to locate the Justice League so that together they can fight Zod and prevent numerous lives from being lost during his attack.[1]\n\nBarry Allen is a remarkably intelligent and determined individual, becoming a highly skilled forensic scientist to prove the innocence of his imprisoned father Henry Allen in the death of his mother Nora Allen. As the Flash, Barry is determined to keep his secret identity a secret from others, demonstrated by the many excuses he came up with when confronted by Bruce Wayne, despite none of them being convincing enough to fool the latter. When finally exposed by Bruce, Barry was quick to agree to join the Justice League, due to his great desire to gain friends he could relate to.\n\nHowever, despite his incredible powers and happy personality, Barry initially remained insecure and unsure of himself, since all of his League teammates seemed prepared to do battle against Steppenwolf's army. In addition to this, Flash had a penchant for drifting around and is plagued by multiple social disorders. However, following the battle against the Apokoliptian forces, Barry developed a stronger sense of confidence, as seen when he didn't hesitate to face the disoriented Superman after his resurrection, despite being visibly terrified.\n\nDespite his tragic childhood, Barry is quite laid-back, witty, bubbly, and somewhat childish and humorous, in stark contrast to the very calm, mature, dark, and serious Batman, as well as most of the Justice League. Regardless of these differences though, the Flash idolizes Batman, promptly expressing a desire to keep a Batarang, and gushing about seeing the Bat-Signal. The Flash seems to idolize and admire Superman just as much, however, as the Man of Steel's heroic death is what inspired Barry to also more openly use his own metahuman powers and come out into the light as the Flash.\n\nBarry's humorous attitude, however, initially annoys his fellow Justice Leaguers; Batman and Aquaman in particular, as well as Cyborg, and even the considerate Wonder Woman, though she still treats him with compassion.[13]\n\nBarry was nonetheless able to strike up friendships with most of them: bonding with Victor Stone over their similar accidents and insecurities, looking up to Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince as mentors, formed a love-hate relationship with Aquaman, whom Barry often jokes about his rumor of having sex with fish, and developing a friendly rivalry with Superman, even challenging him to a race to the Pacific coast to see which one of them was truly faster. Barry can also be extremely serious on occasion, notably during his regular visits to his imprisoned father, Henry Allen.\n\nBarry from Flashpoint, a version of Barry that never experienced his mother's death, was even more laid-back, silly, and immature, as well as less intelligent. This annoyed and angered the original Barry, who accuses his younger self of taking his happy life for granted, and not challenging himself. Growing up with more tragedy also made Barry more resilient to tragedy and corruption, since unlike Flashpoint Barry, he didn't become the Dark Flash.\n\nSpeed Force Conduit: Barry Allen, after being struck by lightning and doused in nearby chemicals, gained a metahuman connection to the Speed Force, an extra-dimensional energy field, granting him many speed-based superhuman abilities, as the Flash.",
