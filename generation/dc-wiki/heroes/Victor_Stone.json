  "content": "Victor Stone is a former college athlete and football star. Following a horrific car accident that resulted in the death of his mother, Victor was gravely injured and was extremely close to death. His father, Silas Stone, was able to save him via the use of a Mother Box that crafted cybernetics onto his body, managing to save his life but leaving him alienated and detached from the rest of humanity due to various complications with his new form, resenting Silas for transforming him into a cyborg.\n\nTo deal with the invasion of Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons, Batman and Wonder Woman began to track down powerful super-beings and managed to find Stone. Although he initially refused to get involved as he felt jaded about humanity, he eventually changed his mind and reluctantly joined the Justice League and aided the team in resurrecting Superman, but lost his father in the aftermath. He was instrumental in locating and defeating Steppenwolf and saving Earth from annihilation by interfacing with the Unity. Stone later became the superhero Cyborg in honor of his parents.\n\nStone several years later discussed with Barry Allen about about the possibility of a wider Multiverse, where there existed alternate counterparts of themselves, which Victor stated was impossible. Allen later traveled via the Speed Force, where he met an older counterpart of himself, mentioning that it was possible.[1]\n\nVictor Stone was born on June 29, 1994, in Gotham City, New Jersey, to Dr. Silas Stone, a scientist at S.T.A.R. Labs, and his wife Elinore. Studyng at Gotham City University, Stone learned a lot about computers, and often helped his friends improve his grades. Stone also played on the Gotham City Wildcats as a football quarterback, but at most of his games, Stone noticed that Silas never came because of his work at S.T.A.R. Labs. Stone also helped his friend Sarah improve her studies.\n\nDuring a match, Stone successfully faced several professionals and gained admiration, winning the match. Stone celebrated the victory with his teammates while his mother watched with pride, but was saddened to see how his father could not come. Stone left with Elinore in the car and was sad because she always defended Silas from coming to watch his games, and began to cry for him, but his mother comforted him because she knew he would have a perfect future, and suddenly they were accidentally hit by a car, which caused Stone to fall into critical condition and his mother died.[2]\n\nAfter the accident, Stone was taken to the hospital, where Silas Stone took Victor's body to his house to use the Mother Box on him.[2] Stone was experimented on by his father in an attempt to revive him, making videos, not knowing that the information would reach the hands of Lex Luthor.[3]  Weeks later, Victor Stone was finally transformed with robotic parts thanks to the Mother Box's alien technology upon being awakened by Silas, causing Stone to wake up from his coma.\n\nVictor Stone was upset with his father for turning him into a cyborg and felt resentment towards him, blaming him for everything that happened, including Elinore's death, even though Silas was only trying to help. Though Victor was \"restored\", he was declared dead to the public, believing that he would be rejected by the world because he considered himself a monster, Victor stayed home so as not to be judged. On November 2015, Stone rested until, due to Superman's death, he watched as the Mother Box began to awaken.[2]\n\nIn 2017, Victor Stone looked out the window remembering his accident until Silas Stone arrived to talk to him about going out into the world and learning his skills, but he kept rejecting him. After Silas left after playing a cassette for him to listen to a message, Stone took the cassette to find out what his father had to tell him. As he listened to the audio, he realized that he had more abilities than he imagined. Stone then began to practice his powers beginning with the skills of flying with the help of rockets on his feet and back. Upon managing to fly, Stone flew into the sky and discovered that he had a helmet.\n\nStone discovered that he could make realistic holograms from his mind, and began assembling statues to bring them to life. Stone saw that he had a lot of information in a virtual library and saw how a woman named Linda Reed had a daughter, but he also had several financial problems, so he multiplied a lot of money to give it to Reed. From afar, Stone watched Reed and her daughter with happiness as they improved their lives. After returning home, Stone began to control all of his abilities and when the audio of Silas was going to say something else, Stone shattered the cassette as he had nothing more to learn. Stone activated his laser and protected the Mother Box because a Parademon was searching for it.[2]\n\nTo keep the Mother Box safe, Stone decided to take it, and learned that Diana Prince was investigating him, so she sent him a message to meet. When Prince arrived, Stone met her and demanded to know why she was looking for him. As they talked, Stone confessed that he knew her entire history, and she explained that she needed her abilities to stop a threat, but he rejected her, as he did not see her form and powers as blessings.\n\nStone heard how Prince walked away from the world because he lost the love of her life, but understood that he had to move on. After the conversation, Stone continued with his decision not to join and flew away. Upon arriving at Elinore Stone's tomb, Victor began to excavate it to put the box in and prevent the Parademons from finding it.[2]\n\nStone returned home and saw how everything was destroyed, which led him to discover that a Parademon kidnapped Silas Stone. Upon seeing the Bat-Signal, Stone considered Diana Prince's proposal, and went to find the team, who were talking about the scientists kidnapped by Parademons. The team discussed the Gotham Harbor as the possible location of the Parademons, so they traveled there.\n\nStone and the team began exploring the docks. As Diana and Allen crossed a bridge, Stone was shocked, as he believed Batman did not exist, but he confessed that he existed only when necessary. The group watched as Steppenwolf interrogated several scientists to discover where the third Mother Box was. When Silas was going to be killed by Steppenwolf, Stone quickly went to him to attack him and rescue his father, who was surprised that he had come. To keep the scientists safe, Stone took his father and the other civilians off the docks with Flash's help.\n\nAfter saving all the scientists, Victor spoke to Silas and forgave him for everything he did, confessing that no matter what he had done to him, he still saw him as his father, leaving to return to the team. Stone hacked the Knightcrawler and spoke with Alfred Pennyworth, as he would be in charge of controlling the vehicle, using it to save Batman, Prince and Flash, who had been saved from drowning by Aquaman. Stone and the team successfully made it out of the flooding dock, and Stone dug up the box to take with the rest of the team, and make a plan to stop Steppenwolf.[2]\n\nThe next morning, Stone and the team went to Batman's aerospace hangar to discuss the plan, impressing Stone. The team began to discuss the Mother Box and Stone used the hologram of him to explain the story of how the thirdbox came to the Nazis and then to Silas Stone and how it was experimented upon by him to revive in his cyborg form. The group agreed of using the Mother Box to resurrect Superman in order to defeat Steppenwolf. At night, Stone and Barry Allen were tasked with searching for Superman's grave, and talked to Allen about Kent and how Allen liked Diana Prince. Finding the grave, the team put it in the van to meet Wayne.\n\nIn order to revive Superman on Scout Ship 0344, Stone took it upon himself to infiltrate S.T.A.R. Labs and hacked into the security system to fake an evacuation so the scientists could escape, the team infiltrated and were spotted by Silas, who helped them, and before leaving, Stone thanked his father for his help. Stone was shocked to see the ship's technology and began hacking it to revive Superman. While Allen prepared to touch the Mother Box before it falls and revive Kent, Stone began the countdown and had a vision of the future in which Darkseid murdered Prince and Curry, and Kent being manipulated by Darkseid to destroy the planet, scaring Stone.\n\nThe team left the ship and happily saw Superman revived in Heroes Park, but without his memories. Stone lost control of his technology, as the defense system was activated, and accidentally attacked Superman, causing the team to fight against him, who surpassed them in power. When Superman attacked the Metropolis Police Department, Stone quickly flew to save them so they could escape safely while he continued to protect other police officers. Stone and the team tried to stop Superman, but were defeated until Lois Lane arrived and managed to get him under control and escape.[2]\n\nAfter Superman left, Stone and Wonder Woman saw a Boom Tube appear, hinting that Steppenwolf had arrived at S.T.A.R. Labs, so Stone went at maximum speed to catch up. Stone tried to stop Steppenwolf from taking the Mother Box, but was knocked down, and on the ground, Stone tried to continue fighting, but watched as Silas Stone went into a security cell so he could make the box burning and traceable.\n\nWith tears, Stone watched as Silas sacrificed himself for him, and while crying, Stone was beaten by Steppenwolf, who took the box. Stone was then found by Flash and the others, who mourned Silas' death. Understanding his father's plan, Stone explained how Silas sacrificed himself so that the box would have a heat mark so they could locate him, and Batman agreed, with Stone agreeing to kill Steppenwolf to avenge his father. The team went to the Batcave, where they met Alfred Pennyworth, but Stone ignored him.\n\nStone decided to use his power to fuse with the boxes that would become the Unity that would destroy the planet, which Stone would destroy when fused. Prince warned him that the Unit would show him his fears, but Stone was firm with his decision. As they prepared, Stone remembered his father and tried to deal with his death. Ready, Stone and the team traveled on the Flying Fox to Pozharnov, where the boxes and Steppenwolf were located. On the ship, Stone and the team discussed the plan to stop Steppenwolf by infiltrating Pozharnov and thus destroying the Unity.[2]\n\nBefore reaching Pozharnov, Stone readied his weapons while the rest of the team prepared in his own way for the fight. After arriving, Stone and the team got off the Flying Fox, as Batman would be in charge of distracting the Parademons. When they managed to enter the city, Stone and the Justice League joined Wayne to fight the Parademons. During the battle, Stone saved Aquaman, who was happy to be his friend. Stone and Aquaman infiltrated Steppenwolf's base and fought him.\n\nWhile Wonder Woman and Aquaman fought Steppenwolf, Stone approached the Mother Boxes to merge with the help of Flash, but he was unable to run due to him being shot. Stone was about to be killed by Steppenwolf, but Superman arrived to save him and help the League. Since Flash was late, Stone and the League watched in fear as Darkseid crossed Apokolips with his army to use the Anti-Life Equation and destroy the entire planet, but Allen managed to turn back time to prevent it, and gave the necessary energy to Stone on time. After fusing, Stone was confronted by the Unity, which showed him how he could be happy with Silas and Elinore, including him in his normal form.\n\nRealizing that he had friends, Stone overcame his fears to move forward, leaving the vision. Stone tried to contain the Unity and with Superman's help, they successfully destroyed the Mother Boxes, then watching as Diana and Superman ended up killing Steppenwolf. The entire League watched Darkseid from a portal because his plan failed, before it closed. After leaving Steppenwolf's base, Stone and the League happily celebrated their victory and saw the Flying Fox arrive for them. Stone and Allen fist bumped as a symbol of victory and each member looked at each other as they were at peace.[2]\n\nFollowing the battle, Victor Stone returned to his home, where he repaired Silas's cassette, to hear his father's voice one last time. Stone discovered that his father had him at the end of an audio to inspire him to become a hero, seeing photos with his parents. After hearing it for the last time, Stone proudly visited his parents' grave, finally forgiving his father. Stone decided to honor the memory of his parents by revealing himself to the world and decided to become the vigilante Cyborg, flying happily into the sky.[2]\n\nStone discussed with Barry Allen about about the possibility of a Multiverse, where there were alternate counterparts, which Victor stated was impossible. Allen traveled via the Speed Force, where he met a counterpart of himself, mentioning that it was possible.[1]\n\nBefore his tragic accident and cybernetic transformation, Victor Stone was an optimistic football enthusiast and academic overachiever, thus managing to gain a scholarship to Gotham City University.\n\nAfter the accident, however, Victor abandons football and becomes gloomy, secluded, depressed, and even somewhat robotic. Cyborg can also be quite blunt and robotically stiff, sternly pointing out to a person that the latter should have moved out of the path of the Humvee flying right at him. This all stems from the fact that after becoming a cyborg, Victor no longer feels fully human, thinks of himself as a monster, and even Wonder Woman herself was initially unable to persuade him otherwise. However, when his father Silas Stone gets kidnapped by Steppenwolf, Cyborg joins the League without hesitation, and even personally attacks the fearsome New God to save him.\n\nDespite his disillusionment with the world, Victor retains his selflessness after his accident, hacking into school databases and changing the grades of students who are suffering from family hardships prior to his transformation, and assisting a penniless single mother by manipulating her bank account as Cyborg.\n\nAfter fighting alongside the Justice League for some time, however, Cyborg seems to have warmed a bit to all of his teammates, as he bonds a bit with Flash over their unexpected metahuman power gain (though he still found the latter's humor a bit annoying[4]), he somewhat bonds with Batman over their engineering expertise, he notably reassures the previously skeptical Aquaman that \"the ride ain't over yet\" (before helping the Atlantean fight a group of Parademons), he comes to appreciate Wonder Woman's emotional support, and even shares a laugh of relief with resurrected Superman (after they successfully pry apart the 3 Mother Boxes). Indeed, Cyborg is the first member of the League to have befriended every single one of his teammates during their first major battle. Superman's return and the defeat of Steppenwolf finally grants Cyborg the confidence to reveal his cybernetic self to the world, and begin mending his strained relationship with his father, as he is seen beginning to work with Silas at S.T.A.R. Labs.\n\nTechnorganic Physiology: After surviving a horrible accident and becoming a cybernetic organism with the help of an Apokoliptan Mother Box, Victor Stone has gained various superhuman abilities.",
