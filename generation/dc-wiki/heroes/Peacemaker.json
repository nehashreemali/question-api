  "content": "Christopher Clyde[2] \"Chris\" Smith, also known as the Peacemaker, is a violent vigilante who believes in achieving peace at any cost no matter how many people he has to kill for it in the process. He was also a member of the second Task Force X strike team sent on a mission to Corto Maltese. While he struck up a rapport with the team, he eventually turned on them to complete their intended mission when they learned it was all a cover-up for the U.S. government's mistake. In the attempt to complete the mission, Smith murdered team leader Rick Flag, and was sent into a coma by teammate and rival Bloodsport.\n\nSmith was sent to hospital to recover, where John Economos and Emilia Harcourt awaited his awakening, preparing to have him join a smaller team to participate in Project Butterfly, with his friend Vigilante also joining the team. During the course of the mission, Peacemaker also came into conflict with his abusive father, and was forced to reflect on his world views and past traumas, culminating in Smith defeating and killing his own father. In the aftermath, Smith was freed from Amanda Waller's control after Leota Adebayo publicly leaked Waller's corrupt secrets, and Smith started taking small steps towards becoming a better person, but became haunted by hallucinations of his father.\n\nChristopher Smith was born in 1981[1] to Auggie Smith, a powerful and cunning small-town racist whose views deeply scarred his son. Auggie forced Christopher through training to become a killer, as in one occasion he forced his son to kill a man by stabbing him.\n\nHe grew up alongside with his older brother Keith Smith, as the two shared the love for music.[3] At one point, Keith told his younger brother about the fake concept of \"butt babies,\" something Christopher believed himself to be until he was 14 years old.[4] While Smith was going through high school, his classmates called him \"Chimp-Arm\".[5] One day, Christopher and Keith went to fish, where they took a picture.[6]\n\nOne day, Chris and his brother were listening to rock and roll until they were interrupted by their father's classmates, warning them that it was time to fight. Smith and his brother went to the battlefield while his father bet, finally the coach warned that there were no restrictions. When the fight with his brother started at their father's orders, Auggie Smith told Chris that he punched like a girl, motivating him to land a harder punch in the head which knocked Keith to the ground accidentally killing him.[1]\n\nTragically, Chris and the crowd watched as Keith did not get up as he moved around and drooled from his mouth. Scared, Auggie approached Keith, screaming as he stopped moving until he died in a fatal seizure, immediately yelling at Chris and insulting him for having killed his brother, Chris observed what happened while very traumatized while his father keep yelling at him. The event later traumatized Christopher for life and strengthened his father's animosity towards him.[1]\n\nEventually, Smith became the superhero known as \"Peacemaker,\" a pacifist diplomat who grew so committed to peace, he eventually decided to enforce it by killing those who stood in his way. He donned a bright costume, an oddly-shaped chrome helmet with a dove engraved on it, and the moniker of Peacemaker to start his quest for peace by any means necessary. During his career, Peacemaker adopted an eagle which he named Eagly, becoming one of his best companions. At some point, Smith befriended Gut Chase and met his younger brother Adrian Chase, known as the Vigilante, with whom did he become friends.[7] In 2012, Peacemaker would visit Starlight Lounge where he would have sex with Becky Coolidge, unaware that this would apparently give birth to a daughter.[8]\n\nPeacemaker first appeared on the scene by apprehending Kite-Man,[6] who was attempting to steal the Blackheart Ruby.[8] During his superhero career, he also met Doll Man,[4] Matter-Eater Lad,[3] the Flash, and Wonder Woman.[8] While working with Matter-Eater Lad, they visited a Wendy’s restaurant, where Smith saw how he looked like a lunatic and used his power to eat the entire restaurant because they were late with their fries. Since then, Smith claimed that he lost his sense of normalcy after seeing what happened.[3] He had also heard of Aquaman,[5] Batman[7][3] and Superman,[6] although he came to form negative opinions about them due to rumors he heard on the Internet[5][6] and for Batman's public reputation for not killing his enemies.[3] Smith became aware about Clemson Murn committing many horrific acts as a mercenary.[5] Peacemaker also fought a gorilla at Burning Man.[6]\n\nIn 2016, Peacemaker was captured by A.R.G.U.S. and detained in Belle Reve for all murder crimes committed during his time as a vigilante, being sentenced to 30 years in prison. Before being imprisoned, he sent Eagly to August's house.[5]\n\nIn August 2020, Smith was recruited by Amanda Waller to join Task Force X on a mission he was eager to carry out: destroying a Nazi-built facility in Corto Maltese called Jotunheim, as well as annihilating all traces of the mysterious Project Starfish. Prior to the mission, Smith was given an ulterior task by Waller, assigned to destroy any evidence pertaining to the United States involvement with Project Starfish, including their torture of the civilians of Corto Maltese. Smith felt obligated to ensure this was kept a secret, as it was to keep the peace from being jeopardized to prevent an international incident.\n\nAfter Robert DuBois agreed to join the squad, Waller took him to meet Smith who was waiting in his cell, highlighting his skills in combat, DuBois complained that he had the same abilities as him, so Smith responded by doing better while they argued to use smaller bullets, beginning a rivalry. Waller took them to meet King Shark so they were surprised at the size of him, after seeing him, Waller made them continue to meet Cleo Cazo.\n\nSmith asked about Ratcatcher 1 but Waller replied that he was dead and she was his daughter, when Cazo arrived she was sleeping in her cell causing Smith to make fun of her for being a millennial. The team then followed Waller to meet Polka-Dot Man, where Smith laughed at his name by ironically asking if his power was to throw polka dots at people, after Waller didn't answer him he realized that it was his power.\n\nAlready recruited, Waller gave them back their suits and took them to an armchairs chamber where she explained the mission with part of the history of Corto Maltese, telling them of the coup and how they should kidnap Gaius Grieves to help them to enter Jotunheim and destroy Project Starfish. When Waller asked if there were any doubts, Peacemaker raised his hand and asked if there was any connection of the Project with the expression Starfish to name the anus, however, Waller answered no and Peacemaker crossed out the idea of a notebook.[9]\n\nThree days later, Peacemaker and his team were able to reach the second beach of the island swimming without problems, after the first strike team was brutally assassinated by the Armed Forces of Corto Maltese. The group advanced to the jungle until they heard an explosion coming from the first coast that scared them, however, Waller informed them that it was only a distraction.\n\nMoving forward, Smith criticized Bloodsport's leadership for what they began to argue, in which Smith demonstrated his love for American freedom when saying being able to eat a beach full of penises if that attributes to peace, while criticizing Bloodsport for killing for money. In that, they saw how Abner Krill's skin became strange and another explosion from the first beach was heard. Finally, the squad stopped in an area and prepared to camp to go to the city the next morning.\n\nWhile Peacemaker slept at night, he awoke to hear Bloodsport stopping King Shark from eating Cleo Cazo. Naked, Smith approached Nanaue along with Bloodsport and Cazo, Ratcatcher called a pack of rats to reassure Nanaue causing Bloodsport to freak out due to his phobia, Peacemaker took the opportunity to make fun of him while he was laughing, then Bloodsport highlighted that he was naked with white underwear, so Smith saw it as a racist offense.\n\nIn that, John Economos found the location of Rick Flag, so Amanda Waller ordered them to go there on his rescue, and Smith and the rest of the team spent the rest of the night traveling on the jungles of Corto Maltese until they found his location at the morning. On the trip, Waller ordered the squad to take down all the captors mercilessly by telling them they were dangerous people.[9]\n\nAfter the group are ordered by Waller to divert their efforts to finding Rick Flag before proceeding with the mission, Task Force X set out to rescue Flag, who they believe to have been captured by the government. Once they arrived, the team began to observe the encampment of people hiding among the leaves. While Bloodsport was observing the exact location on a radar, Peacemaker was preparing to pass a massacre, surprising Cazo because Smith's alias was the Peacemaker, Smith then explained his moral of killing people to achieve peace.\n\nThe firsts attacks of Nanaue and Cazo opened the way for Peacemaker to enter a soldier who was killed with an ax, while Bloodsport was killing, they began to turn the massacre into a competition, each trying to display their skillset. Smith would murder a rebel on a bed with a knife while Bloodsport beat up rebels who tried to stop him. Then Peacemaker would decide to climb on the roof of a fortress to dart the rebels, starting with a woman who was singing, then Smith would go down with a silencer because he saw Bloodsport set fire to enemies. Peacemaker would mistakenly shoot DuBois' helmet but hitting his victim.\n\nThen an upset Bloodsport would prove to have better aim by throwing a conditioner at a rebel. Peacemaker then used bullets of explosive compression. The squad would continue advancing until a rebel from the fort would try to shoot them with a submachine gun, but Polka-Dot Man stopped him. Finally, the team found the exact settlement/base where Rick Flag was located, so they approached.\n\nNonetheless, Peacemaker is both confused and surprised when they find Flag safe and talking with Sol Soria, the leader of a resistance group; it is shortly revealed that Flag hasn't been captured, but rescued. Regretful for killing innocents, Peacemaker and his team tried to cover up the massacre, when Soria was surprised that her companions didn't notify her of the arrival of the squad, until Nanaue spat a bone from a rebel. Shortly after, Soria went outside and saw in anguish the dead bodies of her companions, for which the team felt very sorry and apologized.[9]\n\nThe team now with Flag and the surviving rebels continued their journey through the jungle to rescue a rebel named Milton, on the trip Abner Krill got infected with deluna on his face, Peacemaker stopped him and asked him what that was, for which Krill replied telling their story, they finally decided to keep moving. At night, Peacemaker and the team arrested some guards who were interrogating Milton's truck to save him.\n\nAt that moment, Peacemaker and the team began moving boxes with clothes that they should wear to infiltrate La Gatita Amable's club, while Soria explained that Milton would take them to the place in his truck to kidnap Gaius Grieves. King Shark, by not having a human appearance, tried to pretend to wear a mustache to accompany them, but Peacemaker made fun of him for looking exactly the same.\n\nThe squad then set off to party, while on the trip, Smith listened to Cleo Cazo and Bloodsport stories. When they arrived, the squad entered the club while they watched, they finally sat down and began to talk about Thinker's arrival, as he would not arrive for a few hours, Peacemaker ordered the camarena to bring them a fernet, Bloodsport annoyed told him that they were on a mission, but Smith told him to relax a bit.\n\nWhen they brought the fernet, to annoy Cazo, Peacemaker told the waitress that she forgot the rat Sebastian, Krill sneezed the fernet, so Smith and the others laughed. The hours passed and to entertain themselves, Peacemaker along with his companions began to dance at the disco.[9] While waiting, Smith got Valentina's phone number, who became interested in him.[5] Finally Grieves appeared at the club, so Bloodsport approached and threatened him with a weapon to accompany them.\n\nIn that, when trying to withdraw some soldiers from the Armed Forces of the country arrived in search of the infiltrated Americans, worried Smith prepared a knife just in case. When they were cornered, DuBois asked Krill and Cazo to take Thinker away while he, Flag and Smith surrendered to the authorities, finally Flag and DuBois surrendered, confused Smith also raised his hands as a sign of surrender, so they were handcuffed and taken in a truck to be imprisoned.\n\nWhile traveling, a soldier spoke to them and Bloodsport played along to distract him, on the count of one, the three of them beat the soldiers knocking them out, then freeing themselves from the handcuffs. After breaking free, Peacemaker grabbed a shotgun to assassinate the driver who watched through a camera as they escaped, causing the corpse to push the pedal and drive faster while the partner tried to take the wheel.\n\nHowever, Smith grabbed him and started hitting him against the wall to death, seeing that they were about to collide he tried to grab the steering wheel, but frankly directing him off the road causing him to fall. The car finally stopped, lying face down, as Milton's truck pulled up to the scene, Smith along with DuBois and Flag escape through the door, and are reunited with the rest.[9]\n\nGuided by Flag, Task Force X diverts their efforts to saving Harley Quinn at the morning, who has been captured by the military and is being interrogated for information. As they drove to the palace in Milton's truck, the team began to prepare their weapons, however Peacemaker complained that they were risking the mission just to save a crazy woman, so Bloodsport highlighted that the comment came from someone who used a toilet on his head and Flag told him not to abandon his team, angering Smith.\n\nGoing down, everyone got into position in order of the plan where Peacemaker stood on top of a bell and pointed at the only person in the office waiting for a signal from Flag. When Flag was about to start the mission, he discovered that Harley Quinn had freed herself when he saw her approaching him. A short time later and taking Thinker hostage, the team took him on top of a building where they threatened him to help them enter Jotunheim, while Peacemaker sat eating empanadas, which Milton was delivering.[9]\n\nThe infiltration of Jotunheim at first goes off without a hitch, with Peacemaker and the team easily overpowering the guards at the entrance,[9] Harley Quinn mentioned feeling uncomfortable because Peacemaker was looking at her boobs, offending him by being on the other side without even seeing her, preparing his weapon when soldier Isabella approached to open the door of the van, finally not doing it and letting Thinker pass[10] and drive them to the base, the soldiers then allowed him to enter while hiding on the ground so as not to be seen. After crossing the guards, Thinker parked the vehicle and a heavy rain began to spread, as Peacemaker and the team prepared to get off.\n\nThe squad walked to the entrance, taking advantage of the rain making them less visible, they began to attack the soldiers by surprise, Peacemaker was in charge of splitting several soldiers in half using a sword. After finishing off the group of soldiers, the team advanced until the door. Peacemaker then hit Thinker against the retinal scan, after that threat Thinker was forced to open the door and the squad entered and locking down the building before the entire Corto Maltesean army coming can get to them first.\n\nOnce inside the facility, the team begins placing plastic explosives around the walls and decides to split up into two teams: one would plant the remaining explosives on the upper floors while the other would be in charge of destroying Project Starfish. Peacemaker was assigned by Flag to join King Shark to plant bombs on the first floor. While Smith was working, Nanaue used an explosive to form the figure of Christopher Smith and show it to him, Smith got upset with him for playing with explosives and would ask him to put it back on the wall.\n\nIn that, Peacemaker would listen to Rick Flag, and then see how he along with Ratcatcher 2 took Thinker to the elevator with the intention of showing them Project Starfish. Smith quickly began to follow them without them noticing, taking an elevator down to the basement where they find a testing facility full of the subjects exposed to Project Starfish, which is revealed to actually be the extraterrestrial, Starro the Conqueror, who was imprisoned on the base.\n\nWhile Ratcatcher 2 and Thinker set out to find a way to kill Starro, Peacemaker came to the floor, interrupting the conversation and annoying Flag by saying that he should be planting explosives, Smith however replied that he didn't trust King Shark. Then Flag, anger at being used as a puppet, managed to recover a hard drive containing proof of Starro's existence, as well as the fact that it was actually recovered and experimented on by the US government instead of the Corto Maltesean government.\n\nBefore he can take it however, Peacemaker points his gun at him, exposing his secondary mission. Alongside destroying Starro, Peacemaker was also tasked by Waller to destroy any evidence confirming its existence in order to deny any involvement of the US in its recovery and weaponization. Peacemaker is determined to destroy the hard drive, although he does not want to kill Flag to get to it and gives him a chance to hand it over. Before the situation can escalate however, an explosion rocks the facility, bringing it down on top of the whole team.[9]\n\nPeacemaker and Flag both survive the explosion, however Flag is severely wounded by a piece of debris. He still stands his ground against Peacemaker though, and the two engage in a fistfight in order to wrestle control of the chip. Flag tried to kick Smith, but Smith grabbed his foot to throw it against some seeds to do it again, to defend himself Flag grabbed a nearby pipe with which he began to hit him, Smith however stopped him but Flag continued to hit him, in defense Smith grabbed Flag and threw him against a broken bathtub, seeing the disc he decided to kick it so that Flag wouldn't catch it.\n\nDespite his injury, Flag was able to overpower Peacemaker and pins him to the ground, choking him with a metal pipe. However, before he was able to kill him, Peacemaker grabs a piece of fallen debris and lodges it directly into Flag's heart, fatally wounding him. As he bleeds out, Flag mutters how Peacemaker's name is a joke before succumbing to his injuries. Cleo Cazo saw how Smith killed Flag, and despite Peacemaker’s warnings, she decided to take the disc and started escaping.[9]\n\nWith Flag dead, Peacemaker goes after Ratcatcher 2, who takes the chip and attempts to run. He catches up with her, and pins her to the floor. She begs for her life as he holds a gun to her. Just as he's about to shoot, Bloodsport drops in from the ceiling, realizing that Peacemaker is a traitor. The two shoot at each other, but Bloodsport's bullet goes through Peacemaker's bigger bullet, destroys his pistol, and lands in his neck. Peacemaker questions how this happened while bleeding out, and Bloodsport tells him about the smaller bullet's advantage. Peacemaker then hits the floor, presumably dead. He would eventually be crushed under the rubble as Jotunheim collapses.[9]\n\nAt some point after the Corto Maltese mission ended and the team is sent back home, Peacemaker was found by a rescue team, having miraculously survived his encounter with Bloodsport and the collapse of Jotunheim. He was then quickly rushed to the Mount Rouge Health Center where he was treated for his wounds by Dr. Alandy. However, Waller still had other plans for the vigilante, so she sent Emilia Harcourt and John Economos to visit Smith in the hospital while still in coma.[11]\n\nWhen Smith awoke from his coma, he met the janitor Jamil, who smoked marijuana with Smith while he was recovering and having to move around in a wheelchair, having a good time together but they were not friends.[5]\n\n5 months after the Jotunheim incident, Smith met with Dr Alandy, who showed him amazing images of how they only fixed a few bones, as the whole building fell on Smith, because I surprisingly survive everything, including Bloodsport's bullet. Smith asked Alandy to zoom in on his X-ray to see his muscles, and she finally discharged Smith as long as he kept up with his physical therapy by trying to avoid lifting his right elbow above his shoulder. Smith was surprised because it was so easy and he should not move his right arm, accepting, even without believing that he was finally free.\n\nSmith went to talk to Jamil to ask for his trust, but he knew they were not friends, so he revealed that he was freed and that he should actually be imprisoned in Belle Reve for \"integrity\", but Jamil didn't believe him. He confessed to her that he was a Peacemaker and that he was a famous superhero, but Jamil never heard of him, considering Aquaman as more famous, which annoyed Smith, and commented that @PepetheFrog89 had posted that Aquaman had intimate relationships with fish.\n\nSmith asked him if there were any cops around the hospital to arrest him as he was supposed to be back to prison now that he was free to go, but Jamil assured him that there were not cops around. Smith put on his damaged costume and quickly ran from the Mount Rouge Health Center, getting into a Taxi and telling the driver to drive while he celebrated the fact that he escaped. Peacemaker arrived in his home but was forced to give his helmet to the taxi driver as he didn't have any money to pay him for his service and the driver didn't accept Corto Maltese money.[5]\n\nSmith tried to get into his house but couldn't find his keys, so he began searching to no avail, forcing him to use his right arm to break one the house's windows to get in. To rest, Smith sat in his bed and began to see that his phone had several audio messages from Adrian Chase, which were alerts so that together they could fight crime, but Smith turned down his invitations, to forget about the stress.\n\nBefore Smith had any chance to settle back in his home, he was approached by mercenary Clemson Murn, one of Amanda Waller's operatives, who offered him a chance to stay out of prison if he joined a black-ops assassination team led by Murn. Peacemaker accepted, and joined the team, comprised of Emilia Harcourt, Peacemaker's handler in the field on whom he had a crush, John Economos, the tech and tactics man who Peacemaker enjoyed bullying, and Leota Adebayo, the newbie in charge of all other operations. Smith listened to Adebayo giving out her speech, and after she finished her speech, Smith asked what they wanted him to do.\n\nMurn explained that they had a new mission titled Project Butterfly, which involved assassinating targets called \"butterflies\" that were endangering American citizens. Smith got concerned that he would need a jetpack to fight a giant butterfly, then asked what would happen if he rejected the mission. Murn said he would have to return to Belle Reve and that Peacemaker's neckbomb was still armed which they could use to track him down and detonate it should he try to run away. Murn then asked Smith to come for dinner at 7:30 PM at Fennel Fields on Manchester Road, to which Smith agreed, but first he would go to his father's house and get Eagly.[5]\n\nSmith then took a taxi cab to his father's house to meet him. There, the old man next door commented on him as an evil supervillain, to which Smith argued that he's a superhero. They got into an argument and they stopped after Auggie Smith opened the door. His father asked why he was talking with that old man which Smith replied that he was talking to him first. His father asked Chris why he didn't tell him when he got out of prison, and Chris replied that it had been rough for him and he'd been laid out in a hospital for five months. Smith then told his father about how a guy shot him and the building fell on him, which his father thought was pathetic. Chris asked how Eagly was, and his father said that he had been taking him outside, as he wanted to see him, his father showed the way to Eagly.\n\nChris was happy to finally reunite with his pet, and Eagly hugged him, to Chris's surprise. Chris told his father to get his phone, but his father had already left. Chris later had lunch with his father and told more stories about Bloodsport. He told him about Ratcatcher 2, who could control rats, and mocked Bloodsport for his musophobia, at which his father laughed maniacally. His father asked if DuBois had shot him, to which Smith indirectly said yes, which disappointed Auggie. Smith then told his father that he only came for Eagly and a new helmet.\n\nAfter finishing their lunch, Chris then went with his father to the storage chamber where he explained most of the helmets' capabilities as one with force field, one with underwater breathing ability, and one with x-ray. Smith found several helmets with special capabilities and opted for the sonic trigger, although August refused, he accepted to take it, as he would gift him one to use for the mission if he could do something useful with it.[5] Smith saw other helmets and found that one had scabies, and Auggie confessed that men must have scabies once in their lives.[12]\n\nThat night, Smith put on his new costume and arrived at Fennel Fields. After parking, Smith left Eagly in his car, and entered the restaurant to meet Emilia Harcourt, Clemson Murn, John Economos, and Leota Adebayo, who ordered food without him. Smith argued with the team about Eagly and said that they were jealous because he had an eagle. Smith asked the waitress Blake for his food, and everyone was surprised as he called her sweeycheeks, and they discussed that nickname.\n\nAs Murn wanted him to treat everyone with respect, Smith confessed that he knew stories about him when Murn killed people. As Smith received his food, the team realized that he was being watched by his Gut Chase's younger brother, Adrian. Smith received a document on Senator Royland Goff, whom he was tasked to assassinate, but he had to see the file at his house. While eating, Smith was reprimanded by Economos and Murn, who asked him to remove his helmet, which he reluctantly did.\n\nAfter the meeting ended, Smith returned to his car and was glad to see Eagly, but was surprised by Leota Adebayo. Smith began talking to her about the mission and the two began to bond, and he discovered that Adebayo was married. As he said goodbye, Smith admitted that he had a large crotch, something that surprised Adebayo, since he didn’t want to know. Smith saw Eagly and was happy to have Adebayo as a friend.[5]\n\nAfter he got back to the car, Smith started driving alongside Eagly and they were having fun together while listening to rock music and exploring Evergreen, until he saw Emilia Harcourt enter a bar, as he wanted to have sex, he turned his car around and went into the bar, where he act surprised to see her, who didn't want to talk with him, but he tried to flirt with her, and told her that she could call him Chris, although she kept rejecting him. When Harcourt faced a group of men who tried to abuse her, Smith saw her defend herself and began falling in love with her.\n\nAfter the fight, Smith told her that he was surprised by what had happened, and was happy to hear Harcourt call him handsome. Smith confessed to her that he wanted to date a woman and at least have sex, which made Harcourt upset, and decided to withdraw. Alone, Smith didn’t know what to do until he saw Annie Sturphausen, who took him to her apartment, and they both had sex.[5] After going to the bathroom, Smith found Annie Sturphausen reading Royland Goff's files, but it didn’t matter to him.[7]\n\nSmith began to inspect the apartment and noticed that Sturphausen had rock records, even a The Quireboys record, surprising him, and began to listen to the music as he danced and sang. Smith excitedly admitted that he had a second chance, just like Eagly, and celebrated. Smith was suddenly interrupted by Sturphausen, who started attacking him, so Smith had to defend himself, managing to resist Sturphausen’s knife. Smith started to throw things at her, however she managed to resist his attacks, so with no other options, he was forced to jump out of the apartment.\n\nWith no strength, Smith had to run, crawling, to his car, using Eagly as a distraction. Smith managed to put on his helmet and when Sturphausen was about to kill him, he activated the sonic shot and blew up Sturphausen, which greatly surprised Smith, after the hull was shut off. Smith saw with disgust the destroyed parts of Sturphausen and sat down to rest while he was accompanied by Eagly, with whom he shared a smile of relief until he heard the horns of the Evergreen Police Department.[5]\n\nAs the Evergreen Police Department, were arriving after being alerted to the incident, Smith notified Harcourt, who in turn was assisted by Adebayo to inform her that Annie Sturphausen was a Butterfly, which made Harcourt come to escorting him off the premises before he could be apprehended. Harcourt came to the Wild Estates Apartment Complex, thanks to the Nano-Bombs, scaring Smith, because he thought she saw him doing dirty things, but it wasn’t true.\n\nAs Smith collected his uniform and personal belongings from Annie's apartment, he was briefly noticed by Song and her associate Larry Fitzgibbon, who proceeded to enter the apartment and interrogate its residents while tailing Smith. One of the residences which Smith himself attempted to hide in, was occupied by a man named Evan Calcaterra and his wife Amber, who were in a dysfunctional relationship. To stay hidden, Smith threatened the Calcaterrsa with a knife while Amber, saw what was going on, and got upset with Evan. Smith used a bag and rope to escape while talking to Amber about his musical tastes, which made Evan jealous.\n\nThe two of them assisted Smith in gathering his belongings as he voluntarily tied them up in order to silence their arguing as Song and Fitzgibbon continued questioning other occupants. Smith attempted to exit the complex through the residence balconies, only to be cornered by police officers who arrived to arrest him, but Harcourt infiltrated the premises and tranquillized them. allowing Smith, Harcourt and Adebayo to escape the scene as they are shot at by Song and Fitzgibbon, but first, Peacemaker made a whistle to call Eagly quickly. When Eagly arrived, the group escaped from the police, and they celebrated their escape while traveling to the lair.[7]\n\nMeanwhile, John Economos hastily swapped out Smith's fingerprints in the crime scene to correlate with those of Christopher's own father Auggie Smith to keep the police off Peacemaker's track. Upon arriving at Henenlotter Video, Smith was helped by John Economos to close his wounds and Smith mocked him for having a painted beard. The two began to argue and Smith surprised when he learned that there was a being from another dimension called Bat-Mite. The team began to argue about who was the person reporting to the Butterflies about their operation and denied that Economos could have been.\n\nHowever, Smith took the opportunity to tell an anecdote of how Economos had sex for the first time, which everyone believed, despite Economos' denial. Smith recalled that Annie Sturphausen had read Goff's file, which led to Smith and Murn arguing about it, but Smith was still upset because he didn’t know it was a butterfly, and he believed that his crotch was full of alien infections. He also revealed that he took Amber and Evan Calcaterra hostage, so Murn sent Adebayo to bribe them before  being interrogated by the police, which resulted Auggie's unintended arrest, while Smith was still aided by Economos, and he make Smith realize that everyone hated him.[7]\n\nRecovered, Smith returned to his trailer and started listening to FireHouse’s record while crying because he didn’t have any friends. Smith felt that John Economos might be his friend, but he treated him badly, as did everyone else, also remembering how he killed Rick Flag, as he was right on saying he was just a joke. Smith was surprised by Vigilante, who came to visit him, but he was afraid, because Chase might have his crotch out to cum on him, although it wasn’t true, but he was still scared and mentioned that Louis C.K. did it. Smith argued with him until he finally realized that he had nothing and was upset because he didn’t come through the door.\n\nWhen Chase got in, Smith explained to him that he left Belle Reve to work with the government and Chase thought he was his best friend, but Smith admitted it was Eagly, since he didn’t know Chase’s identity, but Chase revealed that he hasn’t told him because they might threaten him. Smith admitted that he had to kill people, even though he had intentions of letting go of being a bad person. Smith listened to Chase, who sat down next to him to give him advice about killing good and bad people, as Smith wanted to kill only bad people, even though there may be a mistake.\n\nVigilante invited him to partake in target practice and celebrate his freedom, and Smith agreed and went with Chase to shoot some appliances. The duo headed into the woods alongside Eagly to start having fun and shot together, dropped bombs, played with Eagly, and laughed together until they clapped hands to finally be friends. Later, Peacemaker and Vigilante sought out Amber Calcaterra to have sex the three together. After finishing, Smith took a break to smoke and inspected Annie Sturphausen's item, which turned out to be a Butterflies' Spaceship, surprising them.[7]\n\nAfter the events, Smith took the mission seriously and met with his teammates to go kill Royland Goff. Smith talked with Leota Adebayo about the possible small aliens on the ships and mentioned his fear of homunculus-like little fingers, surprising Adebayo and John Economos, whom Smith feared. Smith explained that the ship was at its lunch next to Adebayo and warned Economos not to eat it, calling him \"Dye-Beard\", bothering him.\n\nSmith then tell Adebayo that he thought the Butterflies were sexual, and they were surprised by Vigilante, who was behind the trashcan, and Smith explained that Vigilante wanted to help them, although Smith refused their help. Upon hearing that Vigilante wanted to help him be okay, Smith told him he would be okay, which he accepted, and quickly left to follow them in secret. Smith and Adebayo continued to talk before they got on the truck for the mission.\n\nWhile traveling, Smith learned all about the mission from Murn and Adebayo, who showed him pictures of Goff and his family, Smith was then shocked when Adebayo accidently showed an intimate photo of her wife, and together with Harcourt and Economos they mocked her and began to laugh, as Adebayo blamed Harcourt for telling her to move out of the apartment to be safe. Smith stopped laughing when he heard that he had to kill the whole Goff family, including their children, if they turned out to be Butterflies.\n\nSmith expressed his discomfort, but Harcourt rubbed his peace goal in his face, though Smith began to feel pity, and explained how his brother talked to him about the babies, and noticed that Goff’s daughter was ugly, but it wasn’t a reason to kill him, although Murn said if they were Butterflies it would do. He also learned about Goff’s bodyguard, Judomaster, whom he should avoid, but Smith was more upset, as Judomaster would be easy to beat for being small.\n\nAfter arriving, Smith prepared his sniper gun while talking to Leota Adebayo and Emilia Harcourt about sex until he realized that his gun did not have its dove symbol, Like the rest of his weaponry, so Adebayo gave him a pen to draw his symbol, which upset Christopher Smith, because he couldn’t draw, trying to draw a symbol, which was weird.[4]\n\nDuring the night, Smith and Emilia Harcourt were preparing for the arrival of Royland Goff and his family while Clemson Murn, John Economos and Leota Adebayo watched from the van. Smith ate with Harcourt, but he gave her some candy to eat, not knowing they were being watched by Vigilante. Smith and Harcourt realized the family had arrived, so they set out to assassinate Goff, though Smith pretended not to have the perfect shot, as Goff stood in front of his wife, children and guards.\n\nSmith and Harcourt lost Goff, but they saw how the family behaved strangely at home, which confirmed that all were Butterflies, and he refused to kill Judomaster and the other guard. While waiting for Goff again, Smith spent time with Harcourt and told her about how Auggie Smith trained him to be a killer, and she mentioned about how xhe joined A.R.G.U.S., and how in her childhood he learned to defend himself, and to shoot, surprising Smith.\n\nThey both had a near romantic moment, before Harcourt retired to do something. Smith kept watching until he was caught by Vigilante, who revealed that he followed them thought his Vigilante-Mobile, which upset him, as Chase’s car was actually a Sebring, and they discussed the name. When Harcourt returned, Smith told Chase to leave so that Murn would decide to let Chase stay and help him not to say anything, which upset Smith.[4]\n\nSmith, Harcourt, and Chase got the perfect shot and watched as Royland Goff ate with his family as Butterflies, so Clemson Murn ordered that he had to kill the whole family. Out of fear, Smith could not shoot until Chase took his place to kill Goff’s wife and children, which saddened Smith. When Vigilante was going to kill Goff, they were attacked by Judomaster, so they had to fight him. Smith fought him and accidentally implanted a knife in Chase’s arm. At the disadvantage, the trio was defeated by Judomaster, who took Smith and Chase to Goff’s lair in his residence.[4]\n\nSmith woke up in a cave at the Goff residence along with Vigilante, who was unconscious, and he mocked Judomaster for his size, but Judomaster reminded him how he beat him. Seeing that Judomaster was eating cheetos, he asked Judomaster to eat his treats, but he gave him several while kicking them in the face, upseting Smith, before Royland Goff came. Tied up, Smith watched as Goff put electrical connections to Chase’s testicles while Judomaster made a vulgar sign.\n\nWhen Goff took the mask off Chase, Smith watched as Chase changed faces to avoid being identified while Goff threatened to torture Chase if he didn’t give up information, but Smith refused, which caused Chase to be tortured, and he recognized him as Gut Chase’s brother, but he saw Adrian as more cool. In his position, Smith still refused to reveal the whole plan, while Goff continued to torture Chase, and he proved that he didn’t care until Goff threatened to cut off Chase’s fingers.\n\nAlthough Smith didn’t care, he watched as Chase started to lose his finger. However, an explosion caused by Leota Adebayo, Emilia Harcourt and Clemson Murn with the Adhesive Explosive managed to get Smith out and take advantage of it to face Goff. Smith attacked Goff, but he defended himself by his strength, however, he could give him some blows, and took Goff’s shotgun to then kill him for peace.\n\nSmith then helped Chase get up and returned his mask so the team would not know his identity. The duo rose to meet with Emilia Harcourt and Leota Adebayo to report their location, but to their surprise, both watched as a Butterfly came out of Goff’s head, Which made Smith understand that the Project Butterfly was about alien butterflies while still watching the creature fly.[4] Smith took the Butterfly, which he named \"Goff\".[8]\n\nHiding the butterfly in a jar, Smith and Chase met with Harcourt and Adebayo to then go with John Economos and Clemson Murn and leave. To hide his Butterfly, Smith lied that he had killed the creature and mocked Chase because he would start walking strangely, but he deceived everyone by saying he was laughing at something else. When Judomaster fell because they had taken him, Smith and Chase pointed their guns to kill him, although Harcourt and Adebayo stopped them, because Judomaster would be useful.[3]\n\nSmith and the team returned to Henenlotter Video to rest and meet with Clemson Murn, who immediately called Smith to his office. In anger, Smith informed Murn that it was wrong to kill the children, even though they were Butterflies, and they started arguing, in which Smith tried to say that he couldn’t kill because it wasn’t his symbol, although Murn knew he was lying. He confessed that it was not necessary to kill many people until Murn confessed that to stop the Butterflies required killers, which Smith understood.\n\nThey both saw Chase dying of pain and realized that Murn needed him, but Smith had no faith because Chase was not right in the head. He also told Murn how he saw Matter-Eater Lad devour a restaurant at Wendy’s, since that day it lost all meaning to something normal. Before leaving, Smith asked Murn who the Butterflies were, and he told him they would meet in the evening to discuss it. Smith met with Chase to rest together.[3]\n\nSmith and Adrian Chase headed over to Auggie Smith's home to look for new helmets for the mission. During the trip, he talked to Chase about torture with Royland Goff, although he realized that Chase was upset, since he didn’t support him, but Chase tried to tell him that he wasn’t upset, and Smith knew that if he was upset, starting an argument because he wasn’t going to give any information to Chase. Upon arrival, Smith explained to Chase that his father had the U.S. flag upside down due to the deep state, which Chase considered racist, Smith then reminded him how his father pretended to be gay to get away from him.\n\nAfter getting off the Vigilante-Mobile, Smith asked Chase to stay and ran silently towards the house to avoid arguing with the elderly neighbor. Smith realized that Auggie was not at home, which surprised him, and he entered the Quantum Unfolding Storage Area to take a helmet, however, he decided to take all the helmets with special abilities, but stayed watching White Dragon Suit, which made him have a moment of seriousness because of his father’s dark past.\n\nSmith was surprised by Chase, who judged the appearance of the armor, which upset Smith because he asked him to stay. Listening to the metaphor of Chase’s ducks, Smith argued with him about a duck wearing a suit something that would be impossible and explained to him that he was not working with Auggie Smith only had in common stop criminals while his father makes his equipment.\n\nThe duo had an argument until Smith ordered Chase out because he had all the helmets he needed. They both left the residence, but the neighbor asked Peacemaker if he had any villains, which he didn’t, so the neighbor still thought he was a villain. Angry, Smith confessed that his enemies were dead and talked about Batman because he always fought criminals without killing them so they could escape and murder people. Smith was upset at the conversation and would withdraw until he learned from the neighbor that Auggie had been arrested after being blamed by Murn's team.[3]\n\nSmith called angered to Clemson Murn to ask him why his father was in prison and found out that the Evergreen Police Department had stopped chasing them. Smith hung up on him, as he had planned to go to his father, and talked to Adrian Chase to apologize for the torture, although he had already forgiven him, Smith asked him to take him to the Evergreen Corrections Center to visit his father, even though he was a racist.\n\nSmith and Chase got out of the car, but saw Leota Adebayo come in to try to stop him. Smith talked to her about who was responsible until he found out that John Economos had swapped his prints for his father’s. When Adebayo told her that he knew what Auggie had done to her since he was a child, Smith argued with her, as she did not know everything he had to go through in his childhood, and told Adebayo that even though his father was a villain, he was still his family.\n\nAt the prison, Smith called Auggie to meet, during the conversation, Smith explained to his father his mission with the government and how John Economos framed him so that his mission would not go sideways. Auggie asked his son to tell the truth, though Smith did not want to be arrested before completing the mission, which infuriated his father, who was still disappointed, and Smith found out that his father never loved him, but he did love Keith Smith.\n\nHe tried to explain how he could learn to love him in spite of everything as he grew up and indirectly referred to himself as a crotch. However, Smith explained that it was in a good way, but August was upset because he called himself a penis. Smith asked him not to say anything for the sake of humanity, because it would stop the Butterflies, but Auggie didn’t care because he would tell detective Sophie Song, Which made Smith sad when he realized his father didn’t love him anymore.\n\nAs he left, Smith met with Adebayo and asked her about Chase, finding out that he had gone to do something. Smith didn’t want to tell Adebayo about what happened, so he walked her to her car and left with her, but finally told her about how his father treated him and they began to vent while still forming their bond of friendship. Smith confessed that he was sad because his father didn’t want him until Adebayo gave him a tip to avoid bad people like him and thanked Adebayo for the talk.[3]\n\nSmith and Leota Adebayo were still talking in the car until they got a call from John Economos, but Smith didn't want to talk with for putting his father in prison, however, they immediately learned by him that Judomaster had escaped, so they went with speed to Henenlotter Video. Upon arriving, Smith and Adebayo saw Economos wounded, who told Smith that Judomaster escaped through the window, so Smith jumped and started to chase him through the parking lot while insulting him to get his attention until he showed up and they both had their revenge.\n\nDuring the fight, both insulted each other while sharing punches and Smith had the advantage, Smith insulted Judomaster further and they picked up the fight, but Smith was able to take the blows and was about to defeat him, although Judomaster wanted to inform him something about the Butterflies, until Adebayo showed up to save Smith shooting the latter. Angry, Smith claimed to Adebayo what he did because he was going to beat him, although Smith realized that Judomaster would be revived because martial artists could trade his heart for a kidney, which Adebayo didn’t believe, but Smith did, and they both had no idea what Judomaster would say.\n\nSmith then proceeded to take Judomaster to the lair so that John Economos could keep him alive. Later, he returned to his trailer and fondled Eagly then sit down and pull \"Goff\" out of his bag as he thought he knew more about what Judomaster meant. Smith dropped the jar and got into a fight with Eagly, who tried to eat \"Goff.\"[3]\n\nIn the night, Smith returned to O'Rourke's Sports Bar to meet with Emilia Harcourt, who was angry at seeing him, but he just came to ask her to know what his file said about him and Harcourt revealed that it was talking about how August trained him from a young age, just like the death of his brother, Keith, for \"mysterious circumstances,\" which surprised Smith and then retired, before talking about Harcourt’s breasts as a compliment.\n\nBack in his trailer, Smith began to lament all he had to suffer for being a vigilante and started dancing while getting drunk and listening to music to let off some steam. Smith danced with sadness and remembered the training he had to do to become a murderer and how he killed Rick Flag, who saw him as a joke for his codename, Peacemaker, and he cried for killing one of his friends before falling to the ground depressed, and was surrounded by Eagly and \"Goff\", who tried to cheer him up. Smith took a picture of him and Keith to remember him, leaving the picture to lie down and keep crying.[3]\n\nThe next morning, Smith was still depressed to prepare his breakfast and smoked in the \"Goff\" jar. Smith left his house to watch some brothers play while he kept remembering Keith until Eagly brought him a hunted squirrel, and Smith thanked Eagly for his support. Before he took a shower, Smith struck a grenade with a Russian tank, but he did not know how it would explode.[6]\n\nSmith put on his costume to meet with the team at Henenlotter Video to learn about the Butterflies. During the presentation of Economos, Smith learned that the Butterflies would come in through any hole and he watched with anger to Economos for putting his father in prison. Smith later mentioned that Superman liked to eat excrement, as he read it on the internet, but Adebayo and Harcourt did not believe him.\n\nSmith mocked the Economos' presentation, calling him \"Dye-Beard\" again and was confronted by Economos, who tried to apologize for putting his father in prison because he couldn’t think of anyone else, which made him even angrier, and they started arguing until Smith started saying names of celebrities, fictional people, singers, and famous actors that he could have incriminated,[6] although they both agreed that Ariana Grande should not be arrested.[13]\n\nSmith was still upset, but was interrupted by Murn to continue the explaination, as the team's new goal was to travel to the Glan Tai Bottling Company to investigate the Amber Fluid that the Butterflies eat, to find out how to defeat them. To further annoy Economos, Smith wrote an insult on a piece of paper with his nickname \"Dye-Beard\" and showed it to him to taunt him. As they prepared, Smith talked to Adebayo and Chase about Economos and the nickname he gave him to annoy him.\n\nSmith explained to Leota Adebayo that he always gave nicknames to everyone like Adrian’s brother, Gut Chase, but Adrian confessed that none of Smith’s friends liked nicknames, because they would be their so-called life names. Smith mentioned that as a child he was called bully and jerk, which made him feel bad, but Adebayo encouraged him, and asked him to treat Economos well, which he accepted.[6]\n\nDuring the trip, Smith listened to music while Vigilante danced until Emilia Harcourt turned it off because they were on a mission, upseting Smith because he had many more, and criticized Harcourt’s musical tastes. Smith kept calling John Economos \"Dye-Beard\" but Leota Adebayo reminded him to be nicer and had to call him by name reluctantly. Smith learned that A.R.G.U.S. was like the deep state, as they could do anything to stop the Butterflies.\n\nSmith asked for more music to put on and was surprised to hear that Economos was a fan of Hanoi Rocks and that he had the tattoo with the 11th Street Kids song. Smith excitedly played the music until Harcourt turned it off because they had already arrived at the Glan Tai Bottling Company. Smith took his x-ray helmet and lowered to prepare with his gun, the team got ready and Smith talked to Adebayo about how women had sex until Chase interrupted everyone to show his chainsaw, but Harcourt refused to let Chase take it.\n\nSmith went with Adebayo to interrogate people to find out more about the Amber Fluid. Inside, Smith inspected the place while Adebayo was talking to some people, but thanks to his helmet, Smith realized they were Butterflies, and killed them without warning Adebayo. Smith explained that his helmet had x-rays and he thought he was already behaving, but they continued walking to find the amber, and informed the others that the whole place had butterflies.\n\nSmith and Adebayo noticed that in the manufacturing area there were many Butterflies trying to attack Harcourt and Chase, so he pulled out his grenade stuck to the Russian tank, which he never tried to throw away, and revealed to Adebayo that he didn’t know how many people he would kill. After throwing it at the Butterflies, Peacemaker and Adebayo ran off and managed to evade the big explosion that killed the Butterflies, upon rising, Peacemaker and Leota Adebayo discussed the explosion until they entered the secret room.\n\nHowever, they confronted Charlie, who turned out to be a super gorilla with Butterfly powers. Smith, Harcourt, Adebayo and Chase tried to face the animal but were knocked down. Smith jumped on the gorilla to try to knock him out and managed to give him a few blows, though he was quickly knocked down. On the ground, Smith was about to get killed by the gorilla, with John Economos appearing and managing to kill Charlie with a chainsaw, thus earning the respect and camaraderie of Smith himself.\n\nShocked, Peacemaker thanked Economos and finally began to respect him, which turned the two into friends. On the way home, Smith re-recorded 11th Street Kids and sang alongside John Economos while Leota Adebayo and Adrian Chase celebrated victory. Smith noticed that Harcourt had begun to like music and kept partying, he kept congratulating Economos on saving the day as Harcourt took a photo of them having fun.[6]\n\nPeacemaker and the team returned to Henenlotter Video to inform Clemson Murn that the mission was a success and that they were happy to have defeated Charlie, and Smith mentioned that he once faced a gorilla. As they would investigate what was found at the Glan Tai Bottling Company the next day, Smith and his friends took a break and continued to praise Economos. Smith argued with Chase, who was a little upset because Economos killed someone with his chainsaw and he couldn’t, but Smith didn’t care about it.\n\nSmith went with Adebayo to his trailer, and Smith checked his phone, where he saw that Harcourt invited him to a group she called 11th Street Kids, as they all became friends, and he was happy because he finally had real friends, and he told Adebayo about Chase’s emoji. Smith dropped out of the car, but decided to invite Adebayo to her house to talk, though she believed he would try to convince her to have sex, and Smith convinced her that it was not so.\n\nIn the trailer, Smith offered Adebayo drinks while she inspected the place and some photos of Smith with Keith, as well as pictures from his days as a hero. Smith toasted with Adebayo, however, he saw that Adebayo did not like his drink, as did Smith, and had to have beers to then talk. As they talked, Smith revealed to Adebayo that he liked Harcourt and told her how she called him handsome at the bar, but also insulted him, something that made him feel bad.\n\nAdebayo advised him to be more calm in trying to conquer her, which Smith accepted, as he might be able to date her, and they celebrated because they became a real team. Smith got a great advice from Adebayo about how he should stop being such a jerk so that he can make people like him, thanking Adebayo for all her help and mentioned that he never had a person to motivate him to be someone better. Smith started crying over that advice and retired to the bathroom while Adebayo, under Amanda Waller's orders, put a fake diary in his trailer before leaving.[6]\n\nThe next day, Smith was contacted by Jamil, who asked for his help for his daughter Adiva presenting himself as the Peacemaker at school, which he accepted. Smith introduced himself and told the story when he confronted Kite-Man with the children while answering questions. He also talked about how he \"met\" the Flash and Wonder Woman, and mentioned that he didn’t have a gang of villains, also talking about Eagly and was humiliated by a student. Smith received a question from Adiva, which was about his origin story, something that left him cold, and he remembered when he accidentally killed Keith, mentioning that it was a story not to be told.\n\nSmith was surprised to learn that his former lover, Becky Coolidge, had a daughter, that could be his, but the teacher interrupted to get Smith to say goodbye, and he showed his muscles as his pose. After leaving, Smith met with Jamil, who thanked him for coming and he was happy to help, learning that they were already friends. Smith recalled when he left the Mount Rouge Health Center as he mentioned to Jamil that he never promised to do much for him, but agreed that he would help him in what he needed, and then they withdrew from school. Smith returned to his trailer, where he fed Eagly happiness, and fetched some Amber Fluid that he managed to take from the Glan Tai Bottling Company to give to \"Goff\". While feeding his pets, Smith began to eat breakfast for the day off.[8]\n\nSmith continued to eat breakfast until he received a visit from Adrian Chase, whom he recognized by the very annoying way he knocked on the door. He explained to Chase that he kept \"Goff\" as his captive, watching with surprise as \"Goff\" drew a peace symbol. To find out more, the duo questioned \"Goff\" with yes or no questions, and Smith was angry at Chase’s ridiculous questions and for not understanding the rules, which led to both of them discussing their problems, with Smith understanding that he had many problems while blaming himself and Chase trying to console him, but he quickly screamed at him with anger.\n\nSmith and Chase gave names of alien-related films to \"Goff\" to find out if it was coming in peace or with other intentions, although the interrogation stopped when Clemson Murn called Chase, and Smith picked up the phone to find out that Murn warned him that the Evergreen Police Department was coming for him with a warrant. After checking that the police were here, Smith ordered Chase to take \"Goff\" out of the trailer.\n\nSmith pulled Eagly through the roof to save time and then crossed him. Smith helped Chase up while he closed his roof window slowly. The duo hid in the trees and Eagly didn’t listen, so he had to whistle to call him, which made Sophie Song realize, and forbade Chase from killing her for being a cop. Smith asked Chase to take the Vigilante-Mobile, which he couldn’t do because he rode Uber thinking they’d have a day off. Smith saw Chase accidentally fall to the ground and was discovered with Song, who was killed by \"Goff\" while taking her as a guest.\n\nThe duo tried to stop \"Goff,\" but they failed and knew it was a bad sign, however, they had to get away from the police as they were shot by the cops and got angry when Chase killed some cops. The duo escaped without a hitch, thanks to Eagly’s shooting down some cops until they were surrounded by one and Smith froze to no avail, but Caspar Locke, an ally of Murn’s, appeared to save them, and they could not believe what was going on, though they kept running while Smith watched Locke kill innocent cops.\n\nSmith, Chase and Eagly fled in the car that Locke gave them to avoid the police. Smith tried to call Emilia Harcourt to inform her that they were fine, but Adrian Chase, not knowing they couldn’t trace the phone, took his phone out of him and threw it away, and Smith got angry because he had amazing photos of Eagly, and he didn’t know it was the cloud to store his phone information. Smith still couldn’t believe what happened to Caspar Locke and again argued with Chase about how Locke killed the cops, scaring Smith.\n\nAfter hearing that Chase criticized him for having a new belief in protecting lives, Smith angrily stopped the vehicle and asked Chase for his phone, even though they could be traced, but he didn’t care. Smith used the phone and knew that the password was from his birthday, although he was surprised to learn that Chase searched for images of Taylor Swift’s ass, Smith called Harcourt to inform her that they were all right and headed over to Henenlotter Video.[8]\n\nThe duo returned to Henenlotter Video and Clemson Murn asked Smith about a strange diary, but he denied. Smith revealed that he had \"Goff\" as a pet until he entered Sophie Song’s body and argued with the others about Song’s nationality, but Murn was upset because \"Goff\" was too dangerous. Upset, Smith argued with Murn over sending Locke to kill cops until John Economos interrupted to report that he had discovered where the Amber Fluid came from.\n\nThe entire team discovered that the fluid came from the Coverdale Ranch, where there was a cave in the underground, which surprised Smith, who demanded explanations, since he and Chase didn’t know what was going on. To his surprise, he also discovered by Leota Adebayo that the Butterflies had a giant Cow milking amber. Smith kept asking for answers and getting mad at everyone because he thought they were friends until Murn interrupted him to order them to prepare. However, Smith was still angry and saw Adebayo with hatred for not telling him anything.[8]\n\nIn Henenlotter Video, Smith was resting while he thought about his desire to stop killing, talking to Emilia Harcourt about his belief that he should stop killing people so he could be a good person, and Harcourt agreed, but they had to kill a lot of Butterflies at the Coverdale Ranch, and Smith decided to kill people for the last time. They both said goodbye by name and he learned that Harcourt was called Emilia. Left alone, Smith found a piano, with which he began playing it to the tune of Home Sweet Home. Smith vented all the laments and problems he had while still remembering Keith, as the song was always heard with him.\n\nSmith finished the song and Adrian Chase interrupted him to inform him about the fake diary, Smith accompanied him, where they watched on television how Caspar Locke and the Evergreen Police Department, possessed by Butterflies, framed Smith for the murder of Annie Sturphausen, Royland Goff, and the Massacre at Glan Tai Bottling Plant, becoming Smith in the most wanted person in Evergreen.[8]\n\nSmith went to the bathroom and vent for being framed, rememebring himself when he faced Keith Smith in a fight orchestrated by their father, killing Keith by accident and being framed by Auggie, and he kept crying while Chase tried to talk to him. After cleaning himself, he met with Chase to discuss Locke and they learned that he had been possessed by the Butterflies. Smith knew that Leota Adebayo put the fake diary in her trailer and got mad at her for trusting her wrong.\n\nThey discovered that Judomaster had escaped, but they didn't care, as Smith took their helmets to complete the mission, taking some weapons and explained to John Economos that the diary was fake because if it were real, the diary would look horrible. In order to escape and end the mission, Smith revealed that he would kill the Cow and invited them to go, Economos refused the invitation, until he finally accepted, and the group went to the van to kill the Cow.[1]\n\nFeeling betrayed by his companions, Smith decided to set out, find and eliminate the \"cow\" himself with Eagly, Chase and Economos accompanying him. During the trip, Smith and Chase had fun while singing In My Dreams, but Economos said it was not a time to have fun, and Smith explained that there was never a bad time to rock. They were quickly intercepted by the Aryan Empire that shot down the van, but they managed to survive. Smith couldn’t believe what was happening until Auggie in his White Dragon Suit attempted to kill him. The group dodged the lightning, but Auggie was going to kill him, until Chase decided to attack him to save his friends.\n\nSmith and Economos escaped with Eagly into a hole that Auggie had made, managing to get out, Smith watched as Chase sacrificed himself with a grenade to save them, but he could not save him and retired with Economos into the forest. As they ran, they did not understand how Auggie and the Aryan Empire found them until they realized their helmet had a tracker, so they used a rope to tie the helmet to put it on a raccoon’s tail, but Smith would end up getting scratched in progress, although they successfully evaded the Aryans.\n\nSmith was surprised that the plan worked and went with Economos and Eagly to keep running while Auggie and the Aryans were distracted. They found Chase passed out in a car and woke him up to escape all in the car, with Smith taking over the driving and stopping Eagly from pricking Economos. The group escaped and told Chase that they found them by the helmets, however he was upset to find out that Chase was carrying the helmets in the trunk, and Eagly got off, so Smith asked Economos to put him back in the car while he threw out the helmets.\n\nSmith threw the bag with the helmets far away and relaxed, but the Aryans found him, and he had to run away towards the car until he was attacked by the Aryans, and had to defend himself against them, managing to knock some down with Eagly’s help. After seeing Auggie punching Eagly and leaving him badly wounded, Smith turned to his father to kill him, though he used his blasters to throw it. Fallen, Smith couldn’t do anything and his father put his foot on top of him to humiliate him and talk about all the sins he’s done.\n\nWithout strength, Smith was about to be killed by his father until Chase and Economos came to save him. When Auggie’s armor ran out of strength, Smith rose up and took revenge on his father for everything he did to him. Smith started beating him up and blamed him for killing Keith, blaming him for training him to kill him, for the hatred he had for him, and he got very angry because his biggest mistake was always obeying him, but August mocked him for his punches, which upset Smith more.\n\nTo end his torture, Smith took a gun to threaten his father, who challenged him to kill him, and he continued to bitterly taunt and trash talk Chris, calling him a pussy for not having the guts, until finally Smith pulled the trigger and shot his father in the head, killing him once and for all. After this, Smith broke down to the ground crying, finally able to process his emotions, and being comforted by Chase.[1]\n\nThe team quickly reunited at Paws A Moment Veterinary Clinic where Eagly was taken to be treated for his injuries. After Doctor Cameron Hurwitz cured Eagly, Smith stayed to pray for Eagly, as he regretted that Auggie had taken care of him, acknowledging that he was a bad friend to him. Smith was thinking that he might have asked a woman to look after Eagly while he was at the Belle Reve and considered having sex with the woman, but it would be just once, and Smith kept crying for Eagly’s sake, remaking the same vow he’d made as a child. Smith then excitedly watched as Eagly woke up and shared a hug with him while Smith cried and took a photo.\n\nAfter Eagly recovered, the team elected Harcourt as their new leader after Clemson Murn died, Harcourt then briefed them on the Butterflies' objective to teleport the \"cow\" to another enclave which would render all their efforts up to that point moot, discussing how they would travel to the Coverdale Ranch and kill the Cow before it was teleported to another cave, and the team refused to let vets go because they would die. As the team left the clinic to head to the ranch, Adebayo attempted to apologize for the forged diary but Smith made it clear that he had no intention of forgiving or seeing her again after the mission was over.[1]\n\nDuring the trip, Smith tried to ignore Leota Adebayo, who was trying to apologize to her friend, however, he began making tongue-in-cheek sounds with Adrian Chase until they broke up, and claimed to Adebayo his betrayal as a friend, which caused the two to argue. Smith told her that his oath for peace only consisted of killing bad people would only die to honor Keith, and Adebayo tried to advise Smith not to let Keith’s murder define him. Upon arriving outside the Coverdale Ranch, Smith talked with John Economos about the revelation of Adebayo being the daughter of Amanda Waller.\n\nWhile the team was preparing their battle gear, Smith and Emilia Harcourt watched as the Butterflies guarded the barn, and Smith was called by Adebayo to learn about their helmets, which would help them in battle, explaining about the underwater hulls, urticaria, sonic boom, anti-gravity, and human torpedo, which was a prototype, and they considered using the sonic boom to blow up the barn along with the anti-gravity to lift the Cow. Smith rejected the idea of anti-gravity because it would require some things, but to his surprise, everyone saw the antigravity float, and Smith was upset with Adebayo for activating it.\n\nSmith talked about throwing the helmet into the barn, and with Economos, they mocked the rumors of Green Arrow and Aquaman. Smith thought of using Eagly to carry the sonic boom helmet and got help from Chase to guide the eagle. Smith and his friends watched Eagly fly the helmet into the barn, thrilling everyone, but they were disappointed to see him leave the helmet in the woods.\n\nThe team started a search to retrieve the helmet, where Smith found himself unexpectedly hallucinating Auggie, who began to mock him, enraging Smith, and began to seek his blowgun so as not to use his weapon, for it would draw the attention of his enemies. Upon firing, Smith mocked his father’s hallucination, thanking him for having returned, and killing him again, before being interrupted by Harcourt, and Smith saw with surprise as the helmet was in the same place that he threw the arrow.\n\nUnder Emilia Harcourt's orders, Smith went to the vicinity of the Coverdale Ranch and sought a knife to attack butterfly posessed Officer Johnson, using the knife to kill him by the ear, and took his uniform to wash it, as people left excrement in their pants. In the night, Smith met with the team to give John Economos the uniform so that he can infiltrate the barn and leave the sonic boom helmet, and denied Vigilante the costume because Eek Stack Ik Ik would recognize him.\n\nSmith explained to Economos why he wiped the pants off about his knowledge of excrement in the pants and finally convinced Economos to infiltrate. During the infiltration, Smith saw Economos evade Larry Fitzgibbon and Smith began to relish Economos' vomit. Smith and the others learned that the Cow was a kind of larva and heard Economos talking sorbs because he painted his beard, making Smith feel bad because he mocked him. When Economos was discovered, Smith was upset with Leota Adebayo for losing the radio, and saw how the barn exploded thanks to Adebayo finding the radio, saving Economos as Smith prepared to attack.[14]\n\nAs they prepared, Smith took his pistol and his shield for the fight, and told Adrian Chase they were going kill the Cow. Along with Emilia Harcourt and Chase, Smith went with his friends to the battlefield bravely, calling the attention of the Butterflies, and the trio began shooting, killing several of them.\n\nBy losing his bullets, Smith used shield to ram the aliens and kill several of them along with his weapon, and Smith was warned by Harcourt, using his shield to kill a Butterfly who tried to kill him. With his skills, Smith threw his shield, and shot him to finish off an enemy. Smith saw Eek Stack Ik Ik go underground to see the Cow, so he killed several Butterflies to get to her, and stop the Cow, but Smith would fall down the stairs, and get trapped in the rubble.\n\nInside the cave, Smith was rescued by Eek Stack Ik Ik, and went into a fight with her, where Smith managed to give him a few blows, and Ik Ik managed to dodge them, demonstrating his speed, and cornered Smith between the wall. Smith saw surprised how Leota Adebayo arrived with the human torpedo helmet, and tried to warn her, although Adebayo accidentally crashed into a wall due to her inexperience. Smith was then released by Ik Ik, who asked him to accompany him, and he saw Adebayo passed out.[14]\n\nPeacemaker went with Eek Stack Ik Ik, and saw the Cow in its true form. When Ik Ik asked for help, Smith refused to transport the Cow, but Ik Ik told him he would tell him the truth, just as he did with Judomaster, but Smith continued to refuse because Clemson Murn told them they wanted the conquest. To his surprise, Smith learned that the Butterflies only wanted to protect humans so they wouldn’t suffer the same fate as their planet so they could live in peace, which made Smith remember his oath.\n\nAs he remembered, Smith recalled his traumas, and began to reflect on the actions that he had taken. Smith figured out that the symbol of peace in Ik Ik meant that, as she considered him a good friend, but despite Ik Ik’s request to become the savior of the earth by being a peacemaker, Smith refused for the sake of his friends, activating the human torpedo and causing Leota Adebayo to fly the helmet towards the Cow, killing it, and shooting Ik Ik, Smith went to pick up Adebayo and leave while watching Ik Ik fly away.\n\nAfter returning to the surface, Smith and Adebayo saw Adrian Chase and John Economos, with Emilia Harcourt, who was passed out by a gunshot. Smith carefully picked up Harcourt, and reunited with his friends to leave, before the Justice League arrived late to help, and Peacemaker was upset with them, mocking Aquaman for his rumor about having sex with fish, Smith and the 11th Street Kids then withdrew from Coverdale Ranch.[14]\n\nSmith, Adebayo and Chase rushed Emilia Harcourt and John Economos to the Mount Rouge Health Center. Smith asked Chase to go check on him because he was shot, but Chase told him it wasn’t necessary since he was fine, and they watched as Chase collapsed to the ground, causing him to be taken to the emergency room. While waiting for recovery, Smith and Adebayo stayed in the waiting room to relax, Smith asked her if she heard what Eek Stack Ik Ik said, which Adebayo confirmed hearing, wondering why he didn't join them by having a similar vow.\n\nSmith replied that he didn't want her or the rest be damaged, as Adebayo had faith that Smith was a hero by giving them the opportunity to choose without the help of the Butterflies. Smith and Adebayo apologized to each other for the betrayal. Trying to make up for what she did, Adebayo got up from her chair to leave, when Smith asked her where she was going, she replied that she was going to do the right things. Before she left, Smith spoke to her, saying that after Eagly, she was his best friend, filled with emotion to Adebayo, who said goodbye to her friend.\n\nA few days later, Smith was at the hospital waiting for Emilia Harcourt to recover and watched on the news as Leota Adebayo revealed the truth about \"Project Butterfly\" and Amanda Waller's role in assembling Task Force X to the public, clearing Smith's name in the process. Smith was proud of Adebayo, who publicly reported on the mission and how Smith and the 11th Street Kids were heroes, before being called by Alandy to see Harcourt, and Smith confirmed to Harcourt that he had been waiting for her, making her cry, and they held hands.[14]\n\nLater, Peacemaker would go back to wearing his crime-fighting suit and meet with Vigilante once again to have fun together. In the woods, Smith and Chase used the grenade with a Russian shell to blow up a car while fleeing, avoiding the explosion, and the two friends watched madly as the car exploded while they had a good time.\n\nSmith returned home to his trailer, accompanied by Eagly and Eek Stack Ik Ik, who no longer had any ill will towards him, Smith was awakened by Eek Stack Ik Ik for amber fluid, and decided to go out to feed her, and saw Eagly fly off to fetch his food. After feeding the butterfly, Smith sat down next to her for a beer, but hallucinated his father again, something that disturbed Smith, however, after seeing Eagly bring a death possum, Chris continued to drink in confusion, as he realized his mental health problems.[14]\n\nChristopher Smith is a man who believes in peace at any cost, no matter how many people he has to kill along the way,[15] He is more than willing to fight, kill, and even start a war, but in the end, every action he takes is in the name of ultimately keeping the peace.[16] While Smith is obsessed with gaining everlasting peace and liberty, his actions are violent and he loves death and destruction, stating that there is \"nothing like a bloodbath to start the day.\" He is willing to do anything to get peace and end all fighting, no matter how many people he needs to kill, hurt, maim, or emotionally destroy along the way, making him very hypocritical. However, he is not beyond giving people he appreciates a warning before he attacks. He is also willing to humiliate himself for his cause, blindly follows orders, and condemned Bloodsport for killing for money. His willingness to do whatever it takes makes him the perfect soldier, as well as the only member of the Suicide Squad who knew the truth behind the mission of Corto Maltese.\n\nHe is self-righteous, egotistical, arrogant and overconfident, as seen with his rivalry with Bloodsport, and has no shame in showing off what he is capable of. Due to his ego and hypocrisy, the other members of the Suicide Squad tend to greatly dislike him and not take him seriously, not that he cares, as he views himself as better than them, claiming to do exactly what Bloodsport does, \"but better.\" Ratcatcher 2 and King Shark were the only two members of the Suicide Squad who tried to reach out to him, and while he was initially on good terms with the former, he regretfully attempted to kill her so he could prevent the secrets of Project Starfish from being reached to the public, causing her to see a different side of him and was greatly afraid of him. He was also annoyed by King Shark's childlike and dim-witted nature; he often meanly rejected his gestures of friendship despite a few instances of passing encouragement. Smith also dislikes millennials such as Ratcatcher 2. He is not above showing genuine respect to those who deserve it, such as Colonel Rick Flag, considering him a hero of the nation, which is why he almost begs him to hand him the drive with the records of Proyect Starfish so he wouldn't have to take his life to complete his mission, but ultimately kills him after engaging into a fight.\n\nFollowing his release from the hospital, Smith began to reflect on his actions; he notably regrets killing Flag and putting on the façade of a rude, arrogant, misogynistic person in order to push people away to protect his own feelings and reduce the risk, and begins to question the morality of his father's teachings. He is also heavily driven by his desire to gain his father's approval, despite being well aware and even being blatantly told on occasion that his father does not care about him and sees him as pathetic and weak. He even admitted that John Economos could be a potential friend, if he did not constantly tease him. Despite his claims that he is willing to kill children in the name of peace, he was unable to bring himself to kill Senator Goff's children, though he claimed to Murn that he was unable to kill them due to not having been given the reason to kill them. He also was shown to be uncomfortable and horrified when Vigilante killed them with the sniper rifle. Peacemaker later admitted to Harcourt that he doesn’t think he wants to kill people anymore, showing that he has grown from his previous ideology, though he did admit he still had no issue killing aliens.\n\nPeacemaker is jealous of other superheroes that are more popular than him, mainly the Justice League. He routinely makes wild claims and exaggerated stories about other superheroes in vain attempts to discredit them based on blatantly fake rumors he finds on social media or his own made up stories. Smith feels personally offended whenever his credentials as a superhero are brought into question or when he's reminded that he's a lower tiered unpopular superhero, he also tends to cling on to any proof he can have to validate his superhero status, such as framing a news article reporting his battle with Kite-Man or going to a school Show-n-Tell at Jamill's request to show off in front of kids. Peacemaker would have a moment of self-validation when the Justice League arrived too late at Coverdale Ranch and he scolded them for being useless.\n\nChristopher was also very close to his older brother Keith during their youth, he developed his fondness for music during his childhood while hanging out with Keith. Chris' accidental killing of Keith severely traumatized him, and was a major contributor to his warped view on morality and lack of self-esteem. Chris shows signs of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, frequently flashbacking to Keith's death and struggling to keep a composure whenever the flashbacks happen, his murdering of Rick Flag would later trigger similar flashbacks as well, then after killing his own father Chris began hallucinating him. In his adulthood, Smith retains his fondness of music, he often resorts to listening music as a means of calming himself and when reflecting about himself.\n\nBehind all the egotistical, duty driven and self-righteous demeanor, Smith is a broken, self-loathing man trying to find a purpose in the world, but is too haunted by the horrible actions he committed to adjust in a normal environment. Smith's time with the 11th Street Kids allowed him to slowly come to terms with his past demons and reconsider his world views, showing his vulnerable side more often to others and learning to process his repressed emotions, but also becoming more emotionally unstable and prone to bursts of anger. When White Dragon attempted to kill Peacemaker, Chris finally snapped and lashed out at his father for all years of abuse and horrible treatment and ultimately he chose to kill his own father, when he did Chris broke down crying and fully acknowledged all his terrible actions in the past.",
