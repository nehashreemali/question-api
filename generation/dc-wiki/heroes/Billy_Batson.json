  "content": "William Joseph \"Billy\" Batson, also known as the superhero Shazam,[1] is a superhero and orphan chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam to be his final champion when he was 14 years old, granting him immense magical power from six legendary sources to help protect the entire world from the forces of evil. With the guidance of his foster brother and newfound best friend Freddy Freeman, he would use these incredible powers to become a superhero in Philadelphia, defeat rejected champion candidate and his nemesis Thaddeus Sivana in battle, and bond with his new foster family, eventually sharing his powers with them to become a superhero team to defend the innocent and protect their home from those who would threaten it.\n\nBeing the leader of the Shazam Family, Billy and his siblings saved Philadelphia several times over the intervening years, but without being largely recognized as superheroes, making Billy feel insecure for his bad leadership and his siblings having their personal lives, worrying about ending up abandoned again. After receiving a warning from Shazam, Billy and his siblings came into conflict with the Titan known as Hespera and her sisters Kalypso and Anthea, who kidnapped Freddy Freeman, and tried to use the Staff of the Gods to steal his powers until the Goddesses got hold of the Golden Apple, with which manifested the Tree of Life. Anthea defied her older sisters and allied with Billy and his family, becoming romantically involved with Freddy as they strove to defeat Hespera and Kalypso and thwart their plans.\n\nUsing the staff, Billy finally confronted Kalypso and her dragon Ladon after Hespera's death by Kalypso's hands, whom he defeated, but at the cost of his life, though he would be resurrected by Wonder Woman and reconcile with his family. Later, Billy and his siblings finally gained respect as heroes.\n\nBilly was born to C.C. and Marilyn Batson in October 2004. He was born when his mother was seventeen and married the child's father soon after. It was a rocky and brief marriage; C.C. ended up in jail and Marilyn was cut off by her family. She struggled to raise Billy as a single mother in Philadelphia, though she tried to give him all she could.[2]\n\nBilly was separated from his mother at the Philadelphia Winter Carnival. Billy was found by the police and Marilyn decided the foster system could take better care of him than she ever could. She started using her maiden name again and started a new life, never mentioning that she had a son.\n\nBilly was raised by the foster systems in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and quickly gained a reputation as a problem child. He ran away, always searching for his real family, and never emotionally attached to any family. His search brought him in problems with the police. He kept searching, looking up all women named Batson in the right age range. It never occurred to him that no one ever came looking for him.\n\nWhen Billy was 9, he was running in a parking lot when he was hit by a car, sending him flying into the air before hitting the ground. The accident left him with a broken arm and several months of nightmares, with the accident permanently being affixed to his memory.[3]\n\nSeveral years later in 2018, Billy set up a break-in at a pawn shop in order to get the police to arrive. After acting innocent and telling the police, the perpetrators went through the back of the building. The police search the premises and came to find that there was no one there. Once inside, Billy quickly dropped the act and revealed that he set up the whole situation, and then closed the gate to the door, locking the police in.\n\nHe then quickly acted innocent again to get into the police car and gain access to the police's computer system. In Billy's notebook, it is shown he's been looking up several different women with the last name \"Batson\", in hopes of finding his mother. After finding the address to a Batson, he quickly jots down her address and steals the police officer's lunch, after the police begged him not to take it away. Billy made his way to the woman's house, but to his disappointment, he found she is not his mother and is then caught by the same police officer that he fooled earlier.[2][3]\n\nAfter being taken to the foster system again, E. B. Glover informs Billy that his latest foster family doesn't want him back after he disappeared two weeks ago, prior to his incident with the police. Billy states that he has run away from every home within six counties and that he knows his biological mother is out there, and that what he has to do to find her.  E.B. tells him that he shouldn't try to find someone who doesn't want to find him.\n\nShe informs him of a couple outside that is eager to take him in, but Billy quickly rejects them, stating he can take care of himself. E.B. reminds him he has to wait till he's 18 to legally be able to live on his own. She encourages him to give them a chance cause they are giving him one, having no other choice, Billy accepts and is taken in by the Vasquezs, who seem like a loving couple to him. He meets Victor and Rosa Vasquez, who reveal they were foster kids themselves and were stubborn like him. On the way to the Vasquez house, they tell him about how the other foster kids they have taken in are expecting him, and are excited to meet him.[2]\n\nArriving at his new home, the Vasquezs introduce Billy to his new siblings: The young but kind and accepting Darla Dudley, the eldest Mary Bromfield, the mostly silent Pedro Peña, the intelligent young Eugene Choi, and finally Freddy Freeman, a fan of the Justice League in particular Superman and superheroes in general. On the first day of school, Freddy is attacked and bullied by the Breyer siblings, Brett and Burke, until Billy comes to his foster brother's defense when one of them insults Freddy for not having a mother. Briefly getting the upper hand on them, Billy then flees, thanks to a distraction from Eugene and makes it to safety onto a subway.\n\nHowever, while on the subway, Billy was transported to a mysterious cave and is confronted by the wizard Shazam. The Wizard informed Billy that he is his last and only chance to find someone noble and good enough to replace him as champion. Billy is reluctant at first, but eventually is convinced by the Wizard to accept his offer. Saying the Wizard's name, Billy is transformed into an adult and receives Shazam's powers. After the Wizard gave him his powers, he disintegrated in front of him. He was then transported back to where he was.[2][4]\n\nNot knowing what to do, Billy decided to go to Freddie for help in figuring out what to do in this predicament. After convincing Freddy that he was indeed Billy, the two worked on figuring out Billy's powers where Billy learned he possessed the ability to generate electricity from his hands. When going to a convenience store to purchase alcohol, Billy and Freddy stumble upon a robbery where they discover that Billy has super strength and invulnerability to gunfire. Shortly after this discovery, Billy easily overpowers them and subdues them. Returning home, Billy and Freddy are discovered by Darla where, during his trying to explain to her the situation, Billy learned he could change back to his child self by saying the words \"Shazam\".\n\nOver the next few days, Billy and Freddy test more of the former's power while stopping small crimes across town. However, the power quickly began to go to Billy's head and he ended up abandoning Freddy after promising to show up at school in his adult form to help increase Freddy's popularity. Freddy located Billy, accused Billy of abusing as well as wasting his powers on juvenile activities, and angrily walked away.[2]\n\nBilly was then confronted by Thaddeus Sivana, a man who once attempted to gain the Wizard's powers as a child only to be denied who then absorbed the Seven Deadly Sins. Sivana, wanting to take the power of Billy still decides to do so by force when he punches Billy, who was shocked to have been pained. He punches back only for Sivana to lift him up in the air and drop him, but Billy awakened his power of flight close to impact with the ground, much to his relief.\n\nFreddy noticed Billy fighting in the background, confused with who the villain was. The battle dragged on inside a mall with Billy severely outmatched and still not fully understanding his powers. Sivana finally pinned Billy to the ground, once more asking for the wizard's power. But the latter decided to turn back into his teenage self again, which blinded Sivana with the bolt of lightning briefly, and blended in with the panicked crowd. Freddy was inside the mall looking for Billy and Sivana saw him, remembered his connection to him, and demanded to know where he went.[2][5]\n\nBilly went back to the Vasquez household, where he was confronted by Victor and Rosa. As Victor was furiously lecturing him for his recklessness and Rosa was treating his injuries, the other foster kids were listening idly. Mary saw the news about this new superhero and noticed how he was talking to Freddy and realized that Billy is that superhero. The kids went to Billy about this revelation and told him they knew about his search for his mom as Pedro found the notebook he threw away. Eugene said that he managed to actually locate his mother, who just so happened to live a few blocks down the street. Billy immediately rushed out with the written address and left the household, with Victor and Rosa chasing after him.\n\nWhen he reached the apartment number, he was scared and uncertain of himself. After he knocked on the door, he had finally met his mother, who initially didn't recognize him. He told her that she was his son that she lost. Upon hearing this, she admitted to Billy that she was not ready to take care of him due to his father being arrested, kicked out of her own home, and being a young mom at the time. She told him that when she lost him that day at the fair, she saw her son with the police officers and decide to leave Billy in their care, saying he could be raised better without her. Billy was extremely shocked and heartbroken upon this revelation and said that he needed to go back to his real family and left her mother with the prize she won for him all those years ago saying she'll need it.[2]\n\nBilly received a phone call from Freddy, which he answered and immediately apologized to him. He realized it was Sivana who managed to use Freddy to track down his foster family and take them hostage and promised to them go if he gave him what he wanted. Billy then went to the roof of the apartment complex where he ran and jumped out of it as he transformed into a superhero and flew back home.\n\nBilly arrived to see Sivana and his family there and decided to willingly abide to his demands. Sivana proceeded to create a spell on one of the doors that transported them to the Rock of Eternity in which the two left the Vasquez household. The two arrived at the site where the seven wizards held counsel as Sivana picked up the wizard Shazam's staff. He commanded Billy to hold the staff and say the wizard's name as the Seven Deadly Sins watched them. They were interrupted by Mary, Darla, Pedro, Eugene, and Freddy who used the still active portal and told them to let go of their brother.\n\nBilly managed to strike Sivana and reunited with his siblings and tried to find a way out of the Rock of Eternity. Upon realizing the door Sivana made no longer worked, they came across numerous other doors and tried opening those, only to discover they led to entirely different worlds and locations. Billy, trying to see if he can teleport them himself, ended up bringing them to a strip club in Philadelphia he and Freddy once went to. Billy transformed back and decided that he and his siblings should hide at the Christmas Village, but Sivana noted his location from the summoned lighting bolt. He arrived at the scene and called out Billy for being a coward for jeopardizing the lives of everyone at this event, and demanded he showed himself. Although his family warned against this, he replied that he needed to protect the ones most important to him and confronted Sivana as the champion.[2]\n\nUnfortunately, their fight was cut short as Sivana unleashed the Sins to round his siblings and used them as hostages to force Billy to surrender his powers. As Sivana recalled the Sins, Shazam remembered the wizard telling him to fill the thrones of their \"brothers and sisters\". Seizing the staff and repelling Sivana with it, Billy tells his siblings to take hold, and say his name, echoing the words of the Wizard. After saying \"Billy\", he told them to say \"Shazam\" instead. By saying \"Shazam\", a burst of lightning appeared.\n\nLike Billy, Freddy, Mary, Darla, Eugene and Pedro have all now gained the powers of Shazam. Seeing that Sivana is in disbelief, Billy breaks the staff, leaving Sivana unable to steal the Wizard's powers. While the others face off against six of the Sins, Sivana and Billy have their second fight, racing through the city to try and best one another. In a brief pause during their duel, Sivana began threatening Billy and claiming it would take more than a group of juveniles to save him. However, Billy playfully ignored him and taunted him for monologuing before lunging at him. They unleashed discharges of energy upon each other, but they were too evenly matched. Realizing this, Billy had a split-second to contemplate his next move, but it was all his adversary needed to seize him in a chokehold and rocket into the air with him. However, this move would not work a second time: unintimidated, Billy grabbed his face and the two struggled. Ultimately unable to best Sivana in close combat, he was thrown onto a roof.\n\nBilly takes note that his foster siblings are only facing six of the sins, and mentions the last remaining Sin possessing Sivana's body, the only one still giving him any power: Envy. Insulting Envy, the Sin emerges from Sivana's body, leaving Sivana completely mortal and holding on for dear life on the edge of the building. Envy attacks Billy, but Billy uses the word \"Shazam\" to vaporize Envy into mist, before saying the word again to quickly save a falling Sivana. Billy brings Sivana back to the carnival, and precedes to pull out the Eye of Sin, sucking back in all of the Sins. The Eye then seemingly began tempting Billy with his deepest desire but he reveals he was merely teasing his siblings, having the common sense not to put a demon ball in his eye. Around them, the crowd cheers, and soon after, Billy and the others return to the Rock of Eternity to return the Eye and the Sins. Freddy points out to Billy that they now have a superhero lair.[2]\n\nAfter their fight with Sivana and the Sins, Billy finally felt like he has found a home, with the Vasquez' and his foster siblings, calling all hands on deck over dinner. Later, he and his brothers returned to the Rock. Billy put the Eye back and re-imprisoned the Sins. Freddy was thrilled they had found a place of their own. They proceeded to sit down on six of the thrones before noticing there was an empty seventh throne.[6]\n\nThe next day, Billy came to the school cafeteria as the superhero while Mary, Eugene, Pedro and Darla changed their lunch schedules to eat with Freddy and Billy. As the superhero, he impressed the other school kids, telling them that Freddy taught him everything he knows. He also told Freddy he invited a friend. Looking over, Freddy saw Superman standing right next to him, and is shocked that the Man of Steel is actually there.[2]\n\nWhile listening to a police scanner in class, Billy and Freddy heard of a police blockade in response to a museum heist. The pair texted Darla, Eugene, Pedro, and Mary to meet at the lockers, where they transformed into their superhero alter-egos and headed for the museum. They arrived and quickly intervened. Billy shielded the police from the spray of a minigun while his brothers stopped the other thugs. The robbers were detained and the art was returned.[7]\n\nLater, Billy visits pediatrician Dario Bava for therapy, asking him for advice to be a better leader. When Batson began to talk about his problems by not considering himself worthy of his powers, Bava made Batson notice that he was a pediatrician, showing him his salon, however Batson commented that they had recommended the place and asked for help again. Bava then stated that he believed Batson had imposter syndrome, stemming from childhood trauma, and asked about his childhood, Batson then mentioned abandonment by his parents and receiving powers from a wizard who died in front of him. Billy then went home and plays video games with Eugene.[9]\n\nDuring the Destruction of the Ben Franklin Bridge, the Billy and the Shazam Family quickly attend to the place and save the people who were crossing the bridge, using their speed to take them to a safe. Once all the civilians are saved, the Shazam Family reunites to try to prevent the bridge from collapsing, failing in the attempt. Later, Billy summons his brothers to the Rock of Eternity to review their performance in saving the people on the bridge, however he is frustrated when they don't pay attention and decide to retreat. Mary tries to reason with him about the activities they had to carry out and that they could not always be operating.[9]\n\nBilly eventually dreams of a date with Wonder Woman, but is interrupted in his dream by the wizard Shazam, who warns him about the arrival of the daughters of Atlas. So Billy searches the internet for them and calls a meeting with his siblings. While Freddy Freeman was having lunch with \"Anne\", Billy then interrupts Freddy while he was having lunch with Anne, to ask him to be in the meeting, explaining his dream, but Freddy refuses to attend the meet. During the meeting, Batson explains his dream and his searches. Pedro introduces his siblings to the Library of the Eternity and Steve the Pen to investigate the daughters of Atlas but they end up finding out about the theft of the magic staff by the daughters.[9]\n\nWith the dome lowered and having decided to sacrifice himself to save Philadelphia, Billy says goodbye to Freddy and his family saying that he must sacrifice himself to stop Kalypso. The hero confronts Kalypso and Ladon, shooting lightning bolts around the dome, charging the magical staff with energy and flying at Ladon, but the dragon throws the staff to the ground. Billy soon strikes Ladon, retrieving the staff and embedding it in Ladon's chest, causing an explosion inside the dome that kills Kalypso, Ladon, and himself.[9]\n\nAfter knowing of Billy's sacrifice to save Philadelphia, Wonder Woman would decide to travel to Mount Olympus to restore the power of the magical staff and bring him back to life. The next day, the Shazam Family were soon surprised by the presence of the heroine, who approached to take the staff and invoke lightning over it, restoring its power and bringing Billy back to life, who came out of his burial, also restoring the powers of Anthea and the fauna of the place. Seeing Wonder Woman, Batson briefly spoke to her, trying to ask her out of it, something she refused as she withdrew. Batson then used the staff to restore his family's powers.[9]\n\nHaving Billy Batson alive again, Amanda Waller began to take an interest in him for which she began to investigate him, considering him to join the Justice Society as he was too powerful, sending Emilia Harcourt and John Economos to Philadelphia to try to recruit him in the team.[9]\n\nDuring the family dinner, the Billy and his family were visited by the wizard Shazam who comes looking for the magic staff, surprising everyone with his new appearance. When Billy asks for his superhero alias, he replies that Billy's alias was Shazam.[9]\n\nInitially, Billy seems to be a cynical troublemaking boy who doesn't respect authority and prefers to be on his own and advising Mary Bromfield to not worry about everybody else and \"always look out for number one,\" even firmly believing that families are \"for people who can't take care of themselves\"; it is soon shown, however, that Billy's behavior is the result of him being separated from his mother at a very young age and he's spent years trying to reunite with her. Having grown as an orphan, Billy is dismissive of the idea of families, as he ran from multiple foster homes before and when he was adopted by the Vasquezes he had no interest in socializing with any of his foster siblings and didn't consider himself to be part of the family, as he'd rather go back to his real mother. Billy can be reserved and quiet, not interacting with others at school and rejecting any friendship attempts from the Vasquezes. Billy has a rather low opinion of himself, as when the wizard Shazam chose him as his successor and described him as a \"pure soul\", Billy disagreed and stated that he was not a good person and even believed that truly pure people didn't exist. Despite his flaws, Billy is an inherently good person, as he was willing to step up for his foster brother, Freddy when the latter was being picked on by bullies, an act that convinced the Wizard that he was the right person to inherit his powers.\n\nUpon obtaining the powers of Shazam, Billy was initially overwhelmed but promptly went to Freddy for advice. Freddy and Billy quickly became best friends over Billy's newfound powers as the two used it for their own entertainment. In his champion form, Billy is more optimistic and willing to have fun. Initially, Billy was rather irresponsible with his powers, using them for his own amusement not paying any attention to the consequences of his reckless behavior and not considering Freddy's own opinion of the superhero. It isn't until Thaddeus Sivana attempted to kill Billy and steal his power that Billy understood that superpowers aren't simple power fantasies and can be dangerous for himself and the others around himself, after which he starts being more responsible with his powers.\n\nBilly sees some of his own flaws reflected in Thaddeus Sivana, mainly in that both of them were disillusioned by the idea of families and spent their lives obsessively trying to find something believing that it'd fix all of their problems. Billy somewhat empathized with Sivana over their similarities and chose not to let the doctor die and instead depowered him.\n\nWhen Billy is finally reunited with his mother, he learned that she had willingly abandoned him due to him being a teenage pregnancy child. Following this brief reunion, he realized that his obsession to find his mother had made him selfish and that he was hurting those around him by neglecting them. When Sivana held his foster siblings hostage, who had figured out he was \"Captain Sparklefingers\", Billy was willing to give up his powers to protect them. Billy apologized to Freddy over his previous bad behavior and grew to appreciate the rest of the Vasquez family so much that he gave all of them powers so they could help him defeat Sivana and the Deadly Sins.\n\nFollowing Sivana's defeat, Billy and his foster siblings resolved to continue being active superheroes and protectors of the Rock of Eternity. As the champion, he later publicly admitted that he never could have become the superhero that he is without Freddy's mentoring. Billy also went out of his way to get Superman to visit his school in order to fix Freddy's reputation.",
