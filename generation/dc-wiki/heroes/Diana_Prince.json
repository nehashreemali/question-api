  "content": "Diana of Themyscira, also known as Diana Prince, is an Amazon warrior princess and one of the world's first superheroes, known as Wonder Woman. She is the daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Zeus, the king of the Old Gods, as well as a member and co-founder of the Justice League.\n\nBorn on Themyscira, Diana was raised in a land of paradise, hearing tales of the Amazons’ great task of defeating the corrupt God of War, Ares, ushering in a new era of peace to the world. Upon coming of age, Diana began pursuing the life of a warrior, despite her mother's objections. Determined to serve, she ultimately enticed her aunt Antiope to train her in secret. This, however, was soon discovered by her mother. Begrudgingly, the queen accepted Diana as a warrior, and ordered Antiope to train her better than any other Amazon.\n\nFollowing a training session, Diana happened to come across Captain Steve Trevor during his daring escape from the Imperial German Army in the ongoing Great War. A battle soon followed, as the Germans tracked Trevor to Themyscira, where they invaded in pursuit of Doctor Poison's notes. The loss of Antiope and subsequent realization of mankind's downfall during the absence of the Amazons convinced Diana to join the war effort, recognizing Ares as the instigator of the conflict. In the following days, Diana soon uncovered Ares, who exposed her to be the God Killer, having been originally conceived to be the ultimate weapon against her brother. Following this revelation, a fierce battle ensued, where Diana fulfilled her purpose in freeing mankind from Ares' influence. The loss of Steve in World War I and the loss of her other friends Etta Candy and the Wonder Men sometime after 1918 had left Diana broken-hearted & isolated but she vowed to protect humanity whenever she was needed due to her very compassionate nature over the years in the shadows as a mysterious female savior which people are curious about on who she is. She also gained more knowledge on the world and she changed residence over the years to keep herself guarded while landing jobs at museums like the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1984, she came into conflict with entrepreneur Maxwell Lord and former friend Barbara Minerva all while reuniting with Steve Trevor to prevent a possible nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union after Max used the Dreamstone for his own means which caused global chaos and instability in the process, reluctantly defeating and depowering Minerva. She successfully did so after she convinced Max and the people of the world to renounce their wishes to undo the chaos that was created, including her own in the briefly resurrected Steve.\n\nIn modern times, Diana operates as the curator of the Louvre Museum as by the alias Diana Prince. Two years following the Black Zero Event, Diana came into conflict with billionaire supergenius Lex Luthor, who discovered a photograph of Diana and the Wonder Men during his search for metahumans. During her pursuit of Luthor, Diana crossed paths with Bruce Wayne, who discovered her secret after their confrontation during his search for the White Portuguese. Later, along with the photograph on Luthor's files Bruce sent her, Diana discovered the evidence of metahumans in the world. With her mission fulfilled, Diana prepared to depart back to London, but the emergence of the monstrous Doomsday led Diana to ally herself with Superman and Batman to take down the monster in a fierce battle that ended with the tragic death of Superman. Afterwards, in the wake of Clark's funeral, Diana and Bruce decided to create a team to battle any future threats to the world.\n\nAs the world mourned for the Man of Steel, Diana combated the rise of radicals who saw Superman's death as an omen and capitalized on the world's vulnerability. Shortly after the team assembled, Wonder Woman assisted in helping a newly resurrected Superman regain his memories. With the team now fully assembled, Wonder Woman contributed to the successful offensive against Steppenwolf, forcing the alien invasion into retreat and personally slaying the fearsome New God by decapitating him. Afterwards, she began to plan for the Justice League's future alongside Bruce Wayne.\n\nIn early 2021, she along with the Justice League would be gathered by Amanda Waller to get involved on the \"Project Butterfly\" operation and the 11th Street Kids, however, the League arrived in the immediate aftermath of the battle, with a frustrated Peacemaker reprimanding her and the rest of the team for their incompetence. Eventually, Diana was forced to stop an army of retrobots finding herself with the heroine known as Wonderous Serena in the process, as well with Serena Williams and an alternate version of herself, with whom she would join forces to detain the responsible of the invasion, Doctor Cyber.\n\nKnowing Billy Batson's sacrifice to save the world, Diana went to his tomb on Mount Olympus to restore the Staff of the Gods's power and revive him. Diana later aided Aquaman and Flash in stopping a terrorist attack by a group of ex-marines at the Wayne Foundation Science and Technology Conference. She would also later aid Batman and Flash in stopping Al Falcone and his crew after they robbed a hospital.\n\nDiana was born circa 3000 BC[2] on the newly created island of Themyscira, to Zeus, the King of the Old Gods, and Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons, mere months after the end of War of the Gods. Zeus intended for the child to one day grow strong enough to defeat Ares, the God of War. Fearful for her daughter's safety, Hippolyta lied to Diana about her true parentage, instead telling Diana that she'd sculpted her from clay and prayed to Zeus to bring her to life. Diana would believe this story for most of her life.[3]\n\nAs the only child on the island, Diana grew bored by her lessons. She began to take an active interest in the Amazons' combat training, despite her mother's stern refusal of it. She often ran off from her tutors to watch the Amazons train.[3][4]\n\nHer aunt Antiope, General of the Amazons, was aware of the true nature of Diana's background. Knowing that one day she would have to face Ares, and caring so deeply for her well-being, she began to train the young princess in secret.[3]\n\nSeven years after her training had begun, their deceit was discovered by Hippolyta. Angry at Antiope for defying her decision, Hippolyta sent Diana back to her room so that she could speak to her sister alone. Antiope reasoned with the Queen, reminding her that Ares was alive and would come for Diana someday.\n\nHippolyta accepted this with some difficulty and ordered Antiope to train Diana harder than any Amazon before her, until she was better than even Antiope herself, the Amazons' fiercest warrior. Thus, with the blessing of her mother, Diana formally began extensive training in all forms of Amazon combat. Over the years, she became a formidable warrior.[3]\n\nEventually, Diana competed in multi-stage athletic competition against fully grown Amazonian competitors. After falling from her horse due to looking back at her opponents and taking a shortcut, she was disqualified, which she was forced to account for when an unnamed contestant snatched her stave unexpectedly. As Hippolyta observed, Antiope lectured the little girl on the importance of truth and assured her there was no shame in losing to larger and more experienced competitors.[5]\n\nMuch later, during a training session observed by Hippolyta, Diana sparred against her fellow warriors, demonstrating her weapons expertise and defeating each of them swiftly. Her final opponent was Antiope herself. The two fought with all their might. Diana managed to disarm Antiope and looked toward her mother for approval. Antiope seized the opportunity to push Diana to the ground and pick up her sword, admonishing her for letting her guard down. As Antiope slashed at her and forced her backwards, Diana instinctively brought her arms together to block the attack. She clashed her arm gauntlets together, resulting in her unleashing a powerful shockwave that sent Antiope flying back and left all spectating Amazons there, including Diana herself, in complete shock.[3]\n\nA shocked Diana apologized to Antiope and abruptly left the training session. She wandered off to a cliff on the Themysciran seashore and examined her gauntlets in awe. As she stood there, she noticed an airplane burst through the forcefield surrounding Themyscira and crash in the nearby waters. Seeing even from a great distance away that someone was trapped inside the sinking aircraft, she leaped down the ocean and rescued the pilot, none other than a human soldier named Steve Trevor. She pulled him out of the water and onto the Themysciran shore. As he came to, she noted in disbelief that he was a man, as she had never seen one before. Though somewhat confused, Steve affirmed that he was, rhetorically asking whether or not he looked like one.\n\nShe asked him who he was, but before he could answer, the two noticed several boats coming through the island's forcefield. Steve noted that he was one of the good guys and the people on the boats—Germans—were bad guys. Having noticed the invading ships, the Amazons quickly gathered on the cliffs above the beach. Hippolyta ordered Trevor to move away from Diana, but forgot about him as the German soldiers began to come closer to shore. She took command of her army, ordering the archers to fire on the boats. Diana and Trevor took cover behind boulders on the beach.\n\nAs the soldiers landed on the shore and began to open fire, several archers leaped from the cliffs. Diana watched, horrified, as a bullet fired from one of the German soldiers hit an archer, killing her almost instantly. Amazon cavalry stormed the beach, engaging the soldiers and quickly overwhelming them. Though Trevor told her to stay back as he fought one of the German soldiers, Diana picked up a sword from a fallen Amazon and easily dispatched a soldier.\n\nAs the battle came to an end, a soldier aimed his gun at Diana while her back was turned. Unable to warn Diana in time, Antiope leaped in front of her, taking the bullet and saving her life. As she lay dying, Antiope urged Diana to use the God Killer and defeat Ares.\n\nHippolyta, in angry grief over her sister's death, attempted to kill Trevor for bringing the Germans to Themyscira. Diana stopped her in time, telling her that he had fought by her side. As the Amazons debated whether to kill him or not, Artemis argued that they needed to question him as to who the Germans were and why they'd come.\n\nTrevor was taken to be interrogated using the Lasso of Hestia. Though he tried to resist the lasso's power at first, unwilling to reveal military secrets, he nonetheless was powerless to withstand it and admitted that he was a spy. He told them that he'd been on a mission to observe General Ludendorff and Doctor Poison, that he'd stolen the latter's research notebook, and that his escape had brought himself and the Germans to Themyscira. He described the Great War, informing them that millions of people had died. Hearing this, Diana deduced that only Ares could be behind a war of that magnitude. She tried to persuade Hippolyta to send the Amazons back with him to face the god, but her mother refused, much to Diana's confusion.\n\nLater, as a healer tended to Diana's battle wounds, she noted with confusion that Diana's wounds had healed completely. Diana then visited Trevor in his cell, asking him about the outside world. Due to his words, Diana decided to sneak him off the island and confront Ares herself. She snuck into the island's tower and stole the God Killer, along with an Amazon shield, the Lasso of Hestia, and a special set of battle armor. She broke Trevor out of his cell and took him to the island's dock, where she was intercepted by her mother. To her surprise, Hippolyta allowed Diana to leave, gifting her Antiope's tiara. She then warned Diana to be careful, mournfully telling her that the world of men did not deserve her.\n\nShe and Trevor cast the boat off into the ocean, and Diana watched as her home vanished as they passed through the island's forcefield. As they sailed, Diana told Trevor about Ares and the Amazons' mission to kill him. They then lay down for the night and discussed the concept of marriage, which Diana found odd.[3]\n\nThe next day, Diana awoke to find that they had hitched a ride on a larger ship and arrived in London. She was less than pleased at the sight of the city, stating that it was hideous. As they walked through the streets of London, Diana insisted that Trevor take her to the war. She was dismayed to hear that he intended to deliver Doctor Poison's notebook to his superiors in the British War Council. Trevor promised that if he went with her to deliver the notebook, he would take her to the war. Though annoyed by the detour, Diana agreed. Trevor then realized that she was only wearing her battle armor and took her to a store to buy her some clothes. As they walked to the store, Diana was delighted to see a baby and ran toward it, with Trevor having to pull her away.\n\nAt the store, the two met up with Etta Candy, Trevor's secretary. Candy was overjoyed to see Trevor alive and well. She introduced herself to Diana and offered her hand to shake, but Diana, unaware of what the gesture meant, simply asked what a secretary was. Upon hearing Candy's answer, Diana noted that the job sounded similar to slavery.\n\nCandy helped Diana try on a great many outfits until she finally settled on one. Dissatisfied, thinking that she still looked too \"distracting,\" Trevor gave her a pair of spectacles to wear. After they had paid and left the store, Diana reluctantly allowed Candy to take her sword and shield back to Trevor's office while the two took Doctor Poison's notebook to the British War Council.\n\nAs they walked, Trevor noticed that they were being followed. He tried to lose them by taking a turn down a back alley, but instead walked straight into a German spy's gun. The man ordered Trevor to give the notebook back; he refused, instead headbutting the man. He told Diana to stay back at the man took aim and shot at them. Diana reached out her arm, blocking the bullet off her gauntlet and saving Trevor's life. Diana then fought the German spies single-handedly; her spectacles were crushed in the fight.\n\nAs one of the spies tried to make his escape, Candy blocked his exit, brandishing the God Killer. Diana used her lasso to trap the man and ask him where Ares was. Rather than reveal any information, the spy committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill.[3]\n\nDiana and Trevor arrived at the British War Council's meeting place. Trevor told her to stay behind while he retrieved one of his superiors from the war room. Curious, she followed him into the room, where dozens of men argued with each other while Sir Patrick Morgan struggled to be heard. The room fell silent as the men noticed Diana, as women were not allowed in the room; Trevor quickly escorted her out.\n\nAfter the meeting, Trevor's superior berated him for taking a woman into the war room. Morgan then introduced himself to Diana. She began to introduce herself as \"Diana, Princess of Themyscira,\" but Trevor cut her off to maintain her secret identity, calling her \"Diana Prince.\" Trevor then informed Morgan that he had managed to steal Doctor Poison's notebook.\n\nThe British War Council quickly gathered to discuss the notebook. Their codebreakers were unable to decipher the two different languages that it was written in, but Diana quickly identified them as Ottoman and Sumerian. She read the book out loud, informing the council that Doctor Poison had created a new form of mustard gas based on hydrogen instead of sulfur, which gas masks would be useless against.\n\nTrevor pitched a mission to destroy the facility where the gas was being created, but his superiors decided against it, stating that it was too late in the war to do something as drastic as that. When Trevor argued that more soldiers would die, his superiors simply stated that that was what soldiers did. With the battle of Themyscira and the death of her aunt so fresh in her mind, Diana was infuriated by the man's comments and berated him, calling him a coward and telling the rest of the council that they should be ashamed. Trevor escorted her out as she ranted, apologizing to the council on her behalf.\n\nOutside the room, Diana confronted Trevor for not standing up to the council. Trevor then told her that they were going anyway, without the council's approval. Diana, distrustful of him for lying, did not believe him; he resorted to using the Lasso of Hestia on himself, revealing in the process that he believed it was a terrible idea and that they were going to die.[3]\n\nSteve then took Diana to a local tavern to gather reinforcements in the form of his friends, a spy named Sameer and a sniper named Charlie. She was dismayed to see them, as she did not consider them capable fighters or even good men. Sameer was enamored by Diana upon seeing her, something she did not appreciate.\n\nDiana, Trevor, Sameer, and Charlie sat at a table together as Trevor proposed his plan to them. Sameer and Charlie were willing to join them, if they were paid for the job. Trevor, however, had no money. The two refused the job. Sameer told Diana that all the payment he needed was a photograph of her; Diana countered that he wouldn't need one, as she was going with them. He and Charlie were baffled by her response.\n\nAs they talked, a drunken man who Charlie had gotten into a fight with earlier walked up to him, pointing a gun at his head. Before he could pull the trigger, Diana grabbed the gun from his hand and shoved him away, hurling across the room.\n\nCandy then joined the group, with Morgan in tow. The group was initially nervous to see him, as their plan was going against the direct orders of the British War Council, but Morgan assured them that he was there to help. He told them that their actions were admirable and gave Trevor a large sum of money as payment for Sameer and Charlie's help.[3]\n\nThe next day, the group left for the train that would take them to the war front in Belgium. Diana tried ice cream for the first time at the train station, which she greatly enjoyed.\n\nIn Belgium, Trevor informed Diana that they were to meet with another friend of his, a smuggler known as Chief. She observed with distaste the company they were keeping, noting that they were liars, murderers, and smugglers.\n\nAs they left the train station, Diana began to notice a steady stream of wounded soldiers coming from battle. She was horrified by their injuries. The group took a ride on a small ship that Trevor had arranged for. They walked through the rest of the day, eventually arriving to Chief's camp at night. Chief introduced himself to Diana as Napi.\n\nThat night, as the others slept around Chief's fire, Diana mistook the cannon fire as for strange thunder. Charlie was awoken by a nightmare. Diana tried to comfort him, but he pushed her away in and left the camp. Chief then told Diana that Charlie was haunted by the people he had killed as a marksman.[3]\n\nThe following day, they go to No Man's Land where Diana sees that the people living in the villages were suffering as well. After this, she decides to go into No Man's Land, changing into her armor and blocking the bullets with her bracelets and her shield with the assist of the Wonder Men, led by Steve Trevor.\n\nShe fights off against a group of German soldiers in a warehouse meeting the rest of Steve Trevor's team fighting off more Germans that were invading the village. The citizens of that town see Diana as a hero. In honor of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor's team's bravery, a photograph was taken of her with Steve Trevor's team.\n\nShe then sees Steve on the phone with Sir Patrick Morgan, and suddenly decides that General Ludendorff is really Ares. Later on, Steve and Diana are seen dancing where they finally accept they have feelings for each other and they kiss, after which they proceed to spend the night together.[3]\n\nThe next day, they decided to infiltrate Ludendorff's gala to learn more about the weapon he and Doctor Poison are creating and how to stop it. To enter the gala, Diana stole a dress from a guest where she dances with. She is prepared to kill Ludendorff, but her attempt is intervened by Steve. She hears Ludendorff release some of the gas where it kills citizens from that town.\n\nFeeling devastated, Diana was distressed by this event blames Steve for interfering with her assassination attempt on Ludendorff thinking the people could have been saved with him already being dead and realizes that Ares has corrupted everyone.[3]\n\nReceiving a signal from Chief, she infiltrates Ludendorff's base. She and General Ludendorff fight each other where Diana ferociously and savagely killed him. Thinking that killing Ludendorff would solve the problem, she gets confused when she sees the German soldiers loading the weapons onto the planes thinking that humankind is corrupted and it doesn't deserve her help.[3]\n\nDiana sees Sir Patrick Morgan in the base, who reveals himself to be the true Ares, and tells her of his plan for a world without humanity by having them destroy each other. Ares proposes that Diana help him accomplish his vision of paradise, but Diana promptly refuses, not wanting to kill billions of innocents. Ares then reluctantly engages her in an epic battle while Steve and his comrades attempt to dismantle the plane harboring the mustard gas.\n\nDuring the fight, Steve approaches Diana who can't hear him speak due to an explosion temporarily rupturing her eardrums. Steve, after much talking, departs and leaves Diana with his watch before boarding the plane which is taking off with the mustard gas. Ares eventually restrains Diana, imploring her to surrender and realize the futility of their fight. Diana notices the plane in the sky as she's pinned to the ground and watches in horror as it explodes with Steve sacrificing himself to save billions of lives.\n\nEnraged, Diana breaks free and begins attacking the remaining German troops at the compound. Ares attempts to manipulate the distraught warrior by presenting her with Doctor Poison, saying she should kill her as she fittingly represents the worst of humanity and the evil it can possess as he predicted to Zeus and the other Old Gods.\n\nDiana lifts a tank ready to crush Doctor Poison with it, but hesitates when she thinks about the love and compassion that Steve brought to her life when she realizes that he professed his love for her before leaving to sacrifice himself. Dropping the tank, Diana spares Doctor Poison, telling Ares that he is wrong about humanity. She tells him that while humans are everything Ares says and can be capable of the worst crimes, she's learned that they are equally capable of so much more: unbridled love and compassion. Ares engages Diana in a final fight, but is defeated after she fully embraces her powers as the God Killer and blasts Ares with powerful divine lightning. The soldiers, free from Ares' corruption, stop their fighting, thereby finally ending the war.[3]\n\nReturning to London where the people are celebrating the end of the war, Diana notices a memorial with pictures of deceased soldiers who fought in the war with Steve being among them. Diana lovingly strokes Steve's picture before closing her eyes to take in the world being at peace once again.[3]\n\nDespite helping win the war, defeating Ares and still loving humanity, Diana is still left sobered, emotionally broken, psychologically scarred, and devastated over not having been able to save the Belgian village from Dr. Poison, as well as over her beloved Steve Trevor's self-sacrificing death however she was inspired by his selfless act & love that shows her that humanity is worth believing & protecting despite their flaws so she vows to continues that however as a mysterious female savior since not interested in the fame. Wonder Woman later fought in World War II.[6]\n\nAlthough her exploits in helping humanity remained largely unrecorded, the resulting legend of 'Wonder Woman' persisted. At some point, a comic was made by the company All Star Comix that based it upon her known likeness.[7]\n\nAfter the death of all the other members of the Wonder Men, Diana and Etta Candy left London to live in the United States of America.[6] Circa the 1950s, she and Etta traveled to New York City, where they took a photo together in front of the city skyline from out on the water.[5] Etta died sometime before 1984.[6]\n\nBy 1984, Diana had become a senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., specializing in the culture of ancient Mediterranean civilizations.[5] In the mix, she interfered at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History when a group of gunmen broke in to steal the famous Noble Diamond, thwarting them.[8] She would later prevent a mall robbery in Virginia on her way to work. Shortly afterward, she met and befriended a new co-worker, Barbara Ann Minerva who had just slipped on her way in, dropping and scattering all her papers, Diana assisted her in picking up the mess. She was an insecure woman who idolized and envied Diana for her beauty and confidence. In the mix, aspiring businessman Max Lord visited the Smithsonian in search of a mysterious Dreamstone which seemingly granted wishes upon contact with any user.\n\nBoth Diana and Barbara unknowingly used the stone to fulfill their own desires. Diana wished for Steve Trevor to return into her life, causing his soul to take over another man's body. When she attended a quarterly fundraising gala, Trevor found her.[5]\n\nTogether, Diana, Steve, and Barbara tried to investigate the Dreamstone's power further and discover that it was created by Dolos - the god of treachery and mischief. The stone granted a user their wish but exacted a toll, much like in \"The Monkey's Paw\", and the only way to reverse the exchange was by renouncing the wish or destroying the stone itself. Steve realized that his existence came at the cost of Diana's powers, while Barbara's cost was her warmth and goodness. Both Diana and Barbara were unwilling to renounce their wishes and give up what they were given, and attempted to find alternative solutions.\n\nDuring celebrations of Independence Day in Washington, D.C., Diana and Steve hijacked a tactical jet in the National Air and Space Museum and used it to fly to Egypt. She went on to chase Maxwell Lord, only to lose him in Cairo.\n\nMeanwhile, aspiring businessman Max Lord came to personify the stone through his own wish, and subsequently became a powerful and influential figure, while leaving chaos and destruction in his wake. Upon learning from the U.S. President of a satellite broadcast system that could transmit signals globally, he chose to use it to grant wishes to the entire world. This would make him nearly invincible as he stole the things people cherished most. Diana was betrayed by Barbara when she revealed she had used her wish to become Diana's equal and joined forces with Maxwell to keep him safe from Diana herself. Diana confronted Maxwell in the White House where she was defeated by Barbara, and unable to use her power to heal or stop the terrible things Maxwell wanted to accomplish. More determined than ever, Steve convinced Diana to let go of him and renounce her wish. The process was emotionally painful for Diana who vowed to Steve that she would never love again, though he hoped that wasn't true. As she walked away she renounced her wish and regained her strength in the process, allowing her to take to the skies once more.[5]\n\nReturning home, she proceeded to don the armor of the legendary Amazon warrior Asteria and travel to the broadcast station. There, she fought against Barbara, who had made a second wish to become an apex predator, transforming her into Cheetah, a self-describing hybrid. The fight between the pair was brutal and caused the destruction of the armor's wings. Diana attempted to convince Cheetah to renounce her wish but she refused, not caring about the consequences of her actions due to her morality and humanity have been stripped away. Diana ultimately defeated Cheetah by restraining her underwater, but took pity on her, knowing that she simply wanted to be strong, not malevolent. Arriving to confront Maxwell, Diana used her Lasso of Truth to communicate with the world through him, convincing everyone to renounce their wishes, with remarkable success. With the wishes renounced, the world was restored to its former imperfection. Maxwell reunited with his son and the conflict ended for Diana.[5]\n\nHaving saved the world from destruction, Diana had finally accepted the truth that Steve is gone, having refused to pay the price anymore by not bringing him back, and was now continuing protecting the world whenever it was needed. Although she had returned to her isolated existence, she was happily observing the people to know what they are capable these days. In this current climate, Diana had a chance encounter at a fair, where she met the man whose body Steve had previously inhabited.[5] She was shortly thereafter scheduled to give a second tour to Jazz, Teo, and Teo's friend after their tour the previous week.[8]\n\nAt some point before the 21st century, Diana replaces her destroyed sword with the Sword of Athena, slays more sinister \"beings from other worlds,\" & when not using the sword ,she continues performing heroic acts but remains incognito. Eventually she moves to France, and becomes a professional antiquities dealer, with the Louvre Museum employing her as the Curator for the Department of Antiquities.[9]\n\nAt an orphanage in Gotham, 'Wonder Woman' had a fan in at least one girl who believed that she was a superior hero to both Batman and Superman.[10]\n\nAfter examining the photo of Wonder Woman and the Wonder Men taken in 1918 Belgium, Lex Luthor uses facial recognition software to deduce that the great superheroic Amazon warrior is in fact still alive, under the alias of \"Diana Prince,\" working at the Louvre Museum, and he obtains footage of Diana in Paris, France, which has her exiting a taxi and entering a shop, in civilian clothing.[11]\n\nDiana eventually became aware that Lex Luthor had in his possession the photograph of her and the Wonder Men, the only picture of her together with her deceased beloved even if she accepted the truth that he is gone.\n\nHence, in an effort to finally reclaim it and Steve's memory, Diana flew from France to the United States, and managed to get invited to a charity function hosted by Lex Luthor at his villa, an event which is also attended by Gotham City billionaire Bruce Wayne and illustrious Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent. During his greeting speech, Lex made a reference to how Zeus cruelly punished the Titan Prometheus for enlightening humankind, much to the visible dismay of Diana. Shortly thereafter, she covertly stole a hacking device of Bruce Wayne's, who is likewise investigating Lex Luthor. She exited the party with Bruce pursuing her, but manages to make it to her car and drive off just in time for Bruce to see her depart.\n\nLater, Diana is seen in the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities (with ancient Greco-Roman exhibits), conversing with an elderly couple, when the curator comes up, and offers to show her something of interest. She politely excuses herself and follows him to the exhibit of the fake replica of Alexander the Great's sword, which the ancient conqueror of the Middle East had used to cut the Gordian knot.\n\nWhile Diana stood admiring the replica, Bruce Wayne appeared. He proceeds to angrily confront her by grabbing Diana's arm and asking her about the information device that she had stolen. Bruce claims to see right through her \"babe in the woods\" act, saying that while Diana doesn't know him, he's met \"a few women like [her].\" Diana, however, calmly smiles and retorts that Bruce has never met any women like her. She then proceeds to tell Bruce that she was unable to obtain anything from Bruce's device, due to Lex Luthor's data having military-grade encryption. Diana explains her intention to re-obtain her photograph from Luthor, stating that she only borrowed Bruce's device, and has already returned it to him shortly beforehand (placing it into the glove compartment of his car), before calmly excusing herself and leaving.[11]\n\nStill puzzled as to Diana's identity, Bruce discovers more about her amongst the data he stole from Lex Luthor. He sees a photograph of her alongside the Wonder Men, taken in Belgium in 1918 during the closing days of World War I & asking the mysterious female savior of where she’s been. He then makes contact with her via her laptop, sharing extra information that Luthor had on both her and other metahumans, such as the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg. Diana is visibly intrigued and shocked at this revelation, as Flash's lightning reminds her of that of Ares, Aquaman reminds her of depictions of Poseidon, while the Mother Box that created Cyborg reminds her of the one she briefly saw back on Themyscira. Diana needs to take some time to think this revelation over, does not answer Bruce's e-mail, and instead proceeds with her plans to depart Metropolis on a flight back to France, through Turkey.[11]\n\nWhen news broke of Doomsday's attack on Metropolis, Diana was boarding an airplane bound for Turkey. Seeing what was happening, Diana reflects on what Steve said to her before that the world needs her so she is forced unto the big stage, left the flight before takeoff and dons her Wonder Woman armor and weapons before heading for Gotham City to help Batman and Superman in their battle against this incredibly powerful monstrous opponent.\n\nAs Wonder Woman joins the Battle against Doomsday, she arrives just in time to save Batman from Doomsday's lethal thermal blast, deflecting the beams with her indestructible bracelets. She then jointly attacks Doomsday with Superman while Batman tries to expose the creature to kryptonite, allowing its destruction. She relentlessly battles the monster, and despite Doomsday being stronger, Wonder Woman held her own, parrying a tremendous punch with the Sword of Athena, and then slicing off Doomsday's right arm with it. Eventually, Batman baits the monster into coming closer to her, allowing Wonder Woman to hurl the noose of her unbreakable Lasso of Hestia around his torso.\n\nSuperman then promptly flew back, wielding the Kryptonite Spear, and managed to impale the monster's chest. The mortally wounded Doomsday bellowed in agony, releasing immense amounts of electricity from his body, which made Wonder Woman momentary lose her footing, loosening the lasso's hold and allowing the monster to mortally impale Superman.\n\nWhile a visibly shell-shocked and saddened Batman promptly retrieves Superman's lifeless body (enveloping him in his own cape), Wonder Woman takes the body from Batman, gently placing it on the ground before them. Lois proceeds to cradle and weep over her fallen beloved, as Wonder Woman and Batman stand next to her in respectful lamenting silence, with Wonder Woman empathically giving Lois a comforting glance, as she had been in the same position as Lois was with Steve before. Wonder Woman was astounded by Superman's selflessness, equaling that of Steve Trevor's own and was equally saddened at his death, due to now not having the chance to get to know Superman but inspired by him to come out of the shadows despite doing the good thing especially as a mysterious female savior while also understanding on what it means to be symbol despite not being one because she’s afraid of losing or hurting them since those important to her  .[11]\n\nDiana attends Clark's funeral in Smallville along with Bruce, with the latter paying for it as an anonymous donor. The two share a conversation about honoring Superman by bringing together the three other metahumans, in case a worse threat to the world should ever arise. Diana inquires why Bruce is proposing it. He replies that it is simply due to a feeling he has that things will imminently get worse (in reality, he was following the instructions given to him by the  time-traveler.)\nConsidering Bruce's offer, Diana meanwhile returns to her job as Curator for the Department of Antiquities[9] at the Louvre Museum. Bruce sends Diana a package, which contains the original, physical photograph of herself with the Wonder Men. She sends a thankful e-mail for bringing Steve back to her even if she accepted that he’s gone awhile ago. Diana then dons her Wonder Woman armor after hearing a disturbance in the distance of Paris by sailing off the roof of the museum at sunset in Paris to confront it.[3]\n\nIn London, a small group of reactionary terrorists took over the Old Bailey Courthouse, taking several hostages including a school field trip. Diana stormed the building and used the Lasso of Hestia to compel one of the terrorists to tell her their plans. He revealed that their leader had a bomb powerful enough to destroy several city blocks while the world media will watch. Diana took out the terrorists and neutralizes the bomb. The terrorist leader then tried to kill the hostages with a gun, but Diana protected the hostages by deflecting bullets with her bracelets, killing the leader.[2]\n\nAt the Louvre Museum, Diana watched a news report showing a signal fire burning at the Shrine of the Amazons and knew that it had been sent by her mother to warn of the impending invasion. Diana traveled to the shrine and discovered a painting of Darkseid's invasion of earth. Traveling to Gotham, she broke into Bruce's base of operations to find him tinkering with a new prototype troop carrier, the Flying Fox. It reminded her of someone she thinks of who would have loved to have flown it. Bruce tells her that he believes an invasion is imminent; she corrects him. It has already arrived.\n\nDiana fills Bruce in on Darkseid and the Mother Boxes and the story of his first invasion of the Earth. Knowing that they need to pull a team together, Bruce plans to go after Barry Allen.[2]\n\nUsing Bruce's equipment, Diana tries to track down Victor. Victor is aware of Bruce's interest in him; due to his connection to information and security systems, Victor hacks in the computers to send Diana a message. Diana and Victor meet face to face, and tries to convince him to join them. Victor refuses and flies off.[2]\n\nWhile Bruce came back to Gotham and brought Barry Allen with the airplane, Diana awaited for their arrival. Bruce asked if she found Cyborg, to which her answer is that she and Stone spoke and told them to give him time.\n\nDiana then introduced herself to Allen, as he mistakenly said the names wrong for his introduction. Just then, Allen pointed out the Bat Signal shining in the sky, meaning the Justice League should get going.\n\nThe Justice League receives intel from Commissioner James Gordon that the Parademons are traveling underground. Meanwhile, they go to find Steppenwolf interrogating the S.T.A.R. Labs employees about the final Mother Box.\n\nWonder Woman helps out by attacking the Parademons and taking Steppenwolf to a different part of the factory.\n\nWhen Steppenwolf commanded his Parademon soldiers to let him handle Wonder Woman alone, she spoke with the New God General, trying to tell him that he would overestimate himself, but Steppenwolf prepared to fight her with his own axe while saying it still has the blood of her Amazon sisters.\n\nBatman then jumped down into the Knightcrawler and saved Wonder Woman after a Parademon managed to briefly knock her out. The Knightcrawler got attacked by Steppenwolf, and Flash helped Wonder Woman get her sword so she can help Batman.\n\nFlash and Wonder Woman get attacked by Steppenwolf and the Parademons before Batman helps her by killing one of the Parademons. Cyborg then falls into the Knightcrawler and hacks it in his control, which he uses it against Steppenwolf. But the Knightcrawler fails when Steppenwolf caught the missile and threw it against the wall, which then causes the harbor to flood which allows Steppenwolf to escape.\n\nBefore Diana could get hit with the flooding water, Aquaman comes and saves the team by using his trident to hold back the water while the League escaped.[2]\n\nThe team returns to the Batcave, and discusses a new plan. Victor explains that the mother boxes are \"change machines\", and they can bring things back to life. Bruce states they should use the Mother Box to bring Superman back to life believing that they need Superman to restore hope in humanity. Diana and Arthur are hesitant about the idea, but Bruce forms a secret contingency plan. The team put Clark's body in the waters of the Kryptonian ship, using Allen's Speed Force energy to activate the Box, causing the resurrection of Superman.\n\nHe flies out of the Kryptonian ship and lands in Heroes Park where Aquaman, Cyborg, Flash and Wonder Woman meet him. They notice that something is wrong with him, to which Clark uses his x-ray vision to scan the League before Cyborg's armor's defense system launches a missile at him as it registers him as a threat. Superman attacks Cyborg with his heat vision as the rest of the Justice League try to subdue him, but he swiftly overpowers them.\n\nAs Diana, Victor and Arthur all try to simultaneously flank Superman (albeit unsuccessfully), Barry attempts to help using his speed, but Superman is able to see him and keeps up with the speedster. Despite Barry's best efforts, Superman is able to land a glancing blow, knocking him out before Batman arrives and gets Superman to stop. Wonder Woman tries to fight Superman again, yet she's knocked down. Before Superman could kill Batman, Lois Lane comes to stop him. Superman then flies away with Lois.\n\nThe Justice League uses Flying Fox to Pozharnov to stop Steppenwolf from being the Mother Boxes together, the team plan how there going to stop Steppenwolf, Batman tells the team that he going to take out the tower while the reason of the League will separate the Mother Boxes. Batman destroys the tower, but the controls on the Flying Fox also didn't reporting, which caused it to crash, but Bruce got in the Batmobile and used a siren to get the attention of the Parademons, this allows the rest to get to the Mother Boxes without any problems.\n\nDiana confronts Steppenwolf with Cyborg and Aquaman, ignoring the New God's taunts of how she wasn't at Themyscira to protect her sisters when Steppenwolf attacked it. As Flash charges up, Cyborg gest to the Mother Boxes, while Batman takes care of the Parademons. While Cyborg tries to separate the Mother Boxes, Diana and Arthur battle Steppenwolf. Steppenwolf finds out that Cyborg is trying to separate the Mother Boxes, which he grabs him before Wonder Woman saves him.\n\nDiana and Arthur try to keep Steppenwolf away from Cyborg by using the Lasso of Hestia to pull him down. Steppenwolf tries to taunt Diana about how the Amazons fell before Steppenwolf's might, including her mother, but Diana saw through his deception. He attacked them both before he knocks Arthur into a wall breaking the ceiling before Diana saves him. Before Steppenwolf could kill Cyborg, Superman comes and saves him, by easily overpowering the New God and breaking his axe. But even with Superman, the Boom Tube to Apokolips opens with Darkseid at the helm and his army standing by. Flash is severely injured from the Parademons and the Unity synchronizes, to the horror of all. But Flash uses his powers to reverse time and brings the charge to Cyborg, allowing him to link into the Unity and break it apart from the inside. Victor calls Superman for help with the Mother Boxes, allowing them to separate and destroy them. Steppenwolf is not down yet and tries to attack, but is stabbed by Arthur in the back and lifted before Superman punches him. Diana then jumps and slices Steppenwolf's head, the New God's body flying through the Boom Tube to Darkseid where he crushes his head. Diana is then seen with the rest of the Justice League facing Darkseid before the Boom Tube closes.[2]\n\nAfter the defeat of Steppenwolf, the League observed the beauty of the small town in Russia and later on, Diana helped Bruce Wayne move forward with plans to expand the League with more at the empty Wayne Manor as their base. Diana also captured art thieves at a museum who are lassoed and she was greeted by kids.[2] At a later point in time, at least one newspaper reported on Wonder Woman denying the rumor that she and Aquaman were supposedly dating.[12] Peacemaker once claimed to have been at a party that Wonder Woman was also attending and that she was attracted to him, despite also admitting to have never met her.[13]\n\nAt some point during her heroic career, Wonder Woman entered in conflict with the supervillain known as Doctor Cyber, causing her enemy decided to travel to another reality to make her plans without the intervention of Diana.[14]\n\nIn January 2021, Leota Adebayo informed her boss and mother Amanda Waller about the current crisis point with the Butterfly alien invasion. She suggested to Waller to call in the Justice League. Leota was promptly reminded that they had no time to wait for backup. Diana, along with Clark Kent, Arthur Curry and Barry Allen managed to make it to the site of Coverdale ranch just as Peacemaker and the rest of the 11th Street Kids were heading out of the site. Peacemaker hurled several insults at the League as they left.[15]\n\nEventually, Diana would be forced to intervene in a stadium which was being invaded by retrobots. Upon arriving, Wonder Woman would save a civilian who was about to be attacked using her lasso of truth, while she would see that a heroine helped her. In that, Wonder Woman and Wonderous Serena would introduce themselves to meet while continuing to defend the place, Wonderous would explain to Diana that the retrobots came from her universe.\n\nSerena explained that retrobots arrest anyone who they considered could commit a crime despite not doing so, so that Diana would see it as unfair. Meanwhile, Wonderous Serena would warn some civilians to leave the stadium due to the danger posed by the retrobots. Seeing more retrobots arriving from a portal, Diana proposed to help Serena return to her universe to stop the invasion. Both would try to run to the portal, however a retrobot would shoot them, so Wonderous Serena would return the shot.\n\nSeeing that going to the portal would be very dangerous due to the number of retrobots that guarded the place, Wonderous Serena was would happen to infiltrate in a S.T.A.R. Laboratory upon seeing a debris from a retrobot containing the logo. The heroines would then infiltrate the labs in search of some similar portal technology in the universe that would allow them to travel, entering cautiously so that the retrobots guarding they would not see them.\n\nInside the labs, they would find a room with the name of retribution, so they went inside, Wonderous went through some blueprints that appeared to be similar to the original prototype, so Diana would help her, where she told her that the threat may be affecting both universes. Finally, they would find a sign for S.T.A.R. Labs of their land, seeing the frequency, would realize that they needed a blast of energy.\n\nWonder Woman would hear a retrobot approach to the room, so she was in charge of destroying it with her Lasso of Truth, the retrobot would collide with a door although she was able to launch a shot, that shot would be returned by Wonderous Serena with her racket, but crashing erroneously above the ground, causing a close explosion to the heroines.[16]\n\nThe explosion caused both to travel to the universe of Wonderous Serena, who woke up on the ground with a little pain when hitting the head. Diana saw a retrobot approaching what was warned by Wonderous, however both were saved by Serena Williams and an alternative version of herself. Between confusion, all explained to be alternate versions of themselves but quickly acted when more retrobots approached.\n\nWhile running for survive, Diana asked her new companions to help them enter the offices by facilitating access. In that moment, Wonder Woman by seeing the retrobots protected a door deduced that the responsible hid there, so they all entered by destroying the door and causing an explosion. Upon the team on action entered prepared to attack, Wonder Woman was surprised by recognizing Doctor Cyber with confusion and asking for her.\n\nDoctor Cyber welcomed Wonder Woman and Wonderous Serena with irony, amazing that they have found her along with their new companions. The Doctor Cybeer then proceeded to attack the team using her super speed while she explained her plans, causing tennis players to distract Dr. Cyber by multiple angles. Wonderous Serena gave a scream to Diana to use her Lasso of Truth at the time, causing her to stop by falling on the ground.\n\nAs a result, Doctor Cyber was tied by the Lasso on her arms, forcing her to tell the truth. When Diana asked about the location of the prisoners, Cyber revealed that they were in the cells in the basement. Diana Prince from the other dimension was surprised to see the power of the lasso saying it was amazing, so Diana told her that she was amazing too. Wonderous Serena then continued to give Doctor Cyber recall orders.\n\nWonder Woman and the team headed to the location to open the door and rescue the prisoners by removing their handcuffs. Having freed them, Diana went to Williams to tell her that they should take the families back to their realities, however Williams decided to take Mikayla Johnson's parents with Kym first to reunite them with her again, while Wonder Woman took the others.[14]\n\nReceiving a letter from Billy Batson and learning about his noble sacrifice to save Philadelphia, Diana decided to travel to Mount Olympus to restore the power of the Staff of the Gods so she could resurrect him. There, watching the family's funeral, Diana heard the wizard Shazam mention that there were no gods to restore the magic of the staff, so she presented herself as one.\n\nSurprising the entire Batson family and walking to the staff, Wonder Woman took the item raising it with her hands and summoning lightning into the sky that thundered over Batson's grave, causing all the surrounding fauna in the Mount Olympus to be restored as well, along with the powers of Anthea as Diana watched and handed the staff to the wizard.\n\nSuddenly, Diana watched as Batson came out of his grave and hugged his family, but when Batson saw Wonder Woman, he went excited to meet her, happy that she read her letter. Wonder Woman however noted that Batson had a spider in his mouth, and proceeded to comment that his bravery to save Philadelphia was incredible.\n\nThanking him for restoring life on the Mount and asking him to use the power of Zeus wisely, Wonder Woman then started to leave, to which Batson tried to flirt with her saying that he was turning 18, asking her to have a date, but a flattered Wonder Woman asked him to dedicate to saving the world.[17]\n\nWhen a group of ex-marines attacked the Wayne Foundation Science and Technology Conference, Wonder Woman, together with Aquaman and Flash, were quick to respond to the threat. Upon arriving, Aquaman directed her to clear the bystanders, but Wonder Woman pointed out that she was every bit the warrior he was. They soon learned that the group they were fighting had been kicked out of the marines for stealing classified information, and had used that same information to create a Meta Bomb out of Apokoliptian residual energies that could reprogram DNA, a bomb that had seemingly been brought to the conference. Wonder Woman asserted the fact that there would always be people unwilling to believe in the better nature of superhumans, regardless of their good deeds, even as she used the Lasso of Truth to wrangle three of the ex-marines.\n\nOne of the ex-marines then managed to damage the Meta Bomb, right before Wonder Woman managed to attack and subdue her. Wonder Woman then pointed out that the weapon was breached and unstable, its effects becoming more apparent. As Flash and Aquaman began giving out suggestions, Wonder Woman pointed out that Aquaman's plan to bring the Meta Bomb to the Hudson River was dangerous. Aquaman however, was resolute in his plan, flying off with the bomb as Wonder Woman watched from the ground.\n\nAfter Aquaman returned from disposing the bomb, Wonder Woman informed Aquaman and Flash that she would be bringing the captured ex-marines to Fort Hamilton, where she supposedly still had a few friends. Aquaman then thanked her, mentioning how busy he was especially in light of his wedding plans. Flash was surprised by the comment, grasping Wonder Woman's shoulder in shock, while Wonder Woman stated that it was \"About time\".[18]\n\nAfter Batman chased Al Falcone and his crew to a bridge where Batman managed to take down most of Falcone's crew, but was now dangling from the edge of the bridge, holding onto Falcone. Wonder Woman arrived in time to pull Batman and Falcone back onto the bridge using the Lasso of Truth. Flash then arrived, having saved multiple babies at a hospital, and attempted to free Batman from the Lasso of Truth as he started to talk about his feelings. Wonder Woman laughed at their revelations before flying off.[19]\n\nDiana is a very kind, loving, compassionate, and strong-willed person, who, while initially somewhat naïve, has become all the wiser through her time in Man's World. An outspoken egalitarian, she fights for what she believes in and generally for the betterment of mankind through love and mutual understanding, as taught to her by her mother and fellow Amazons.[20] Growing up, Diana also proved herself headstrong and determined to do what she wanted, such as training in hand-to-hand combat under her aunt Antiope's tutelage despite her mother initially forbidding it. In this way she is quite stubborn; if she believes something is the right thing to do, then she will do it - as evidenced by her attempt to leave Themyscira without her mother's permission and insistence in attending Ludendorff's gala despite Steve telling her not to. Alongside her kindness and compassion, however, Diana was also a very naïve idealist when she first arrived in \"Man's World,\" blindly believing that all men were corrupted by Ares and that the World War I Central Powers would simply abandon their sinister ways if she killed him. This blind naivety also translated to explicit indignation whenever she was treated with disrespect due to her status as a woman, such as when she was ignored by members of the War Office. Alongside this, Diana also voiced her opinions rather bluntly upon her arrival, such as when she perceived Etta Candy's job as Steve Trevor's secretary to be akin to slavery (which earns Diana Etta's admiration). Despite her outspokenness and behavior in Man's World, however, Diana remained very caring and compassionate, as demonstrated by her initially rocky relationship with Charlie and willingness to step into No Man's Land to save the village of Veld while encouraging him with compassion to sing for them\n\nBy the end of the war, Diana began to lose faith in both humanity and herself after Ares opened her eyes to humanity's potential for evil. While she still believed in the power of love and compassion to change humanity for the better despite their flaws because of Steve’s declaration of love to her that showed her that, Diana was left sobered and emotionally broken over certain events from the war, such as the use of Doctor Poison's gas to massacre the entire village of Veld, and Steve Trevor's self-sacrificing death however she was inspired by his love & selfless act that shows her that humanity is indeed worth protecting despite their imperfections so she vows to do because she is unable to fully stop caring for and protecting humanity by keeping innocent people safe as a mysterious female savior while also continued to fight and kill other malicious beings from other worlds and did everything in her power to prevent Max Lord's apocalyptic agenda. In spite of her sophisticated line of work, Diana was clearly an introvert at heart with few friends. This did not mean she was closed off from human connection, however, as she and Barbara Maxwell bonded rather quickly. When she saw what the power of the wishing relic was almost ready to do to the entire world, she made the ultimate sacrifice by heavyheartedly revoking her wish to be reunited with Trevor — ironically, the Amazonian who had still had belief in humanity despite their imperfections was the very first to revoke her wish, having done so purely out of selflessness. Upon witnessing the destruction of the seemingly unstoppable Doomsday, Diana joined to battle him alongside Batman and Superman. After witnessing Superman's sacrifice to stop the monster, and after Bruce's appeal to her underlying belief in the inherent good of humanity even though she understands the complexities of human nature because humanity is both good and bad by sending her the original photograph of her and the Wonder Men & sends Bruce a thankful email of him bringing him back Steve Trevor even if she accepted the truth that Steve is gone thirty yrs ago since she can’t have it all even though he’s a memory to Diana so she’s inspired to come out of the shadows demonstrating despite how much humanity had failed or she understands that humanity is flawed but worth protecting despite being a mysterious female savior over the yrs, she still held underlying belief in her own core values and the positive effect true heroes can have on the world.\n\nWhile living in \"Man's World\" for a century following World War I tempered some of Diana's more blindly held beliefs, she still held true to her core values of kindness and compassion, and further grew into an exceptionally considerate, diplomatic, and empathetic woman. fully understanding the complexities of human nature. This can be seen when she silently emphasizes with Lois Lane after the death of Superman had been killed (recalling her own pain with Steve Trevor) smiling knowingly when Aquaman accidentally sat on the Lasso of Hestia and confessed his fears about their upcoming mission and how attractive he found her. With all of her experiences, Diana is also the most diplomatic member of the Justice League, as evidenced by her treatment of the Flash with compassion and patience, despite his tendency to somewhat annoy her and the other Justice Leaguers with his humorous attitude, and the kindness and support she showed to Cyborg while he continued to grapple with his powers.[21] Indeed, through her compassion and unbreakable spirit, Diana has given renewed hope to many of her teammates throughout the years. For example, she motivated and inspired the Wonder Men into looking past purely monetary interests, with Chief resolving to no longer be neutral in the war, Sameer finally admitting his passion for acting, and even the depressed Charlie struggling with PTSD finally beginning to sing again for the first time in years. Likewise, during the Justice League's battle against Steppenwolf's forces, Wonder Woman was able to inspire confidence in the inexperienced Flash and Cyborg, assuring them that they wouldn't need to fight the Apokoliptian invasion alone. Furthermore, she was the most understanding of Superman's confusion upon his resurrection and remained ambivalent about fighting the newly-resurrected Superman and even implored him not to force her to, showing him compassion and persistence while attempting to get him to remember who he is (even calling him by his birth name). In addition to her general willingness for empathy, however, Diana is also extremely friendly and can step back enjoy the smaller moments in life, as seen in her utter delight in experiencing ice cream and agreement with Superman (who, up until this point she had not spoken to much) about him not missing out on the positive results of their victory over Steppenwolf.\n\nEven alongside all of her kindness, compassion, and empathy, Diana is still also a warrior at heart, and when someone she cares about is hurt, becomes far more relentless and ruthless. When seemingly beaten by Ares (who was only growing more powerful from her violence, rage, and hatred), and after having to watch her beloved Steve Trevor die, she flew into an agonizing rage, and she assaulted and brutalized several armed German soldiers with immense speed and ferocity. She even came close to murdering Doctor Poison as vengeance for Steve's death; but after recalling Steve's great love for an undying belief in her and her beliefs, restrained herself and refocused her energies on Ares, harnessing her love for Trevor to overcome her violent emotions and swiftly overpower an angered Ares. Additionally, she resolved to fight even harder after Steppenwolf revealed that he had killed several other Amazons. Outside of battle, however, Diana can also react indigently and negatively towards people who disrespect her, her relatives, or those she cares about. Two such notable instances were when she shot an angry look at Lex Luthor (after he insulted her father Zeus's memory), and when she furiously shoved Batman back (after he had insulted her beloved Steve Trevor's memory). Diana also remains ruthless when facing enemies in battle as Wonder Woman, and she even shows signs of enjoying a good battle when they put up a good fight. This was seen when she briefly smiled and laughed when she was beaten to the ground by Doomsday, and smirked as she stopped the first bullet fired at a group of hostages in London.\n\nStill, Diana ultimately had a very strong regard for life and compassion for her enemies, choosing not to drown Cheetah or wish Max Lord out of existence, knowing that ending the conflict without committing murder would be far more difficult. Additionally, she only killed Ares and made more than one attempt on the life of Steppenwolf because it was clear to her that both of them were sentient beings of pure malevolence with no genuine love for anybody.\n\nPerhaps due to her Amazon background, Diana greatly respects other noble selfless warriors, as evidenced when she attended Superman's funeral in Smallville and spoke of how he had been much more than a soldier (adding to what Batman said about Metropolis burying an empty casket). As a result of her great posthumous respect, she was, therefore, more than willing to aid Batman in honoring the heroic death of Superman, by helping round up the metahumans from Lex Luthor's files to form a team of superheroes (later known as the Justice League) to protect the world from the imminent mysterious alien invader Steppenwolf and his Parademon minions after Superman's death left the world vulnerable.\n\nIn addition, Diana appears to hold members of her close family in high esteem. In addition to the respect she has for her mother, Hippolyta, and aunt Antiope, she indicated that she held her father Zeus in the same very high esteem, when she was visibly angered when Lex Luthor referred to him distastefully while discussing the story of the Titan Prometheus.\n\nAmazon-Olympian Hybrid Physiology: As the hybrid offspring of an Amazon and an Old God, Wonder Woman  possesses extraordinary superhuman physical abilities, including immense strength, durability, speed, agility, stamina, reflexes, and accelerated healing, along with extended longevity. She can generate divine energy through her bracelets and manipulate it to deflect attacks or create energy effects, including limited electrical bursts. Her power is great enough to engage very powerful beings, such as the Old God Ares and Doomsday. As such, Wonder Woman is one of the most powerful beings on Earth.",
