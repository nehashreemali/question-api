  "content": "Robert DuBois, codenamed Bloodsport, is an assassin equipped with advanced weaponry who was hired to kill Superman using a kryptonite bullet but ultimately failed to do so. As a result, he was arrested and incarcerated in Belle Reve, and subsequently became a member, and briefly the leader, of the Task Force X team sent to Corto Maltese. While there, DeBois formed a close bond with Ratcatcher 2, became an integral part of destroying Starro, defeated and grievously wounded his traitorous rival Peacemaker when the latter killed Rick Flag and threatened Cleo's life, and successfully blackmailed Amanda Waller into letting him and his surviving teammates go free after proving himself a capable leader.\n\nSince he was born, Robert DuBois was trained and mistreated by his father to become a hardened mercenary like himself, since every time he didn't complete a school assignment, his father used to lock him inside a crate full of starving rats for one day, making him gain a rat phobia. DuBois began to be trained by his father in shooting and combat.[1]\n\nGrowing up, DuBois joined the military, where he met and befriended Rick Flag. Once, DuBois learned that he could never take a bone out of Flag's mouth, as he had intense plans. The duo joined the Qurac special forces to take on the dangerous terrorist, Avral Kaddam. Upon leaving the military, DuBois became the paid assassin known as Bloodsport. Years later, DuBois married and unknowingly, his wife had a daughter, whom he named Tyla, but when she grew up, DuBois' wife died.[1]\n\nDuBois was hired to kill Superman with a Kryptonite bullet. During the confrontation, DuBois managed to injure the hero after shooting him. However Bloodsport was defeated by Superman  where afterwards he ended up being arrested and Superman was sent to the ICU for medical treatment. After sentencing DuBois was sent to the Belle Reve Correctional Center, where he worked as a janitor and received regular visits from his daughter.[1]\n\nDuBois was visited by A.R.G.U.S. Director Amanda Waller, who wanted to recruit him to join Task Force X on a mission to Corto Maltese in exchange for a reduced sentence, but he refused. While cleaning the bathrooms, DuBois began to find a lot of hair and took it upon himself to remove gum from tables and the floor. When Blackguard threw a piece of paper at him, DuBois became upset with him, as he had a lot to do. DuBois was again visited by Waller, but kept refusing her request, until Waller mentioned that she had visitors.\n\nDuBois discovered that his daughter Tyla came to visit, and the two began to argue, as DuBois did not want her to visit him. Upon hearing that Tyla stole a watch, DuBois became upset that she had stolen something useless, beginning to argue while yelling at each other, but then calmed down. DuBois told Tyla that he was not a good example and found out that Tyla was going to prison for the robbery, but Tyla mentioned he could help her if he accepted Waller's request.\n\nDuBois angrily confronted Waller for threatening his daughter, as he believed Tyla was going to juvie, but Waller threatened him that she would be transported to Belle Reve Correctional Center, which only angered him further, and he threatened to kill Waller with a pencil. Waller wanted DuBois to be the leader, but he kept refusing, until Waller confessed that the fate of the world depended on him, so reluctantly, DuBois finally agreed to go on the mission, and Waller quickly took him to meet the team.\n\nDuBois was then taken to meet Peacemaker, an extremist vigilante with the same abilities as DuBois, something that annoyed him, starting a rivalry with him. DuBois and Smith then met King Shark, a giant shark, mocking him for being a fool, but learned that he loved human flesh. They then met Cleo Cazo, who could control rats, scaring DuBois, and finally the group met Abner Krill, who could shoot colored dots. DuBois grew annoyed at the irresponsible guards and Weasel watching him.\n\nAfter donning their suits, the team went to a briefing room to learn the details about the mission, where Waller explained to them about the history of Corto Maltese and its rulers the Herrera Family, but after a coup d'état they were killed by Silvio Luna. The squad's mission was then to destroy the Jotunheim fortress along with something known as Project Starfish, a weapon capable of causing an international crisis, having to kidnap the scientist Thinker and ask for his help. DuBois felt that they were going to die on the mission, something Krill expected, upsetting DuBois even more.[1]\n\nThree days later, the squad was taken to the airport to reach Corto Maltese, arriving at night and jumping into the ocean to then reach the beach, where they heard explosives, so Bloodsport pulled out his gun to fight, but Amanda Waller told them it was of no importance, despite being another team that distracted the military. As they walked, DuBois learned how Peacemaker would do anything for peace, annoying DuBois, but when Smith mentioned that he would never kill for money.\n\nThe two began to argue until Cleo Cazo interrupted them, hearing more explosives. While resting, DuBois woke up only to see Abner Krill vomiting colorful polka dots, something that surprised him, and both stared at each other for what happened until Cazo's pet, Sebastian, interrupted to tell DuBois that King Shark was going to eat Cazo, so DuBois released his weapon to attack him until he left him in a tree and team confronted King Shark to calm him down.\n\nCleo Cazo then summoned an army of rats to attack the King Shark, something that scared DuBois because of his fear, he even let out a scream. DuBois had to reveal his fear of rats and asked Cazo to expel them, while Peacemaker mocked him. After Nanaue and Cazo became friends, DuBois knew that they were doomed, and left the place to rest alone.[1]\n\nThe next morning, DuBois and the team learned from Amanda Waller that they were to track down Rick Flag, whom DuBois already knew. Upon arriving at the base, the squad was to brutally murder the captors, where DuBois saw Flag's location, so they made a plan to eliminate each enemy.\n\nDuBois sprang into action to kill the enemies and to compete against Peacemaker for the most kills while glaring at each other. After seeing an explosive bullet from Smith, DuBois was shocked and admitted that it was cool. The squad prepared to go in, but there were more soldiers, and they were shocked to see how Abner Krill eliminated them using his dots.\n\nThe squad found Flag, but it turned out that he was not kidnapped, as Sol Soria and the supposed enemies were the resistance, something that made the team feel sorry, since they killed several allies. DuBois was surprised to see his friend and tried to lie saying that they had not seen anyone, but Nanaue and Krill admitted what had happened. The group apologized to Soria so that they could help them along with Flag to reach Valle Del Mar.[1]\n\nIn the morning, the squad set out to meet up with Sol Soria's contact, Milton, who would take them to Valle Del Mar. DuBois and the group saw Abner Krill with his stitches on his face and discovered his tragic origins of how his mother experimented on him to give him powers by injecting him with an interdimensional virus. Soria wanted Corto Maltese to be free from Silvio Luna's rule, but DuBois mentioned that they were only to destroy Jotunheim and kept walking.[1] Confused, DuBois asked Rick Flag why he was on the mission, with Flag assuming they were a decoy group for Waller, surprising DuBois, who did not understand why he was despicable to Waller, and Flag claimed to believe it was because of the time he made fun of her shirt.[2]\n\nAt night, the squad and the Maltese Resistance found Milton surrounded by the military, so they arrived to save him, killing the soldiers, and DuBois surprised Milton to ask him if he was him. DuBois and Peacemaker then put boxes of clothes on the bus to pass unsuspecting. Both of them made fun of King Shark, since he wanted to wear a disguise, and DuBois then talked to Cleo Cazo about her fear of Sebastian, since the rat wanted to be his friend because he had faith in him, but DuBois kept rejecting him.\n\nDuring the trip through Valle Del Mar, DuBois lost communication with Amanda Waller, but she reminded him she still had a threat with his daughter. DuBois talked to Cazo about her relationship with her father, but Cazo denied it, as her father loved her, but died due to drugs. When Cazo asked him about his fear of rats, DuBois confessed that his father always put him in a cage with rats, which caused him to be afraid. DuBois and Cazo promised each other that they would get out alive.\n\nArriving at La Gatita Amable to find Thinker, DuBois and the squad settled in to wait, but when Grieves did not arrive, Smith suggested they have some fun, but DuBois did not want to, since they were on a mission. DuBois was convinced by Rick Flag to have some fun, so he decided to have some fernets, but the squad began to be more united and they had fun at the club.\n\nWhen Thinker appeared, DuBois sprang into action to talk to him. During the conversation, DuBois threatened him with a gun to kidnap him and told him that he would take them to Jotunheim, and if he doesn't, he would feed him to King Shark. The squad was going to retreat with Thinker, but they were found by the Corto Maltese Armed Forces, so DuBois gave his gun to Abner Krill so that he and Cazo could take Grieves to the bus.\n\nDuBois allowed himself to be discovered as part of his plan, so Rick Flag and Peacemaker played along by turning themselves in to the military. On the convoy, DuBois asked a guard for a cigarette to pretend to smoke. DuBois and the soldier began talking about the prison they were going to until he mentioned that Harley Quinn might be dead, something that surprised Flag, as he believed she was dead.\n\nDuBois took advantage to deal a blow to the guard and Peacemaker along with Rick Flag joined together to free themselves and take the guards' weapons. After eliminating all the soldiers, DuBois, Flag, and Smith crashed on the ground, as the truck lost control. The trio managed to survive and got out of the truck to meet up with the squad, as they were ready to go to Jotunheim, but Flag changed the plans to go rescue Harley Quinn first.[1]\n\nThe squad headed to Silvio Luna's Palace to free Harley Quinn, where DuBois gave the team weapons for the fight and argued with Peacemaker, as the mission was in danger, but DuBois agreed to Rick Flag's plan, angering Smith. The squad got off the bus after chaining Thinker and DuBois went with Flag to attack the palace.\n\nAfter the team reported that there were no soldiers, DuBois used his grappling hook as he was going to enter the palace to rescue Quinn until she appeared as she was able to escape by herself, something that disappointed them as they wanted to carry out their plan. DuBois talked to Quinn about her javelin, but she did not know how to use it, and watched as Quinn hugged Flag. DuBois then introduced himself to Quinn by his codename Bloodsport.[1]\n\nThe squad went up to a rooftop to eat empanadas, where DuBois and Rick Flag explained to Thinker that he must not betray them, or else he would die. DuBois explained the plan where Ratcatcher 2, Flag, and Thinker would delete the files on Project Starfish, while the rest would plant explosives on Jotunheim and then escape, something Thinker considered suicidal, but Flag seconded his friend, as that was their brand.\n\nAs Grieves drove the bus to get to the tower, DuBois and the others threatened him with their weapons to prevent him from betraying them,[1] Bloodsport shut Harley Quinn and Peacemaker up from arguing and threatened Thinker with his gun to convince soldier Isabella not to confiscate the van and let them pass.[2] When he parked, the squad prepared to get off and camouflaged themselves in the rain to avoid being discovered, where DuBois and his teammates surprised them by eliminating the soldiers to enter the tower. Upon entering with the help of Grieves, DuBois took his bombs to leave along with Quinn, Krill, and without realizing it, Milton also accompanied them.\n\nAfter planting several explosives, DuBois saw from afar how Mateo Suarez and the rest of the Corto Maltese Armed Forces came to stop them, so he informed the team that they had to hurry, since they were only nine floors away. The group reached the top of the tower to blow it up, but Krill dropped his explosives, until they were attacked by soldiers. DuBois asked if there were more, but learned with Quinzel that Milton was killed, arguing, since they did not know that Milton followed them.\n\nDuBois told of how Krill was friends with Milton until more soldiers arrived, but Krill accidentally caused the explosives to detonate prematurely, causing Jotunheim to begin collapsing. DuBois and the squad fell into the flooding tower, and tried to save King Shark from the Clyrax to no avail. When Krill and Quinzel were able to jump, DuBois failed in the jump and began being shot at by the soldiers, but survived as he fell floor by floor until he hit the ground.\n\nAs Bloodsport finished falling, he saw Peacemaker attempting to kill Ratcatcher 2, so DuBois and Smith engaged in a decisive fight, in which DuBois \"killed\" Smith and mocked him by mentioning that he beat him with his small bullets. Upon learning that Flag was killed by Smith, as he wanted to reveal that the United States was responsible for Project Starfish, DuBois kept the disk with the information because he planned to blackmail Amanda Waller.[1]\n\nDuBois and Cleo Cazo reunited with Harley Quinn, Polka-Dot Man, and King Shark, who managed to survive, but felt tremors as Starro had begun to emerge, so the squad left the building, and watched as Starro emerged. To avoid being killed by Starro's spores, DuBois began killing the creatures and was shocked to see Starro take control of the soldiers to become his army, and the squad watched as Starro began killing the citizens of Valle del Mar.\n\nDuBois talked to Amanda Waller about Starro, but she refused to let them do anything, as they had completed the mission, and if they did anything, she would kill them. DuBois had to accept that the people would die and ordered the team to retreat, but upon hearing the desperate cries of help from the people, DuBois had kindness and decided to save Valle Del Mar, and his teammates followed him, angering Waller, who ended up beaten by her subordinates when she tried to kill DuBois.\n\nThe squad was then aided by Emilia Harcourt, John Economos, Flo Crawley, and several A.R.G.U.S. agents, after betraying Waller. With the agents' help, DuBois and the team managed to locate Starro on a route away from infected people. In order to kill him, DuBois rigged his nanotech weapon to make it larger and began shooting at Starro to kill him, but had to run away from him when he tried to attack him.\n\nRealizing that in order to defeat Starro he would have to use his friends' abilities, DuBois finally acted as leader, ordering Harley Quinn to go to the rooftops, telling King Shark that Starro was \"nom nom\", and telling Polka-Dot Man to view Starro as his mom. DuBois became proud of Krill, but he was instantly killed by Starro, much to DuBois's dismay. DuBois watched as King Shark and Harley Quinn were taken down by Starro, and being surrounded by several infected, DuBois used all of his weapons to kill several of them.\n\nRunning out of weapons, DuBois used his sword to continue fighting until he had to use his flamethrower as a last option, but ended up being caught by the infected. DuBois saw that Cazo was going to be attacked by Starro, so he managed to break free, and jumped to save his friend. The duo was surrounded by more infected and DuBois was left without weapons, so he could not do anything, until Cazo confronted Starro again to summon an army of rats, something that scared DuBois, but Cazo protected her friend to avoid being killed.\n\nAfter the rats defeated Starro, DuBois was calmed down by Cazo and they watched as Starro spoke through Mateo Suarez's body, before being killed by the rats and Quinn, and DuBois watched as she emerged from Starro's body alongside the rats and gave him a thumbs up sign, which DuBois responded to, as they had won the battle. DuBois then sent the disk to a server. He then and called Waller to inform her that if his friends or Tyla were sent to prison, he would leak all the information about the United States involvement with Starro, something that Waller agreed to, being proud to know that DuBois had become a leader.\n\nAfter hanging up, DuBois and Quinn talked about Rick Flag, as he wanted to release the information, and admitted that Flag was their friend, when Quinn offered to be her friend, DuBois accepted. Quinn tried to tease him a bit by confusing him with Milton, but DuBois persisted until the helicopter arrived to pick them up and was upset to hear that King Shark was planning to eat something. In the helicopter, DuBois and the squad rested, as they were free from prison. DuBois was scared when Sebastian stood on his leg, but DuBois began to grow fond of the rat and petted him, managing to overcome his fear.[1]\n\nRobert DuBois takes his work as an assassin and a Task Force X membership seriously, acting as if he'd like to be finished with it and move on with his life. He's confident and tough, with flexible morality and a clear understanding of the mission's stakes, both for those close to him and the world at large.\n\nHe is hardened, aggressive, and easily frustrated, and despite distancing himself from relationships, including his own daughter, he can be compassionate for his close friends and family, willing to sacrifice his life for what's right, showing a good side that surprises even himself. This is also proven when he chose to keep safe a drive which contained files about the Starfish Project instead of destroying it as a part of his mission.\n\nHe is very proud about his abilities and tends to maintain the image of a tough, fearless, undefeatable and cunning assassin. Because of this, he doesn't like to show to people his weaknesses and preferred to directly lie to Amanda Waller by hiding his fear of rats from her. This is further seen when he and Peacemaker competed to see which of the two is a better soldier by killing multiple enemies. Despite his confidence, he is still honorable and dislikes someone who show off his abilities just to prove to be better than anyone else.",
