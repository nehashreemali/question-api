  "content": "Jaime Reyes is a college graduate from Palmera City who tried to help pay off his family's debts by working at Kord Industries, but accidentally bonded with biotechnological alien Khaji-Da. In an attempt to get rid of the beetle, Reyes teamed up with Jenny Kord and his uncle Rudy Reyes to do so, being chased by Victoria Kord and coming into conflict with Ignacio Carapax. After the death of his father Alberto Reyes and his capture on Pago Island, Reyes regained his trust, accepting Khaji-Da and fighting Kord Industries to save his family. Accepting to be a superhero, Reyes became Blue Beetle, following the legacy of Ted Kord.\n\nJaime Reyes was born in 2001 as the son of Alberto and Rocio Reyes, a Mexican couple who migrated to Palmera City. During his childhood, Jaime grew up with his family, including his parents and nana, forming a friendship with his uncle, Rudy Reyes, and eventually had a sister named Milagro Reyes. When Jaime was a child, he participated in a baseball team. In their teens, Reyes and Milagro were taught by their mother to learn how to dance salsa, although they found it difficult, claiming that he had two left feet.\n\nUpon graduating from high school, Reyes left his family in Palmera City to continue his studies in Gotham City, at the Gotham Law, being unaware of the economic difficulties of his family, who got into debt due to the gentrification of Kord Industries in the area, although they never told him so as not to distract him from his studies, until Jaime finally graduated with a law degree.[1]\n\nReyes flew back to Palmera City, and upon arriving at the airport, he happily asked a man if he looked good putting on his graduation hat, surprised by the man's response. Jaime saw his family waiting for him, to whom he greeted excitedly, receiving a balloon as a gift for his sister, and then being happy to see his Nana, sharing a hug with the family while wondering about Rudy Reyes. Jaime was happy to see his uncle arrive to pick him up, and the family went to a restaurant to eat.\n\nWhile Jaime marveled at the food, Milagro confessed Jaime the truth about the debt, missing Jaime, so that his parents told him about the increase in rent was becoming unpayable, a worried Jaime offered to help in the workshop to pay off the debt, learning that they lost it because of Kord Industries. Jaime, saddened, wondered why they didn't tell him, and his family said that they didn't want to distract him from his studies, with his father trying to encourage him, but Reyes continued to be frustrated that he hadn't been there to help.[1]\n\nJaime and Milagro went up to the roof to talk, remembering when their mother taught them salsa and Jaime's 21st birthday, getting frustrated at losing the house, vowing never to leave again, although Milagro tried to cheer him up. Jaime criticized the companies for talking about progress while moving forward to buy the area, bankrupting the family, something Milagro agreed with. Jaime got motivated, pledging to get a first class job to save the neighborhood, getting excited about buying a mansion.[1]\n\nMilagro got Jaime a job at Kord Industries accompanying her sister as janitors on the Kord mansion, while he was working, Reyes began to contemplate the ocean, being reprimanded by Milagro who asked him if he finished cleaning the gum. Jaime felt humiliated by the job, receiving complaints from Milagro for being ungrateful. Jaime interrupted his sister to show her how Victoria Kord passed by, trying to greet her when she was on the phone, being surprised that he was ignored.\n\nWhen Milagro went to the bathroom, she asked him to guard, although Jaime tried to tell him that the service bathrooms were in another direction, but Milagro was trying to go to a first-class bathroom. Jaime then overheard an argument between Victoria and Jenny Kord about the company's legacy, and when the tension rose, Jaime tried to intervene, and when Milagro came out of the bathroom, Victoria fired them.\n\nJaime and Milagro stayed to wait for the car to pick them up, and seeing Jenny Kord leave, Reyes tried to talk to her, to which Jenny liked him, shaking arms, with Jenny apologizing for what happened, and asking Reyes go to the Kord tower to try to get him another job in the company, giving him her phone number. When Kord retired, Milagro told Jaime to believe that Kord was in love with him, thinking that she could lift him out of poverty just like María la del Barrio.[1]\n\nGoing to sleep, Jaime looked at Jenny Kord's Instagram posts, trying to send her a message, but hesitating to send it, feeling remorseful. As he was not sleepy, Jaime went out to the yard where his father was resting, who told him about how he planted the nepales in the garden when Jaime was a baby.\n\nJaime explained that he felt insecure and believed that everything was out of his reach and that he disappointed the family, and his father spoke philosophically, that the objects had no value and were just a stop on the trip, but that the family is what lasted, and that everyone had a purpose, encouraging Jaime, who decided to send the message to Jenny.[1]\n\nThe next day, Jaime showed up at the entrance of the Kord Industries building to meet Jenny Kord and get the job, and nervously, he was encouraged by his family who accompanied him. When Nana Reyes called Jaime, he approached her, being blessed by his grandmother, and while he returned to enter the establishment, he was encouraged again by his family.\n\nReyes went to the receptionist, where he told her to come see Jenny Kord, so the receptionist asked him to sit down and wait, where after a while he saw Jenny come down from an elevator, so he began to follow her trying to call her attention. When Reyes met with Kord, she told him to be in a hurry, but Reyes insisted that he needed the job even though Jenny said it was a bad time for it.\n\nSeeing that many security guards were on alert, in an act of desperation and knowing that Reyes was willing to do anything, Jenny Kord gave Reyes a hamburger box, telling him to protect him with his life, but not to open it or look inside. Following the directions, Jaime Reyes left the establishment with the box, where Reyes stopped to note that it was a Big Belly Burger box.[1]\n\nReyes returned to his house with his family, where Milagro Reyes bragged that he only managed to get a hamburger, but Jaime claimed not to believe it was a burger, learning that his sister opened the box despite Jenny Kord telling her not to open him, but since she was not present, Jaime was encouraged by his family to open the box, finally accepting, discovering that it was a beetle-shaped relic, and explaining that he did not know why Jenny wanted to hide it.\n\nJaime was upset when Milagro irresponsibly took the scarab, asking to be put back in the box and snatching it out of Rudy's hands when Milagro passed it to him. Suddenly, Reyes was surprised to see the beetle shine, seeing how it transformed into a mobile insect, rejoicing to believe that he liked it, until the beetle attacked him by jumping towards his face, scaring the family who he asked to take it away.\n\nRudy tried to remove the insect, but was struck by lightning, the scarab began to enter Jaime's back, while the family made efforts to remove it, but Jaime was scared to find out that the scarab entered him, generating pincers on his back they held him to the ceiling, while an armor was generated on his body without Jaime understanding what was happening, falling to the floor after the act.\n\nThe confused family tried to communicate with Jaime, with the scarab controlling Jaime against his will, Jaime heard a robotic voice in his head, beginning a systems check that activated thrusters, with Jaime trying to tell his family to remain calm, but being propelled into the sky, taking an scared Reyes into space. Reyes tried to remain calm despite not knowing what was happening, until his thrusters deactivated, plummeting to Earth as the armor caught fire.\n\nA few meters from falling onto the water, the beetle activated wings to stop the crash, relieving Jaime who asked to return to his house, but the beetle activated high-speed flight systems that made it hit a bridge. Jaime tried to explain to the beetle that he was mistaken for a person, but it boosted up, making him fly in the air while he hit some cars, asking him to be careful and retaliating with the scarab for kidnapping him.\n\nJaime flew with impulse through the city until falling on top of a car, trying to apologize to the owners. Seeing that a bus was approaching, the beetle protected Reyes with a shield considering him a threat, cutting him in half, worrying Jaime who tried to explain that it was not his fault, but the thrusters activated again, taking Reyes to his home.\n\nReyes fell on top of the bare roof, but when his mother tried to give him a sheet to cover himself, he fainted. After a few hours, Reyes woke up being cared for by his family, he returned confused to his room dressing to return with Kord, but he saw in the mirror how he had the scarab implanted on his back, screaming in horror.\n\nJaime mentioned to his family that he was going to ask Jenny Kord for help, but found that his favorite shoes melted during the transformation, explaining that he was confused and cut a bus in half, but his mother wouldn't let him go out, getting upset with Milagro for taking his phone to see Kord's profile, leaving the house when the family was distracted, taking Rudy's The Taco.[1]\n\nReyes drove to the Kord Industries facility, but suffering from an itch, until he saw Jenny Kord covering herself between cars, for which he confusedly caught her attention, seeing how she got into the car and desperately asked to start, getting scared to see that some soldiers were shooting, so Reyes drove, worried about how Rudy was going to scold him for the damage to the car.\n\nAt home, Jaime and his family tended to Jenny while he listened worriedly to Rudy's screams for the car. When Rudy returned, Jaime tried to introduce him to Jenny, but Rudy angrily mentioned that his real name was César. When Jenny asked about the scarab, Jaime tried to remove his shirt before Rudy threw a shoe at him, prompting repudiation from the family, but finally showing Jenny the scarab attached to his back.\n\nJaime asked what it was, Kord explained that it was a weapon of mass destruction that belonged to her father, frustrating Jaime as Jenny mentioned that the scarab chose him, when Jaime asked how they could make it unchose him, Kord said she didn't know but she could find out, causing disappointment in the family until Alberto Reyes calmed the situation, with Jaime agreeing to go with Kord to look for answers at the Kord Estate but having to steal a key first in Kord Plaza, and Rudy joining them by having help mechanisms.[1]\n\nIn Kord Plaza, Jaime and Jenny saw Rudy's mechanism, El Chapulín, distrusting that it would work, but with Rudy stating that it was better than Kord's technology, watching as he turned it on, hacking into Kord Industries' security cameras with a broadcast of El Chapulín Colorado, allowing Jaime and Jenny to enter, where Kord explained to Reyes how her father had inherited the company, and Reyes helped open a glass window with the Tedwatch key.\n\nAs they left happy that Rudy's plan worked, they ran into Ignacio Carapax who asked for the beetle, but as Carapax ran to hit Reyes, the beetle stopped him with Jaime's arm, activating the armor to counterattack Carapax by hitting him against a statue, when Jenny asked Jaime how he did that, Jaime replied that he had no idea, watching as an angry Carapax activated his armor, launching a missile at Reyes, so the scarab protected him by activating a shield.\n\nReyes asked Kord to go find Rudy while the beetle and Jaime engaged Carapax, taking cover behind a car when Carapax started shooting, and the scarab suggested using an arsenal, but Reyes preferred to talk to him, however as Carapax kicked the car hitting Reyes, Reyes accepted the scarab to generate an electric shock to free themself, walking up to Carapax and fight him, kicking him and flying to shoot him.\n\nHaving Carapax neutralized, Jaime and the scarab descended to activate some swords with which to kill him, however Reyes resisted, refusing to kill him, with the scarab following his orders. At that, Reyes saw Rudy Reyes and Jenny Kord arrive at The Taco to rescue him, but when Carapax started shooting at them, Reyes ran to save them.\n\nHowever, Carapax got in the way and stopped him by firing a laser to weaken him, hitting him against some cars, as Carapax was preparing to kill him while he taunts him that he should have taken the chance to finish him, Reyes begged for mercy, but Rudy and Kord threw El Chapulín at him, allowing Reyes to escape. Along the way, Reyes detransformed again naked, claiming to be fine and putting on a shirt, mentioning feeling the name of the scarab, Khaji-Da, in his mind.[1]\n\nDuring the morning, the trio arrived at the Kord Estate, entering into a secret passageway, where upon going down the stairs, they arrived at Ted Kord's hangar, surprising Rudy Reyes for discovering that Kord was the Blue Beetle, but as Jaime said not knowing who he was, Rudy explained that he was the hero of Palmera City, and seeing the suits, Jaime asked Jenny about the hangar, comparing it to Batman's technology.\n\nJenny Kord explained how her father was never able to activate the scarab, so he created his own technology to become the Blue Beetle, watching as Rudy prepared to investigate on the computer, receiving complaints from Rudy for smelling bad, but Jaime told him which was his shirt, and Kord asked him to come with her to change into her father's clothes. After a shower, Reyes was amazed to see in the mirror how a scar was healed by the scarab.\n\nGetting dressed, Reyes went outside to talk to Kord about growing up on the Estate, but Kord mentioned feeling lonely, seeing a painting of Kord's mother, mourning her death and asking about her, and Kord explained how her father became obsessed with the scarab after the death of his mother, until his disappearance. When Jenny got emotional, Reyes was sympathetic, being about to share a kiss with her before being interrupted by Rudy who found information.\n\nInside the hangar, Reyes and Kord overheard Rudy talking about how Ted Kord had a professor named Dan Garrett, who studied the beetle only to discover that the beetle was connecting to Jaime's brain, becoming aware of him. When Jaime asked how to remove the beetle, Rudy mentioned that it only left its host when it died, angering Reyes who decided to go for a walk.\n\nIn remorse, Jaime sat reflecting on the roof where he was found by Rudy, who tried to talk to him, consoling him by talking about Alberto Reyes's jobs, explaining that the universe chose him to carry the beetle and he had to decide what to do with it, believing that it was destiny and motivating him to be a hero, brightening Reyes' spirits to then see Victoria Kord's helicopter flying above them, deducing that she was going to his residence.[1]\n\nTrying to activate his armor to fly and save his family, Jaime raised his arms to no avail, with Jenny asking him to take his time and Rudy telling him to force him out, giving Reyes the idea to jump off the cliff in knowing that the scarab would always protect him, running to jump despite Rudy and Jenny's concern, but activating the armor to fly home.\n\nUpon arrival, Jaime asked Khaji-Da for the arsenal, attacking several soldiers by surprise, which he shot down, from the air, Reyes apologized to his family for taking time while he was targeted by the soldiers. Reyes asked that they not shoot, realizing that he was bulletproof when seeing that the shots did not affect him, but the soldiers received the order from Victoria Kord to attack the family, so Jaime and Khaji-Da jumped to defend them with a shield, asking them to remain calm.\n\nAs Khaji-Da was preparing to use arsenal against the soldiers, Jaime asked for something non-lethal, using energy cannons to stop the soldiers, asking his family to escape. After analyzing the threat, Khaji-Da and Reyes launched themselves to fight the soldiers, taking them down with no difficulty, activating handcuff launchers to immobilize them. Jaime was warned by Khaji-Da about going to help his father, stopping a soldier and asking Milagro to take him out of the combat zone.\n\nSeeing Victoria Kord's helicopter, Reyes in revenge prepared to shoot it down, but when watching in horror as his father had a heart attack, Jaime ran to help him, being hit by a giant grappling hook, making him unable to move, crying over his father's death while being kidnapped by Ignacio Carapax to be taken to Victoria Kord's helicopter.[1]\n\nJaime was kidnapped and imprisoned on Pago Island, where they planned to extract Khaji-Da from his brain and transfer the technology to the OMAC, when Jaime woke up he saw José Morales, asking him to release him and becoming desperate when he did not help him. Reyes was reunited with Victoria Kord, who revealed her intentions to kill him to get the scarab out of him, alarming Jaime who desperately tried to get out.\n\nDespite his efforts, Reyes could not free himself, and the transfer began to kill him due to the energy overload, taking him to the afterlife, where Jaime was reunited with his father, Alberto Reyes, being moved to see him as he looked at the ceiling of the house was destroyed. Alberto asked Jaime to come back, and despite Jaime's insistence that his father accompany him, Alberto told him that his destiny was to share a moment with him to advise him, motivating him to fight when he understood his purpose.\n\nTearfully, Jaime followed his father to see the armor of the scabbard in the distance, being mentored by him about finding answers, saying goodbye with emotion when he saw him disappear. Reconnecting his brainwaves with Khaji-Da, Jaime ran to the armor as everything around him was being destroyed, floating to retrieve the armor, waking up upon touching it.[1]\n\nDue to an explosion caused by Jenny Kord and the Reyes family towards the OMAC, the machine containing Jaime deactivated, allowing Reyes to escape. Reyes tried to open the exit door, being surprisingly helped by José Morales, who betrays Victoria Kord by asking Jaime to find his family and escape, which confuses Reyes who tried to ask him. Morales desperately began to destroy the electronic lock, but he was killed by Ignacio Carapax. As Carapax was destroying the door, Reyes asked Khaji-Da to activate, but Khaji-Da reset, freaking out and starting to run when Carapax activated lasers to blow up the gate.\n\nAfter losing sight of him, Reyes attempted to reactivate Khaji-Da, getting frustrated as it kept rebooting, suddenly an explosion occurred behind him, forcing Jaime to escape from the soldiers, but being surrounded by them. The soldiers were preparing to neutralize Jaime, but they were suddenly killed by Nana Reyes using a machine gun, surprising Jaime to discover that she knew how to fight, but in realtiy, the soldiers were just stunned. As they retreated, Nana felt soldiers approaching, with Jaime backing off as he watched her Nana knocking them uncounsious, confusing Jaime.\n\nArriving at the Bug Ship, Jaime was reunited with his mother, being glad to see her, and realizing that Milagro Reyes and Jenny Kord were still missing. Jaime set out to go look for them, but before going, Rocio Reyes asked Jaime and Khaji-Da to work together and use their strength to save them and avenge Alberto Reyes, motivating Jaime to fight. Reyes returned to the halls, with Khaji-Da's reset complete, they saw Milagro Reyes being stopped by the soldiers, proceeding to attack them one by one, easily knocking them against the walls.\n\nReyes was warned by his sister of a missile, so Reyes generated a hammer on his arm to slow him down, fighting again with the remaining soldiers. While he was fighting, Reyes decided to activate pincers against them, but being knocked down by the soldiers, which Khaji-Da knocked out with a energy blast, and seeing a soldier escaping, Reyes stopped him with his pincers. Glad to see her sister, he shared a hug with her, watching as Rudy Reyes arrived.\n\nJaime asked where Jenny Kord was, but since Milagro got separated from her, she didn't know, with Jaime insisting on finding her. Reyes was suddenly attacked by Ignacio Carapax with a cannon, who turned into the OMAC, throwing him out of the facility, fighting in the air. Reyes asked Khaji-Da for rockets to counterattack the OMAC, shooting at it and then using swords, but getting knocked into a wall, being warned by the scarab that Carapax got stronger, running when he tried to attack him.\n\nReyes continued to fight Carapax in the air, but when he destroyed the wings, Khaji-Da reported critical damage, with Jaime holding out until he fell to the ground. Reyes created a sword as the OMAC attacked him with an electrical lasso, hitting Reyes, who shielded himself with his pincers as the OMAC attacked him with a saw, with Khaji-Da launching a bolt of energy to push Carapax away, allowing Reyes to get up, who immediately generated a buster sword, which hit the ground to launch the OMAC away.\n\nReyes followed Carapax to confront him, having fun striking him with his sword despite Khaji-Da's warnings not to rush. Reyes was stabbed by Carapax, overloading Khaji-Da's generative system who tried to attack OMAC with the pincers, managing to counter it but being propelled by Carapax into the air to hit him to the ground, leaving Khaji-Da in critical condition, who wasn't able to protect Jaime, being attacked by Carapax as his face mask is broken in half. When Carapax was going to kill Jaime, he was distracted by Rudy Reyes, and Jaime screamed in anguish when the OMAC launched a missile at him, believing Carapax killed his uncle.\n\nEnraged, Reyes' powers escalate as he launches himself in the air and energized a critical energy discharge at him, gaining the upper hand by flying towards him and dragging him through the compound. Pinning Carapax to the ground and vengefully striking him, while also forcibly ripping his enemy's helmet off, Jaime ignores Khaji-Da's warnings that he was losing control as he furiously recalled to Carapax of what he said in their last battle. With the OMAC neutralized and its user vulnerable, Reyes attempted to make the killing blow on Carapax, but was stopped by Khaji-Da at the last second, who reminded him that they weren't killers. She also told him to let Carapax live, as she reveals to Jaime that she had unlocked and accessed his memories during the transfer.\n\nKhaji-Da then showed Reyes all of Carapax's traumatic memories in reverse chronology of when he went through painful experiments with the OMAC, his days as a soldier that cost him one of his arms and legs from a landmine, when he was found, enslaved and manipulated by Victoria Kord in the past to be raised as a soldier, and especially when his mother was killed by an air strike presumably by Kord during the war back when he was a child. After witnessing Carapax's tragic memories, Jaime soon comes to reason, understanding his enemy and ultimately deciding to spare his life, setting Carapax free in reconciliation, before Jaime told him he was wrong and stating that the love for his family was actually what made him strong.\n\nReyes soon saw Jenny Kord as she destroyed the data Victoria needed to make more OMACs, and became glad to be reunited with her. Despite Victoria Kord's orders to Carapax to kill Reyes, Carapax lets Jaime and Jenny run, with Jaime staying to watch as Carapax sacrificed himself to kill Kord by overloading his system. Jaime escapes the impeding explosion, jumping to the Bug Ship with Rudy on board, who survived the ordeal, where he was grabbed and saved by Jenny Kord, helping him inside and flying out. Inside the ship, a moved Jaime hugged his family and Kord.[1]\n\nThe Reyes family returned to the ashes of their home, dressed in mourning for the death of Alberto Reyes, cheering a saddened Rudy, emotional to see the neighbors come to help, with whom they shared a barbecue. While Jaime was discussing with his family to repair the house, they received a visit from Jenny Kord, who informed them that Kord Industries was in charge of repairing the house, with Jaime asking Rudy to be thankful to Jenny for buying him a car.\n\nAs Jenny had to leave, Jaime accompanied her, asking when he would see her again, with Jenny explaining that she wanted to go back to the Kord Estate to see her mother's paintings, Jaime offered to take her, complimenting Jenny, with whom he shared a kiss. Activating his suit, Jaime smiled as he watched his family celebrating his engagement, grabbing Jenny and flying her to the Estate.[1]\n\nBeing the first in his family to graduate college, Reyes harbors dreams of law school, but got conflicted in the face of threats to his home and misfortunes befalling his family, feeling guilty for not having been there to help them, and criticizing big companies buying the city, driving up the cost of houses on their way. Reyes was a gentleman to Jenny Kord, trying to defend her from her aunt's threats, with Jenny liking him by seeking to get him a job, but despite everything, Reyes was hesitant to contact her, feeling unsure of himself, thinking that everything was out of his reach, but being motivated by his supportive family.\n\nAfter being chosen and kidnapped by Khaji-Da, Reyes was very confused by what happened, rebelling with his mother when she did not allow him to go find Jenny Kord for answers, and receiving anger from his uncle Rudy after the car was destroyed. As a superhero, Reyes took a no-kill policy with Khaji-Da, stating that they were not meant to be killed as shown by requesting not to kill Ignacio Carapax in their first showdown, and during the course of his adventure, Reyes fell in love with Jenny Kord.\n\nReyes fell into frustration and remorse upon discovering that they could not remove the scarab from his body, being comforted by his uncle Rudy who claimed to believe that the scarab was a gift from the universe and he had to tell him what to do with it, encouraging him to be a superhero, taking a sense of responsibility with his powers. When his family was ambushed by Victoria Kord, Reyes arrived to save them, breaking down in tears as he watched his father die from Carapax without being able to do anything about it.\n\nIn their reunion in the afterlife, Reyes was moved by being able to talk with his father, who motivated him to fight and save his family, making him understand Jaime's purpose as a hero, and to find the answers by having confidence in himself. After Carapax tried to kill his uncle Rudy and provoked him by saying that his love for his family made him weak, an infuriated and grieving Jaime unleashed all his repressed rage on him, trying to kill him in revenge for all the damage and torment done to him and his family.\n\nJust when he was about to kill Carapax, Jaime is stopped by Khaji-Da who tells him they aren't killers, and he soon enters into reason when Khaji-Da convinced him not to kill him by making him understand through the memories that Carapax suffered post-traumatic stress due to the war and had also tragically lost his mother, just like how Jaime lost his father. Jaime then reconciled with Carapax while letting him know that it was the love for his family was actually what made him strong. Jaime hugged his family emotionally after surviving the battle, and soon enters into an engagement with Jenny Kord.",
