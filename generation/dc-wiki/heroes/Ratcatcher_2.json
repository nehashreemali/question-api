  "content": "Cleo Cazo, also known as Ratcatcher 2, is the daughter and protégée of the original Ratcatcher. Under his guidance, she turned to a life of crime, while being aided by an army of small rodents which she can communicate with and control. After being arrested, she became a member of the second Task Force X strike team sent to Corto Maltese, where she formed a close relationship with Bloodsport. Cleo played a major role in Starro's defeat by calling all the rats in the city to enter in the alien monster's eye and eat its organs, killing it.\n\nCleo Cazo was born in Portugal and raised by her father. Despite her father's drug problems, he gave his daughter a lot of love and taught her that if rats, the most helpless creatures in the world, had a purpose they did too. Throughout her life, her father taught her to use his gadgets to control rats, getting the animals to bring her things they stole and protect them on cold winter nights. However, Ratcatcher's drug problems continued to grow and one day he died of an overdose, leaving his young daughter alone. For the next several years, Cleo continued to live on the streets with the rats until she reached adulthood.[2]\n\nUpon reaching adulthood, she tried to straighten herself out and live the \"American dream.\" However, she ended up following in her father's footsteps as a criminal, calling herself \"Ratcatcher 2,\" after her father. While a criminal, Cleo evaded the police several times and grew quite fond of one rat in particular, who she named Sebastian and treated as a pet. Unfortunately, Cleo was caught by local law enforcement after robbing a bank and sent to Belle Reve.[2]\n\nIn August 2020, following General Silvio Luna’s coup in Corto Maltese, Amanda Waller proposed Cazo to join Task Force X for a mission in the country, in exchange for reducing her sentence, with Cazo accepting, so a Nano-Bomb was injected into his neck to prevent him from fleeing. When Waller showed the team’s line-up to Bloodsport, Peacemaker and King Shark, they visited Cazo, causing her to get up from sleep, and Waller ordered her to get up and accompany them to visit Abner Krill.\n\nWith the team assembled, Waller explained the purpose of the mission, explaining the coup and how they had to destroy the prison and laboratory known as Jotunheim, leaving Cazo shaken. Waller tasked them with infiltrating the fortress of Jotunheim to destroy all evidence of the existence of the Project Starfish, not before informing them that they would first have to force Gaius Grieves to help them infiltrate. Once the session was over, Cazo asked about a broken projector, which Waller revealed to be broken.\n\nThree days later, Cazo’s team was sent to the north beach of Corto Maltese as part of a second team of Task Force X. Upon arrival, they heard several disturbances coming from a battle between a first team on the south beach, but under orders from Amanda Waller, the group continued on their path to Valle Del Mar. As they crossed the jungle, Cazo heard Bloodsport and Peacemaker discussing the team’s leadership, with Smith challenging him to swallow a bag full of penises, and Cazo questioned why someone would do that, which Smith responded sarcastically.\n\nDuBois decided that the team would camp in the jungle in the morning to reach the city. However, as she was asleep, King Shark tried to eat her, causing DuBois to attack him repeatedly to prevent it. Still sleepy, Cazo heard the other members tell her that Nanaue was going to devour her, so enraged, she summoned a group of rats, which alarmed DuBois, who had a phobia of rats. As the team argues, DuBois begs her to get rid of the rats, which she does so reluctantly. Cazo then tried to get close to Nanaue to prevent her from eating her, becoming friends with him, before going back to sleep.[2]\n\nThe next morning, Amanda Waller contacted the team tasked with rescuing Colonel Rick Flag, who had allegedly been kidnapped. The squad traveled several kilometers to reach the location of Flag, where Peacemaker, observing Flag’s captors, said he would enjoy starting the day with a massacre, mistaking Cazo for thinking he was fighting for peace, but Smith revealed to treasure peace no matter how many people he had to kill, making Cazo exclaim that she believed that Abner Krill was the only madman.\n\nWhen her teammates began to cruelly murder the captors, Cazo used her rats to distract one of them, allowing Smith to murder several of them. The team eventually found Flag conversing with Sol Soria, the leader of the Maltese Resistance that opposed the regime of Silvio Luna. Despite the squad killing his men, Soria agreed to help them by providing disguises to infiltrate La Gatita Amable and kidnap Gaius Grieves.\n\nTo enter Valle Del Mar, Soria first agreed to find Milton, a contact of his who would help them. In the middle of the road, Abner Krill began to suffer a swelling of multicolored moles on his face, so the rest of the squad asked about his condition, with this explaining that his mother had experimented with him with an interdimensional virus, Cazo then asked her about her mother, and Krill only claimed to \"see her everywhere\".[2]\n\nIn the night, Bloodsport found Milton after rescuing him from a group of soldiers, so all the team assembled in his van to arrange the mission, where Sol Soria provided clothes for them to go undercover to La Gatita Amable, but King Shark, wanting to go with a fake mustache, began to complain vulgarly when his teammates joked with him, so Sebastian approached DuBois, which Cazo took as a kind gesture, however, DuBois continued to reject it.\n\nOn the bus, Cleo asked DuBois why he was afraid of rats, where he retorts by asking why she loved them, as she then revealed her upbringing, living homeless on the streets of Portugal. Sympathizing with her, DuBois told her about how her past reminded him of his daughter's, telling her that when he was a kid, his father locked him in a crate full of starving rats. Bonding with each other, they make a mutual pact to keep each other safe.\n\nSoon after, they arrived at a bar the Thinker frequented, where they pass the time by drinking and dancing. Eventually, the Thinker arrived, and DuBois successfully took him hostage. Before they can leave however, the Corto Maltese military showed up, asking for ID's. Realizing the military is onto them, so he gave Thinker and his gun to Cleo and Abner, telling them to escape out the back and meet at the shared coordinates. He, along with Flag and Peacemaker, then turn themselves in, giving Cleo and Abner time to escape.\n\nPanicked, Cleo leaded Abner and Thinker out the back, where they meet up with Milton. On the way, the Thinker complemented her Rat Communicator, mentioning he was working on a similar invention with humans, but she did not want to hear it. Indignant, Thinker called her out for her increasingly anxious state, deducing that she was not her team's leader, which angered her enough to threaten him, making him back down.[2]\n\nHowever, upon arriving the truck, Cazo noticed that Nanaue had escaped, worried, Cazo ordered Abner Krill to supervise Thinker while she went to find Nanaue, allowing him to shoot him if he moved. Outside the van, Cazo found a toy airplane in the mud, so she activated her Rat Communicator to call the rats and ask for their help. The rats began searching around the neighborhood, with one of them pointing out to Cazo that they had found Nanaue.\n\nCazo went up the stairs towards the rat's direction, finding Nanaue's tracks, becoming desperate when he heard screams. However, Cazo found Nanaue playing with two children with toys, when he invited her to play, she refused, taking him back to the team. Upon returning, Cazo heard a gunshot from the van, running to see what happened, discovering that Krill had shot Thinker in the ear, with the latter being exalted.[3] She and the others later meet Dubois, Flag, and Peacemaker outside the city where they had crashed the convoy.\n\nHaving discovered that Harley Quinn was still alive, Rick Flag devised a plan with the team to rescue her from captivity, however, when Cazo and the others were ready in their positions, Flag discovered that Quinn had escaped on her own, so the mission was cancelled. The Task Force X then assembled Thinker to force him to help them infiltrate, but when he claimed that there were security cameras throughout the building, Cazo revealed that she had taken care of it with her rats, which had disconnected the wires.[2]\n\nUpon arriving in Jotunheim, Cazo accompanied Flag and Grieves to the Project Starfish facilities on the building’s basement. There, the duo were horrified to observe the various possessed victims of Grieves' experiments, who then revealed the truth of their mission, destroying evidence of United States’s involvement with Starro’s experiments, an alien creature that was subdued by Grieves since she was locked up in Jotunheim. Frightened, Cazo was surprised by one of Starro’s arms.\n\nAngered by the government’s lies, Flag quickly grabbed the hard drive containing the evidence, hoping to expose it, before being stopped by Peacemaker. However, the bombs the rest of the team had planted imploded prematurely, causing the building to begin to collapse. Seeking to get the hard drive into the hands of the press, Flag was finely forcibly killed by Smith, while a frightened Cazo took the hard drive to escape, but Smith was able to reach her. Begging him not to kill her, Bloodsport suddenly arrived to stop him and shoot him with a bullet, supposedly killing Smith.[2]\n\nCazo reunited terrified with Bloodsport to give him the hard drive, until, due to the destruction of Jotunheim, Starro emerged from the rubble, so the team was quickly forced to flee, as Starro began releasing spores to control the Corto Maltese Armed Forces' minds, heading to Valle Del Mar to wreak havoc. With the mission accomplished, Amanda Waller ordered them to retreat, despite the damage Starro was causing. However, DuBois' courage to disobey Waller motivated Cazo and the team to follow him to stop Starro.\n\nBefore killing them with the Nano-Bombs, Waller was arrested, so John Economos and Emilia Harcourt guided Task Force X to Starro’s location. The team soon began to be overwhelmed by Starro’s power, so in a desperate attempt, Cazo used her Rat Communicator, but was quickly protected by DuBois from being hit by Starro. After Starro exclaims that the city belonged to him, Cazo summoned an army of rats to subdue Starro, as he remembered in tears her father's words about how rats had a purpose like them, as Starro’s organs were devoured by the rats.\n\nCazo cried over Abner Krill’s remains, who had been killed by Starro, holding a piece of his suit, until King Shark appeared in front of the team after being hit by Starro against a building, so Cazo happily ran to him to hug him. Later, a helicopter sent by Amanda Waller arrived at the city, where Cazo and the rest of the team boarded to return home, after DuBois got their freedom. After the helicopter picks them up, the team finally catches a breath, with Ratcather leaning into Nanuae and sleeping.[2]\n\nUnlike most of the Squad, Cleo is not a hardened and violent criminal, rather a sweet, empathetic, and endearing young woman, but completely out of her element as a member of the Suicide Squad. She sees the good in everyone, and attempts to make friends with them, even dangerous serial killers like King Shark and the Peacemaker. Because of her innocent demeanor and empathetic nature, Cleo tends to panic easily when suddenly thrown into a dangerous situation. She also seems to be afraid of violence, and prefers to have her rats fight for her. Her most defining trait however, is her apathetic laziness, as she tends to get tired easily and sleeps whenever she gets the chance.\n\nShe, however, is entirely capable of threatening and reacting aggressive if someone she cares about is threatened or in danger by others, like when she angrily used her technology to threaten Nanaue when he insinuated to eat Sebastian, but she quickly forgives him after becoming friends with him. Cleo is also a little bit naive, believing that she and her teammates were sent to Corto Maltese to destroy the Project Starfish in order to stop the Thinker and save the world.\n\nCleo is fond of rats, having one as her own pet. This is mostly related to her bond with her father who told Cleo that if rats have their own purpose then they also have one. This also due to how she views herself at the eyes of society. Cleo dislikes seeing people being killed, quickly turning around to not watch the recording of the Herrera family being publicly hanged. Also, despite being a member of the Suicide Squad, Cleo has noble intentions with people, telling Flag that they had to save those who were used by Starro as part of the project.",
