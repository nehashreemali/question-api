  "content": "Arthur Curry is the King of Atlantis, the firstborn son of Atlanna, the older maternal half-brother of Orm Marius, the husband of Mera, the father of Arthur Curry Jr., and a member of the Justice League, as well as the superhero known to the world as the Aquaman.\n\nDuring his childhood in Amnesty Bay, Maine, he was secretly trained by his vizier and mentor Nuidis Vulko in hand-to-hand combat and gifted with his mother's trident as a blessing. While he was initially reserved and content with his self-imposed isolation from both the surface world and Atlantis, which was primarily due to his mother's forced abandonment of him and his father Tom Curry as a child by Orm's father Orvax, Aquaman would eventually be sought and recruited by Batman to join the newly formed Justice League in order to help defend Earth against the alien forces of Steppenwolf and his Parademon army, despite being reluctant to get involved at first.\n\nFollowing his recruitment to the team, Arthur played a pivotal role in reviving Superman a year after the latter's death at the hands of the monstrous Doomsday. With the Justice League now fully assembled, Aquaman contributed considerably into driving back Steppenwolf, even severely injuring the latter with his trident, forcing the failed alien invasion into hasty retreat.\n\nRoughly a year later, Arthur reluctantly decided to finally pursue his rightful place in Atlantis when Orm threatens the surface world with untold catastrophe – after traveling across the globe in a journey of self-discovery, he retrieved the legendary Trident of Atlan from the depths of the Hidden Sea with the help of his newfound love interest Mera and his long lost mother Atlanna, and defeated his half-brother Orm in a climatic battle, mercifully sparing Orm's life and finally becoming the rightful King of Atlantis at last while embracing the Aquaman moniker, though in the process of accomplishing this he also inadvertently created a new and dangerous villain hellbent on his destruction: the bloodthirsty pirate Black Manta.\n\nAquaman and the Justice League traveled to the Coverdale Ranch on the behest of Amanda Waller to help the 11th Street Kids stop the Butterflies along with the Cow, but they arrived far too late to assist, and the new heroes were the ones who stopped the invasion as Peacemaker mocks him in particular about nasty rumors. In the midst of his duty as a superhero and king, Curry alongside Flash and Wonder Woman defeated Charybdis and the Aquamarines, marrying Mera and discovering that she was pregnant, giving birth to their son, whom he began to raise while fulfilling his role as king, entering in bitter conflict with the Council of Atlantis over their lack of interest in the throne and contamination by the surface.\n\nDealing with his conflict as king, Atlantis was attacked by his newfound nemesis Black Manta, who used the Black Trident to seek revenge against him. Seeking a way to stop the theft of Orichalcum and prevent the planet's destruction, Curry had to free Orm Marius from the Kingdom of the Deserters, forming a temporary alliance. After the kidnapping of his son Arthur Curry Jr., Curry and his allies headed to Necrus to confront the Manta Men and prevent the arrival of King Kordax, destroying the Black Trident and defeating Black Manta with the timely help of Marius. After making peace with Marius and saving his son, Curry revealed Atlantis to the world to join forces and protect the planet from contamination.\n\nArthur Curry was born in Amnesty Bay, Maine, to Thomas Curry, a lighthouse keeper, and Atlanna, the queen of Atlantis. When Arthur was only three years old[1], their home was attacked by royal guards, who were sent to bring Atlanna back so that she could marry King Orvax. While Atlanna managed to fight them off, she realized she had to return to her home and leave him and his father to keep them both safe. Before she left, she imparted Arthur her trident as her legacy, believing him to be the key to uniting the Atlanteans and humans one day.[2][3]\n\nOne day, when his school went on a field trip to the Boston Aquarium in Massachusetts, Arthur was confronted by two bullies for seemingly talking to the animals in the tank. However, when Arthur cried out, a shark came to his aid, slamming against the tank hard enough for a large crack to form. The crowd around stood back as the remaining animals surrounded Arthur. When he turned, his eyes had changed color, glowing golden.[2]\n\nThis heritage caused Arthur to grow up with incredible powers, including the ability to breathe underwater. However, Arthur's ignorance regarding how to handle these Atlantean powers induced him to become very conflicted, and somewhat reserved, with internal struggles.[4]\n\nWhen he was 13[1], Arthur was dared by his friends to swim down into a shipwreck. Arthur then swam down and explored a section of it. But then he found himself stuck inside. After a few seconds, he realized that he was probably drowning and proceeded to black out.\n\nAfter awakening, Arthur realized he could breathe underwater. It was there that he noticed a man swimming above him known as Nuidis Vulko.[5] He introduced himself as the Chief Advisor to the King of Atlantis, who began to train him in unlocking his Atlantean abilities so that one day, Arthur could take his place as the rightful ruler of Atlantis.[1]\n\nLex Luthor, in pursuit of proving the existence of extraordinary individuals hidden amongst the general population, discovered Arthur's existence by hacking into the NSA's database and retrieving footage from two UUV drones, which recorded a video of Arthur emerging from a shipwreck in the Pacific Ocean near Tonga.\n\nFootage from one drone showed Aquaman emerging from the shadows, and then aiming his trident and quickly destroying it while another recorded him swimming away from the site, causing an underwater sonic boom in his wake.[6]\n\nAfter Task Force X successfully defeated the mystical duo of Enchantress and Incubus in Midway City and saved her, Amanda Waller met up with billionaire Bruce Wayne, asking him to take care of the rumors following the aftermath of the calamitous events, and in exchange, she gave Bruce her files on Arthur Curry, referring to the information as 'crown jewels'.[7]\n\nArthur was visited by Bruce Wayne in Iceland, who had eventually tracked him down using files given to him by Amanda Waller.[7] Bruce arrived during the winter, during which time Arthur brought fish to feed the hungry, always coming into town on the king tide. On the day afterwards, Bruce asked the village's council if he could speak with Arthur, whom he deduced was still around.\n\nWhen Arthur revealed himself to be there, he demanded Bruce talk, during which he informed Arthur that an impending threat was coming to the world, asking Arthur to join the newly founded Justice League under his leadership. Initially, Arthur refused to become involved with, and risk his life for, a group of strangers. He responded with hostility when Bruce refused to leave proceeding to pin Bruce against the wall in an attempt to intimidate him.\n\nHowever, he decided to hear Bruce out, where the latter disclosed that he was Batman. Afterwards, while Arthur was beginning to depart back to the ocean, he remarked that, \"the strong man is strongest alone.\"[8]\n\nArthur rescued a sailor caught in a storm, taking him to a bar where he deposited him on a table and ordered himself a drink. He told the bartender that the man was paying for the wine and that he should respect the storm the next time he was going out. Arthur drank the entire bottle and jumped back into the ocean and headed toward overgrown ruins. There, he came across a statue of the King Atlan and his mythical trident.\n\nVulko then appeared behind him, carrying the trident Arthur had discarded years ago along with a piece of armor, expressing his dissatisfaction on Arthur's continued rejection of his Atlantean royal duties and reminded Arthur that he never slept in the same place wise, though chose to return to the statue. Vulko brought news of darkness coming to Earth and its forces kidnapping Atlanteans, with King Orm blaming the surface for these actions.\n\nVulko suspected they were looking for one of the Mother Boxes given responsibility of being guarded by the Atlanteans. Vulko offered Arthur his mother's trident and asked him to protect the Box, but Arthur backed away. Vulko then angrily threw the trident on the floor in front of Arthur and mentioned he could not run away from his responsibility, before leaving.[8]\n\nArthur decided to investigate Vulko's claims on the imminent attack on the Mother Box stronghold. There, he encountered the New God Steppenwolf, who was about to cut down Mera, but was stopped by Arthur. He initially managed to get an upper hand against Steppenwolf, but was knocked out, with the Mother Box snatched by the New God.\n\nWith the Mother Box in the hands of Steppenwolf, Arthur is about to leave, but Mera convinced a reluctant Arthur to listen to her. Arthur shows his bitterness at his mother for leaving him, mockingly saying \"what a saint\" when Mera noted Atlanna took her in and simply refers to how he believed he was abandoned by his mother without a second thought from the Queen of Atlantis, but Mera revealed to Arthur how much it hurt his mother, too, left him behind and she only did it to save his life.\n\nClearly affected, Arthur was finally convinced to retrieve the Mother Box from Steppenwolf when Mera noted how he is no longer a defenseless child and it is what his mother would've done, but with her gone, it was now his responsibility. His change of heart caused Arthur to finally make up his mind and take up the armor and weapon Vulko was offering before going after Steppenwolf.[8]\n\nAfter an intense fight with the team of heroes and having lost some of his Parademon minions, Steppenwolf, annoyed by the heroes' intervention, managed to catch one of the missiles in mid-air, shot by Cyborg who was piloting the Knightcrawler, redirecting it to the wall, leaving its structure weak, and releasing all the water above.\n\nAs Gotham Harbor was flooding with Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, and Cyborg inside, Aquaman arrived just in time to save the group by using the trident's powers to slow down the tide allowing the others to get to the safety of the higher ground. As soon as everyone was safe, Victor left to retrieve the last Mother Box.\n\nAfter the fight with Steppenwolf, Batman met with Gordon before Aquaman showed up and said that Steppenwolf took the Mother Box from Atlantis, then Cyborg revealed that he is in possession of the final Mother Box, which he hid from his father. Aquaman then decided to be a member of the Justice League.[8]\n\nCurry and the team arrived at the Wayne Aerospace Hangar with the Mother Box, questioning Victor Stone's powers as allegiance to Steppenwolf, but Stone tells him and the team the whole story, changing Curry's mind. With all the possibilities the Mother Box could cause, the team decides to resurrect Superman, in order to stop Steppenwolf, though Curry feared of the dangers that would arrive. While digging Superman's grave, Curry talked to Diana about the war between Amazons and Atlanteans, talking about the differences the people had back in the day. When Superman's body was unearthed, the team brought him to S.T.A.R. Labs to be resurrected.\n\nThe team put Clark's body in the waters of the Kryptonian ship. While hesitant and fearing about the dangers to come, the team still ended up using Allen's Speed Force to activate the Box, causing the resurrection of Superman. When he flies out of the Kryptonian ship and lands in Heroes Park, Aquaman, Cyborg, Flash and Wonder Woman meet him. Arthur, however, notices that something is wrong with him, with Clark using his x-ray vision to scan the League. Stone's armor's defense system launches a missile at him as it registers a threat to him. Superman attacks Cyborg with his heat vision as the rest of the Justice League try to calm him down, but he swiftly overpowers them.\n\nAs Arthur, Victor, and Diana try to flank Superman simultaneously (which was unsuccessful), Barry attempts to help with his speed but Superman is able to see him and keeps up with the speedster. Despite Barry's best efforts to avoid all of Superman's blows, a glancing hit knocked out Barry. Batman arrives and gets Superman to stop fighting the League, Aquaman and Flash attempt to halt Superman in his place, before being thrown against the stairs of the monument. Cyborg then attempts to hold back Superman, but is swiftly overpowered. Wonder Woman then tries to halt Superman, before she is bested. Superman makes it to Batman, and shoots his laser eyes at the latter's gauntlets. Lois Lane then arrives, ending the ordeal.\n\nSuperman calms down and leaves with Lois to the Kent Farm where he reflects and tries to recover his memories. Curry then points at Flash in anger, leaving Flash to apologize. After the battle, Steppenwolf arrives, chases Silas Stone through S.T.A.R. Labs, before Stone heats up the Mother Box, killing him in the process. Steppenwolf takes the Mother Box, and leaves, completing the Unity. When Cyborg says his father is dead, Curry tells the team that it is their fault that Stone was killed.\n\nThe team returns to the Batcave, meeting Alfred Pennyworth, with Curry telling Pennyworth that the place was badass. The team then developed a plan to go after Steppenwolf, using Bruce's six satellites to track the general.\n\nMeanwhile, Cyborg located the Mother Boxes near an abandoned nuclear plant in Pozharnov, Russia. The Justice League used the Flying Fox to get Russia to stop Steppenwolf from combining the Mother Boxes together and terraforming the Earth; the team planned on how they were going to stop Steppenwolf, in which Curry was simply listening to what the team was planning, though defending Cyborg after watching his father die that now wasn't the best time to send the Cyborg out to battle. Nonetheless, Curry and the team ready for battle.[8]\n\nWhen they arrived, Batman told the team that he was going to take out the tower while the rest of the League would take on Steppenwolf and separate the Mother Boxes. Batman destroyed the tower, but by crashing the Flying Fox. Batman got in the Batmobile and drove through the streets with the team by his side.\n\nThe Parademons attacked the Batmobile, ripping off one of the guns that it had an opening up the car before Wonder Woman and the rest of the League saved Batman. Aquaman jumped on the Batmobile and told Batman how insane he was for basically going on a suicide mission before getting attacked by Parademons. Bruce gives him the thumbs up, and Curry jumps onto a Parademon, which led Cyborg to save him and throwing him back into the battle. The Batmobile then got destroyed after Batman ejected from the vehicle and using his grapple, swung across to take out the Parademons, utilizing the environment around him.\n\nWonder Woman and Aquaman confronted Steppenwolf. As Flash helped Cyborg get to the Mother Boxes, he took care of the Parademons. While Cyborg tried to separate the Mother Boxes, Batman saved Flash by grappling his legs from stopping him from falling: Batman took one of the Parademons' guns and fired at them. Steppenwolf then found out that Cyborg was trying to separate the Mother Boxes, which he grabbed him before Wonder Woman had saved him.\n\nWonder Woman and Aquaman tried to keep Steppenwolf away from Cyborg by using the Lasso of Hestia to pull him down. Steppenwolf attacked them both before he knocked Aquaman into a wall, breaking the ceiling which almost crushed him until Wonder Woman came to his aid. With Aquaman and Wonder Woman down, Steppenwolf arrives and prepares to kill Cyborg.\n\nBefore Steppenwolf could kill him, Superman arrived and easily overpowered the New God. Then, Wonder Woman and Aquaman were amazed by his return when the Atlantean victoriously said \"Alright!\" Meanwhile, he and Wonder Woman began to gain the upper hand. Cyborg called for Superman to help with separating the Mother Boxes, which they managed to do with great effort.\n\nSteppenwolf attacked again, but Aquaman speared him with his trident from behind and Superman delivered a devastating punch, which knocked out towards the Boom Tube to Apokolips. Diana soon severs his head, defeating the New God. Aquaman is then seen with the rest of the superheroes confronting Darkseid before the Boom Tube closes. Later, at Amnesty Bay, Arthur greeted Vulko and Mera but coldly bade them farewell by stating that he was going to see his father, before hopping in a truck and driving away.[8]\n\nFollowing Steppenwolf's defeat, Arthur would continue to do vigilante activities across the seas, over time his exploits were made public by multiple witnesses and he was given the name \"Aquaman\" by the media, though he wasn't very fond of the name.[2] The existence of the Aquaman drew the attention of multiple pirates such as David Kane.[9] Dr. Stephen Shin became obsessed with the Aquaman as well, whom he saw as proof that Atlantis is real.[2]\n\nAbout one year later, Arthur intercepted a group of pirates attempting to hijack a submarine, he lifted the submarine into the surface and broke into it to fight the Pirates. Arthur would go through and using the submarine to his advantage, Arthur would go and free the hostages. With the hostages freed, Arthur was attacked by David Kane a member of the Pirates who identified him as the Aquaman.\n\nArthur battled David in which he gets the upper hand on David by breaking his dagger and throwing him around. Before Arthur can defeat David, Arthur is met with Jesse Kane, David's father. Shot by Jesse with a grenade launcher it would, however, leave a little effect on Arthur who got up and impaled Jesse with a pipe. Arthur then chided Jesse for setting a bad example for David before removing the pipe. While Arthur was walking away, Jesse, in rage, shot another grenade, but missed and flooded the submarine. While Arthur was escaping the submarine, David asked for help in saving his father, but Curry refused, noting that he had killed innocent people and would leave him and his father to their fate.\n\nAfter the attack on the submarine, Arthur met his father Thomas Curry at the lighthouse where the two would greet each other. They went to a bar where they celebrated. As they are watching, the news reports about the submarine that Curry saved. Arthur and Thomas would discuss Atlantis, which is interrupted by a gang who wanted photos with Arthur.[2]\n\nAs Arthur and Thomas left the bar, Curry is met by Mera who left Atlantis to find Arthur to tell him to come with her to Atlantis to stop Arthur's half-brother Orm Marius. Arthur would refuse and leave Mera as he drove home. On the way home, Arthur noticed that there was a tidal wave coming toward him which Curry tried to stop the car, but was hit by the wave. Arthur would try and find his father before he could drown, but fortunately is saved by Mera who used her powers to stop the water so Arthur could find his father. Locating Thomas, Arthur attempted to revive his father with CPR, but luckily, Mera used her hydrokinesis powers to save him from drowning.[2]\n\nArthur reluctantly accompanies Mera to Atlantis where they would meet with Nuidis Vulko, Arthur is informed about what had happened and the history of Atlantis which they needed to find the Trident of Atlan: a magical artifact that once belonged to Atlan the former king of Atlantis, in order to claim his rightful place as king. They are then suddenly ambushed by Orm's men, Arthur would hold them off while Mera and Vulko escaped, but Arthur is eventually beaten unconscious and captured by the guards sent by Orm.\n\nWhen Arthur awakes, he is chained and visited by Orm, who announces that Atlanna was executed for the crime of having a half-breed son and states he blames his half-brother and the surface for her death, which enraged Arthur to the point of pulling his chains so hard that all the royal guards barely managed to keep him still. Orm offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur instead challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava known as the Ring of Fire. Before the duel, Arthur is met by Vulko, who warns him about Orm being more experienced at underwater combat, but Arthur tells Vulko that he taught him how to fight, which Nuidis would respond by throwing a Trident which Arthur caught and threw back at him assuring him that he remembered his lessons.\n\nArthur would enter the ring of lava as Orm was waiting. Orm would once again give his half-brother the chance to live by asking him to leave Atlantis forever and never return and makes it clear that if he doesn't back down then Orm will defeat and kill him, but Arthur is not intimidated and refuses as he can't let Orm destroy the surface world. In the duel, Arthur, although putting up a good fight, is clearly pressured by his half-brother's greater experience in underwater combat and Orm repeatedly gains the upper hand, nearly killing Arthur at one point by almost forcing him in the lava and ultimately upon reaching a statue, Arthur is ultimately bested by his half-brother and his trident is broken. Now weaponless and unable to fight, Arthur is about to be killed by Orm, but Mera rescues him.[2]\n\nThe two would escape Orm and his men by hiding in a whale's mouth. Together, Arthur and Mera take a flight to the Sahara, jumping out of the plane when they arrive. The two would find and unlock a holographic message from Atlan which tells them to go to Sicily.\n\nArthur and Mera would find the location of the Trident and be ready to go until they were attacked the Black Manta and Orm's men. Initially outfighting Black Manta, Arthur realized that he was the same pirate from the submarine who tried to stab him and now seeking revenge for his father’s death. When Black Manta revealed he had acquired weapons made of Atlantean Steel, being able to injure him, Aquaman was caught off-guard and although he was still able to fight off his relentlessly brutal assault, also having to keep innocents safe from the battle made Arthur unable to focus entirely on defeating Black Manta, getting severely injured. Fortunately, Arthur was able to resist being stabbed by an Atlantean Steel made hook long enough to use it to pull him to him and proceeded to throw Black Manta with all his might away, damaging his suit. He then finally defeated him by throwing a pair of chained stone balls directly into Manta's helmet right before it fired another laser blast, which exploded throwing David Kane off a cliff. With Black Manta dealt with, Arthur realized Orm is tracking them, and Mera destroys the device, the bracelet Orm gave her.\n\n[[File:Arthur and Mera escaping the Trench.PNG|left|thumb|250px|Arthur and Mera escaping from the Trench]\nMera nursed Arthur's wounds as they journey to the trident's whereabouts and encouraged him to embrace his destiny as a hero and king. Arthur felt that the Black Manta was his own fault, as he willingly chose to let David's father die when he had the chance to save him. Mera assured Arthur that Black Manta was no longer a problem, but Arthur remained wary that it wasn't the last they'd see of him. Arriving at their destination, Arthur and Mera are attacked by a legion of amphibious monsters known as the Trench, but they managed to fend them off using torches to scare them with bright lights and reach a wormhole that transports them to the Hidden Sea located at the center of the Earth.\n\nThere, they are unexpectedly reunited with Atlanna, who was seemingly sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes but manage to escape them and reach the uncharted sea, where she had been stranded ever since.\n[[File:Aquaman in the classic costume promotional still.png|thumb|250px|Arthur becoming worthy of Atlan's trident]]\nArthur would enter the cave where he is faced with Karathen, the mythical leviathan that guards the trident, and voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface. On the cave floor lie the remains of others who had tried to claim the trident, all of whom were killed by the beast. Before Karathen could kill Arthur, he successfully used his ability to communicate with all sea life. Mollified, she allows Arthur to attempt to claim the trident, proving that he is worthy of his birthright, which grants him control over the seven seas.[2]\n\nAmidst the huge battle between the Kingdom of the Brine and Orm's forces, as Orm defeats the Brine King and is about to kill him, he is interrupted by Aquaman and Karathen bursting out of the seafloor. With his command of all sea life, Aquaman turns the Atlantean's steeds against them and summons numerous sea creatures to aid him. He shares a kiss with Mera.\n\nAquaman and Orm's final duel lead them atop an Atlantean vessel in the open air. After a lengthy battle, Aquaman shatters his half-brother's trident, but Orm remains defiant and demands his half-brother to kill him until Atlanna arrives, convincing him to surrender. The members of all kingdoms cheer and hail their new king.[2]\n\nAt some point following the battle, Arthur's new Trident and armor became known to the world at large, with the boy known as Freddy Freeman imagining a scenario wherein Arthur would be waiting for long lines of fans to get pictures taken with him.[10]\n\nA Twitter user by the name of @PepetheFrog89 claimed to work for an aquarium where, the user claimed, Aquaman would supposedly pay 50 dollars regularly to have his way with a sturgeon. Peacemaker believed the claims, repeating them to a janitor he became acquainted with.[11]\n\nIn January 2021, Aquaman, Flash, Wonder Woman, and Superman were called by Amanda Waller to assist the 11th Street Kids in the battle against the alien species known as Butterflies. The Justice League arrived at Ranch Coverdale only to be told by Peacemaker that they arrived late, and the crisis had already been solved. While leaving with his team, Peacemaker mocked Aquaman about the rumors of him having intercourse with fish which made him express his disdain for the rumor, leading Flash to jokingly say that it was not a rumor, much to his irritation.[12]\n\nInitially, Arthur Curry was a very conflicted individual, struggling with the fact that he has superhuman powers which he didn't know how to handle, but he was later trained by his mentor Nuidis Vulko. Arthur grew up feeling alienated from both the human and Atlantean worlds, feeling trapped between them, yet having the responsibility of protecting both.[4] In addition, Arthur was very bitter at his mother Atlanna for abandoning him and his father Thomas Curry. Arthur was thus somewhat gruff and reserved, unwilling to accept his place in Atlantean society, and also unwilling to accept Bruce Wayne's offer to join the Justice League at first, as well as getting annoyed with the young and quirky Flash.[4] Surely, Arthur had previously reached an emotional rock bottom during this period in his life, even claiming that he had no concern for the ocean, and by extension, his own people.\n\nArthur hides his insecurities and troubled past behind a tough intimidating attitude, choosing to alienate himself from others and almost never showing any sympathy towards anyone. However, he can be more relaxed and friendly around those he trusts and is close to, such as his father and Mera.\n\nDespite his somewhat gloomy and fearsome exterior, however, Arthur is ultimately a selfless and compassionate person, indicated by him frequenting an Icelandic fishing village during the winter in order to feed its hungry inhabitants with fish. He is later seen saving an unconscious fisherman found along the shore, bringing him into the shelter of a local pub in the village. However, he casually shrugged it off by stating that his drinks would be on the fisherman. He also notably made it his priority to keep the innocent civilians of Sicily out of harm's way when fighting Black Manta. Arthur also showed compassion towards his half-brother Orm, whom he refused to kill despite the multiple atrocious actions Orm had committed. He also showed guilt over letting David Kane's father die and leading him to become the Black Manta.\n\nWhen confronted by Mera, Aquaman initially pushes back against her reprimands, but upon learning that his mother Atlanna did not abandon him of her own free will, he begins to have a change of heart. After being unable to stop Steppenwolf from retrieving the Atlanteans' Mother Box, Arthur's mind is finally made up and he joins the Justice League. He still clashes with Batman, Flash, and Cyborg a few times, but otherwise gets along with the team fairly well, eventually befriending them.\n\nArthur, while outwardly very serious, occasionally demonstrates a dry sense of humor, notably complimenting Batman on the latter's vigilante suit. When failing to intimidate Bruce due to the latter's profound experience in intimidation tactics, Arthur quickly drops his façade, revealing his laid-back and charming self. While he initially distrusted the isolated Cyborg (suspecting that he could be working with the enemy, due to his Apokoliptian cybernetics), Aquaman gradually developed a friendship with him as well, seen when Cyborg assisted him in taking down a group of airborne Parademons. Aquaman is also somewhat of a realist, recognizing that he and the other Justice Leaguers could very well die in a battle against the New God Steppenwolf, and agreeing with Wonder Woman that resurrecting Superman with a Mother Box is too risky.\n\nDespite his gruff appearance and devil-may-care approach to battle, Arthur is quite intelligent and introspective, notably when he quotes Friedrich Schiller's William Tell to Bruce when asked to join the League, stating that 'the strong man is strongest alone', thus further emphasizing his preferred isolation from the surface world, and later quoting Jules Verne when describing the extreme unlikelihood of his parents' successful relationship. When bound by the Lasso of Hestia, Aquaman reveals that deep down, he is very grateful for the team's acceptance, and even developed a crush on Wonder Woman, despite the Atlanteans having once warred against the Amazons. Arthur, upon his release, became dismayed upon realizing the circumstances of his confession and angrily forbade Flash from ever sharing it with anyone.\n\nArthur is clearly a thrill-seeker who enjoys adventuring, displayed when he enthusiastically slew Parademons alongside the Justice League and when he was introduced to his homeworld of Atlantis. He'll often employ words such as \"badass\" and \"awesome\" to describe his experiences, and even whooping in excitement when he jumped after Mera from a cargo plane without a parachute.\n\nHybrid Physiology: Due to his half-Atlantean high-born maternal heritage, Aquaman has incredible superhuman abilities, that surpass most other Atlanteans, deemed as the most developed traits of all Atlanteans, with only other high-born Atlanteans equaling his genetic attributes. He is also one of the most powerful members of the Justice League, only surpassed by Superman and Wonder Woman. He is also the only member to technically be \"both a human and a god.\"[13] Newspapers collected by Doctor Stephen Shin refer to Aquaman as the \"underwater Superman.\"",
