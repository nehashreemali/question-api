  "content": "Richard \"Rick\" Rogers Flag, Jr. was a U.S. Army colonel, special operations forces specialist, and the field leader of the A.R.G.U.S. affiliated strike team Task Force X. In 2016, he was recruited by Amanda Waller to lead Task Force X and a team of Navy SEALS in a high-risk operation to defeat the wicked siblings Enchantress and Incubus. The mission proved successful, and Flag remained as the Squad's field leader and being happily reunited with his lover June Moone, the former unwitting host of Enchantress.\n\nIn 2020, Flag led a new incarnation of the Squad on a mission to Corto Maltese to destroy a Nazi-Era fortress known as Jotunheim, along with the dangerous Project Starfish. Upon reaching the island, Flag and the team had to face the soldiers of Corto Maltese, but most of the team died in battle. Flag fled into the jungle where he encountered a rebel group against Silvio Luna led by Sol Soria, which he joined.\n\nFlag joined the new Task Force X team to get to Jotunheim successfully. Flag intended to reveal the whole truth about the alien creature Starro, but was killed in a brutal brawl by Peacemaker, who was secretly working with Waller to protect the files, mockingly proclaiming Peacemaker as a joke before succumbing to his fatal injuries.\n\nRichard \"Rick\" Rogers Flag, Jr. was born in Washington, D.C., being the son of Richard \"Rick\" Rogers Flag Sr., a decorated war veteran. In high school, Flag met a young woman named Marsha Lane. During a winter break from school, Flag worked as a messenger in Midway City, where he met and had a relationship with a girl named Emily Spiegel.[2]\n\nAfter graduating, Flag, with a great sense of patriotism, entered the United States Military Academy and later graduated as a soldier. Flag entered the United States Armed Forces, where he managed to reach the rank of Colonel with multiple awards, and being named as the best officer that the country has ever produced.[3]\n\nDuring a mission to the Qurac nation to defeat Avral Kaddam, Flag met and befriended Robert DuBois. According to DuBois, Flag proved that no one could \"take a bone out of his mouth\" as he had intense plans that were hard to ignore. Likewise, with DuBois' experience, Flag was impressed with his abilities.[4]\n\nAt some point, Flag met Japanese samurai assasin Tatsu Yamashiro, aka Katana, with whom he formed an alliance after a mission in which he was apparently impressed by the power of Yamashiro's sword. Grateful to Flag, Tatsu agreed to become his bodyguard to protect him.[3]\n\nSometime later, Flag was recruited by A.R.G.U.S. Director Amanda Waller to track down Dr. June Moone. Flag eventually made it to the building where she was being held with a special team, but when they arrived they discovered that the doctor was possessed by a being known as the Enchantress.\n\nFlag helped Moone by taking her to A.R.G.U.S. for monitoring. For a time, they began to fall in love progressively becoming lovers, which Waller took advantage of to manipulate the couple, forcing Flag to be the field leader of Task Force X, a team of criminals recruited by Waller to defend the nation.[3]\n\nIn an attempt to present the project to the United States Government, Amanda Waller went to the Pentagon accompanied by Flag, June Moone, Dexter Tolliver, and Admiral Mackenzie Olsen. There, Moone presented the idea to President Edwards, explaining it as a project of metahuman criminals to protect the country. Waller requested a demonstration of power from Moone, which she reluctantly agreed to, although Flag comforted her moments before her presentation.\n\nMoone allowed herself to be possessed by Enchantress, demonstrating her power potential by bringing back files from the vault in Iran. After this, Waller ordered Flag to take her with him, which he complied with. Edwards approved the project to be used in case of supernatural emergencies.[3]\n\nIn order to convince Waller's decision of the team's structure, Flag was forced by Waller to agree in forcing June Moone to transform into Enchantress and task her with looking into the histories of the most prominent members. Flag met with Waller at a helicopter station, and despite Flag's displeasure, Waller insisted on speaking with June Moone, Rick Flag then went to Moone to tell her of Waller's arrival and Moone tried to resist, but was threatened by Waller.\n\nUpon being summoned, the Enchantress used sorcery to glimpse the past, and revealed the secret lives of Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang and Katana, mentioning that Katana was the most suitable candidate. The Enchantress warned them that it was cruel to use the candidates despite everything they suffered, making Flag think but Waller did not care and forced her to transform back into June Moone. Rick Flag helped a weakened Moone to get up, while Waller asked Flag to put everything in order, convincing herself of her candidates.[5]\n\nDays later, Amanda Waller, Flag, and June Moone traveled to Belle Reve Federal Penitentiary in Louisiana to meet and recruit some of the inmates who would join Task Force X. They were greeted by guard Hunter Griggs, who greeted Flag, although he told him to kiss Waller's ass as she was in charge.\n\nFlag headed to the prison sewers, where inmate Waylon Jones, aka Killer Croc, was being held, a metahuman with a skin peculiarity that makes him resemble a crocodile. Jones asked him if he wasn't afraid of him, but he asked why he was put in the sewers, to which Jones replied that he had wanted it that way. Flag and Waller then went to the pyrokinetic criminal Chato Santana, aka El Diablo, offering him a good life for accepting, which Santana flatly denied, believing that he had already caused too much damage.\n\nLater, the two arrived with the criminal Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot, an expert marksman with perfect aim, tied to handcuffs and guarded by guards. Flag ordered him to be released, and then showed him a table full of firearms, in order to see how perfect his aim was. However, he pointed the gun at Griggs to prove that the gun had real bullets.\n\nLawton finally fired into the air and began shooting at targets, demonstrating his marksmanship and surprising Waller, Flag and Griggs. After giving his demonstration, Lawton told them that the only thing he would do to accept their deal would be his release, custody and education of his daughter, Zoe Lawton, although Flag told him that he was in no position to sue. Upon hearing this, Lawton replied that he was not talking to him, but to Waller.\n\nDisgusted by Waller's idea of ​​recruiting criminals, Flag had a serious argument with Waller about using them, telling her that she could have a better team with special forces soldiers. However, Waller warned him that she was doing this for a possible World War III, and that Moone would still be tied to Enchantress, once again manipulating him into obeying her.[3]\n\nLater, Flag and June Moone checked into a hotel. In their room, Enchantress summoned herself and transported Flag into a vision of Moone's death. Suddenly, Enchantress transported herself into Amanda Waller's room and released her brother Incubus into Midway City. Enchantress returned to the room, and Flag was shocked by this again. Moone, who had returned to normal, tearfully begged him to end Enchantress' life if necessary, even though it would kill her.\n\nIncubus created unrest in the city, causing Waller to send Flag and Moone to the city's train terminal, where Incubus was located. Flag gave Moone a detonator to activate as Enchantress. However, she escaped Flag's custody to reunite with her brother and plan an attack. Because of this, the government decided to activate Waller's Task Force X to attack Incubus and Enchantress.[3]\n\nFlag was transported to Midway City Airport with his special forces team. There, the team's prisoner recruits arrived, including Harley Quinn, Deadshot, El Diablo, Killer Croc, Slipknot, and Captain Boomerang, who upon arriving punched a guard, causing Flag to restrain him to calm him down.\n\nAfter this, Flag explained to the criminals the rules of the mission. If they disobeyed him, tried to escape or made him angry, a nano-bomb in their heads would detonate, ending their lives. Flag gave them some time to prepare their things for the fight, and then had a small discussion with Deadshot, who tried to teach him how to give a good motivation.\n\nAfter the team prepared, Flag showed them a video of Amanda Waller to explain the details about the mission in Midway City and after the message, Flag accepted that they are now a Suicide Squad and together with the team he entered the plane and before leaving he introduced Katana and communicated with her so that she would not kill his allies as they left for Midway City.\n\nUpon arriving at Midway City, he and the squad witnessed the helicopter explode and began to walk through the streets to find HVT1 and Flag understood that HVT1 was actually Waller, but kept it a secret. As they walked, Flag watched as Slipknot tried to escape and had no choice but to use the nano-bombs to kill Slipknot by exploding his head and warned the rest that the same will happen to them if they betray him again and continued walking.[3]\n\nAs they walked, Flag found remnants of destruction and threatened Deadshot to kill him if he runs away and they were attacked by creatures working for Enchantress known as the Eyes of the Adversary and they faced the creatures. While facing them, Flag wanted to prove to Deadshot that he can have their trust by showing his skills attacking the creatures and Flag was going to be killed but was saved by Harley Quinn and Edwards as they continued the confrontation.\n\nEveryone continued to fight the creatures and Flag realized that they weren't actually creatures but a team that was sent to investigate and were turned into Eyes of the Adversary by Enchantress. Flag got angry at Deadshot for attacking alone and was shocked that he managed to kill all the Eyes of the Adversary. Flag and the squad continued walking as Deadshot and Flag talked about team leadership.[3]\n\nEntering the building, Flag and the squad inspected the place and were once again attacked by another horde of Eyes of the Adversary and got angry at Harley Quinn for leaving without doing anything in an elevator. Flag and the others angrily found Harley Quinn and threatened to kill her if she does such a thing again. Flag and the others fought the creatures again and was about to be killed by the Eyes of the Adversary but was saved by his team as they fought the creatures together. After finishing off all the Eyes of the Adversary, Flag and the squad continued walking to reach the place where the HVT1 was located.\n\nFlag and the squad arrived and discovered that HVT1 was actually Amanda Waller and Flag revealed that he had information that it was her and they obtained Enchantress' heart to kill her and they kept walking to find Enchantress and take Waller to safety. As they walked, Flag and Deadshot agreed that Waller is an evil woman. Upon reaching the roof, Flag and his allies were ambushed by the Joker and his gang. Flag tried to activate the button to explode Harley Quinn's head but couldn't because it was disabled and he saw Harley Quinn get on the helicopter and witnessed how Waller ordered the helicopter to be destroyed. After this, Flag and the others took Waller safely on their helicopter and continued with the mission.[3]\n\nFlag and the squad found Harley Quinn alive and realized that the helicopter containing Amanda Waller went down and believed that she died as they kept walking except for Deadshot who stayed behind to investigate Waller's files. Flag saw Deadshot angrily throw the files away and ordered Flag to tell the truth and with no other choice Flag revealed that June Moone was possessed by Enchantress and the witch took Moone's body because of her and also said that his efforts would not be revealed, angering the squad, and everyone went to a bar to drown their sorrows.\n\nFlag entered the bar to reveal to the squad that they are now free since he defused the bombs, but the only one who left was Captain Boomerang. Flag gave Deadshot the letters that Zoe Lawton wrote to him every day and Deadshot gratefully promised Flag that he will help him get Moone back and end all the chaos as Flag regrouped the squad including Captain Boomerang to take down Enchantress.[3]\n\nBefore reaching Enchantress's lair, Flag gave Killer Croc a detonator to support the soldiers in placing it to kill Enchantress. Flag, Deadshot, El Diablo and Harley Quinn began to have visions for Enchantress and Flag's was to have a normal life with June Moone, but they were saved thanks to El Diablo and arrived at the lair to confront her, but first they had to face her brother Incubus. Flag and Deadshot shot at the beast, but the attacks were useless and they learned that the detonator was already ready and watched with the squad as El Diablo faced Incubus and Flag on El Diablo's orders, warned that they should activate the detonator as El Diablo took Incubus nearby and both exploded, dying.\n\nAfter seeing El Diablo sacrifice himself, the squad observed Enchantress and Flag tried to attack her without success as Enchantres was still trying to convince them to join her and she would give them what they always wanted. Flag got angry because he believed that Harley Quinn was going to join her, but they were surprised to see how Harley Quinn used Katana's sword to damage Enchantress and Flag along with the squad had time to attack her. Flag attacked her many times and warned Killer Croc to throw the detonator at Enchantress, making her explode while Deadshot gave the coup de grace, defeating Enchantress.\n\nFlag was happy how they managed to succeed and went to give Deadshot a happy hug, thanking him for the shot, but Deadshot mentioned that he doesn't like hugs. He approached Enchantress angrily because he wanted Moone back, but Enchantress replied that she no longer existed so Flag took the heart and broke it in two, angrily killing Enchantress. Flag began to mourn Moone's death, but Deadshot warned him to see something important which was that Moone managed to survive and get out of the possession, making Flag happy, who went to give Moone a kiss and Flag thanked everyone and agreed that they could leave, but they were interrupted by Amanda Waller, who was still alive and Flag listened to the requests of his allies and agreed to help fulfill them.[3]\n\nA few days after the battle, Flag brought Floyd Lawton to see his daughter while he supervised the visit. When the Belle Reve guards arrived to take Lawton back to his cell, Flag bought time for Lawton to say goodbye to Zoe. Later, Flag continued to bring Lawton to visit his daughter more often.[3]\n\nYears later, in 2020, during a work day at Belle Reve, Rick Flag saw Amanda Waller wearing a new blouse, mocking her by describing her as a \"gang of clowns\", making John Economos to begin laughing hysterically at Flag's joke while Waller just looked at Flag in an intimidating manner, with Flag embarrassedly drinking coffee, regretting the joke.[6]\n\nFlag was again recruited by Amanda Waller in a Task Force X mission to infiltrate Jotunheim, Corto Maltese and eliminate everything related to the Project Starfish,[4] without knowing he was sent in a decoy team in retaliation for having made fun of Waller.[6] For recruitment, Flag recommended Waller to recruit his old military friend, Robert DuBois, aka Bloodsport. On flight day, Flag met Brian Durlin, one of the new recruits, which he did not know how to call him by his codename Savant or by his real name.\n\nFlag and Durlin arrived at the airport to meet with the other members such as Captain Boomerang, who returned to the team, Blackguard, Mongal, Javelin, T.D.K., and Weasel. When Savant noticed that the team was the Suicide Squad, Flag told him that the official name was Task Force X. When entering the plane, Flag was reunited with Harley Quinn, who also returned to the team. During the flight, Flag calmed the squad down when they met Weasel, revealing that he had killed 27 children.\n\nWhen the squad reached the beaches of Corto Maltese and jump from the plane, Flag got upset when he realized that no one knew that Weasel could not swim, with Savant helping him to reach the coast and reporting him dead. Flag and the team soon settled on the beach, but were betrayed by Blackguard, who communicated with the Corto Maltese Armed Forces, starting to fight against them. After Quinn was in danger, Flag went to save her friend, and sent T.D.K. to face the soldiers, however half of the team ended up killed.[4]\n\nRick Flag managed to escape from the beach, but was badly injured while trying to reach Amanda Waller for help. While running, Flag thought Harley Quinn died. Unable to communicate, Flag ended up in the forest, but was found by Sol Soria and the Maltese Resistance, who wanted to overthrow President Silvio Luna, Flag then showed that he was on their side and was rescued.\n\nDuring his stay, Flag befriended the resistance and was cured of his heritages, and while talking to Soria during the morning, he was surprised by a second Task Force X strike team formed by Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Ratcatcher 2, Polka-Dot Man and King Shark, who believed that Flag was kidnapped. Surprised, Flag explained that Soria and the rebels saved him, something that made the squad feel sorry because they killed several rebels.\n\nFlag went out with Sol Soria and the team went from the tent and saw with sorrow the dead bodies of the rebels. Feeling sorry, Rick Flag apologized to Soria and accepted that the new team was misfit, but they would be the only hope to give Corto Maltese freedom from the corrupt government, convincing Soria to help them travel to Valle Del Mar and find Gaius Grieves. As they prepared, Rick Flag, Sol Soria, the Task Force X, and the Maltese Resistance began a journey to save Milton, who would lead them across Valle Del Mar to find Grieves.\n\nDuring the trip, Flag and the group noticed that Abner Krill had many colorful spots on his face, and the team learned Krill’s origins and how his mother experimented with him to get powers.[4] While walking, Flag was asked by Bloodsport why he was on the mission, and he assumed they were a decoy group for Waller, surprising DuBois, who did not understand why he was despicable to Waller, and Flag claimed to believe it was because of the time he made fun of her shirt.[6]\n\nAt night, Flag and the others found Milton on his bus and saved him from the military. As the Task Force X installed the boxes with clothes in the vehicle, Rick Flag talked with Sol Soria about his plan when he arrived at Jotunheim, as it would attract the soldiers' attention, and so Silvio Luna’s palace would be free to be attacked, something that made Soria happy, since she saw Rick Flag as a great person.[4]\n\nThe squad and Milton traveled throughout Valle Del Mar as they tried to communicate with Amanda Waller and her team. During the trip, Flag heard the origin story of Cleo Cazo and Robert DuBois. Arriving at La Gatita Amable, the squad entered the club to capture Thinker, but he still did not appear, so they accepted the Peacemaker's idea about having fun before going into action, drinking and laughing.\n\nWhen Thinker arrived, the squad managed to kidnap him, but the Corto Maltese Armed Forces arrived, as they knew there were intruders. Seeing Cazo and Abner Krill taking Thinker to the bus, Flag and Smith joined DuBois in surrendering to the soldiers so that they would not capture the others. The trio was taken to a convoy, where Flag discovered that Quinn was still alive.\n\nRobert DuBois managed to defeat a soldier and Flag and Smith joined him in murdering the rest of the military to get out of the convoy. The trio managed to survive the explosion of the convoy and reunited with the rest of the team. When everyone prepared to go to Jotunheim, Rick Flag decided first to save Harley Quinn.[4]\n\nA few hours later, the squadron went straight to Silvio Luna’s Palace to find Harley Quinn, with Peacemaker being upset that the mission was at risk, but Flag told him that no partner should be left behind. After preparing, the squad split through the palace to initiate a brilliant plan to save Harley Quinn, where Flag and DuBois would take charge of entering the palace.\n\nAfter communicating with the radio team to start the plan, Flag scolded Nanaue for interrupting the transmission, however, when they were about to start the rescue, Flag and DuBois were surprised by Quinn, who had escaped alone from the military, something that saddened Flag as he wanted to develop his incredible plan. Flag and Quinn shared a hug of happiness before being interrupted by DuBois.[4]\n\nThe squad went to a roof, where they ate empanadas, until Flag and Dubois began to explain the rules to Gaius Grieves, since if he betrayed them or lied, he was going to die, with Flag calming Quinn when he threatened Thinker about coughing without covering his mouth. Flag continued explaining how he and Cleo Cazo would go with Thinker to erase the Project Starfish files. After detailing the plan of how they would enter Jotunheim, Grieves believed that this was suicide, something that Flag agreed, since it was the team's brand.[4]\n\nWhen they entered, the truck was about to be confiscated by the soldiers, and Flag ordered Polka-Dot Man to release some dots from the door to pretend to be Thinker's materials, letting Thinker pass,[6] the team infiltrated the outskirts of the tower, and when they prepared to go down, Flag took the shotgun from Milton's hands, because he didn't know how to shoot. After preparing, the squad walked in the rain to cover itself and then began to kill the guards of the tower. The team successfully entered Jotunheim and Flag began delivering bombs to implant in the tower and finish the mission.\n\nOnce inside, the team split up, with Bloodsport, King Shark, Harley Quinn, and Polka-Dot Man going to the upper levels to plant the bombs, while Flag and Ratcatcher take Thinker down to the basement. Once there, they bear witnessed to the gruesome experiments that Thinker had conducted on Starro and it's captives, which horrified them, especially Ratcatcher.\n\nWhen Thinker told them that they were sent to Corto Maltese to cover up the U.S's involvement in Project Starfish, Flag refused to believe him at first, enraging Thinker as he then revealed the truth; thirty years ago, the American government had found Starro and saw the potential in weaponizing such a powerful beast, so they made a secret deal with the Corto Maltese government to be able to conduct their illegal experiments on their soil, while Thinker himself oversaw them.[4]\n\nAs he explained, Peacemaker suddenly showed up, finding Thinker untrustworthy. Disgusted and betrayed, Flag broke inside the controls and found a hard drive that contained the secrets to what the American government had done, planning to share it with the press, only to be cornered by Peacemaker, who attempted to stop Flag under orders from Amanda Waller.\n\nRight then, the building rumbles, and the group realized the bombs have been set off too early. Believing that the information contained would cause an international dispute, Peacemaker tried to reason with him and begged Flag not to make him kill him. Before the confrontation could turn violent, however, the floor above caved in on Flag, Ratcatcher, Thinker, and Peacemaker, knocking all of them unconscious.\n\nUpon waking up, Flag, despite being wounded from the debris, saw the hard drive and attempted to take it, but Peacemaker stopped him, leading to a brutal fistfight. Despite Peacemaker initially having the upper hand, Flag managed to pin Peacemaker to the ground with a metal rod, choking the latter. Before Flag succeeded, Peacemaker grabbed a shard of tile broken off from the fight and uses it to stabbed Flag through the heart. With his last breath, Flag called Peacemaker out for his hypocritical name before collapsing to the ground, dying.[4]\n\nSoon after, Peacemaker realized that Ratcatcher 2 had unwittingly witnessed Flag's death. She then took the drive and fled upstairs, prompting Peacemaker to chase after her. Ratcatcher then informed Bloodsport and the other Task Force X Members about what had happened, forcing a confrontation with Bloodsport and Peacemaker, resulting in Peacemaker being mortally wounded.\n\nThis act of rebellion unwittingly inspired Task Force X to commit to another one, saving the citizens of Corto Maltese from Starro even at the cost of defying Amanda Waller. Ultimately, the Task Force was successful. Bloodsport managed to use the contents of the drive to bargain for their freedom. Although Bloodsport solemnly admitted to Ratcatcher that he sadly couldn't deliver exactly on Flag's final wishes, he did remark that he had made the best compromise he possibly could out of it.[4]\n\nChristopher Smith managed to survive his final confrontation with Bloodsport. When informed that he would have to embark on another mission for A.R.G.U.S., Peacemaker brought up Flag, complaining that he'd already killed him for them.[7] The following day, Peacemaker, influenced by the music he was listening to, started to cry, mourning his part in causing Flag's death and noting that Flag was right in saying that he was a joke.[8]\n\nTrained in West Point, Rick Flag was very confident in his abilities. His tough military attitude, however, occasionally made him seem less intelligent. When in combat, he tended to be very serious and short-tempered, particularly when concerning other allies' mistakes. His short temper also extended to his Task Force X teammates; in his first outing with the team, Rick made no effort whatsoever to hide his utter contempt and hatred for the criminals and supervillains under his command, referring to them as \"scumbags\" to Amanda Waller, threatening to blow their heads off for pissing him off and at one point flying into a rage when Harley Quinn nonchalantly stole from an abandoned shop window. Despite this, Flag was not above requesting Deadshot's assistance in keeping the team in check. Moreover, Flag was quite loyal to Waller and A.R.G.U.S., despite the intimidating rumors around her. Indeed, Rick even noted one can get used to Waller's ruthless personality after a while.\n\nRick's softer side came from his love for June Moone, the unwilling host of the fearsome and malevolent Enchantress. Having been assigned to watch her, Rick promptly fell in love and they began dating. Hence, he followed Waller's orders \"as Holy Writ\", to protect his lover, whom Waller used as exploitable leverage over him. In addition, the events in Midway City seem to have allowed Rick to gain a better understanding of the Squad members, with him ultimately destroying his nano-bomb detonator and releasing them from the mission after Waller's capture, giving up Zoe Lawton's letters to Deadshot, happily hugging Deadshot upon their victory over Enchantress, and making sure Deadshot's first supervised visit to his daughter lasts a few moments longer.\n\nYears after being reunited with June, Flag had become more upbeat and cheerful in his mannerisms. Rick even began to form bonds and started to care for some of the Task Force X members, such as Harley and Bloodsport for example. He also showed to have had a strong sense of morals, as he was willing to tell the world about the horrible unethical experiments that the U.S. government supervised on the people of Corto Maltese and Starro.",
