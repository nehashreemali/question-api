  "content": "Kara Zor-El was born on Krypton to Zor-El and Alura around 18,000 years ago. When she was old enough, she joined the Kryptonian Explorer Guild to train as a pilot.\n\nWhile leading a training exercise in a Kryptonian jungle, she split her team to retrieve three beacons for the Explorer Guild. She sent Nam-Ek and Dora to the south for one, Dev-Em and Kell-Ur, her boyfriend, for another, and partnered with Thara for the third.\n\nDev-Em bitterly questioned her authority, but Kara dismissed him and sent them off. While Kara was locating the beacon, she heard screams from Kell-Ur, who was about to fall off a cliff. She tried to help him up, but couldn't save him. She accused Dev-Em of his murder, battled and subdued him, and had him arrested to the Kryptonian Law Council. Kell-Ur's murder was the first in a thousand years.[1]\n\nHer leadership and valor earned her a team of her own, with a scout mission captaining Scout Ship 0344 to colonize a new world. Kara and her subordinates entered stasis chambers during the journey, intending to sleep for ten years until arriving at their new world, but when Kara awakened, she found that Dev-Em had escaped from prison ten years ago, secretly boarded her ship, and killed the entirety of her crew. The two fought as the ship approached Earth, resulting in a crash landing on Ellesmere Island, Canada. Sometime after the crash, the ship's landing entrance could be seen opening and a figure emerged, going into the snowing wasteland.[1]\n\nMillenia after the crash landing, the scout ship was discovered by NASA.[1] Kal-El, the last known survivor of the House of El, used his House of El command key to enter the scout ship, which led to him finding several pods with the carcasses of dead Kryptonians, although there was at least one pod which was notably empty.[2] After further exploration, Clark discovered the bridge which was filled with the long-deceased Kryptonian bridge crew seated on couches. Clark noticed that one of the couches was empty, prompting him to wonder if there had actually been a survivor.[3]\n\nSometime after Kal El's death, the members of the Justice League infiltrated the scout ship in a bid to resurrect the last survivor of the House of El. As they carried his body into the ship, they passed the empty pod and glanced at it quickly before proceeding to their destination.[4]\n\nShe followed her lifelong dream and enlisted in the Kryptonian Explorer Guild, trained as a pilot and leader and remained determined to accomplish her goals. She cared about her family, but even knowing she may never see them again, she bravely set out on a journey far from Krypton.\n\nKryptonian physiology: As a Kryptonian, Kara possesses superhuman abilities. On a planet near a red star, Kara would have physical attributes nearly identical to those of humans, but while on a planet near a yellow star, she is granted many new abilities and powers that surpass the capabilities of humans.",
