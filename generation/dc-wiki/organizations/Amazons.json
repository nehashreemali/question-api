  "content": "The Amazons are an all-female race of superhuman warriors that currently reside in the island of Themyscira. They were created by Zeus as a way to protect Mankind from the manipulations of Ares, though ultimately they failed in doing so.\n\nFollowing the War of the Gods, the Amazons seceded from the world, eternally training for their battle against the God of War.\n\nAfter Ares first attempted to corrupt mankind, Zeus and the other Old Gods created the Amazons in order to spread love and compassion throughout the world to counter Ares' effects and machinations. They brought a brief period of peace upon the world.[1]\n\nSome time before the War of the Gods, the Amazons joined with the Atlanteans, Humans, Old Gods, and the Green Lantern Yalan Gur in fighting off an Apokoliptan invasion of Earth led by Darkseid and his massive Parademon army. Before being forced to depart, Darkseid left behind three Mother Boxes, and each of the three factions of the army that helped save Earth would be given one of them to hide and guard.[2]\n\nAs Ares slowly became engulfed in his jealousy towards mankind, his corruption of humanity led to their betrayal of the Amazons. The Amazons were forced into enslavement by the very people they were created to protect. Rallied under the leadership of Hippolyta, the Amazons freed themselves from captivity, while the Old Gods were slain by Ares one by one. In his final duel, Ares was banished to the realm of Man by his father, Zeus, and left severely crippled and unable to regain his full strength.[1]\n\nAs the War of the Gods neared its end, princess Diana was born as the daughter of Zeus and Queen Hippolyta. Zeus used the last of his power to create the island of Themyscira where the Amazons would be safe from Ares, able to train for their eventual return to the realm of Man and the battle against the God of War. Diana also was eventually trained in combat tactics by her aunt, Antiope, in order to eventually fulfill her role as the \"God Killer\" and defeat Ares once and for all.[1]\n\nOn November 6, 1918, during World War I, The German army pursues Steve Trevor to Themyscira, where the Amazons' attack against them breaks out. Orana is the first Amazon to be killed in the skirmish, while Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana. Soon afterwards, Diana and Steve left Themyscira for London.[1]\n\nOn 2017, Steppenwolf went to Themyscira, where the first mother box was located. Despite the Amazons' efforts to escape with the box, their defense ultimately failed. Queen Hippolyta attempted to escape with the mother box after sealing Steppenwolf inside the chamber, but Steppenwolf retrieved the mother box before Hippolyta and her Amazons can do anything.\n\nLater, Hippolyta used one of the arrows of Artemis to alert her daughter Diana to Steppenwolf's arrival on Earth.[2]\n\nAlthough Amazons are generally similar to human women in appearance, they are distinguished from them by their remarkable beauty and extreme physical strength. Interestingly though, they appear to resemble various human races, from all across the globe, which may indicate Zeus purposely created them to resemble humans. Amazons also possess enhanced strength, coordination, stamina and agility, further honed by their years of combat training. In addition, although they only seem to be young women at their best, many Amazons have lived for centuries in Themyscira. This gives them a form of immortality. However, they are not invincible and can be killed.[1]\n\nThe Amazons also possess a heightened intellect that allows them to quickly learn and adapt. Additionally, the Amazons were gifted with the ability to innately understand all human languages, including those currently dead such as Ancient Greek, Latin, Sumerian or Turkish Ottoman. Presumably, their incredible learning capability allows them to quickly learn non-human languages as well.[1]",
