  "content": "The Advanced Research Group Uniting Superhumans[1][2] or Advanced Research Group United Support[3], commonly known as A.R.G.U.S., is a United States government organization directed by Amanda Waller. A.R.G.U.S. is known to collaborate with the CIA and FBI in some instances and uses people with superpowers or otherwise impressive skills to make their ends, protect the country, and handle major threats.\n\nA.R.G.U.S. was formed by the United States government as an agency with the intention of conducting advanced research on superhumans. Eventually, Amanda Waller became director and under her leadership, she gained a fearsome reputation.[1] At some point, A.R.G.U.S. developed a government website that only authorized agents could access, containing files on the investigations carried out.[4] Eventually, under Waller's orders, A.R.G.U.S. built the Task Force X Black Site facility under the sea in Antarctica, where various dangerous metahumans were imprisoned.[5] A.R.G.U.S. also developed prototypes of an Adhesive Explosive which worked when tested in laboratories.[6]\n\nDirector Waller was known to have encountered super-genius businessman Lex Luthor, allowing him to familiarize himself with her organization, as Lex subtly revealed while conversing with Ron Troupe.[7]\n\nAfter the death of Superman, amidst the emergence of metahumans, Waller noted that while Superman was a benevolent and powerful ally of the United States of America, other powerful beings may become hostile and leave humanity helpless to defend themselves. To counter this possibility, Waller advocated for the formation of Task Force X, a black-ops team of expendable criminals with exceptional skills, abilities, and powers to combat superhuman threats.\n\nHer roster included the formidable marksman Deadshot, rope assassin Slipknot, Australian bank robber Captain Boomerang, the psychopathic Harley Quinn, the monstrous crocodilian metahuman Killer Croc, pyrokinetic metahuman El Diablo, and the mystical witch Enchantress, all of whom would be led in the field by Colonel Rick Flag and his formidable samurai bodyguard Katana.\n\nOn behalf on A.R.G.U.S., she gathered support for Task Force X with Dexter Tolliver and joined a conference with Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Edwards to present her initiative. While initially skeptical of Waller's plan, she commanded Enchantress to teleport to Iran and steal nuclear arsenal papers to deliver to Edwards. Impressed with her results, he authorized funding and support for Task Force X.[1]\n\nIn early 2020, businessman Alan Kupperberg and pop singer Vandalia traveled on a plane with butterflies on their heads. During the trip, the plane crashed, killing them. When they were taken for autopsies, dead alien creatures were discovered in their skulls. This led A.R.G.U.S. to notice butterflies for the first time, beginning an exhaustive investigation into other individuals carrying these life forms, hiring mercenary Clemson Murn to run a domestic operation to stop the alien menace.[8]\n\nIn August 2020, A.R.G.U.S coordinated a new mission as Waller launched a new iteration of Task Force X to Corto Maltese to assassinate Silvio Luna and destroy any evidence of Project Starfish. However, the true purpose of the mission was to erase America's involvement in it. When the remaining members of Task Force X destroyed Jotunheim, Starro was inadvertently released and wreaked havoc on Valle Del Mar. When Waller threatened to kill the remaining Task Force X members after they decided to disobey her orders and kill Starro, some of her subordinates also decided to rebel against her and help Task Force X take down Starro with success. With the crisis now over, Bloodsport, an assassin and a team leader blackmailed Waller into releasing them or he would release the evidence behind Project Starfish that field leader Flag obtained prior to his death at the hands of Peacemaker, a delusional pacifist who turned on the team after it was revealed he was tasked to ensure no one knew the truth about Project Starfish in exchange for a pardon.[9]\n\nAfter the Battle of Valle Del Mar, A.R.G.U.S. found Peacemaker buried under the rubble of Jotunheim, taking him to the Mount Rouge Health Center to recover under Waller's orders as she still had other plans for him.[10] Waller planned to create task force team lead by Murn to conduct Project Butterfly as she knew that any attempt to investigate the Butterflies would be shut down by her superiors, forcing her to conduct the mission illegaly by covertly diverging funds from other operations, also recruiting her daughter after she lost her job. A.R.G.U.S. researched Senator Royland Goff as a suspected butterfly, and delivered the file to Clemson Murn.\n\nA.R.G.U.S. created a Peacemaker's Diary which contained fake evidence meant to incriminate him for whatever crime her undercover team would commit throughout the mission, and Waller instructed Leota to sneak the fake diary on to Peacemaker's house so that the police could find it later.[11] When Peacemaker killed Annie Sturphausen, the Evergreen Police Department began an investigation, so that when seeing the operation in danger, A.R.G.U.S. hired mercenary Caspar Locke to undercover, putting him as the Captain of the Police Department.[8] However the Butterflies took over the entire policemen including Locke, and they used the forged diary against Peacemaker, turning him in the most wanted person in Evergreen.[12]\n\nThe task force team managed to reach the Coverdale Ranch, requesting Waller to contact the Justice League for aid as they didn't have time for backup. A.R.G.U.S. contacted the Justice League, but when they arrived the battle had already ended. Days later, Leota Adebayo called for a press conference where she publicly exposed her mother for all of Project Butterfly's secrets, also revealing the Task Force X activities orchestrated by Waller, requesting an exhaustive investigation into A.R.G.U.S. for their human rights violations, as Waller watched on TV, shocked by the turn of events.[13]\n\nAfter Teth-Adam was freed from Kahndaq and began slaughtering Intergang soldiers, A.R.G.U.S. quickly took action on the matter, with Amanda Waller contacting Carter Hall to send the Justice Society to apprehend Adam, while Hall requested that A.R.G.U.S. managed to get a cell to hold him.\n\nThe following day and with Teth-Adam's voluntary surrender, the team took charge of taking him asleep on a stretcher to the maximum security prison, Task Force X Black Site, where they were received by Emilia Harcourt and her troops, who thanked the Society for their work. The soldiers of A.R.G.U.S. Later they took it upon themselves to lock him up in a capsule submerged in water, where they placed an oxygen mask and handcuffs on him, preventing him from speaking.\n\nTeth-Adam, being helped telepathically by Kent Nelson, managed to get out of his cell, despite the fact that the A.R.G.U.S. tried to stop them, Adam confronted them and managed to escape from prison, traveling back to Kahndaq where he would kill Sabbac in search of saving the nation from him. Seeing Adam as a threat to Earth, Waller ordered the dispatch of an A.R.G.U.S. drone to Kahndaq to contact Adam and warn him not to leave Kahndaq, threatening to send people from other planets to stop him.[5]\n\nA.R.G.U.S. later acted in the recruitment process for the Justice Society. After the Battle of Philadelphia, Waller became interested in recruiting Billy Batson into the team, so an research of him was made, with John Economos and Emilia Harcourt finally going on to recruit him.[14]\n\nThe first version of the A.R.G.U.S. insignia was used prominently in 2016, being notable on its official website and on the first mission of Task Force X,[1] until being replaced by its second insignia sometime between 2016-2020.[6]\n\nThe second version of the A.R.G.U.S. insignia was introduced sometime between 2016-2020. This logo was present in the agency's classified files, such as the Royland Goff file.[6]\n\nThe A.R.G.U.S. files have widely contradicted each other or information given in other films:\n\nThe in-universe solution is to assume that A.R.G.U.S. was doing faulty research, which is reinforced by the fact that in Shazam! Fury of the Gods, it mentions \"based on investigations,\" implying a lack of credibility on the part of the agency's reports. Additionally, Javelin's file included in its notes that the character was \"known for deadly accuracy and his large penis,\" so it's possible that the agents didn't take their jobs seriously, as happens in The Suicide Squad when Waller's team starts placing bets. Therefore, information from A.R.G.U.S. files is recognized as valid as long as it does not contradict other information provided by other sources, and files with more detailed information are given more weight.",
