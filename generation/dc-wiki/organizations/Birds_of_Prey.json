  "content": "The Birds of Prey are a team of vigilante women dedicated to combating crime in Gotham City.\n\nShortly after the Battle at the Booby Trap, and fearing that someone worse than Roman Sionis would lay siege to Gotham City after his death, Renee Montoya proposed Dinah Lance and Helena Bertinelli to form a team to which they accepted. The trio decided to use the proceeds of the Bertinelli fortune to form a team of vigilantes called the Birds of Prey, with the purpose of combating crime in Gotham City. Shortly after, they fought a group of thieves in an abandoned warehouse, where after defeating them, they gathered to leave the place.[1]",
