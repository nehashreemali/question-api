  "content": "Peacemaker is an American web television series, based on the DC Comics antihero of the same name.

Peacemaker would begin production in early 2021, before Gunn began his work on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 for Marvel Studios.[1]\n\nOn October 9, 2020, Hollywood North Buzz reported that filming would begin in Vancouver on January 11, 2021, and would end on June 9, 2021, assuming the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic wouldn't delay production. They also reported that the working title for Peacemaker was \"The Scriptures.\" On Twitter, James Gunn said that the timeline of when the series takes place would not be revealed until after The Suicide Squad releases on August 6, 2021, in order to avoid spoiling the film and whether or not Peacemaker lives.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, it was reported that Jody Hill had been hired to direct episodes of the series.[2]\n\nOn April 4, 2021, it was reported that Rosemary Rodriguez was also attached to direct episodes of the series.[3]\n\nOn June 5, 2021, it was reported that Brad Anderson was attached to direct episodes of the series.[4]\n\nOn June 14, 2021 Clint Mansell and Kevin Kiner were announced to score the series.
