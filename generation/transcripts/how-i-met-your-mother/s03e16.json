  "transcript": "Now kids, when aunt Robin was a teenager, she was, well, a Canadian pop star. But by 2008, she was an entirely different person Coming up next: Is your baby trying to kill you? which made the events of that week all the more surprising. So, I go in this morning and, brr, it's freezing! So I walk over there, and I don't know why I'm still talking, because clearly, we're all asking the same question, What in God's creation is going on with Robin's breasts? I know! Right? Isn't it amazing? I spent half an hour making this happen. There's tape in there, cotton balls, half of a Nerf football, but it works, right? Totally. What's the occasion? And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink. Somebody you went to Degrassi with? No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend. Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. And he had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock CafÃ© T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love. Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car? So he's the guy who How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf? No, it wasn't like that. Sounds to me like he gave you your first \"O, Canada!\" face. This went on for a really long time. Some of them jokes were elegant and well-crafted Wait, wait. Did he break up with you and tell you he's just not that Inuit? others were crude, and ill-formed Um, something about fur trapping. and others were obvious, but needed to be said Did you ride his Zamboni? Wait, wait, wait. Did he? I think I'm out. Yeah, I'm also \"oot.\" Okay, now I'm really out. Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig Oh, my God! Simon. That was such a good show. You guys totally rocked out. Yeah. I know. I figure we're about four or five gigs away from really exploding. We're gonna be big, babe. I mean, like Crash-Test-Dummies big. - So, that everything? - Yeah. Listen, babe It's over. What? I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh. Louise Marsh?! That's a whore's name if I ever heard one. Yeah, why would he want to get back together with Louise Marsh? Well, the thing is her folks just put in a pool. Totally I get it. Pools are great. Swimming's awesome. We have a sprinkler. Run right through it. Well, I should go. Babe, wait. Yeah, Simon? You forgot to load the drum set. Tell me you did not load the drum set. I did. And now he's coming here? Robin, why do you want to see this guy? Oh! I know why. You're gonna win, aren't you? I have no idea what you're talking about. Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser. Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points. You're starting out with two big ones right there. Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom. Point Robin. He never became a rock star. Point Robin. He now works at a water slide park outside of Ottawa. - Point Simon. - Wait. - Do they have a wave pool? - No. Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip. There's no coming back from that. Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is. And sure enough, there was a clear winner, and a clear loser. It just wasn't clear to everybody. Hey, babe. Oh, my God. Okay, what the hell just happened? Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it? - Hey, Simon. - Wow, look at you. You got old. Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible. Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but, I can't help it. I mean he's still got it. Whoa! Four bucks for a brew? What a rip. Good think I'm packing. So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North. The thing is, we gave you so many opportunities. So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. - Tell him, Robin. - No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt. I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living? Oh, I work at the Splish Splash Ottawa Water Slide Park. A water slide park. That sure is different than what Robin does. Yeah, it is because I save lives. If I'm not sitting in that stool at the top of the slide, going Go Go Go people die. What, you think it's so easy? You try it. - Go. - You didn't put your hand up kid just died. - No, I didn't know - Another kid just went, he died too. Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually Another kid just went, now you've got a pile-up and Robin's got something to report on the news. This just in: My friend, Ted, just killed a bunch of kids today. Well, that's cool. You got to pay the bills somehow since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it? Well, it hasn't panned out yet, but the band's still going. About four or five gigs away from really exploding. The Foreskins are still playing? The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name? Well, there's four of us, and we play without shirts. Babe, seriously. I know. I'm sorry. I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going that's impressive. I mean, I gave up my musical dream. Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight. So, Simon, how did you guys meet? Oh, I was in her video. Starred in it is more like it. Once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker. I'm sorry. I've seen \"Let's Go to the Mall\" about a thousand times, - and you, sir, are not in it. - No, I was in the other one. There's another video?! Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape. All right. You give me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute searching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found. Okay. It's just It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again. Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though. It's called \"revertigo.\" Yeah, I don't know about \"revertigo.\" You know who gets really bad revertigo? Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle. Michelle? She sounds hot. You don't know about Lily and Michelle? No. What about Lily and Michelle? Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. - Hey, Lil? - What? You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while. Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out. What Do they make out? Better. - Comparable. - Comparable. Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance. - I got a second chance. - What happened? He came by my place tonight Simon. What are you doing here? I just feel like there's some unfinished business between you and me. Seeing you now has made me realize that breaking up with you is the biggest mistake I made in my entire life. Oh, I like where this is going. I know this is crazy, and I'm only in town for a couple of days, but, do you want to go on a date? He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon. The coup de grace. Finish him! I'd love to! Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon? The one we met? Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you. That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school? - Oh, hell, no! - I think you're gonna enjoy this. That my girl Michelle? - Bitch, you know it! - How she livin'? She living only way she know how to. Large! Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here. I'm hoping my fat ass can hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade. For reals. I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle. Guys, that was great. Let's take five. Hey, babe, did you like it after my bass solo when I flicked my pick at you? That rocked. Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back. Oh, uh, sure. Um - It's cool. You'll find it later. - Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning. But, babe, you got to go to work. You got to play our demo on your show. Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news. Right. So you can be, like, \"Hey, did you hear there's some news? There's a rad band you guys should check out.\" And then play it. Or just, like, the first three songs. And now it's time for \"Puppy Corner,\" some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.  Murder climb aboard the Murder Train   Murder climb aboard the Murder Train  Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to kill them. Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work. What's revertigo? It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning. No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them. Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is. You do? Yeah. Ted. Me? Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again. Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that. Ooh. That must be Adam. - 'Sup, Punchy? - 'Sup, Shmosby?! - You want to go? - I'm already there! - Come on! - This is it! Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad. Yeah, it was a real shock. I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this. Why? No reason. Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy? Okay, you want the truth? I like Simon. I do. We have fun together. We know you do, honey, but we're worried about you. You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents? I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old? That's exactly what my mom would say. No. If I was your mom, I would say, \"We forbid you from seeing this boy.\" No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good. This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel! No, no. We were once young and in love, too. Yeah, like, a billion years ago. You've been drinking, haven't you? Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round. You're not going to that show tonight! Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way! Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help. - Hey, so, today at work - Not now, Ted! Hey, Simon. Great show. - You guys still rock. - Yeah. They totally dug my bass solo. Man! Why can't I always feel this alive?! God, I just love seeing you so happy. Yeah. About that. Listen, babe. It's over. What? I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh. What? You're kidding me. You're breaking up with me? Again? F-For the same ex-girlfriend? In the same van? What is it? Her-Her parents got a pool? Is that still the reason? Well her folks did just put in a Jacuz. I'm sorry, Robin. I'm fine, really. Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. - You feel me, Chelle? - Mm-hmm, for reals. - He a scrub. - Mm. True dat. I'm get me my champagne and grape soda on. So, how's Columbia? Great! I'm almost done with my dissertation. I'm getting a PhD in behavioral psychology. Can I make an observation? I know. Whenever I'm around Lily, she just brings out that side of me. There's a psychological term for the phenomenon. - Revertigo? - No. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl! One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin. All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr What's the matter? Simon dumped me in his van after the show. Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago. No, tonight. Really? Oh, come here. Come here. It's just when I was young, I was so vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And I guess I just I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again. Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome. Right. Of course, the-the first being you. No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up. I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be. Barney, do you want to come back to my place? Your place? - Are you sure you want to do this? - Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay? Of course. So, should I just put it in? Yeah, why not?  Met you at the mall  This was my big artistic follow-up to \"Let's Go to the Mall.\" It kind of tanked.  My friends said I was a fool  - # You're a fool. - Shut up! # - Is that Tiffany? - Mm-hmm.  'Cause you were older and got kicked out of school   You are so rad.   Together we were gonna travel the globe   From Alberta to Ontario  It's everything I want it to be and more. - Oh, I'm so glad. - Hmm.  a sandcastles in the sand   Sandcastles in the sand   Thought I could fly when you held my hand  - # Thought I could fly - But now #  Eternity returns to black and white  - Is that Alan Thicke? - Yeah.  It was the greatest week and a half   Of my life We used to go to the beach  You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere.  On our favorite bench   We'd sit and talk and you taught me to french   You're good at  Do you see how lame you were back then? - Yeah, you're right. I was lame. - Totally lame.  so unfair   You don't understand about love.  And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad. He was my sidekick. He had to be. And so they watched it again.  Its crazy,   no one gets me   Let's go all the way  #I love you. Let's do it. #  I miss you.  And again.  Sandcastles may be cute I'm on the pill now.   But now  And again.  all they do is remind me of you  They watched it over and over that night until finally, they stopped watching.",
