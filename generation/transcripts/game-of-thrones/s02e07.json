Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?\"\nBLACK LORREN: Gone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Right. Get the horses and the hounds.\nMAN: Come on, find the scent. Where they going?\"\nDAGMER: Halt!\nTHEON GREYJOY: Enjoying your first hunt?\nLUWIN: So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: With hunting, there's blood at the end.\"\nLUWIN: They're little boys.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.\"\nLUWIN: Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.\nTHEON GREYJOY: They have no value to me missing.\nLUWIN: Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000.\"\nMAN: We have a scent!\nTHEON GREYJOY: The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game.\"\nOSHA: We should have took more food.\nBRAN STARK: We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.\nOSHA: Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.\nBRAN STARK: And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.\"\nOSHA: The boy can't survive on walnuts.\nRICKON: I'm fine.\nOSHA: We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire.\nHODOR: Hodor.\nOSHA: Even you, sweet giant.\"\nBRAN STARK: Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.\"\nRICKON: Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.\nBRAN STARK: We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are.\"\nRIKON: Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.\nOSHA: You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.\"\nBRAN STARK: They'll be after us with hounds.\nOSHA: We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever.\"\nYGRITTE: Did you pull a knife on me in the night?\nYGRITTE: What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.\nJON SNOW: Let's move.\nYGRITTE: It is the first time. How old are you, boy?\"\nJON SNOW: I'm a man of the Night's Watch.\nYGRITTE: You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-\nJON SNOW: Don't call them that.\nYGRITTE: What, stones? Or bone?\"\nJON SNOW: Neither. Both.\nJON SNOW: Move!\nYGRITTE: I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?\"\nJON SNOW: There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.\"\nYGRITTE: So the lads just do it with each other?\nJON SNOW: No.\nYGRITTE: Never?\nJON SNOW: Never. We swore an oath.\nYGRITTE: You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable.\"\nJON SNOW: Would you please shut up?\nYGRITTE: Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman.\"\nJON SNOW: You're a free woman?\nYGRITTE: I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.\"\nJON SNOW: If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what \"\"prisoner\"\" means.\"\nYGRITTE: And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.\nJON SNOW: It was my choice to say the words.\nYGRITTE: So you don't like girls?\nJON SNOW: Of course I like girls.\nYGRITTE: But you chose never to touch them.\nJON SNOW: That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.\nYGRITTE: So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-\"\nJON SNOW: Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!\"\nYGRITTE: They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.\nJON SNOW: My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours.\"\nYGRITTE: So why are you fighting us?\nMAN: Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.\nMOUNTIAN: We hanged twenty men last night.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.\nMOUNTAIN: We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one.\"\nMOUNTAIN: Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Mmm. Is that mutton?\nARYA STARK: Yes, my lord.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Don't like mutton.\nARYA STARK: I'll bring something else.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Leave it. Are you hungry?\nARYA STARK: No.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Of course you are. Eat.\nARYA STARK: I'll eat in the kitchen later.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: It's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.\nARYA STARK: I eat a lot. I just don't grow.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.\nARYA STARK: Have you ever lost before?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?\"\nARYA STARK: Dragons?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Yes. Dragons happened.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name\"\nARYA STARK: Aegon and his sisters.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Mmm?\nARYA STARK: It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Correct. A student of history, are you?\"\nARYA STARK: Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.\nARYA STARK: Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?\nARYA STARK: Most girls are idiots.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?\nARYA STARK: From my father.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.\nARYA STARK: Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: And, girl.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: M'lord.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Lowborn girls say \"\"m'lord,\"\" not \"\"my lord. \"\" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.\"\nARYA STARK: My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?\nARYA STARK: Yes.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Go on.\nSANSA STARK: I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.\nSANSA STARK: Does it give you joy to scare people?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: No, it gives me joy to kill people.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.\nSANSA STARK: It was his duty. He never liked it.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.\nSANSA STARK: Why are you always so hateful?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.\nXARO: I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You are one of the Thirteen.\nXARO: If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.\nXARO: Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?\"\nXARO: I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: But it did happen under your roof.\nXARO: Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been-\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I don't care where you've been.\nYGRITTE: You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.\"\nJON SNOW: No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.\"\nYGRITTE: We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.\"\nYGRITTE: You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.\nJON SNOW: Walk.\nYGRITTE: I could teach you how to do it.\nJON SNOW: I know how to do it.\nYGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.\"\nROBB STARK: And what did she say?\nALTON: She admired your spirit, Your Grace.\"\nROBB STARK: And what then?\nALTON: She, uh...\"\nROBB STARK: If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang.\"\nALTON: She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.\"\nROBB STARK: You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.\"\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.\"\nROOSE: Too many prisoners.\nROBB STARK: Is there room for Ser Alton?\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Does he need to lie down?\nROBB STARK: Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Torrhen.\nROBB STARK: That will be all.\nTALISA: Your Grace. A minute of your time?\nTALISA: I've been treating your wounded men.\nROBB STARK: And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.\"\nTALISA: They're not my enemies.\nROBB STARK: That's what I tell my bannermen.\nTALISA: I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.\"\nROBB STARK: But some are not.\nTALISA: I need silk for stitching.\nTALISA: I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over.\"\nROBB STARK: If you need help finding these-\nTALISA: I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.\"\nROBB STARK: Continue, my lady.\"\nTALISA: You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?\nROBB STARK: Yes.\nTALISA: The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.\nROBB STARK: I expect he will.\nTALISA: If I could write a list-\nROBB STARK: Come with me to the Crag.\nTALISA: I don't think that will be-\nROBB STARK: Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men.\"\nWOMAN: Children, come inside, quick. Come on.\"\nCHILD: Hurry up!\nMAN: Can't find anything, ser. They've lost the scent.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Try again.\nMAN: We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.\nLUWIN: We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak.\"\nMAN: Prince Theon.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Where are they?\nWINTERFELL SHEPHERD: Who, m'lord?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: The Stark boys. Where are they?\nWINTERFELL SHEPHERD: I don't know. I seen no one.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Think harder.\nWINTERFELL SHEPHERD: I swear, m'lord. I don't know.\"\nDAGMER: My lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for.\"\nDAGMER: Send the old man home.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.\nLUWIN: Theon, don't do this.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You came back.\nJORAH MORMONT: As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Irri is dead.\nJORAH MORMONT: I know. She was a good-\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.\nJORAH MORMONT: Doreah?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: I should have been here.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You went to find me a ship.\nJORAH MORMONT: My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: These people\"\"?\"\nJORAH MORMONT: They are not to be trusted.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Your people are in Westeros.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.\nJORAH MORMONT: They will soon enough.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.\nJORAH MORMONT: You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: There it is. \"\"Trust me. \"\" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: You are too young to be so-\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And you are too familiar.\nJORAH MORMONT: Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Find my dragons.\nYGRITTE: How long till we get back to your crows?\nJON SNOW: We're close.\nYGRITTE: What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?\"\nYGRITTE: What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?\nJON SNOW: Nothing happened between you and me.\nYGRITTE: I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?\"\nJON SNOW: Turn back around.\nYGRITTE: And I thought that we were done, but he said, ''Turn back around.'\"\" I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just-\"\nJON SNOW: What, right here in the muck?\"\nYGRITTE: I'll keep you warm enough.\nYGRITTE: Are you that afraid of it?\nJON SNOW: That's enough.\nYGRITTE: It's nice and wet and warm.\nJON SNOW: Enough!\nYGRITTE: It don't have teeth.\nYGRITTE: All right! All right. Gods, you're dull.\"\nYGRITTE: Should have took me while you had the chance.\nSANSA STARK: No, no!\"\nSANSA STARK: No. Oh, no.\"\nSHAE: It's all right. Give me that.\nSANSA STARK: If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now.\"\nSHAE: Help me flip it over.\nSHAE: Where are you going?\nHANDMAIDEN: To tell Her Grace.\nSHAE: You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more.\"\nSANSA STARK: My mother told me, but I thought it would be different.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: In what way?\nSANSA STARK: I thought it would be less messy.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Wait until you birth a child.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?\nSANSA STARK: I'm fit to bear children for the king?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.\"\nSANSA STARK: His Grace was not with you?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You may never love the king, but you will love his children.\"\nSANSA STARK: I love His Grace with all my heart.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice.\"\nSANSA STARK: But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You can try, little dove.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Who did you say your mother was again?\nALTON: Cinda Lannister.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Is she the fat one?\nALTON: Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she-\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it.\"\nALTON: I squired for you once, you know.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: When?\nALTON: The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I went to Willem Frey's wedding?\nALTON: You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.\nJAIME LANNISTER: He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?\nALTON: Bryan.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before.\"\nALTON: That's right. I ran up and volunteered. \"\"Let me, my lord. Let me.\"\" My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You didn't, though.\"\nALTON: You really remember?\nJAIME LANNISTER: You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.\"\nALTON: When I think back to that day-\nGUARD: Shh!\nJAIME LANNISTER: You were saying?\nALTON: I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.\nJAIME LANNISTER: More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?\nALTON: I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I understand completely.\nALTON: How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.\"\nALTON: Which knight was it?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.\nALTON: What was he like?\nJAIME LANNISTER: He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.\"\nALTON: It's hard to put into words.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.\"\nALTON: Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.\nALTON: Did you squire for him again?\nJAIME LANNISTER: No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.\"\nALTON: And have you thought about\nJAIME LANNISTER: Of course. Every day.\nALTON: And?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now.\"\nALTON: What is it?\nJAIME LANNISTER: It's actually quite simple.\nALTON: Well, let me help you.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You'll only have to do one thing.\nALTON: Tell me.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You'll have to die.\nQUAITH: Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.\nJORAH MORMONT: I didn't come here for lessons.\nQUAITH: No, you came for the dragons.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: You have them? Where are they?\nQUAITH: Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.\nQUAITH: You love her.\nJORAH MORMONT: Where are the dragons?\nQUAITH: Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?\"\nQUAITH: Will you betray her again?\nJORAH MORMONT: Never.\nQUAITH: The thief you seek is with her now.\nSPICE KING: I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.\nXARO: No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.\"\nSILK KING: Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Without me, the dragons will die.\"\nSPICE KING: It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you.\"\nPYAT PREE: You are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How?\nPYATT PREE: I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You have my dragons?\nPYAT PREE: When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. He procured them for me.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: But there is no King of Qarth.\nXARO: There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.\nXARO: You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.\"\nSPICE KING: Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king.\"\nXARO: An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise.\"\nPYAT PREE: The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever.\"\nPYATTPREE: A mother should be with her children.\nPYAT PREE: Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them.\"\nJACKS: Lady Stark!\nBRIENNE: No farther.\nJACKS: Keep your hands off me, woman.\"\nBRIENNE: Don't enter without an invitation, man.\"\nJACKS: Forgive me. Lady Stark.\nCATELYN STARK: What is it?\nJACKS: They caught the Kingslayer.\nMAN: Kingslayer!\nMAN: Kill the fucking Kingslayer!\nMAN: Hang him!\nMAN: You'll die today.\nMAN: Justice for the Karstark.\nMAN: Gut him!\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.\nCATELYN STARK: Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner.\"\nRICKARD: This monster killed my son.\nCATELYN STARK: And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here.\"\nRICKARD KARSTARK: I will have his head. And if you try and stop me\nCATELYN STARK: You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!\"\nRICKARD KARSTARK: And where is our king now?\nROBB STARK: You know very well.\nRICKARD KARSTARK: He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him.\"\nCATELYN STARK: How dare you!\nBRIENNE: Threatening my lady is an act of treason.\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?\nCATELYN STARK: I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down.\"\nRICKARD KARSTARK: When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Wise men do not make demands of kings.\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-\"\nCATELYN STARK: Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!\nJAIME LANNISTER: You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.\nCATELYN STARK: And gag him!\nTYRION LANNISTER: Since when do you light your own candles?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How many times can you read one raven scroll?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: More than we have.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Rain fire on them from above.\"\" You're quoting Father, aren't you?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.\nTYRION LANNISTER: He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I thought the girls might help him.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Did you?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I was wrong. If we can't control him\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The boy is more Robert than Jaime.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Sins?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? \"\"Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.\"\"\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.\"\nMAN: Then why wait?\nMAN: We're sworn to the king.\nMAN: There's not a king.\nMAN: That's treason.\nMAN: So is saving Lannisters, yeah?\"\nMAN: Back off, you.\"\nMAN: No, I won't.\"\nBRIENNE: Your son returns at dawn, my lady?\"\nCATELYN STARK: So they say.\nBRIENNE: The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?\"\nCATELYN STARK: Come.\nCATELYN STARK: I need to be alone with him.\nGUARD: My lady, our orders-\"\nCATELYN STARK: Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?\"\nCATELYN STARK: Do you hear them out there? They want your head.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.\nCATELYN STARK: You strangled his son with your chains.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.\nCATELYN STARK: You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.\nJAIME LANNISTER: So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?\"\nCATELYN STARK: She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.\"\nCATELYN STARK: You are a man without honor.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?\"\nCATELYN STARK: Brienne.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Your sword.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.\nLUWIN: What are you doing? What have you done?\nTHEON GREYJOY: If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question.\"\nLUWIN: No!",
