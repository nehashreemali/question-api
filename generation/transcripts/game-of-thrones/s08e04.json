  "transcript": "JON SNOW: We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.\nMAN: To your health.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Have you seen Arya?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You can still smell the burning bodies, and that's where your head is at.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I just want to thank her for-\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I'm sure you do.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Look, it's not about that.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Gendry.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: That's right, isn't it?\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Yes, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You're Robert Baratheon's son.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I don't know, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Does anyone?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I can't be. I'm a bastard.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you.\"\nDAVOS: To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.\nALL: To Gendry!\nMAN: Lord Gendry!\nMAN: Gendry!\nMAN: That's easy, isn't it?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: A fitting reward for a hero.\nSAM: Uh, hold on.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.\nMAN: Come, my lord.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: See? You're not the only one who's clever.\nWOMAN: I have to go down and get another barrel.\nJAIME LANNISTER: We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?\"\nDAVOS: The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm sure you had your reasons.\nDAVOS: I did. I do.\nTYRION LANNISTER: So did you?\nDAVOS: Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.\nDAVOS: And what if I'm not trying to be happy?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.\"\nDAVOS: Thank you. I feel much better.\nMAN: More ale!\nTYRION LANNISTER: This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.\nBRAN STARK: It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.\nBRAN STARK: I'm not Lord of Winterfell.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You don't want it.\nBRAN STARK: I don't really want anymore.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I envy you.\nBRAN STARK: You shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.",
