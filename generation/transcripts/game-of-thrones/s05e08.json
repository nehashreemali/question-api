How do I know you are who you say you are?\nTYRION LANNISTER: If only I were otherwise.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine\nTYRION LANNISTER: You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.\nTYRION LANNISTER: When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I have a very large army and very large dragons.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I know.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Yes, many opportunities.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And did he?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No. Not until forced to do so.\nTYRION LANNISTER: He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So I should kill him?\nTYRION LANNISTER: A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Remove Ser Jorah from the city.\nSEPTA: Confess.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My son. Let me speak to--\nSEPTA: Confess. I meant it.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My face will be the last thing you see before--\nARYA STARK: My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more.\"\nARYA STARK: Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--\"\nARYA STARK: Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade.\"\nJAQEN HGHAR: Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.\nARYA STARK: How will she serve him?\nJAQEN HGHAR: She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.\nARYA STARK: What will she do there?\nJAQEN HGHAR: She will see.\nARYA STARK: See what?\nJAQEN HGHAR: How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her.\"\nARYA STARK: Oysters, clams and cockles!\"\nARYA STARK: Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!\nTHIN MAN: Your oysters fresh?\nARYA STARK: Best in the city.\nTHIN MAN: You wouldn't lie to an old man would you?\nTHIN MAN: Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.\nMAN: It's my 18th voyage. I've returned from all of them without a scratch on me.\nTHIN MAN: Can't do it.\nMAN: Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don't understand?\"\nJAQEN HGHAR: The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.\nARYA STARK: So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?\nJAQEN HGHAR: A girl tells a man that she has seen.\nARYA STARK: If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money.\"\nJAQEN HGHAR: But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn't have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?\"\nARYA STARK: The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.\nJAQEN HGHAR: A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.\nARYA STARK: And then what?\nJAQEN HGHAR: A gift for the Thin Man.\nWAIF: She is not ready.\nJAQEN HGHAR: Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.\"\nWAIF: And if she's not?\nJAQEN HGHAR: It is all the same to the Many Faced God.\nQYBURN: The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The charges?\nQYBURN: Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: All lies.\nQYBURN: Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?\nQYBURN: I'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Tell him I need to speak to him.\nQYBURN: I implored him to visit you but he would not.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--\"\nQYBURN: Your arrest, and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother.\"\nQYBURN: I tried my grace, he wouldn't see me. He wouldn't see anyone.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I can't stay here.\nQYBURN: There is a way, Your Grace. A way out.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.\"\nQYBURN: Goodbye my queen. The work continues.\nSANSA STARK: Why. Why Theon.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.\nSANSA STARK: Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left.\"\nSANSA STARK: Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.\nTHEON GREYJOY: They weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: They weren't. They were only--\nSANSA STARK: Only what?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I can't..\nSANSA STARK: Tell me!\nTHEON GREYJOY: I can't, not unless the master says...\"\nSANSA STARK: Tell me, they weren't what?!\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: They weren't...\nSANSA STARK: Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.\nSANSA STARK: You didn't…?\nSANSA STARK: Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I can't talk to you anymore.\nSANSA STARK: Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Not Theon, Reek!\"\nBOLTON BANNERMAN: Our scouts tells us he's got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however.\"\nROOSE: And how high can Stannis' horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny.\"\nROOSE: You disagree?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Stannis isn't from the North. You are, father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders.\"\nROOSE: And what do you recommend?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows.\"\nROOSE: A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can't touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn't get an army through if we wanted to.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I don't need an army. I need 20 good men.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: It's probably my safest option.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And what would your father do?\nTYRION LANNISTER: My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Is that why you killed him?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.\nTYRION LANNISTER: So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm terrible?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I've heard stories.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?\nTYRION LANNISTER: To see if you were the right kind of terrible.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Which kind is that?\nTYRION LANNISTER: The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Perhaps it won't come to that.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Varys? King Robert's spy master?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.\nTYRION LANNISTER: He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: But you trust him?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The brother who killed my father.\nTYRION LANNISTER: That's the one.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Perhaps I will have you killed after all.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm not going to kill you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: No? Banish me?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No.\nTYRION LANNISTER: So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished...\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Advise you on what?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How to get what I want.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And when you get back to your home, who supports you?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The common people.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.\nJORAH MORMONT: You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.\nMASTER: You struck me.\nJORAH MORMONT: I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?\nMASTER: You're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Let me fight for her and I belong to you.\nSEPTA: Thirsty? Confess.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die.\"\nGILLY: Does it hurt?\nSAM: No.\nGILLY: Good.\nSAM: How are you?\nGILLY: I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.\nSAM: You know what I mean.\nGILLY: I'm good.\nSAM: Are you scared?\nGILLY: A little.\nSAM: Me too.\nSAM: Who's there?\nOLLY: Olly.\nSAM: Come in.\nOLLY: I heard what happened.\nSAM: Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.\nOLLY: Figured you were hungry.\nSAM: You're a good lad.\nOLLY: Wanted to ask you something. If you've got the time.\nGILLY: I need to check on baby Sam.\nSAM: Now then. How can I help?\nOLLY: It's about the Lord Commander.\nSAM: Yes?\nOLLY: He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.\nSAM: We've been fighting them for years.\nOLLY: This wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why's he saving them?\nSAM: Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones.\"\nOLLY: The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village.\"\nSAM: Olly...\nOLLY: How can he trust him?\nSAM: I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find.\"\nOLLY: But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?\nSAM: Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run.\"\nOLLY: You believe that?\nSAM: With all my heart.\nSAM: Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.\nTORMUND: You trust me Jon Snow?\nJON SNOW: Does that make me a fool?\nTORMUND: We are fools together now.\nTORMUND: Lord of Bones. Been a long time.\nLORD OF BONES: Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?\nTORMUND: War.\nLORD OF BONES: You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.\nTORMUND: We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.\nLORD OF BONES: You don't give the orders here.\nTORMUND: I'm not giving an order.\nLORD OF BONES: Why aren't you in chains?\nJON SNOW: He's not my prisoner.\nLORD OF BONES: What is he?\nJON SNOW: We're allies.\nLORD OF BONES: You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.\nTORMUND: I don't fight for the crows.\nJON SNOW: We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.\nLORD OF BONES: Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--\"\nTORMUND: Gather the elders and let's talk.\nJON SNOW: My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.\nKARSI: You built that wall to keep us out.\nLOBODA: Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?\nJON SNOW: In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.\nKARSI: Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.\"\nJON SNOW: It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.\nJON SNOW: Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.\nLOBODA: You saw this?\nJON SNOW: No. But I trust the man.\nKARSI: There are old stories about Dragonglass.\nLOBODA: There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.\nKARSI: And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?\nJON SNOW: Come with me and I'll share these weapons.\nKARSI: Come with you where?\nJON SNOW: There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.\nJON SNOW: I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life.\"\nKARSI: If…?\nJON SNOW: If you swear you join us when the real war begins.\nLOBODA: Where is Mance?\nJON SNOW: He died.\nLOBODA: How?\nJON SNOW: I put an arrow through his heart.\nLOBODA: I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.\nTORMUND: None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that's what we need today\"\nKARSI: I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows.\"\nJON SNOW: I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight.\"\nKARSI: You vouch for this man, Tormund?\"\nTORMUND: He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him.\"\nLOBODA: My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.\nKARSI: So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead.\"\nTORMUND: This is the way.\nWILDLING ELDER: I'm with Tormund. We stay here we're dead men. At least with King Crow there's a chance.\nGIANT: Tormund.\nLOBODA: Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That's our enemy. That has always been our enemy.\"\nKARSI: I fucking hate Thenns.\nJON SNOW: How many are with us? 5000?\nTORMUND: I'm not good at counting.\nJON SNOW: We're leaving too many behind.\nTORMUND: The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.\nJON SNOW: And he knew them better than I ever will.\nTORMUND: They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt. They'll come around.\nKARSI: Johnna is gonna look after you. She's in charge, you listen to her.\"\nDAUGHTER: I wanna go with you.\nKARSI: I need to get the old folks on the boats. I'm right behind you, I promise. Go on.\"\nWUN WUN: Lokh kif rukh?\nLOBODA: Shut the gate.\nLOBODA: Shut the gate!!\nSHOUTING: Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!\nLOBODA: Ready your arrows!\nJON SNOW: Get in line! Get in line!\nJON SNOW: Hold the line! Hold the line!\nNIGHTS WATCH BROTHER: Lord Commander!\nJON SNOW: Get them to the ship and come back for me!\nBROTHER: But you'll never make it--\nJON SNOW: Now!\nJON SNOW: You should be on one of those boats.\nKARSI: So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you're not there ?\nJON SNOW: You have my word. I've given orders.\nKARSI: Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders !\nTORMUND: If they get through, everyone dies !\"\nJON SNOW: Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!\nJON SNOW: The Dragonglass!\nLOBODA: You're with me, lad! Now!\"\nLOBODA: Get the glass.\nEDD: Fuck the glass! We're gonna die here.\nJON SNOW: Go! Go! Go!\nTORMUND: Wun Wun, to the sea.\"\nJON SNOW: Let's go now! Now!\nEND: EPISODE",
