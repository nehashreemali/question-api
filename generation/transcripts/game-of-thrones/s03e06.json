  "transcript": "GILLY: You've got too much wood in there.\nSAM: But the more wood, the bigger the fire.\"\nGILLY: It needs to breathe. Take off that big log.\nSAM: Huh. You know your fires.\nGILLY: Someone built your fires for you growing up?\nSAM: It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course.\"\nGILLY: I knew you were highborn.\nSAM: Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think.\"\nGILLY: What does it do?\nSAM: I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?\"\nGILLY: How much longer?\nSAM: Not so far. A few more days.\nGILLY: Is the Wall as big as they say?\nSAM: Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.\nGILLY: You're playing with me.\nSAM: I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best.\"\nGILLY: Do you sing?\nSAM: No. No, no, no. Not very well.\"\nGILLY: Sing me a song.\nSAM: Oh, all right. Let's see.\"\nSAM: Oh ahem. The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife /And she loves her little children.\"\nOSHA: That's not how you skin a rabbit.\nMEERA: I know how to skin a rabbit.\nOSHA: Not by the looks of it.\nOSHA: You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game.\"\nMEERA: I didn't see any game before I got here.\nOSHA: If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits.\"\nMEERA: Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall.\"\nOSHA: You learn how to use your fists, though.\"\nMEERA: Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?\"\nOSHA: I had someone else in mind.\nMEERA: Well, someone else is sitting right here.\"\nBRAN STARK: You're both very good at skinning rabbits.\nOSHA: Some of us are just a little better.\nMEERA: Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?\"\nOSHA: You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.\"\nBRAN STARK: Stop it!\nHODOR: Hodor.\nBRAN STARK: You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.\nOSHA: Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.\"\nBRAN STARK: You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.\nOSHA: Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.\"\nBRAN STARK: First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace.\"\nMEERA: Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.\nOSHA: I said so, didn't I?\"\nBRAN STARK: Osha!\nOSHA: You're a good little hunter.\nMEERA: Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you.\"\nOSHA: Don't push me.\nMEERA: Shh. I'm right here with you.\nRICKON: What's happening?\nMEERA: I'm right here with you.\nRICKON: What's wrong with him?\nMEERA: The visions take their toll.\nBRAN STARK: He's having one now?\nJOJEN: I saw Jon Snow.\nBRAN STARK: You saw him? At Castle Black?\nJOJEN: He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.\nTORMUND: Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.\nORELL: Your flock gets smaller every year.\nJON SNOW: You ever climbed it before?\nYGRITTE: No. But Tormundo s done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.\nJON SNOW: Aren't you?\nYGRITTE: Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down.\"\nYGRITTE: I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good.\"\nJON SNOW: You kill someone for them?\nYGRITTE: Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised.\"\nYGRITTE: He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.\nJON SNOW: Can we not talk about that here?\nYGRITTE: Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.\"\nJON SNOW: Did I seem scared the other day?\nYGRITTE: You were trembling like a leaf.\nJON SNOW: Only in the beginning.\nYGRITTE: Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.\"\nJON SNOW: What secret?\nYGRITTE: Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.\nYGRITTE: But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down.\"\nYGRITTE: It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.\nJON SNOW: I won't.\nYGRITTE: Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.\nTORMUND: Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers.\"\nARYA STARK: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.\nANGUY: You're good. You're not as good as you think you are.\nARYA STARK: Face, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to.\"\nANGUY: Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position.\"\nANGUY: Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.\nARYA STARK: What?\nANGUY: Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.\nARYA STARK: But I have to aim.\nANGUY: Never aim.\nARYA STARK: Never aim?\nANGUY: Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.\nARYA STARK: There's someone out there.\nANGUY: That's about far enough.\nMELISANDRE: We come as friends.\nANGUY: Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that.\"\nMELISANDRE: Valar morghulis.\nTHOROS: Valar dohaeris. I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.\nMELISANDRE: You are Thoros of Myr.\nMELISANDRE: The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?\nTHOROS: I failed.\nMELISANDRE: You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk.\"\nTHOROS: You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?\"\nTHOROS: My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?\"\nBERIC: Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.\nTHOROS: Lucky for the ladies.\nMELISANDRE: How many times has the Lord brought him back?\nTHOROS: Six.\nMELISANDRE: That's not possible.\nTHOROS: The Lord has smiled upon me.\nMELISANDRE: You should not have this power.\nTHOROS: I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will.\"\nTHOROS: I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him.\"\nMELISANDRE: You've been to the other side.\nBERIC: The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason.\"\nMELISANDRE: You have someone He needs.\nANGUY: Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel.\"\nANGUY: I'll get you the steel.\nMAN: Come on.\nARYA STARK: I don't like that woman.\nANGUY: That's 'cause you're a girl.\nARYA STARK: What does that have to do with anything?\nBERIC: Forgive me, lad.\"\nARYA STARK: What are you doing? Let go of him.\nARYA STARK: Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!\nBERIC: We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.\nARYA STARK: Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?\nARYA STARK: You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.\nTHOROS: We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.\nMELISANDRE: You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.\nARYA STARK: You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.\nMELISANDRE: I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again.\"\nYGRITTE: You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?\"\nTORMUND: Look out!\nYGRITTE: You all right?\nTORMUND: Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Sorry. Were you sleeping?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Wa-\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Please.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Please is not a body part.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'll tell you everything, please.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: If I win, you'll let me go?\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?\nTHEON GREYJOY: The North.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Too vague.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Deepwood Motte.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Terrible guess.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Now, where?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Last Hearth.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Karhold!\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?\nTHEON GREYJOY: No. It was just a guess.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Torrhen Karstark.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.\nTHEON GREYJOY: He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.\nTHEON GREYJOY: You swore to tell me if I-\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You're right.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Yes. You win.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I'm afraid I am.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Everything I told you is a lie.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I win.\nROBB STARK: Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.\nBLACK WALDER: The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come.\"\nLOTHAR: Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.\nROBB STARK: Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.\nBLACK WALDER: As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.\"\nEDMURE: I don't think that's-\nROBB STARK: We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.\nBLACK WALDER: And there's something else.\nROBB STARK: We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.\nBLACK WALDER: Not what, whom.\"\nEDMURE: What?\nEDMURE: No.\nLOTHAR: Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.\nEDMURE: How old is she?\nLOTHAR: Nineteen.\nEDMURE: Could I see her first?\nBLACK WALDER: You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.\nBRYNDEN: Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?\nLOTHAR: Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.\nBLACK WALDER: And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.\nROBB STARK: He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.\nEDMURE: Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord.\"\nROBB STARK: He's a proud man and we've wounded him.\nEDMURE: I didn't wound him. My answer is no.\nBRYNDEN: Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-\nEDMURE: The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.\nBRYNDEN: The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.\nROBB STARK: It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.\"\nEDMURE: He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.\"\nCATELYN STARK: You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?\nROBB STARK: I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.\nBRYNDEN: You recall that heroic engagement?\nEDMURE: I had something less permanent in mind.\nROBB STARK: I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.\"\nEDMURE: I'll marry her.\nROBB STARK: You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it.\"\nROOSE BOLTON: I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.\nBRIENNE: Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.\"\nROOSE BOLTON: When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason.\"\nROOSE BOLTON: I should send you back to Robb Stark.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?\"\nROOSE BOLTON: Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.\nJAIME LANNISTER: We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.\nROOSE BOLTON: You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.\"\nROOSE BOLTON: King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.\nJAIME LANNISTER: He'll make time for you.\nROOSE BOLTON: As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Shall we drink on it?\nROOSE BOLTON: I don't partake.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.\"\nROOSE BOLTON: Oh, she won't be going with you.\"\nBRIENNE: I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-\nROOSE BOLTON: You are charged with abetting treason.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm afraid I must insist.\nROOSE BOLTON: You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Impossible.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Why?\nOLENNA TYRELL: My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: Old.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Old?\nOLENNA TYRELL: Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Of course.\nOLENNA TYRELL: And you never-\nTYWIN LANNISTER: No.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Not once? Not in any way?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Never.\nOLENNA TYRELL: I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.\nOLENNA TYRELL: I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.\nOLENNA TYRELL: As an authority on myself, I must disagree.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: Oh\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.\nOLENNA TYRELL: You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.\nORELL: No!\nORELL: We've gotta cut them loose!\nTORMUND: No!\nJON SNOW: Take my hand!\nSANSA STARK: That's a wonderful pin.\nLORAS: Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so\"\nSANSA STARK: I'm very happy about\nLORAS: Uh, yes. I-I am as well.\"\nSANSA STARK: I feel like I'm in a dream.\nLORAS: Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?\"\nSANSA STARK: No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.\nLORAS: It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We can have them both killed.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.\nTYRION LANNISTER: On a boat you built.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?\nTYRION LANNISTER: The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What do you want me to say?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Who's going to tell her?\nSANSA STARK: Do you think people will like it?\nSHAE: I don't think they will even notice it.\nSANSA STARK: You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade.\"\nSHAE: I'm sure he does.\nSANSA STARK: Will they let me invite my family?\nSHAE: They haven't asked my opinion.\nSANSA STARK: But do you think they will?\nSHAE: No.\nMAID: Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I beg your pardon, my lady.\"\nSANSA STARK: Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.\"\nSANSA STARK: Of course.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Alone, if I may.\"\nSHAE: Why do you need to speak to her alone?\nSANSA STARK: Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.\nSANSA STARK: It's all right, really.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.\nVARYS: A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.\nVARYS: Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.\"\nVARYS: Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.\"\nVARYS: I did what I did for the good of the realm.\nPETYR BAELISH: The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.\nVARYS: But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.\nPETYR BAELISH: Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.\nPETYR BAELISH: Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.\nPETYR BAELISH: And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.\"",
