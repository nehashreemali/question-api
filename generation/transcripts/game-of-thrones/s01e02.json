And eat.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Isn't there anything else?\nJORAH MORMONT: The Dothraki have two things in abundance\nDOREAH: Khaleesi!\nIRRI: Your hands.\nJORAH MORMONT: We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.\"\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.\nJORAH MORMONT: As you wish, your Grace.\"\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: What good will my sympathies do them?\nTYRION LANNISTER: None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.\nTYRION LANNISTER: One word and I'll hit you again.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I'm telling mother!\nTYRION LANNISTER: Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: You can't...\nTYRION LANNISTER: Do you understand?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: The Prince will remember that, little lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Little brother.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Beloved siblings.\nMYRCELLA BARATHEON: Is Bran going to die?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Apparently not.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What do you mean?\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Maester says the boy may live.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Please.\nCATELYN STARK: I would have dressed, your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I never knew.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I am grateful..\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Perhaps this time she'll listen.\nJAIME LANNISTER: A sword for the wall?\nJON SNOW: I already have one.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Good man. Have you swung it yet?\nJON SNOW: Of course I have.\nJAIME LANNISTER: At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.\"\nJON SNOW: We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Is it \"\"we\"\" already? Have you taken your vows then?\"\nJON SNOW: Soon enough.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.\"\nARYA STARK: Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. \"\"My things weren't properly folded\"\", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.\"\nJON SNOW: It's good you've got help.\nARYA STARK: Watch. Nymeria, gloves.\"\nJON SNOW: Impressive.\nARYA STARK: Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!\"\nJON SNOW: I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.\nARYA STARK: A present?\nJON SNOW: Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.\nARYA STARK: It's so skinny.\nJON SNOW: So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.\"\nARYA STARK: I can be quick.\nJON SNOW: You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?\nARYA STARK: I think so.\nJON SNOW: First lesson\nARYA STARK: I know which end to use.\nJON SNOW: I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.\"\nARYA STARK: Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.\nJON SNOW: I came to say goodbye to Bran.\nCATELYN STARK: You've said it.\nJON SNOW: I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I want you to leave.\nCATELYN STARK: 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.\nEDDARD STARK: I have no choice.\nCATELYN STARK: That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.\"\nEDDARD STARK: You can. You must.\nROBB STARK: You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.\nJON SNOW: You Starks are hard to kill.\nROBB STARK: My mother?\nJON SNOW: She was very kind.\nROBB STARK: Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.\"\nJON SNOW: It was always my color.\nROBB STARK: Farewell, Snow.\"\nJON SNOW: And you, Stark.\"\nEDDARD STARK: There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.\"\nJON SNOW: Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?\"\nEDDARD STARK: The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I've half a mind to go with you.\nROBERT BARATHEON: What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.\"\nEDDARD STARK: You should have asked me 20 years ago.\nROBERT BARATHEON: There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I recall a few chances.\nROBERT BARATHEON: There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Bessie. She was one of yours.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?\nEDDARD STARK: Wylla.\nROBERT BARATHEON: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.\nEDDARD STARK: Nor will I.\nROBERT BARATHEON: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.\"\nEDDARD STARK: The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?\nROBERT BARATHEON: A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.\"\nEDDARD STARK: She's little more than a child.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.\nEDDARD STARK: Tell me we're not speaking of this.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.\"\nEDDARD STARK: But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.\"\nEDDARD STARK: He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.\"\nBENJEN STARK: Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.\nJON SNOW: Why do you read so much?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Look at me and tell me what you see.\nJON SNOW: Is this a trick?\nTYRION LANNISTER: What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.\"\nJON SNOW: Until your brother killed that King.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?\"\nJON SNOW: Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.\"\nJON SNOW: The Night's Watch protects the realm from...\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Talk to Poole about it.\nMAESTER LUWIN: Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...\"\nCATELYN STARK: I don't care about appointments!\nROBB STARK: I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.\nMAESTER LUWIN: Very good, my Lord. My Lady.\"\nROBB STARK: When was the last time you left this room?\nCATELYN STARK: I have to take care of him.\nROBB STARK: He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.\"\nCATELYN STARK: What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.\nROBB STARK: Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...\"\nCATELYN STARK: Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!\nROBB STARK: Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.\nASSASSIN: You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.\nCATELYN STARK: No!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Have you ever seen a dragon?\nIRRI: Dragon gone, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Everywhere? Even in the east?\nIRRI: No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.\nJHIQUI: It is known.\nDOREAH: A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The moon?\nDOREAH: He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.\"\nIRRI: Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?\nDOREAH: Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How old were you?\nDOREAH: I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Nine?!\nDOREAH: I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?\nDOREAH: Yes.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Will it take three years?\nDOREAH: No.\nBENJEN STARK: Welcome.\nCATELYN STARK: What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.\nMAESTER LUWIN: The boy was always sure-footed before.\nCATELYN STARK: Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Saw what, my lady?\"\nCATELYN STARK: I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.\nRODRICK CASSEL: Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.\"\nROBB STARK: They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...\nTHEON GREYJOY: If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I don't trust a raven to carry these words.\nROBB STARK: I'll ride to King's Landing.\nCATELYN STARK: No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.\nROBB STARK: Mother, you can't.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I must.\nRODRICK CASSEL: I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.\nCATELYN STARK: Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.\nRODRICK CASSEL: Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.\nROBB STARK: What about Bran?\nCATELYN STARK: I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.\nDOREAH: No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Finish a man?\nDOREAH: Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.\"\nDOREAH: You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.\nDOREAH: If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.\nSANSA STARK: Pardon me, Ser.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.\"\nSANSA STARK: I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.\"\nSANSA STARK: Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.\nMYCAH: I'll get you!\nSANSA STARK: Arya!\nARYA STARK: What are you doing here? Go away.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Your sister? And who are you, boy?\"\nMYCAH: Mycah, my Lord.\"\nSANSA STARK: He the butcher's boy.\nARYA STARK: He's my friend.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.\"\nMYCAH: She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.\"\nMYCAH: It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?\"\nARYA STARK: Stop it!\nSANSA STARK: Arya, stay out of this.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!\nSANSA STARK: No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I'll gut you, you little cunt!\"\nARYA STARK: Nymeria!\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Please don't.\nSANSA STARK: Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Then go! Don't touch me.\nSOLDIER: The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.\nARYA STARK: You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!\nSOLDIER: It's a direwolf.\nSOLDIER: I'll check down here.\nSOLDIER: I think I heard a noise.\nARYA STARK: Go!\nJORY CASSEL: My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.\nEDDARD STARK: Where is she?\nJORY CASSEL: She's been taken directly before the King.\nEDDARD STARK: Who took her?\nJORY CASSEL: The Lannisters found her.\nEDDARD STARK: Right, get back.\"\nJORY CASSEL: The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.\nEDDARD STARK: Back! Back to the inn. All back!\nARYA STARK: I'm sorry.\nEDDARD STARK: Are you hurt?\nARYA STARK: No.\nEDDARD STARK: It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How dare you speak to your King in that manner?\nROBERT BARATHEON: Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.\nARYA STARK: That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.\nARYA STARK: That's not what happened!\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.\nARYA STARK: Liar!\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Shut up!\nROBERT BARATHEON: Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?\"\nEDDARD STARK: In bed asleep.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.\"\nSANSA STARK: I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.\nARYA STARK: Liar! Liar liar liar!\nEDDARD STARK: Stop it! That's enough of that.\nARYA STARK: Liar liar liar!\nEDDARD STARK: Stop! Arya!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.\nROBERT BARATHEON: What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.\nROBERT BARATHEON: You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.\nEDDARD STARK: Gladly, your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?\nROBERT BARATHEON: I'd forgot the damned wolf.\nSOLDIER: We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: So be it.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We have another wolf.\nROBERT BARATHEON: As you will.\nEDDARD STARK: You can't mean it.\nROBERT BARATHEON: A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.\nSANSA STARK: He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!\"\nARYA STARK: Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!\nSANSA STARK: Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!\nEDDARD STARK: s this your command... your Grace?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Where is the beast?\nSOLDIER: Chained up outside, your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.\"\nEDDARD STARK: No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Is this some trick?\nEDDARD STARK: The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.\nEDDARD STARK: The butcher's boy... You rode him down?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: He ran... Not very fast.",
