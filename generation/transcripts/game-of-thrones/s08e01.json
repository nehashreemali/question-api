  "transcript": "TYRION LANNISTER: You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.\nVARYS: You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Because I have balls, and you don't.\"\nJON SNOW: I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.\nJON SNOW: Look at you.\nJON SNOW: You're a man.\nBRAN STARK: Almost.\nJON SNOW: Where's Arya?\nSANSA STARK: Lurking somewhere.\nJON SNOW: Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.\"\nSANSA STARK: Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.\"\nBRAN STARK: We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.\nBRAN STARK: He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.\"\nSANSA STARK: As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?\"\nUMBER: We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.\"\nUMBER: And my lord.\nUMBER: And my queen. Sorry.\nSANSA STARK: You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.\nJON SNOW: We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.\nMAESTER WOLKAN: At once, Your Grace.\"\nLYANNA MORMONT: Your Grace.\nLYANNA: But you're not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I'm not sure what you are now.\nLYANNA: A lord? Nothing at all?\nJON SNOW: It's not important.\nLYANNA: Not important? We named you King in the North.\nMAN: King of the North!\nJON SNOW: You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.\"\nSANSA STARK: May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Whatever they want.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.\"\nMAN: Sorry 'bout that.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Are these the last of the wagons?\nMAN: Aye.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: All right, let's get it all to the forges.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: My lord. My lady.\nROYCE: My lady.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.\nSANSA STARK: So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.\nSANSA STARK: It had its moments.\nSANSA STARK: Apologies for leaving like that.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.\"\nSANSA STARK: We both survived.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-\"\nSANSA STARK: Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?\nTYRION LANNISTER: She did.\nSANSA STARK: And you believed her?\nTYRION LANNISTER: She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.\nSANSA STARK: I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.\nARYA STARK: You used to be taller.\nJON SNOW: How did you sneak up on me?\nARYA STARK: How did you survive a knife through the heart?\nJON SNOW: I didn't.\nJON SNOW: You still have it.\nARYA STARK: Needle.\nJON SNOW: Have you ever used it?\nARYA STARK: Once or twice.\nARYA STARK: Valyrian steel.\nJON SNOW: Jealous?\nARYA STARK: Too heavy for me.\nJON SNOW: Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.\nARYA STARK: She doesn't like your queen, does she?\"\nJON SNOW: Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.\nARYA STARK: She's the smartest person I've ever met.\nJON SNOW: Now you're defending her?\nJON SNOW: You?\nARYA STARK: I'm defending our family. So is she.\nJON SNOW: Yeah. I'm her family too.\nARYA STARK: Don't forget that.\nQYBURN: Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Good.\nYARA GREYJOY: Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?\nEURON GREYJOY: But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.\nEURON GREYJOY: If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?\nEURON GREYJOY: I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.\nYARA GREYJOY: Are we in King's Landing?\nEURON GREYJOY: Mm.\nYARA GREYJOY: You picked the losing side.\nEURON GREYJOY: Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.\nEURON GREYJOY: But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Twenty-thousand men, is it?\"\nHARRY: Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.\"\nEURON GREYJOY: They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Horses?\nHARRY: Two thousand.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And elephants?\nHARRY: Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.\nHARRY: They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.\"\nHARRY: We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.\"\nEURON GREYJOY: Am I most welcome here?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.\nEURON GREYJOY: Good. As a true friend and an honored guest\nEURON GREYJOY: I was hoping we could talk in private.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: After the war. That was our agreement.\nEURON GREYJOY: Wars sometimes last years.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her.\"\nEURON GREYJOY: How?\nEURON GREYJOY: I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're insolent. I've executed men for less.\nEURON GREYJOY: They were lesser men.\nDIRAH: I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.\nCRAYAH: Burnt up some of my favorite boys.\nDIRAH: Archie, was it?\"\nCRAYAH: And William.\nDIRAH: Tall handsome William?\nCRAYAH: Yeah, tall handsome William.\"\nDIRAH: They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.\nBRONN: I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.\nCRAYAH: Did you?\nBRONN: Nearly killed it.\nMAREI: That's brave.\nCRAYAH: That boy Eddie.\nDIRAH: The ginger?\nCRAYAH: That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.\nDIRAH: How does he sleep with no eyelids?\nBRONN: All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?\"\nQYBURN: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.\nBRONN: You're kidding me.\nQYBURN: Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.\"\nBRONN: Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps.\"\nCRAYAH: You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.\nQYBURN: Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.\nBRONN: Which girl?\nQYBURN: The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.\nBRONN: She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.\"\nQYBURN: That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.\"\nBRONN: So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-\"\nQYBURN: She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.\nBRONN: Yeah, well, good luck with that.\"\nQYBURN: Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-\nQYBURN: She has a keen sense of poetic justice.\nBRONN: That fucking family.\nQYBURN: When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I wanted those elephants.\nEURON GREYJOY: So, how do I compare to the fat king?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're insulting my late husband?\nEURON GREYJOY: Are you offended?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.\"\nEURON GREYJOY: And the Kingslayer?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?\"\nEURON GREYJOY: Life is boring.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're not boring, I'll give you that.\"\nEURON GREYJOY: Do I please the queen?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: But now I want to be alone.\nEURON GREYJOY: I'm going to put a prince in your belly.\nYARA GREYJOY: Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.\"\nYARA GREYJOY: We can take our home back.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Daenerys went north.\nYARA GREYJOY: Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.\nTHEON GREYJOY: You're my queen. I go where you command.\nYARA GREYJOY: You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.\nTHEON GREYJOY: What is dead may never die.\nYARA GREYJOY: But kill the bastards anyway.\nWOLKAN: Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me\"\nVARYS: The Karstarks.\nTYRION LANNISTER: One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.\"\nDAVOS: Can't argue with that.\nDAVOS: Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And our queen is grateful.\nDAVOS: Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I sense that you're leading to a proposal.\nDAVOS: A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: They do make a handsome couple.\nVARYS: You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm not that old.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Not as old as him.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Our queen respects the wisdom of age.\nVARYS: Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: What is that?\nVARYS: Nothing lasts.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your sister doesn't like me.\nJON SNOW: She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How many today?\nDOTHRAKI MAN: Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.\nJON SNOW: What's the matter?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The dragons are barely eating.\nJON SNOW: What's wrong with them?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They don't like the North.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Go on.\nJON SNOW: I don't know how to ride a dragon.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.\nJON SNOW: What if he doesn't want me to?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.\"\nJON SNOW: What do I hold onto?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Whatever you can.\nJON SNOW: You've completely ruined horses for me.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We could stay a thousand years-\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No one would find us.\nJON SNOW: We'd be pretty old.\nJON SNOW: It's cold up here for a southern girl.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So keep your queen warm.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Don't be afraid.\nMAN: Gendry?\nMAN: He's here.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.\nSANDOR: You're saying you're good, is that it?\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-\nSANDOR: You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?\nARYA STARK: Leave him be.\nSANDOR: I heard you were here. You left me to die.\nARYA STARK: First I robbed you.\nSANDOR: You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive.\"\nARYA STARK: That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Yeah, thanks. So have you.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I mean, you look good.\"\nARYA STARK: Thanks. So do you.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.\"\nARYA STARK: Stay close to that forge, then.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Is that a command, Lady Stark?\"\nARYA STARK: Don't call me that.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: As you wish, milady.\"\nARYA STARK: Here's my wish.\nARYA STARK: Can you make it?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: What do you need something like this for?\nARYA STARK: Can you make it or not?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: You already have a sword. What's that?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.\nARYA STARK: You don't know any other rich girls.\nSANSA STARK: Come in.\nSANSA STARK: Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.\"\nJON SNOW: House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years.\"\" Isn't that what he said?\"\nSANSA STARK: I will stand behind Jon Snow,\"\" he said.\"\nSANSA STARK: The King in the North.\nJON SNOW: I told you we needed allies.\nSANSA STARK: You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.\nJON SNOW: I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.\"\nSANSA STARK: And a Targaryen queen.\nJON SNOW: Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.\"\nJON SNOW: Do you have any faith in me at all?\nSANSA STARK: You know I do.\nJON SNOW: She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.\nSANSA STARK: No, she's much prettier.\"\nSANSA STARK: Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?\nSAM TARLY: Oh!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So you're the man?\nSAM TARLY: Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.\nJORAH MORMONT: They could, they just wouldn't.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.\nSAM TARLY: Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Well, there must be something I could give you.\"\nSAM TARLY: If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: For what crime?\nSAM TARLY: Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.\"\nSAM TARLY: And also a sword.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: From the Citadel?\nSAM TARLY: From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.\nSAM TARLY: It wouldo ve been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Not Randyll Tarly?\nSAM TARLY: You know him?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.\nSAM TARLY: Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your brother stood with your father.\nSAM TARLY: Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Of course.\nSAM TARLY: What are you doing out here?\nBRAN STARK: Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth.\"\nSAM TARLY: No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?\"\nBRAN STARK: I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.\nJON SNOW: Sam?\nSAM TARLY: I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.\"\nJON SNOW: Were you hiding from me?\nSAM TARLY: Of course not.\nJON SNOW: What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?\nJON SNOW: What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?\nSAM TARLY: She's good.\nJON SNOW: Little Sam?\nSAM TARLY: Don't you know?\nJON SNOW: Know what?\nSAM TARLY: Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.\nSAM TARLY: She didn't tell you.\nJON SNOW: I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.\nSAM TARLY: Would you have done it?\nJON SNOW: Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.\"\nSAM TARLY: You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.\nJON SNOW: I wasn't a king.\nSAM TARLY: But you were. You've always been.\nJON SNOW: I gave up my crown, Sam.\"\nJON SNOW: I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.\nSAM TARLY: I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.\nSAM TARLY: Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.\nJON SNOW: What are you talking about?\nSAM TARLY: Your mother was Lyanna Stark.\nSAM TARLY: And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.\"\nJON SNOW: My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.\nSAM TARLY: No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.\"\nJON SNOW: Daenerys is our queen.\nSAM TARLY: She shouldn't be.\nJON SNOW: That's treason.\nSAM TARLY: It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?\nEDD: Stay back, he's got blue eyes!\"\nTORMUND: I've always had blue eyes!\nBERIC: Did you find anyone?\nEDD: The Umber boy.\nBERIC: It's a message. From the Night King.\nTORMUND: His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.\nEDD: We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.\nTORMUND: If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.\"\nTORMUND: We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-",
