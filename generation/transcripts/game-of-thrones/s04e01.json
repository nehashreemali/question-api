The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: From someone who no longer had need of it.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: And now we have two.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Two?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Well, thank you. It's glorious.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You'll have to train your left hand.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You'll never be as good.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.\nJAIME LANNISTER: How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Home?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: No?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I don't believe I asked you a question.\nJAIME LANNISTER: There's my answer.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: If you think your bloody honor comes before...\nJAIME LANNISTER: My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: What do you want?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Supper would be nice.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I suppose you want the sword back.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Keep it.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.\nBRONN: How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Please don't.\nBRONN: Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.\"\nBRONN: If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.\nBRONN: And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.\nBRONN: Oh.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ah, here we are.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Can you read the sigils?\nBRONN: Yellow balls?\nPODRICK: Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Boy knows his Dornish Houses.\nBRONN: I need a sigil.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?\"\nPODRICK: I don't see it, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company.\"\nDORNISH LORD: The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.\"\nDORNISH LORD: Will he?\nTYRION LANNISTER: And where is Prince Oberyn?\nDORNISH LORD: Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You must be weary after such a long journey.\nBRONN: Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?\nTYRION LANNISTER: We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.\nBRONN: How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?\"\nBRONN: I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Look at this one. How lovely is she?\nELLARIA: Beautiful. But pale.\nOBERYN MARTELL: They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.\nOBERYN MARTELL: You like?\nELLARIA: Timid. Timid bores me.\nOBERYN MARTELL: You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: I think she likes you. ELLARIA\"\" She has good taste.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: You're not timid, are you?\"\nELLARIA: Not timid.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Do you like women?\nWHORE: When they look like her, my lord.\"\nELLARIA: This one will do nicely.\nOLYVAR: Very good, my lady.\"\nELLARIA: Oh, I'm not a lady.\"\nOLYVAR: A term of courtesy in this establishment.\nELLARIA: A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.\nOLYVAR: Any of the others?\nOBERYN MARTELL: The two girls can leave.\nOBERYN MARTELL: You stay.\nOLYVAR: I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.\nOLYVAR: My lord.\nOBERYN MARTELL: I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?\"\nOLYVAR: Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Take off your clothes.\nOLYVAR: Which way do you like it?\nOBERYN MARTELL: My way .\nMORGAN: And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere. And now the rains\nELLARIA: Oberyn.\nMORGAN: Weep o'er his hall...\nELLARIA: Oberyn, don't.\"\nMORGAN: With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear.\"\nMORGANS FRIEND: You lost, friend?\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.\nMORGANS FRIEND: I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.\nOBERYN MARTELL: We don't like the smell.\nELLARIA: Come with me, lover.\"\nMORGAN: Gods, look at this one.\"\nOLYVAR: Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room.\"\nMORGAN: Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?\nOBERYN MARTELL: You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be...\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: trouble.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Apologies, my love.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm here to welcome you to the capital.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: If there's anything I can do to make your stay...\nOBERYN MARTELL: What are you? His hired killer?\nBRONN: It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: How did that come to pass?\nBRONN: Killed the right people, I suppose.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, they take all kinds.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Even Dornishmen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: I was invited to the royal wedding.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I thought we were speaking truth.\nOBERYN MARTELL: The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city...\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I wasn't actually present.\nOBERYN MARTELL: And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: I'm asking you a question.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I've heard rumors.\nOBERYN MARTELL: So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.\nOBERYN MARTELL: If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Ser Barristan.\nBARRISTAN: Your Grace.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?\nBARRISTAN: Gambling, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Gambling?\nCROWD: Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How long have they been at it?\nMISSANDEI: Since midnight, Your Grace.\"\nDAARIO: Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?\nDAARIO: The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.\nDAARIO: You like this girl? Must be frustrating.\nGREY WORM: You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis.\"\nDAARIO: I'd rather have no brains and two balls.\nSHAE: You need to eat something.\nSHAE: Pigeon pie.\nSANSA STARK: No, thank you.\"\nSHAE: Lemon cakes?\nSHAE: You love lemon cakes.\nSHAE: Tell her she needs to eat.\nTYRION LANNISTER: My lady, you do need to eat.\"\nSANSA STARK: I don't need to eat.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If I could have a moment alone with my wife.\nSHAE: She needs to eat.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I can't let you starve.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I swore to protect you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you.\"\nSANSA STARK: How can you help me?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't know, but I can try.\"\nSANSA STARK: I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.\nSANSA STARK: Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true.\"\nSANSA STARK: Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.\"\nSANSA STARK: I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.\nSHAE: My lion.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What are you doing?\nSHAE: What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.\nTYRION LANNISTER: How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.\nSHAE: I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course I haven't forgotten.\nSHAE: I want you. Don't you want me?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Things are a bit tense right now.\nSHAE: What things?\nTYRION LANNISTER: My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.\nSHAE: You need to relax.\nSHAE: Don't you want to relax?\nSHAE: What's wrong?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I told you. It's not a good time.\nSHAE: It's never a good time. You have your child bride now.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Shae.\nSHAE: Do you love her?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.\nSHAE: That's not an answer.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course I don't love her.\nSHAE: You tried to ship me away.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ship you away?\nSHAE: Give me diamonds and make me disappear.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What in the world are you talking about?\nSHAE: If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.\nSHAE: You want me to stay?\nQYBURN: A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Days?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Uh... a hook would be more practical.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Elegant, I think.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Thank you for your help with the other matter.\nQYBURN: The symptoms have abated?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.\"\nQYBURN: Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Odd little man.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: What symptoms?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Symptoms that are not your concern.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You let him touch you?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You jealous?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Well, they smell like Pycelle.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You drink more than you used to.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Yes.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Why?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: It must have been traumatic for you.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.\nJAIME LANNISTER: A rather short siege.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So...\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Father disowned me today.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He can't disown you. You're all he's got.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You're forgetting Tyrion.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Not now.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Something's changed.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?\nJAIME LANNISTER: What do you want me to apologize for?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: For leaving me.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You took too long.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I... What are you saying?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I'm saying you took too long.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Come in.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Go away.\nMAREI: Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important.\"\nTORMUND: You plan on killing all the crows yourself?\nYGRITTE: Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?\nTORMUND: We wait for Mance's orders.\nYGRITTE: You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.\"\nTORMUND: And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there.\"\nYGRITTE: Yeah, well, he's a liar.\"\nTORMUND: He is? Shouldn't it be \"\"he was\"\"? You said you put three arrows in him.\"\nYGRITTE: I did.\nTORMUND: I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go.\"\nTORMUND: Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.\nTORMUND: Mance sent you?\nTORMUND: How did you find us?\nTORMUND: You came from the south, not the north.\"\nWARG: Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.\nSTYR: Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?\nTORMUND: Help yourself.\nSTYR: Maybe everything's just better fed down here.\nSTYR: Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?\"\nSTYR: You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?\"\nTORMUND: I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.\nSTYR: She yours?\nYGRITTE: I'm not anybody's.\nSTYR: Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.\nSTYR: Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.\"\nSTYR: I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow.\"\nOFFICER: Draw. Loose.\nJON SNOW: Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. \"\"He said, \"\" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.\"\" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could.\"\nSAM: Sometimes I want to hate you.\nSAM: Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading.\"\nSAM: They're... they're ready for you.\nJON SNOW: He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.\nSAM: No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.\nJON SNOW: I've done plenty wrong.\nALLISER THORNE: So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?\nJON SNOW: I didn't murder him.\nALLISER THORNE: No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?\nJON SNOW: He wanted me to kill him.\nJANOS SLYNT: A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?\nJON SNOW: The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.\nALLISER THORNE: Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.\nJON SNOW: Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...\"\nJANOS SLYNT: The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.\nJON SNOW: Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl.\"\nJANOS SLYNT: You admit to breaking your vows, then?\"\nJON SNOW: I do.\nJANOS SLYNT: The law is the law. The boy must die.\nMAESTER AEMON: If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men.\"\nALLISER THORNE: There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.\nJON SNOW: While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.\"\nALLISER THORNE: Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.\nJON SNOW: 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him.\"\nJANOS SLYNT: Giants?\nJON SNOW: Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?\"\nJANOS SLUNT: I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.\"\nJON SNOW: And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.\nJANOS SLYNT: How dare you?!\nJON SNOW: There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.\nJON SNOW: Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?\nMAESTER AEMON: None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on.\"\nALLISER THORNE: I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.\"\nMAESTER AEMON: Yes, you are.\"\nALLISER THORNE: And I don't trust the bastard.\nMAESTER AEMON: He told the truth.\nALLISER THORNE: And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?\nMAESTER AEMON: I grew up in King's Landing.\nOLENNA TYRELL: No. No. You're a queen, not an ox.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: Nonsense.\nOLENNA TYRELL: My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.\nOLENNA TYRELL: You watch that. Even here, even with me.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: My word.\nBRIENNE: My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.\nOLENNA TYRELL: We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.\nOLENNA TYRELL: I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.\nBRIENNE: My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: You dare not refuse.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: A shadow?\nBRIENNE: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Joffrey is our king now.\nBRIENNE: I meant no offense.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: And you've given none.\nJAIME LANNISTER: All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.\nMERYN: I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble.\"\nMERYN: The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.\nJAIME LANNISTER: The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Busy getting captured.\nJAIME LANNISTER: So this is the famous \"\"Book of Brothers\"\"? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: So they say.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Ser Jaime Lannister.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.\nJAIME LANNISTER: There's still time.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Have you ever been to Meereen?\nMISSANDEI: Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And?\nMISSANDEI: They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?\nMISSANDEI: If they're smart, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You were told to ride at the back of the train.\nDAARIO: Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy.\"\nMISSANDEI: Your Grace.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: All right, what is this matter of strategy?\"\nDAARIO: A dusk rose.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?\nDAARIO: And this one's called lady's lace.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Would you like to walk without shoes?\nDAARIO: You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy.\"\nDAARIO: Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You are a gambler, aren't you?\"\nDAARIO: Your Grace.\nJORAH MORMONT: There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How many miles are there between here and Meereen?\nBARRISTAN: 163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.\nBRIENNE: There she is.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Yes, there she is.\"\nBRIENNE: And? You made a promise.\nJAIME LANNISTER: To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.\nBRIENNE: To keep them safe.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication.\"\nBRIENNE: A complication does not release you from a vow.\nJAIME LANNISTER: What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?\nBRIENNE: Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks.\"\nSER DONTOS: It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.\nSANSA STARK: You're drunk.\nSER DONTOS: Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?\nSANSA STARK: Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.\nSER DONTOS: I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.\"\nSANSA STARK: Anyone would have done the same.\nSER DONTOS: But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life.\"\nSER DONTOS: It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.\"\nSANSA STARK: I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.\"\nSER DONTOS: I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.\nSANSA STARK: I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.\"\nSER DONTOS: Yeah.\nARYA STARK: When am I going to get a horse of my own?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: The little lady wants a pony.\nARYA STARK: The little lady wants away from your stench.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?\"\nARYA STARK: Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: No.\nARYA STARK: You're not very smart, are you?\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I'm not a thief.\nARYA STARK: You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: A man's got to have a code.\nARYA STARK: You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much.\"\nARYA STARK: I'm hungry. You're hungry.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Five horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach.\"\nARYA STARK: I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.\nARYA STARK: He killed Lommy.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: What the fuck's a Lommy?\nARYA STARK: He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Got what?\nARYA STARK: My sword Needle.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Needle? Of course you named your sword.\nARYA STARK: Lots of people name their swords.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Lots of cunts.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: What are you... get back here.\nARYA STARK: My brother gave me that sword.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Get back here.\nARYA STARK: He killed my friend.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.\nMAN: Come on, give it up.\"\nMAN: Come here.\nMAN: Let's have a feel there.\nMAN: Leave it.\nINNKEEPER: Please, she's a good girl.\"\nPOLLIVER: Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.\nPOLLIVER: I know you.\nPOLLIVER: You're the Hound.\nPOLLIVER: Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?\nPOLLIVER: Just keeping the king's peace.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: No need. The war's over.\nPOLLIVER: So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: None taken.\nPOLLIVER: He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun?\"\nPOLLIVER: But I don't need to tell you that, eh?\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: She's all right. I've had better.\nPOLLIVER: You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I'm not going to King's Landing.\nPOLLIVER: Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Fuck the king.\nPOLLIVER: When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.\nPOLLIVER: You got money to pay for it?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You paid for it?\nPOLLIVER: No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Not a penny.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I'll still take that chicken.\nPOLLIVER: Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.\nPOLLIVER: You don't seem to understand the situation.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.\"\nPOLLIVER: You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Someone is.\nARYA STARK: Something wrong with your leg, boy?\"\nPOLLIVER: What? What do you mean?\nARYA STARK: Can you walk? I've got to carry you?\nPOLLIVER: Carry me?\nARYA STARK: Fine little blade.\nARYA STARK: Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.",
