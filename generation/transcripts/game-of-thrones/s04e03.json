Where's Sansa?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Where is she?!\nTYWIN LANNISTER: No one leaves the capital! No one!\nSER DONTOS: Get in.\nSANSA STARK: Where are we going?\nSER DONTOS: Somewhere safe.\nSER DONTOS: Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know.\"\nSANSA STARK: Lord Baelish?\nPETYR BAELISH: Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.\nSER DONTOS: Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.\nPETYR BAELISH: Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water.\"\nSER DONTOS: I should get back before someone thinks to look for me. LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?\"\nSER DONTOS: 10,000.\"\nSER DONTOS: Wait!\nPETYR BAELISH: Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?\"\nSANSA STARK: I didn't murder anyone.\nPETYR BAELISH: I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.\"\nSANSA STARK: Why did you kill him?\nPETYR BAELISH: Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.\nSANSA STARK: He saved me.\nPETYR BAELISH: Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.\"\nSANSA STARK: He was helping me because I saved his life.\nPETYR BAELISH: Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?\nSANSA STARK: We're all liars here.\nPETYR BAELISH: Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: So am I the queen?\nOLENNA TYRELL: More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: What was it like?\nOLENNA TYRELL: They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: But I would have been the queen.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I'm not trying to trick you.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: It means I'll become king.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: A good king?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: This is hardly the place or the time.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Holiness?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Justice.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: No.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: No.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: What about strength?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Wisdom.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Yes!\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Wisdom is what makes a good king.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: A king needs a queen.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Yes.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.\nJAIME LANNISTER: How are you?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I'm all right.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You are. You will be. I'll see to that.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.\nSEPTON: Yes, my lord. All of you.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. \"\"A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.\"\" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he...\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I don't know what I saw.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Jaime, not here, please. Please.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Stop it. Stop it. Stop.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Stop it. Stop.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Stop. Stop. It's not right.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It's not right. It's not right.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I don't care.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Don't.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Don't. Jaime, don't.\"\nARYA STARK: Gonna rain soon. Where are we?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Near Fairmarket, I think.\"\nARYA STARK: You think? You don't have a map?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: No, I don't have a map.\"\nARYA STARK: Maybe we should get one.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.\nARYA STARK: How far is it to the Eyrie?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Far.\nARYA STARK: And you're sure we're going the right way?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way.\"\nARYA STARK: On your way where?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me.\"\nARYA STARK: I'd like to see Braavos one day.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Why Braavos?\nARYA STARK: I have friends there.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I doubt it.\nFARMER HAMLET: Seven blessings to you.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: What do you want?\nFARMER HAMLET: What do I want? This is my land.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: If I'm standing on it, it's my land.\"\nARYA STARK: We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.\nARYA STARK: He's never been the same.\nFARMER HAMLET: Which house did he fight for?\nARYA STARK: The Tullys of Riverrun.\nFARMER HAMLET: There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it.\"\nFARMER HAMLET: We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You got to do all seven of the fuckers?\nARYA STARK: Father!\nFARMER HAMLET: We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.\nARYA STARK: I'm so sorry.\nARYA STARK: Really good.\nFARMER HAMLET: Did you fight at the Twins?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.\nFARMER HAMLET: The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Guest right don't mean much anymore.\nFARMER HAMLET: It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You got any ale?\nFARMER HAMLET: Afraid not.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: How can a man not keep ale in his home?\nFARMER HAMLET: You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Fair wages for fair work.\nARYA STARK: What did you do?!\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Get your horse saddled.\nARYA STARK: You told me you weren't a thief.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I wasn't.\nARYA STARK: He took us in. He fed us and you...\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter.\"\nARYA STARK: You don't know that.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.\nARYA STARK: You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?\nRANGER: Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.\nALLISER THORNE: There he is, Sam the Slayer.\"\nJANOS SLYNT: Going to visit your wildling whore?\nSAM: She's not a whore.\nJANOS SLYNT: No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.\nSAM: They all think I'm lying.\nGILLY: About what?\nSAM: Killing the white Walker.\nGILLY: You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.\nSAM: But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...\nGILLY: A what?\nSAM: Well, a wildling.\"\nGILLY: My father hated that word.\nSAM: It's not a very nice word, I suppose.\"\nGILLY: I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?\"\nSAM: So... are you all right? No one bothering you?\nGILLY: I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.\nSAM: I worry about it sometimes. All the time.\nGILLY: Why do you worry about it?\nSAM: 100 men, one woman.\"\nGILLY: They've got other things to think about.\nSAM: That's the only thing they think about.\nGILLY: You're being silly.\nSAM: I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.\nGILLY: What about you?\nSAM: What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.\nGILLY: Thank you.\nSAM: For what?\nGILLY: For worrying about me.\nSAM: I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep.\"\nGILLY: So what are you saying?\nSAM: Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.\nGILLY: Are you bored of me?\nSAM: Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.\nGILLY: I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.\nDAVOS: Your Grace.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?\nDAVOS: Joffrey?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.\nDAVOS: I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night...\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: What progress have you made?\nDAVOS: I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: House Peasebury.\nDAVOS: House Musgood.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: House Musgood.\nDAVOS: And House Haigh.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.\nDAVOS: Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: The Golden Company?\nDAVOS: They've never broken a contract.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: They're sellswords.\nDAVOS: We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: We don't have any gold.\nDAVOS: Not yet.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -\"\nSHIREEN: You're late.\nDAVOS: I'm sorry, Princess.\"\nSHIREEN: I thought you weren't coming.\nDAVOS: The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.\nSHIREEN: You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say \"\"ka-nigit.\"\"\"\nDAVOS: That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you.\"\nSHIREEN: It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.\nSHIREEN: You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.\nDAVOS: The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos.\nDAVOS: Thank you very much.\nSHIREEN: I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.\nDAVOS: No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler.\"\nSHIREEN: What's the difference?\nDAVOS: Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right.\"\nSHIREEN: My father says a criminal is a criminal.\nDAVOS: Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.\nSHIREEN: You've sailed to Braavos?\nDAVOS: Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction...\"\nSHIREEN: What was that for?\nDAVOS: I need you to write a message.\nSHIREEN: You should write it yourself. It's good practice.\nDAVOS: It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.\nDAVOS: To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.\nSHIREEN: But that's not you.\nDAVOS: I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.\nSAM: He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?\"\nMOLES TOWN WHORE: Precious little thing.\nMOLES TOWN WHORE: What's his name?\nGILLY: Sam.\nMOLES TOWN WHORE: Lovely. That the daddy?\nGILLY: No.\nMOLES TOWN WHORE: Where's the daddy?\nGILLY: He's dead.\nMOLES TOWN WHORE: Oh. Where you from?\nGILLY: North of here.\nMOLES TOWN WHORE: North of here? You a fucking wildling?\nMOLES TOWN MADAM: Only room and board?\nSAM: That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.\nMOLES TOWN MADAM: Could find other work for her, too.\"\nSAM: No other work.\nMOLES TOWN MADAM: There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.\nSAM: I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?\nGILLY: You protected me north of the Wall.\nSAM: This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's.\"\nSAM: You have to trust me. It's for the best.\nGILLY: Best for you.\nSAM: Oh, Gilly. Please don't.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Greedy.\nELLARIA: No?\nOLYVAR: I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?\nELLARIA: That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Your loss.\nOLYVAR: You like them both the same? Boys and girls?\nOBERYN MARTELL: Does that surprise you?\nOLYVAR: Everyone has a preference.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Then everyone is missing half the worldo s pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides.\"\nOLYVAR: I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.\nOBERYN MARTELL: What are you, 25?\"\nELLARIA: Children.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day.\"\nOLYVAR: Did you?\nELLARIA: He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.\nOBERYN MARTELL: They will all have to line up behind you.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Prince Oberyn.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Lord Tywin.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: May we have the room?\nELLARIA: Call my name if you need me, lover.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Would you like to sit?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: No, thank you.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Some wine?\nOBERYN MARTELL: I'm sorry about your grandson.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Are you?\nOBERYN MARTELL: I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Which way is that?\nOBERYN MARTELL: Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Some believe the king choked.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.\nOBERYN MARTELL: I did. This is why I know.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?\nOBERYN MARTELL: You think we conspired together?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: What did you discuss?\nOBERYN MARTELL: The death of my sister.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: For which you blame me.\nOBERYN MARTELL: She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.\nOBERYN MARTELL: So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Categorically.\nOBERYN MARTELL: I would like to speak with the Mountain.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.\nOBERYN MARTELL: He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I could arrange for this meeting.\nOBERYN MARTELL: But you want something in return.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Why?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.\nOBERYN MARTELL: I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Podrick. Apologies for the stench.\nPODRICK: I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: A noble effort.\nPODRICK: They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?\nPODRICK: I've heard nothing, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?\nPODRICK: You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?\nPODRICK: No, my lord. You didn't?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?\"\nPODRICK: Your father.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course.\nPODRICK: Mace Tyrell.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.\nPODRICK: And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.\nPODRICK: I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.\"\nPODRICK: My lord, she's gone.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Gone?\nPODRICK: No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...\nTYRION LANNISTER: No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick.\"\nPODRICK: Yes, my lord?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: They'll be following you now.\nPODRICK: Who will?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.\"\nPODRICK: Any other witnesses, my lord?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Varys could vouch for me if he dared.\nPODRICK: He's already been called as a witness for the queen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.\nPODRICK: I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Why not?\nPODRICK: They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?\nPODRICK: I'll ask, my lord.\"\nPODRICK: There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?\nPODRICK: I didn't tell them anything, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Are you going to accept their offer?\nPODRICK: My lord.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.\"\nPODRICK: You've been good to me, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that.\"\nPODRICK: I already gave them an answer, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell.\"\nPODRICK: Farewell, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.\nOLLY: Mother says it's time to eat.\nGUYMON: What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.\nOLLY: Potatoes.\nGUYMON: Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got...\"\nMAN: The wildlings!\nOLLYS MOTHER: Guymon! Hide. Hide!\nSTYR: You know how to get to Castle Black?\nOLLY: Yes. Yes.\nSTYR: Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.\nYARWYCK: We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.\nMEN: Aye! Aye!\nYARWYCK: Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.\nMEN: Aye!\nALLISER THORNE: If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time.\"\nMAESTER AEMON: We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.\nPYP: There's got to be a way to protect them.\nALLISER THORNE: You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?\"\nJON SNOW: Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them.\"\nALLISER THORNE: We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.\nPYP: Rangers returning.\nJON SNOW: Help him.\nDOLOROUS EDD: Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.\nALLISER THORN: What took you so long?\nGRENN: We were held up.\nALLISER THORN: By what?\nGRENN: Chains.\nDOLOROUS EDD: We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.\nJON SNOW: And the mutineers stayed?\nDOLOROUS EDD: They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.\nJON SNOW: We need to ride north and kill them all.\nALLISER THORN: We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait.\"\nJON SNOW: It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.\"\nPYP: I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Are they attacking?\nJORAH MORMONT: A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What is he doing?\nBARRISTAN SELMY: I believe he means to...\nMISSANDEI: He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole.\"\nBARRISTAN SELMY: Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?\"\nGREY WORM: Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.\nBARRISTAN SELMY: Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Which is why you must remain by my side.\nJORAH MORMONT: I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life.\"\nDAARIO: I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.\nMISSANDEI: He is very brave, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You sure you don't want a horse?\nDAARIO: Why would I want a horse?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Horses are faster than men.\nDAARIO: Horses are dumber than men.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I am Daenerys Stormborn.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Fire!",
