And you will make this right.\nJEOR: Wait outside.\nJON SNOW: Lord Commander-\nJEOR: Now!\nSAM: Lord Commander-\nJEOR: Leave us.\nJEOR: What did you do?\nJON SNOW: I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.\"\nJEOR: What business is that of yours?\nJON SNOW: No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys...\"\nJON SNOW: You know.\nJEOR: Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.\nJON SNOW: Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.\nJEOR: Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster.\"\nJON SNOW: I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.\nJEOR: Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn.\"\nJEOR: Don't lose it again.\nSAM: Gilly.\nGILLY: You're leaving.\nSAM: I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother.\"\nGILLY: I can't take it.\nSAM: Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.\nGILLY: You, you shouldn't give it away.\"\nSAM: I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.\nSAM: Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.\nHODOR: Hodor.\nLUWIN: Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons.\"\nBRAN STARK: Every night it's the same.\nBRAN STARK: I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.\"\nLUWIN: That's exactly what they are, Bran - stories.\"\nBRAN STARK: So she was lying? They don't exist?\nLUWIN: Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.\"\nBRAN STARK: No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream.\"\nLUWIN: What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.\nLUWIN: This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on.\"\nLUWIN: All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Loras! Highgarden!\nMAN: Get him!\nCROWD: Oh!\nLORAS: Yield! I yield.\nRENLY: Well fought. Approach.\nRENLY: Rise. Remove your helm.\nRENLY: You are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you.\"\nRENLY: That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours.\"\nBRIENNE: Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.\"\nLORAS: What?\nBRIENNE: I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.\"\nRENLY: Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.\"\nCOLEN: Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.\nRENLY: Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss.\"\nCATELYN STARK: You are most kind.\nRENLY: My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husbando s murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head.\"\nCATELYN STARK: It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord.\"\nBRIENNE: Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.\nRENLY: There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.\nLORAS: Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?\nCATELYN STARK: I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.\"\nLORAS: If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts.\"\nCATELYN STARK: My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.\"\nRENLY: Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning.\"\nGERARD: Your Grace.\nRENLY: Gerard. How's your foot?\nGERARD: Better, Your Grace.\"\nGERARD: They don't know their own size is all.\nRENLY: Good man.\nRENLY: I have a hundred thousand men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.\nCATELYN STARK: And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them.\"\nRENLY: Why?\nCATELYN STARK: Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.\nRENLY: Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey.\"\nBRIENNE: At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?\"\nRENLY: That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.\nBRIENNE: If you'll follow me, my lady.\"\nCATELYN STARK: You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.\"\nBRIENNE: I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: What are you doing here?\nYARA GREYJOY: I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: You lying bitch.\nYARA GREYJOY: It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.\nYARA GREYJOY: You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Why didn't you tell me?\nYARA GREYJOY: I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.\nBALON: The plans are made. It's time you heard them.\nYARA GREYJOY: Father.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Father.\nBALON: The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall.\"\nBALON: Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte.\"\nYARA GREYJOY: I've always wanted a castle.\nTHEON GREYJOY: And what's my role in all this?\nBALON: You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.\nTHEON GREYJOY: A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?\nYARA GREYJOY: The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm to fight fishermen?\nYARA GREYJOY: Be careful of their nets.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily.\"\nYARA GREYJOY: They won't even know we're there until it's too late.\nTHEON GREYJOY: What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior.\"\nBALON: Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.\"\nBALON: What are our words? Our words?\nTHEON GREYJOY: We do not sow.\nBALON: We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.\nTHEON GREYJOY: You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: You gave me away!\nTHEON GREYJOY: Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.\nYARA GREYJOY: You'd have our father bow down to your other family?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I have no other family.\nYARA GREYJOY: Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you.\"\nSHAE: You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-\nTYRION LANNISTER: Keep your voice down.\nSHAE: Why? You think your father can hear me? He's three hundred miles away!\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Again, only temporary.\"\nSHAE: Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.\nTYRION LANNISTER: But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.\nSHAE: Scullion? What is a scullion?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Kitchen wench.\nSHAE: A kitchen wench?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, but-\"\nSHAE: Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.\nSHAE: I'm the weakness?\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's a compliment, my lady.\"\nSHAE: How is being a weakness a compliment?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Language can be a bit tricky here.\nSHAE: Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench.\"\nMYRCELLA: When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Soon, darling, when the war is over.\"\nMYRCELLA: Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The princess just spoke to you.\nSANSA STARK: Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He might.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Would you like that?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: No. I don't think so.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?\"\nSANSA STARK: Come in.\nSANSA STARK: Who are you?\nSHAE: I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden.\"\nSANSA STARK: I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.\nSHAE: No.\nSANSA STARK: What are you doing?\nSHAE: Waiting for you to tell me what to do.\nSANSA STARK: I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.\nSHAE: What things?\nSANSA STARK: Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.\"\nSANSA STARK: No.\nSHAE: You said to brush your-\nSANSA STARK: Not now.\nSHAE: Your chamber pot is empty.\nSANSA STARK: Clean the table.\nSANSA STARK: Have you ever been a handmaiden before?\nSHAE: Yes.\nSANSA STARK: For whom?\nSHAE: Lady Zuriff.\nSANSA STARK: Lady Zuriff\nSANSA STARK: There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.\nSHAE: She wasn't in this city.\nSANSA STARK: I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job.\"\nSHAE: Do you want me to leave?\nSANSA STARK: Just brush my hair.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.\nPYCELLE: I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Please.\nPYCELLE: Thank you, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?\"\nPYCELLE: Why, yes, of course, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.\nPYCELLE: Matrimony, huh? Yes.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake.\"\nPYCELLE: Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it.\"\nPYCELLE: Myrcella sent away to Dorne?\nTYRION LANNISTER: But remember, the Queen mustn't know.\"\nVARYS: Ooh. \"\"The Queen mustn't know.\"\" I love conversations that begin this way.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.\nVARYS: Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Precisely.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.\nTYRION LANNISTER: But remember, you must tell no one.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Tell no one what?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.\nPETYR BAELISH: She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?\nTYRION LANNISTER: For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Who better?\nPETYR BAELISH: Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Harrenhal is cursed.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You served my family well in the matter of the succession.\nPETYR BAELISH: So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Good. Oh. And remember-\nPETYR BAELISH: The Queen mustn't know.\nRENLY: That must hurt.\nRENLY: What? What is it?\nLORAS: A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.\nRENLY: Brienne is a very capable warrior.\nRENLY: And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.\nLORAS: Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.\nRENLY: I'll make it up to you.\nLORAS: No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone.\"\nLORAS: Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.\nRENLY: And Margaery's a virgin?\nLORAS: Officially. Shall I bring her to you?\nRENLY: I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: As is your right. You are a king.\nRENLY: You look very beautiful.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Thank you, Your Grace.\"\nRENLY: It's a lovely gown.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way.\"\nRENLY: You certainly don't need it.\nRENLY: Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.\"\nRENLY: Must be the wine.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Here, let me.\"\nRENLY: I'm sorry.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Do you want my brother to come in and help?\nRENLY: What?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.\nRENLY: I don't know what you're talking about.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Whatever you need to do. You are a king.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Dorne is the safest place for her.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.\nTYRION LANNISTER: That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: She'll be a hostage.\nTYRION LANNISTER: A guest.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's done, Cersei.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You cannot stop it.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No!\nTYRION LANNISTER: Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Get out! Get out!\nPRIEST: Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I would.\nDROWNED PRIEST: Kneel.\nDROWNED PRIEST: Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: What is dead may never die.\nDROWNED PRIEST: What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.\nPETYR BAELISH: I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: No, afraid not. Sorry about that.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Leave me out of your next deception.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.\nTYRION LANNISTER: No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Find him?\nBRONN: Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: No, you don't.\"\nBRONN: No, I don't.\"\nPYCELLE: What is the meaning of this?\nPYCELLE: No, please, please.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You disappoint me, Grand Maester.\"\nPYCELLE: I am your loyal servant.\nTYRION LANNISTER: So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.\nPYCELLE: No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you.\"\nPYCELLE: The eunuch has spies everywhere.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.\nPYCELLE: No, no, no.\"\nTIMETT: There are no goats, halfman.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, make do.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: How long have you been spying for my sister?\nPYCELLE: All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't like his beard.\nPYCELLE: What? What?\nPYCELLE: Oh, no. No.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?\"\nPYCELLE: Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: So you poisoned him?\nPYCELLE: No. Never.\nTYRION LANNISTER: But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.\"\nPYCELLE: Lannister, I always served Lannister.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.\nPYCELLE: Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: For your trouble.\nVARYS: You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Good. One of my better ideas.\nVARYS: And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?\nVARYS: Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.\nVARYS: Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Why, am I about to hear one?\"\nVARYS: Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Depends on the sellsword.\nVARYS: Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.\nTYRION LANNISTER: He has a sword, the power of life and death.\"\nVARYS: But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I've decided I don't like riddles.\nVARYS: Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.\"\nYOREN: You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.\"\nARYA STARK: I can't sleep.\nARYA STARK: I don't like the taste.\nYOREN: Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest.\"\nYOREN: What?\nARYA STARK: How do you sleep?\nYOREN: Same as most men, I think.\"\nARYA STARK: But you've seen things, horrible things.\"\nYOREN: Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many.\"\nARYA STARK: How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?\nYOREN: You didn't see that. I made damn sure.\nARYA STARK: I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister.\"\nYOREN: You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?\"\nYOREN: Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Get up.\nARYA STARK: Get up.\nYOREN: Keep out of sight, both of you.\"\nARYA STARK: No, I'm not afraid.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I can fight.\nYOREN: Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back.\"\nYOREN: Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!\"\nMAN: Come on, move, move!\"",
