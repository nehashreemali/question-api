Let me send some men with you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm going alone.\nGREY WORM: In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die.\"\nJON SNOW: Grey Worm!\nJON SNOW: It's over.\nGREY WORM: These men are prisoners. It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.\nDAVOS: How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.\nGREY WORM: They are breathing.\nDAVOS: Look around you, friend. We won.\"\nGREY WORM: I obey my queen's commands, not yours.\"\nJON SNOW: And what are the queen's commands?\nGREY WORM: Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister.\"\" These are free men. They chose to fight for her.\"\nDAVOS: Easy, men. Easy! Easy.\"\nDAVOS: Jon. We should speak with the queen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Blood of my blood.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Torgo Nudho.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Will you break the wheel with me?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You freed your brother. You committed treason.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Take him.\nJON SNOW: What are you doing here?\nJON SNOW: Hey, what happened?\"\nARYA STARK: I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.\nJON SNOW: She's everyone's queen now.\nARYA STARK: Try telling Sansa.\nJON SNOW: Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.\nARYA STARK: Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Did you bring any wine?\nJON SNOW: No.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, \"\"See, I told you.\"\" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: So is there life after death?\nJON SNOW: Not that I've seen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.\nJON SNOW: You didn't.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not.\"\nJON SNOW: I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.\nJON SNOW: And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.\nJON SNOW: You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.\"\nJON SNOW: Cersei left her no choice.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.\"\nJON SNOW: She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And she burned down a city for it.\nJON SNOW: Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Would you have done it?\nJON SNOW: What?\nTYRION LANNISTER: You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?\"\nJON SNOW: I don't know.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.\"\nJON SNOW: What's it matter what I'd do?\nTYRION LANNISTER: It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.\nJON SNOW: Love is the death of duty.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You just came up with that?\nJON SNOW: Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?\nJON SNOW: That's her decision. She is the queen.\nJON SNOW: I'm sorry it came to this.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?\nJON SNOW: My sisters will be loyal to the throne.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.\nJON SNOW: She doesn't get to choose.\nTYRION LANNISTER: No. But you do. And you have to choose now.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.\"\nJON SNOW: I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: It was necessary.\nJON SNOW: Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.\nJON SNOW: And Tyrion?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?\"\nJON SNOW: Forgive him.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I can't.\nJON SNOW: You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand.\"\nJON SNOW: Please, Dany.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.\nJON SNOW: The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.\nJON SNOW: How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Because I know what is good. And so do you.\nJON SNOW: I don't.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You do. You do. You've always known.\nJON SNOW: What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They don't get to choose.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together.\"\nJON SNOW: You are my queen. Now, and always.\"\nSANSA STARK: Where's Jon?\nGREY WORM: He is our prisoner.\nSANSA STARK: So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.\nGREY WORM: We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.\nSANSA STARK: If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest.\"\nGREY WORM: And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.\nYARA GREYJOY: Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.\nSANSA STARK: You swore to follow a tyrant.\nYARA GREYJOY: She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.\"\nARYA STARK: Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.\nDAVOS: Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?\"\nDAVOS: If it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way.\"\nGREY WORM: We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's not for you to decide.\nGREY WORM: You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.\nMAESTER WOLKAN: We don't have a king or queen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.\nGREY WORM: Make your choice, then.\"\nEDMURE: My lords and ladies. I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-\nSANSA STARK: Uncle? Please sit.\nMAESTER WOLKAN: Well, we have to choose someone.\"\nSAM: Why just us?\nSAM: Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone.\"\nEDMURE: Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.\nYOHN ROYCE: I'll ask my horse.\nEDMURE: I suppose you want the crown.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Me? The Imp?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Can't think of a worse choice.\nDAVOS: Who, then?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?\"\nSANSA STARK: Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?\"\nBRAN STARK: Why do you think I came all this way?\nTYRION LANNISTER: To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.\nSAM: Aye.\nEDMURE: Aye.\nRIVERLANDS LORD: Aye.\nYOHN ROYCE: Aye.\nMAESTER WOLKAN: Aye.\nROBIN: Aye.\nDORNISH PRINCE: Aye.\nYARA GREYJOY: Aye.\nIRONBORN LORD: Aye.\nVALE LORD: Aye.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Aye.\nDAVOS: I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.\"\nBRIENNE: Aye.\nSANSA STARK: I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.\"\nALL: All hail Bran the Broken!\nBRAN STARK: Lord Tyrion, you will be my Hand.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it.\"\nBRAN STARK: And I don't want to be king.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else.\"\nBRAN STARK: I choose you.\nGREY WORM: You cannot.\nBRAN STARK: Yes, I can. I'm king.\"\nGREY WORM: This man is a criminal. He deserves justice.\nBRAN STARK: He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.\nGREY WORM: It is not enough.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.\nJON SNOW: There's still a Night's Watch?\nTYRION LANNISTER: The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.\"\nJON SNOW: Was it right? What I did?\nTYRION LANNISTER: What we did.\nJON SNOW: It doesn't feel right.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ask me again in ten years.\nJON SNOW: I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.\nUNSULLIED CAPTAIN: All the men have boarded.\nGREY WORM: Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.\nSANSA STARK: I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?\nJON SNOW: The North is free, thanks to you.\"\nSANSA STARK: But they lost their king.\nJON SNOW: Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.\nJON SNOW: You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black.\"\nARYA STARK: I can't.\nJON SNOW: You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?\nARYA STARK: I'm not going back north.\nSANSA STARK: Where are you going?\nARYA STARK: What's west of Westeros?\nARYA STARK: No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.\nJON SNOW: You have your Needle?\nARYA STARK: Right here.\nJON SNOW: Your Grace.\nJON SNOW: I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.\nBRAN STARK: You were exactly where you were supposed to be.\nTYRION LANNISTER: That's not- Uh-\nTYRION LANNISTER: What's this?\nSAM: A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.\nSAM: Oh, I wouldn't say that.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: He's not kind?\nSAM: He-\nTYRION LANNISTER: He what? What does he say about me?\nSAM: I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your Grace.\nDAVOS: Your Grace.\nBRONN: Your Grace.\nSAM: Your Grace.\nBRAN STARK: We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.\"\nBRAN STARK: And Drogon? Any word?\nSAM: He was last spotted flying east, toward-\"\nBRONN: The farther away, the better.\"\nBRAN STARK: Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.\nTYRION LANNISTER: As you wish, Your Grace.\"\nBRIENNE: Ser Podrick.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign.\"\nSAM: Long may he reign.\nDAVOS: Long may he reign.\nBRIENNE: Long may he reign.\nBRONN: Long may he reign.\nTYRION LANNISTER: That will improve.\nBRAN STARK: I'm sure it will.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?\"\nBRONN: In full, my lord Hand.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?\nBRONN: Indeed we can.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.\"\nDAVOS: We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.\nBRONN: The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin.\"\nDAVOS: Any more.\nBRONN: You Master of Grammar now too?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.\"\nSAM: The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-\nBRONN: The strong live and the weak don't.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Find the best builders and set them to the task.\nBRONN: Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction.\"\nSAM: Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.\nBRONN: Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly.\"\nBRIENNE: I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.\nBRONN: I think that's a very presumptuous statement.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.\nMAN: The Queen in the North!\nALL: The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North!",
