The honor of your presence is requested.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.\"\nJORY CASSEL: Yes, my Lord.\"\nKINGS LANDING GUARD: If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…\nJAIME LANNISTER: Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Glad to see you're protecting the throne.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.\"\nEDDARD STARK: You've chosen your opponents wisely then.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.\"\nEDDARD STARK: But you just stood there and watched.\nJAIME LANNISTER: 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?\"\nEDDARD STARK: You served him well, when serving was safe.\"\nVARYS: Lord Stark.\nEDDARD STARK: Lord Varys.\nVARYS: I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.\nEDDARD STARK: A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.\nRENLY BARATHEON: And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...\"\nPETYR BAELISH: But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.\"\nEDDARD STARK: She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.\nEDDARD STARK: Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.\nPETYR BAELISH: It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.\"\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Grand Maester.\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: How many years has it been? You were a young man.\nEDDARD STARK: And you served another King.\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?\"\nEDDARD STARK: Without the King?\nRENLY BARATHEON: Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.\"\nVARYS: His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.\nPETYR BAELISH: We are the lords of small matters here.\nRENLY BARATHEON: My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.\nPETYR BAELISH: Mmm, how much?\"\nEDDARD STARK: 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.\"\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: Can the treasury bear such expense?\nPETYR BAELISH: I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?\"\nEDDARD STARK: Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?\nPETYR BAELISH: I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.\nEDDARD STARK: How could you let this happen?\nPETYR BAELISH: The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.\nEDDARD STARK: I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.\"\nRENLY BARATHEON: Counting coppers,\"\" he calls it.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.\nPETYR BAELISH: As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.\"\nEDDARD STARK: There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.\"\nVARYS: You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Please, it's nearly healed.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: It's ugly.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Do I have to marry her?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I don't want to.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How would you handle them?\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A royal army?\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And if the northerners rebel?\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: For me. I'm their King.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I'm not asking.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: So you agree... The Starks are enemies?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.\nSEPTA MORDANE: Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.\"\nARYA STARK: I'm practicing.\nSANSA STARK: Practicing for what?\nARYA STARK: The Prince.\nSEPTA MORDANE: Arya, stop!\"\nARYA STARK: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.\nSANSA STARK: The Hound killed your friend.\nARYA STARK: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.\nSANSA STARK: You're an idiot.\nARYA STARK: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.\"\nSEPTA MORDANE: Enough!\nEDDARD STARK: What's happening here?\nSEPTA MORDANE: Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.\nEDDARD STARK: Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…\"\nEDDARD STARK: The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?\nSANSA STARK: I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?\nSEPTA MORDANE: You've barely eaten a thing.\nEDDARD STARK: It's all right. Go on.\nEDDARD STARK: War was easier than daughters.\nARYA STARK: Go away!\nEDDARD STARK: Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?\"\nARYA STARK: Mine.\nEDDARD STARK: Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.\nARYA STARK: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.\nEDDARD STARK: Come here. Now what do you want with this?\nARYA STARK: It's called Needle.\nEDDARD STARK: A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?\nARYA STARK: Stick 'em with the pointy end.\nEDDARD STARK: laughs] That's the essence of it.\nARYA STARK: I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.\nEDDARD STARK: No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.\"\nARYA STARK: I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.\nARYA STARK: So was I! He is a liar.\nEDDARD STARK: Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.\"\nARYA STARK: But how you can let her marry someone like that?\nEDDARD STARK: Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.\nARYA STARK: Winter is coming.\nEDDARD STARK: You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.\"\nARYA STARK: I don't hate her. Not really.\nEDDARD STARK: I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.\"\nARYA STARK: I can keep it?\nEDDARD STARK: Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.\"\nOLD NAN: Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.\nBRAN STARK: I hate your stories.\nOLD NAN: I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.\nBRAN STARK: Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.\nOLD NAN: Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…\"\nROBB STARK: What are you telling him now?\nOLD NAN: Only what the little Lord wants to hear.\nROBB STARK: Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.\nBRAN STARK: Maybe we do.\nROBB STARK: How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.\"\nBRAN STARK: I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.\"\nROBB STARK: Don't ever say that.\nBRAN STARK: I'd rather be dead.\nRODRICK CASSEL: Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.\"\nCATELYN STARK: It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.\nRODRICK CASSEL: My Lady.\nGUARD: Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?\"\nCATELYN STARK: I would. We've done nothing wrong.\nGUARD: We've been instructed to escort you into the city.\nCATELYN STARK: Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...\"\nGUARD: Follow me, Lady Stark.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.\nCATELYN STARK: You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…\nPETYR BAELISH: I meant no disrespect to you of all people.\nCATELYN STARK: How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?\nPETYR BAELISH: No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.\nCATELYN STARK: How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?\nPETYR BAELISH: A dear friend told me.\nVARYS: Lady Stark.\nCATELYN STARK: Lord Varys.\nVARYS: To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.\nCATELYN STARK: How did you know I was coming?\nVARYS: Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Do you know whose dagger this is?\nVARYS: I must admit I do not.\nPETYR BAELISH: Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Yours?\nPETYR BAELISH: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.\"\nCATELYN STARK: To whom?\nPETYR BAELISH: Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.\nALLISER THORNE: If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?\"\nALLISER THORNE: Next!\nALLISER THORNE: Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: A charming man.\nJEOR MORMONT: I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And how's that going, Commander Mormont?\"\nJEOR MORMONT: Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Good news or bad?\nJEOR MORMONT: Both.\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.\nPETYR BAELISH: Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?\nEDDARD STARK: My wife is in Winterfell.\nPETYR BAELISH: Is she?\nPETYR BAELISH: I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.\nEDDARD STARK: You're a funny man. A very funny man.\nCATELYN STARK: Ned! [poking her head out of a window]\nPETYR BAELISH: The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.\"\nGRENN: You broke my nose, bastard!\"\nJON SNOW: It's an improvement.\nGRENN: If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.\"\nPYP: I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.\nGRENN: What're you looking at, halfman?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.\nRAST: What do you care about our faces?\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.\"\nGRENN: We'll talk later, Lord Snow.\"\nJON SNOW: Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice\nJON SNOW: They hate me because I'm better than they are.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.\nPETYR BAELISH: The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.\nCATELYN STARK: We have proof. We have the blade.\nPETYR BAELISH: Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.\nPETYR BAELISH: I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I won't forget this. You're a true friend.\nPETYR BAELISH: Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How could you be so stupid?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Calm down.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Then what are you raving about?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...\nJAIME LANNISTER: We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And my husband?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Let me go.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Never.\nJAIME LANNISTER: The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I wish I could see the girls.\nEDDARD STARK: It's too dangerous.\nCATELYN STARK: Just for a moment.\nEDDARD STARK: Until we know who our enemies are...\nCATELYN STARK: I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And if you find the proof?\nEDDARD STARK: Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.\"\nCATELYN STARK: My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.\"\nEDDARD STARK: He still loves you.\nCATELYN STARK: Does he?\nEDDARD STARK: Off with you.\nROBERT BARATHEON: It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?\nBARRISTAN SELMY: Of course, your Grace.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Who was it?\nBARRISTAN SELMY: A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.\nROBERT BARATHEON: How'd you do it?\nBARRISTAN SELMY: Lance through the heart.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, \"\"Wait! Wait!\"\"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?\"\nLANCEL LANNISTER: It's empty, your Grace.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: What do you mean it's empty?\nLANCEL LANNISTER: There's no more wine.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.\nBARRISTAN SELMY: I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.\nBARRISTAN SELMY: A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Your outlaw... Any last words?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I cut his head off, so no.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?\nJAIME LANNISTER: He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... \"\"Burn them all.\"\" If that's all, your Grace...\"\nJORAH MORMONT: The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: From whom?\nJORAH MORMONT: If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Tell them all to stop.\nJORAH MORMONT: You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Until I command them otherwise.\nJORAH MORMONT: You're learning to talk like a Queen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?\nIRRI: Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No!\nIRRI: Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.\"\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!\nJORAH MORMONT: Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?\"\nRAKHARO: You walk. [to Viserys]\nBENJEN STARK: I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.\nJON SNOW: You're leaving?\nBENJEN STARK: I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.\nJON SNOW: What kind of reports?\nBENJEN STARK: The kind I don't want to believe.\nJON SNOW: m ready. I won't let you down.\nBENJEN STARK: You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.\"\nJON SNOW: But I'm better than every...\nBENJEN STARK: Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.\"\nYOREN: A bear's balls.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're joking?\nYOREN: And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And how do a bear's balls taste?\nYOREN: A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?\"\nYOREN: But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.\nTYRION LANNISTER: They have a better chance finding feed than glory.\nBENJEN STARK: The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.\"\nBENJEN STARK: I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?\"\nBENJEN STARK: Call me what you like.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.\nBENJEN STARK: You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word \"\"but\"\" really counts.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.\"\nBENJEN STARK: You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.\"\nYOREN: Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.\"\nBENJEN STARK: Enjoy the capital, brother.\"\nYOREN: I always do.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I think he's starting to like me. \"\"Going below\"\"?\"\nYOREN: Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.\nTYRION LANNISTER: So you're heading down to King's Landing too.\nYOREN: Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.\nYOREN: I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.\nIRRI: Yes, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What are you doing?\nIRRI: When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.\"\nRAKHARO: Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.\nJORAH MORMONT: Armor.\nRAKHARO: Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?\nJORAH MORMONT: Slow.\nRAKHARO: Slow.\nJORAH MORMONT: It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.\"\nRAKHARO: My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.\nJORAH MORMONT: I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.\nRAKHARO: He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?\"\nJORAH MORMONT: He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.\nIRRI: The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.\nRAKHARO: There are no rabbits.\nIRRI: Find some ducks, she likes ducks.\"\nRAKHARO: Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?\"\nIRRI: Dog then. I have seen many dogs.\nJORAH MORMONT: I don't think she wants to eat dog.\nIRRI: The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.\nRAKHARO: A blessing from the Great Stallion.\nIRRI: She does not want to eat horse.\nJORAH MORMONT: I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.\nRHAKARO: We ride for Vaes Dothrak.\nJORAH MORMONT: Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.\nJON SNOW: Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.\nMAESTER AEMON: How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Eight... no, nine.\"\nMAESTER AEMON: All of them brief?\nTYRION LANNISTER: They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.\"\nMAESTER AEMON: This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually\nJEOR MORMONT: We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.\"\nJEOR MORMONT: One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.\nMAESTER AEMON: The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.\nJEOR MORMONT: Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.\nMAESTER AEMON: When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: It's a boy.\nKHAL DROGO: How do you know?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I know.\nJON SNOW: I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.\nJON SNOW: Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.\nJON SNOW: If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course.\nJON SNOW: He'll never walk again.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.\"\nJON SNOW: Farewell, My Lord.\"\nSYRIO FOREL: You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.\"\nARYA STARK: Who are you?\nSYRIO FOREL: Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.\"\nSYRIO FOREL: Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.\"\nARYA STARK: It's too heavy.\nSYRIO FOREL: It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.\nARYA STARK: What if I drop it?\nSYRIO FOREL: The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.\"\nARYA STARK: I'm a girl.\nSYRIO FOREL: Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...\"\nARYA STARK: A needle.\nSYRIO FOREL: Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.\"\nSYRIO FOREL: Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.\"",
