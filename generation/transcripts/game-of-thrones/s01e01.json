One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they're ripping each other to pieces.\"\nWILL: I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I've never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.\"\nWAYMAR ROYCE: How close did you get?\nWILL: Close as any man would.\nGARED: We should head back to the wall.\nROYCE: Do the dead frighten you?\nGARED: Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.\nROYCE: You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.\nWILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.\nROYCE: It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again.\"\nROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.\nWILL: They were here.\nGARED: See where they went.\nROYCE: What is it?\nGARED: It's …\nJON SNOW: Go on. Father's watching.\nJON SNOW: And your mother.\nSEPTA MORDANE: Fine work, as always. Well done.\"\nSANSA STARK: Thank you.\nSEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that you've managed to get in this corners. … Quite beautiful … the stitching …\nEDDARD STARK: And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.\"\nJON SNOW: Don't think too much, Bran.\"\nROBB STARK: Relax your bow arm.\nJONROBB: Quick, Bran, faster!\"\nCASSEL: Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.\nEDDARD STARK: Get the lads to saddle their horses.\nCATELYN STARK: Do you have to?\nEDDARD STARK: He swore an oath, Cat.\"\nCASSEL: The law is law, my lady.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Tell Bran he's coming, too.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.\nEDDARD STARK: He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.\nROBB STARK: Lad, go run back and get the rest.\"\nWILL: White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.\"\nWILL: I know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry.\"\nEDDARD STARK: nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block.\"\nWILL: Forgive me, lord.\"\nEDDARD STARK: In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …\"\nJON SNOW: Don't look away.\nEDDARD STARK: King of the Andals and the First Men …\nJON SNOW: Father will know if you do.\nEDDARD STARK: Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.\"\nJON SNOW: You did well.\nEDDARD STARK: You understand why I did it?\nBRAN STARK: Jon said he was a deserter.\nEDDARD STARK: But do you understand why I had to kill him?\nBRAN STARK: Our way is the old way?\nEDDARD STARK: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.\nBRAN STARK: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?\nEDDARD STARK: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.\nBRAN STARK: So he was lying?\nEDDARD STARK: A madman sees what he sees.\nJON SNOW: What is it?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Mountain lion?\nEDDARD STARK: There are no mountain lions in these woods.\nTHEON GREYJOY: It's a freak.\nEDDARD STARK: It's a direwolf.\nEDDARD STARK: Tough old beast.\nROBB STARK: There are no direwolves south of the Wall.\nJON SNOW: Now there are five.\nJON SNOW: You want to hold it?\nBRAN STARK: Where will they go? Their mother's dead.\nCASSEL: They don't belong down here.\nEDDARD STARK: Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Right. Give it here.\nBRAN STARK: NO!\nROBB STARK: Put away your blade.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I take orders from your father, not you.\"\nBRAN STARK: Please, father!\"\nEDDARD STARK: I'm sorry, Bran.\"\nJON SNOW: Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.\nEDDARD STARK: You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.\"\nBRAN STARK: What about you?\nJON SNOW: I'm not a Stark. Get on.\nROBB STARK: What is it?\nTHEON GREYJOY: The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What if Jon Arryn told someone?\nJAIME LANNISTER: But who would he tell?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My husband.\nJAIME LANNISTER: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You should be the Hand of the king.\nJAIME LANNISTER: That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.\"\nCATELYN STARK: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.\nEDDARD STARK: You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.\nCATELYN STARK: I wonder if the old gods agree.\nEDDARD STARK: It's your gods with all the rules.\nCATELYN STARK: I am so sorry, my love.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Tell me.\nCATELYN STARK: There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.\nEDDARD STARK: Your sister. The boy …\nCATELYN STARK: They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.\nEDDARD STARK: He's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after.\"\nCATELYN STARK: You can always say no, Ned.\"\nCATELYN STARK: We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.\nMAESTER LUWIN: I'm told he drinks all night.\nCATELYN STARK: How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.\nLUWIN: We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.\nCATELYN STARK: In any case, candles.\"\nJON SNOW: Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?\nTHEON GREYJOY: It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]\"\nROBB STARK: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.\nROBB STARK: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!\"\nBRAN STARK: I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!\nCATELYN STARK: How many times have I told you\nBRAN STARK: But he's coming right now! Down our road!\nCATELYN STARK: I want you to promise me\nBRAN STARK: I promise.\nCATELYN STARK: D'you know what?\nBRAN STARK: What?\nCATELYN STARK: You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.\nCATELYN STARK: Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?\"\nEDDARD STARK: Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]\"\nARYA STARK: Move!\nEDDARD STARK: Your Grace.\nROBERT BARATHEON: You've got fat.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Cat!\nCATELYN STARK: Your Grace.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?\nEDDARD STARK: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.\"\nARYA STARK: Where's the Imp?\nSANSA STARK: Will you shut up?\nROBERT BARATHEON: Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?\"\nARYA STARK: Arya.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.\nARYA STARK: That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.\nSANSA STARK: Would you please shut up.\nEDDARD STARK: My queen.\nCATELYN STARK: My queen.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Ned.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.\nEDDARD STARK: Tell me about Jon Arryn.\nROBERT BARATHEON: One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.\"\nEDDARD STARK: We both did.\nROBERT BARATHEON: He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Aye.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I'm not worthy of the honor.\nROBERT BARATHEON: I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.\nROS: Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I did hear something about that.\nROS: And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And the other brother?\nROS: The queen has two brothers?\nTYRION LANNISTER: There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.\nROS: I hear they call him the Imp.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I hear he hates that nickname.\nROS: Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Clever girl.\nROS: We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Have you?\nTYRION LANNISTER: The gods gave me one blessing.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Don't get up.\nROS: M'lord.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: She has odd cravings, our sister.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Close the door!\nROBERT BARATHEON: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.\nEDDARD STARK: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.\nROBERT BARATHEON: She belonged with me.\nROBERT BARATHEON: In my dreams, I kill him every night.\"\nEDDARD STARK: It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Not all of them.\nVISERYS: Daenerys!\nVISERYS: Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.\nVISERYS: Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No.\nVISERYS: When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.\"\nMAID: It's too hot, my lady.\"\nVISERYS: Where is he?\nILLYRIO: The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.\nILLYRIO: May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.\"\nVISERYS: Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.\"\nILLYRIO: Come forward, my dear.\"\nVISERYS: Where's he going?\nILLYRIO: The ceremony is over.\nVISERYS: But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?\nILLYRIO: Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know.\"\nILLYRIO: It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.\nVISERYS: When will they be married?\nILLYRIO: Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.\nVISERYS: Is it true they lie with their horses?\nILLYRIO: I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.\nVISERYS: Do you take me for a fool?\nILLYRIO: I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.\nVISERYS: I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.\nVISERYS: So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I don't know.\nVISERYS: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took.\"\nSANSA STARK: Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?\nCATELYN STARK: Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.\nSANSA STARK: He's so handsome.\nSANSA STARK: When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?\nCATELYN STARK: Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.\nSANSA STARK: Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.\nCATELYN STARK: He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.\nSANSA STARK: You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.\nCATELYN STARK: Sansa…\nSANSA STARK: Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted.\"\nBENJEN: Is he dead yet?\nJON SNOW: Uncle Benjen!\nBENJEN: You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?\nJON SNOW: Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.\nBENJEN: Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.\"\nJON SNOW: So take me with you when you go back.\nBENJEN: Jon…\nJON SNOW: Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.\"\nBENJEN: The Wall isn't going anywhere.\nJON SNOW: I'm ready to swear your oath.\nBENJEN: You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.\nJON SNOW: I don't care about that.\nBENJEN: You might, if you knew what it meant. … I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.\nJON SNOW: What're you doing back there?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.\nJON SNOW: You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?\nTYRION LANNISTER: My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.\"\nJON SNOW: Lord Eddard Stark is my father.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.\"\nJON SNOW: What the hell do you know about being a bastard?\nTYRION LANNISTER: All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.\nBENJEN: You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.\nEDDARD STARK: The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?\nBENJEN: Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.\"\nEDDARD STARK: He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.\nBENJEN: The two he was with are still missing.\nEDDARD STARK: A wildling ambush.\nBENJEN: Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.\nEDDARD STARK: Winter is coming.\nROBB STARK: Uncle Benjen.\nBENJEN: Robb boy. How are ye?\nROBB STARK: I'm good.\nCATELYN STARK: Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Yes. Lovely country.\nCATELYN STARK: I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?\"\nSANSA STARK: Thirteen, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're tall. Still growing?\nSANSA STARK: I think so, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And have you bled yet?\nSANSA STARK: No, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And your dress. Did you make it?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Such talent. You must make something for me.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I hear we might share a grandchild someday.\nCATELYN STARK: I hear the same.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.\nEDDARD STARK: Your pardon.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.\nEDDARD STARK: Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I don't fight in tournaments.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No? Getting a little old for it?\nEDDARD STARK: I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Well said.\nSANSA STARK: Arya!\nROBB STARK: Time for bed.\nEDDARD STARK: I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I won't let him take you.\nEDDARD STARK: The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.\nCATELYN STARK: I'll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'\"\nEDDARD STARK: How did he get so fat?\nCATELYN STARK: He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.\nA VOICE: It's Maester Luwin, my lord.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Send him in.\nLUWIN: Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Stay.\nCATELYN STARK: This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.\nEDDARD STARK: What news?\nCATELYN STARK: She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.\nEDDARD STARK: She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?\"\nLUWIN: If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?\"\nCATELYN STARK: They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.\nLUWIN: The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.\"\nCATELYN STARK: He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.\nLUWIN: A different time. Different king.\nVISERYS: When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.\nILLYRIO: If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.\"\nVISERYS: When?\nILLYRIO: When their omens favor war.\nVISERYS: I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.\nILLYRIO: A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.\nJORAH MORMONT: A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.\"\nILLYRIO: Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Thank you, Magister.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: She's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: There is no word for ‘thank you' in Dothraki.\nVISERYS: Make him happy.\nKHAL DROGO: No.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Do you know the Common Tongue?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Is ‘no' the only word that you know?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Rough night, Imp?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I didn't pick you for a hunter.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: It's not hunting if you pay for it.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?\nEDDARD STARK: No, but I'm still better than you.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.\nEDDARD STARK: I hope I'll serve you well.\nROBERT BARATHEON: You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!\"\nBRAN STARK: Come on, you.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Stop. STOP.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Are you completely mad?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He saw us.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It's all right. It's all right.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He saw us!\nJAIME LANNISTER: I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?\"\nBRAN STARK: Ten\nJAIME LANNISTER: Ten.\nJAIME LANNISTER: The things I do for love.",
