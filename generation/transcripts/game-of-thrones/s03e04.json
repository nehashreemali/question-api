She loosened you up for us?\"\nBRIENNE: He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: If I die, you won't be getting-\"\nLOCKE: Oh, enough. Here.\"\nLOCKE: Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.\nBRIENNE: Stop!\nMAN: Far enough.\nLOCKE: Do that again and I'll take your other hand.\nMAN: Come on, you.\"\nVARYS: Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I hope we might speak. In confidence.\nVARYS: Oh, always in confidence.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?\nVARYS: Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-\nVARYS: End your life?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof.\"\nVARYS: Proof? Will there be a trial?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I need to know.\nVARYS: I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't know. Do I?\nVARYS: As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-\"\nVARYS: You do not possess at the moment.\nVARYS: But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: The sorcerer.\nVARYS: Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it.\"\nGRENN: When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling.\"\nDOLOROUS EDD: Or the shit.\nGRENN: They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it.\"\nDOLOROUS EDD: And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.\nGRENN: But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling.\"\nDOLOROUS EDD: Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day.\"\nRAST: We need to get out of here.\nGRENN: When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.\"\nRAST: The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?\nDOLOROUS EDD: He had no way of knowing.\nRAST: We do now. We know what's out there.\nGRENN: Craster's been out here surviving.\nRAST: So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?\nDOLOROUS EDD: We're like the sons he never had.\nRAST: Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves.\"\nGILLY: Shh, shh, shh.\"\nGILLY: You woke him.\nSAM: I'm sorry. He's beautiful.\nGILLY: Shh!\nSAM: He's beautiful. Does he have a name?\nGILLY: No.\nSAM: Are you going to give him one?\nGILLY: Why?\nGILLY: Here.\nSAM: Gilly.\nGILLY: You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.\nSAM: I wanted you to have it.\nGILLY: I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?\nGILLY: I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.\nJOJEN: You have to go after him.\nBRAN STARK: How?\nJOJEN: You know how.\nCATELYN STARK: Brandon.\nBRAN STARK: Mother.\nCATELYN STARK: How many times have I told you? No climbing.\nBRAN STARK: Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I want you to promise me. No more climbing.\nCATELYN STARK: Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!\nBRAN STARK: Mother! Mother!\nCATELYN STARK: Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!\"\nVARYS: Is he very large?\nROS: No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-\"\nVARYS: Extraordinary.\nROS: The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.\nVARYS: We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?\nVARYS: What did he do to them?\nROS: I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive.\"\nVARYS: So what did they say?\nROS: They said it was hard to describe.\nVARYS: Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?\nROS: He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.\nVARYS: Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?\"\nROS: He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest.\"\nVARYS: What makes you say so?\nROS: His shipboard inventory.\nVARYS: Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.\nROS: Former profession.\nVARYS: Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?\nROS: Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.\nVARYS: Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?\nROS: He's not interested in them, my lord.\"\nVARYS: How do you know?\nROS: Because I'm one of his girls.\nVARYS: Prodigies in odd places indeed.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: What is this place?\nTHOROS: Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You look like a bunch of swineherds.\nANGUY: Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?\nBERIC: No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.\nBERIC: And I won't see them again.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.\nBERIC: Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?\nBERIC: Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You're fighting for ghosts.\nBERIC: That's what we are- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You found god? Is that it?\nBERIC: Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.\"\nTHOROS: You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice.\"\nANGUY: And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.\nTHOROS: House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?\nANGUY: Murder is a crime.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not.\"\nARYA STARK: You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Aye, he was a bleeder.\"\nBERIC: You don't deny killing this boy?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.\nARYA STARK: That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.\nBERIC: You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?\"\nBERIC: Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.\nMISSANDEI: The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.\"\nMISSANDEI: And who knows? In ten years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Is it done, then? They belong to me?\"\nKRAZNYS: It is done.\nMISSANDEI: It is done.\nKRAZNYS: She holds the whip.\nMISSANDEI: You hold the whip.\nKRAZNYS: The bitch has her army.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Unsullied!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Forward march!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Halt!\nKRAZNYS: Tell the bitch her beast won't come.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: A dragon is not a slave.\nKRAZNYS: You speak Valyrian?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see!\"\nKRAZNYS: I am your master.\nKRAZNYS: Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Dracarys.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?\"",
