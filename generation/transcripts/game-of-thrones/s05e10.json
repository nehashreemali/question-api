The way ahead is clear.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: We ride for Winterfell.\nMELISANDRE: And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.\nSOLDIER: Your Grace.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Prepare to form up.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Tell me.\nSOLDIER: The men. Many deserted before dawn.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: How many?\nSOLDIER: Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses.\"\nSOLDIER: Your Grace?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Speak up. It can't be worse than mutiny.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Cut her down.\nSOLDIER: Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.\nJON SNOW: He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world.\"\nSAM: So what are you gonna do?\nJON SNOW: I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.\nSAM: But… the Dragonglass?\nJON SNOW: No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it.\"\nSAM: But… you killed a White Walker.\nJON SNOW: With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…\nSAM: He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?\nJON SNOW: Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?\nSAM: You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.\nJON SNOW: Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.\nJON SNOW: What?\nSAM: I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this.\"\nJON SNOW: I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?\"\nSAM: Well, there's Edd.\"\nSAM: I'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.\"\nSAM: If Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.\"\nSAM: Thank you.\nJON SNOW: You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too.\"\nSAM: They'll bloody try.\nJON SNOW: Sam?\nSAM: What?\nJON SNOW: Sam…\nJON SNOW: You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--\nSAM: Very carefully.\nJON SNOW: I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone.\nSAM: I'll come back.\nJON SNOW: To your return.\nSAM: To my return.\nPODRICK: My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.\nBRIENNE: How do you know it's Stannis?\nPODRICK: He's carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.\nSOLDIER: There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Bolton has women fighting for him.\nBRIENNE: I do not fight for the Boltons. I'm Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I did.\nBRIENNE: In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Go on, do your duty.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Looks like we're done here.\nSURVIVOR: I surrender. I surrender!\nRAMSAY BOLTON: And I accept your surrender.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Let's head back. My wife must be lonely.\nMYRANDA: My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Go with her. Please.\nSANSA STARK: I know what Ramsay is. I know what he'll do to me. If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's some of me left.\"\nMYRANDA: Die? Who said anything about dying? You can't die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you. Just the parts he'll use to make his heir. Until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them. He's got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?\"\nMYRANDA: You're leaving it to me? Good. Let's begin.\nMYRANDA: Stop! Stop!\nMAN: Open the gates!\nTHEON GREYJOY: He's coming back.\nMERYN: I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.\nARYA STARK: You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I've gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I'm glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?\"\nARYA STARK: I can't hear you.\nARYA STARK: You know who I am. I'm Arya Stark.\nARYA STARK: Do you know who you are?\nARYA STARK: You're no one. You're nothing.\nJAQEN HGHAR: A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.\nWAIF: I was right about her.\nJAQEN HGHAR: You were.\nWAIF: You're not ready. Not at all.\nJAQEN HGHAR: That man's life wasn't yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.\nJAQEN HGHAR: Only death can pay for life.\nARYA STARK: No! No! No, you don't die! Don't die!\"\nWAIF: Why are you crying?\nARYA STARK: He was my friend.\nWAIF: No he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?\nJAQEN HGHAR: He was no one.\nARYA STARK: But if you're… Who's this?\nJAQEN HGHAR: No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.\nJAQEN HGHAR: The faces are for no one.\nJAQEN HGHAR: You are still someone.\nJAQEN HGHAR: And to someone…\nJAQEN HGHAR: the faces are as good as poison.\nARYA STARK: I can't see!\nARYA STARK: What's happening?! What's happening?!\nDORAN: I wish you a safe journey home.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Thank you.\nELLARIA: Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.\nBRONN: Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.\nTYENE: Maybe I'll come visit you.\nBRONN: Don't wait too long. I've a noble woman to marry back home.\nTYENE: You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Whenever you're ready, My Lord.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Try not to lose it this time.\nMYRCELLA: I'll never take it off again.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I know you didn't want to leave Dorne. But I'm glad you're coming home. Your mother's desperate to see you. And I'm glad Trystane's coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You're lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.\nMYRCELLA: Do you think mother will like him.\nJAIME LANNISTER: If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.\"\nMYRCELLA: And you really believe that?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?\nMYRCELLA: She likes you.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm not so sure about that. Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is… we don't choose whom we love. We just… It's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot.\"\nMYRCELLA: No you don't.\nJAIME LANNISTER: What I'm trying to say. What I'm trying and failing to say…\nMYRCELLA: I know what you're trying to say.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No. I'm afraid you don't.\nMYRCELLA: I do.\nMYRCELLA: I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I'm glad. I'm glad that you're my father.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Myrcella?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Myrcella?!\nJAIME LANNISTER: Myrcella?! Myrcella?!\nTYRION LANNISTER: You love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.\"\nDAARIO: Does he always talk so much?\nGREY WORM: Jorah the Andal.\nJORAH MORMONT: Torgo Nudho.\nGREY WORM: You should not be here.\nDAARIO: No, but he is.\"\nGREY WORM: Our queen ordered him exiled from city.\nDAARIO: Our queen would be dead if not for him.\nMISSANDEI: It's true. And I would be dead if not for the… little man.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Dwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.\nMISSANDEI: A bit “rusty”.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Rusty” Thank you.\nGREY WORM: I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.\nDAARIO: You missed a good scrap.\nJORAH MORMONT: None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.\nTYRION LANNISTER: He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: We? You're a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And I intend to help her do it.\nJORAH MORMONT: You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You betrayed her!\nJORAH MORMONT: Careful now.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And she exiled you, twice, I believe?\"\nJORAH MORMONT: The second time thanks to you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.\"\nDAARIO: He's right. The Queen exiled Jorah. And he's right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.\nDAARIO: Forgive me, but why would we bring you?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Pardon me?\nDAARIO: Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--\"\nDAARIO: Can you fight?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.\nDAARIO: Are you good on a horse?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Middling.\nDAARIO: So mainly you talk?\nTYRION LANNISTER: And drink. I've survived so far.\nDAARIO: Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?\nDAARIO: They wouldn't. They will listen to Grey Worm.\nGREY WORM: I'll come with you. I'll find our queen.\nMISSANDEI: You are not strong enough to go anywhere.\nGREY WORM: I am.\nDAARIO: He is, he's the toughest man with no balls I've ever met. But you still can't go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen.\"\nMISSANDEI: It's true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half.\"\nDAARIO: And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen's closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let's find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.\"\nVOICE: Hello, old friend.\"\nVARYS: I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.\nVARYS: The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?\"\nVARYS: Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.\nVARYS: If only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I did miss you.\nVARYS: Oh, I know.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We have to go home.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How far did you carry me?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Drogon, we need to return. My people need me.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper.\"\nSEPTA: Confess. Confess.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--\"\nSPARROW: You wish to make a confession?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Once I've confessed, will I be free?\"\nSPARROW: Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess.\"\nSPARROW: Name him.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Lancel Lannister.\nSPARROW: Your cousin. And the King's squire.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I was lonely and afraid.\nSPARROW: You had a husband.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A husband of whoring every chance he got.\nSPARROW: His sins do not pardon your own.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: May the gods forgive me.\nSPARROW: Other men?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No.\nSPARROW: No others?\nSPARROW: Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I do.\nSPARROW: There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it.\"\nSPARROW: Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Trial? I have confessed?\nSPARROW: To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son… I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him. Please.\nSPARROW: You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Thank you. Thank you.\nSPARROW: The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I will, I will. I swear it, day and night.\"\nSPARROW: Good.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Am I free to go?\nSPARROW: After your atonement.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My atonement?\nSPARROW: A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement.\"\nSEPTA: Shame. Shame. Shame.\nCROWD: Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits!\nWOMAN: I've had half as many cocks as the queen!\nMAN: Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch!\"\nQYBURN: Your Grace. It's good to have you back. Come. We'll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.\nQYBURN: May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard.\nQYBURN: If it please Your Grace, he's taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace's enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm.\"\nDAVOS: He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!\nJON SNOW: We don't have enough men to make any difference.\nDAVOS: The wildlings will make a difference!\nJON SNOW: The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--\"\nDAVOS: You saved their bloody lives. If they're going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.\"\nJON SNOW: It's not their fight!\nJON SNOW: Stannis?\nDAVOS: Shireen? The princess?\nOLLY: Lord Commander. It's one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says he's still alive.\nJON SNOW: Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?\nOLLY: Says he was first Ranger. Said he knows where to find him.\nALLISER: Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.\nJON SNOW: He could be lying.\nALLISER: Could be. There are ways to find out.\nJON SNOW: Where is he?\nALLISER: Over there.\nALLISER: For the Watch.\nBROTHER: For the Watch.\nJON SNOW: Olly…\nOLLY: For the Watch.\nEND: EPISODE\nEND: SEASON",
