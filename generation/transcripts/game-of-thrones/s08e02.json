  "transcript": "DAENERYS TARGARYEN: When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your sister pledged to send her army north.\nJAIME LANNISTER: She did.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.\nJAIME LANNISTER: She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We\"\"?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your Grace, I know my brother-\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Like you knew your sister?\nTYRION LANNISTER: He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat.\"\nSANSA STARK: You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again.\"\nBRAN STARK: The things we do for love.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So why have you abandoned your house and family now?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Because this goes beyond loyalty.\nJAIME LANNISTER: This is about survival.\nBRIENNE: You don't know me well, Your Grace.\"\nBRIENNE: But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it.\"\nBRIENNE: Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.\"\nSANSA STARK: You vouch for him?\nBRIENNE: I do.\nSANSA STARK: You would fight beside him?\nBRIENNE: I would.\nSANSA STARK: I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What does the Warden of the North say about it?\nJON SNOW: We need every man we can get.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Very well.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Thank you, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I was a fool.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Not for the first time.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Don't you have something better to do?\nARYA STARK: You make my weapon yet?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.\nARYA STARK: You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: It's strong enough.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know.\"\nARYA STARK: Are you going to be down in the crypt?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: No, but-\"\nARYA STARK: But you're a fighter.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I've done my share.\nARYA STARK: You've fought them?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I did. Some of them.\nARYA STARK: How many?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: A few. That was enough.\nARYA STARK: What are they like?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Bad. Really bad.\nARYA STARK: Really bad\"\"?\"\nARYA STARK: Even a smith's apprentice can do better than \"\"really bad.\"\" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like.\"\nARYA STARK: I know Death.\nARYA STARK: He's got many faces.\nARYA STARK: I look forward to seeing this one.\nARYA STARK: My weapon?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I'll get right on it.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm sorry for what I did to you.\nBRAN STARK: You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm not that person anymore.\nBRAN STARK: You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You're not?\nBRAN STARK: No. I'm something else now.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You're not angry at me.\nBRAN STARK: I'm not angry at anyone.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Why didn't you tell them?\nBRAN STARK: You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.\nJAIME LANNISTER: What about afterwards?\nBRAN STARK: How do you know there is an afterwards?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, here we are.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Yes, here we are.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Together again.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And the masses rejoice.\nJAIME LANNISTER: How do they feel about their new queen?\nTYRION LANNISTER: She's your new queen too.\nTYRION LANNISTER: They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.\nJAIME LANNISTER: And she is? Different?\nTYRION LANNISTER: She is.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You're sure about her?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I am.\nJAIME LANNISTER: She didn't seem sure about you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Hmm.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Was she lying about the baby too?\nJAIME LANNISTER: No, that part is real.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.\nJAIME LANNISTER: What?\nTYRION LANNISTER: She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-\"\nBOTH: A girl's mouth around-\nJAIME LANNISTER: Your cock.\nTYRION LANNISTER: My cock.\nTYRION LANNISTER: At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.\nBRIENNE: Ser Jaime.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Lady Brienne.\nJAIME LANNISTER: He's come a long way.\nBRIENNE: He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.\nBRIENNE: I am. It's, uh-it's good ground.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: It is.\nBRIENNE: The rise, it should give us some advantage.\"\nBRIENNE: If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Yes, I think you're right.\"\nBRIENNE: What are you doing?\nBRIENNE: I think you know.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I truly don't.\nBRIENNE: We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You want me to insult you?\nBRIENNE: No!\nJAIME LANNISTER: Good.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me.\"\nBRIENNE: I better get back.\nJORAH MORMONT: Forgive me, khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Have you done something to offend me?\nJORAH MORMONT: Many things.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Long ago and long forgiven.\nJORAH MORMONT: But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: You made the right choice.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.\nJORAH MORMONT: I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.\nJORAH MORMONT: But the mind behind all those words-\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.\nJORAH MORMONT: As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?\nJORAH MORMONT: I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me.\"\nROYCE: The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates.\"\nSANSA STARK: Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.\nSANSA STARK: Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.\nSANSA STARK: Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei.\"\nSANSA STARK: You never should have either.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I thought he knew his sister.\nSANSA STARK: Families are complicated.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Ours certainly have been.\nSANSA STARK: A sad thing to have in common.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother.\"\nSANSA STARK: He loves you, you know that.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: That bothers you.\nSANSA STARK: Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: All my life, I've known one goal\"\nSANSA STARK: I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about.\"\nSANSA STARK: Who was the first?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Someone taller.\nSANSA STARK: And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I take the Iron Throne.\nSANSA STARK: What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?\"\nWOLKAN: Apologies, my lady. Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What is it?\nTHEON GREYJOY: My queen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your sister?\nTHEON GREYJOY: She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: But why aren't you with her?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me.\"\nMAN: Milord, we're not soldiers.\"\nDAVOS: You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way.\"\nMAN: Thank you.\nGILLY: When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts.\"\nGILLY: They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.\nWOMAN: Thank you.\nTEELA: Which way should I go?\nDAVOS: Which way do you want to go?\nTEELA: All the children will be going below when the time comes.\nTEELA: But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.\nGILLY: That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us.\"\nDAVOS: I'm sure a lot of people would.\nTEELA: All right. I'll defend the crypt, then.\"\nTORMUND: My little crow.\nJON SNOW: I thought we'd lost you.\nTORMUND: Almost.\nJON SNOW: How did you find each other?\nEDD: We met up at the Last Hearth.\nTORMUND: The dead got there first.\nJON SNOW: The Umbers?\nBERIC: Fighting for the Night King now.\nTORMUND: We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.\nJON SNOW: How long do we have?\nTORMUND: Before the sun comes up tomorrow.\nTORMUND: The big woman still here?\nJON SNOW: They're coming.\nJON SNOW: We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.\nJON SNOW: But there are too many of them.\nJON SNOW: Far too many.\nJON SNOW: Our enemy doesn't tire.\nJON SNOW: Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.\nJON SNOW: We can't beat them in a straight fight.\nJAIME LANNISTER: So, what can we do?\"\nJON SNOW: The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.\nJAIME LANNISTER: If that's true, he'll never expose himself.\"\nBRAN STARK: Yes, he will.\"\nBRAN STARK: He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens.\"\nSAM TARLY: Why? What does he want?\nBRAN STARK: An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory.\"\nSAM TARLY: That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: How will he find you?\nBRAN STARK: His mark is on me.\nBRAN STARK: He always knows where I am.\nJON SNOW: We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest.\"\nBRAN STARK: No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.\nSANSA STARK: You want us to use you as bait?\nARYA STARK: We're not leaving you alone out there.\nTHEON GREYJOY: He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.\nDAVOS: We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.\nTYRION LANNISTER: When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it.\"\nDAVOS: The dragons should give us an edge in the field.\nJON SNOW: If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does.\"\nARYA STARK: Dragonfire will stop him?\nBRAN STARK: I don't know. No one's ever tried.\nTORMUND: We're all going to die.\nTORMUND: But at least we die together.\nJON SNOW: Let's get some rest.\nJON SNOW: Your Grace.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Do you need help?\nBRAN STARK: No.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You've had a strange journey.\nBRAN STARK: Stranger than most.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'd like to hear about it.\nBRAN STARK: It's a long story.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.\"\nMISSANDEI: Hello.\nGREY WORM: When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?\"\nMISSANDEI: Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.\nGREY WORM: Then I will take you there.\nMISSANDEI: My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.\nGREY WORM: My people are not peaceful. We will protect you.\nSAM TARLY: Have you told her yet?\nJON SNOW: No.\nSAM TARLY: Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-\nEDD: And now our watch begins.\nJON SNOW: Gilly? Little Sam?\nSAM TARLY: They'll be safe down in the crypt.\nJON SNOW: If you want to join them.\nJON SNOW: To protect them.\nSAM TARLY: Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.\nEDD: Thenn.\nSAM TARLY: I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there.\"\nEDD: Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked.\"\nSAM TARLY: Well, calling you \"\"fucked\"\" wouldn't be strictly accurate.\"\nEDD: Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.\nSAM TARLY: Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp.\"\nJON SNOW: Now it's just us three.\nEDD: Last man left, burn the rest of us.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I wish Father were here.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.\nJAIME LANNISTER: That would be something to see.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Mm.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I was speaking in relative terms.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Do you miss it?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course I miss it.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's not. Things would be easier if it were.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The perils of self-betterment.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Oh! My lady.\nBRIENNE: Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.\nPODRICK: Thank you, milord.\"\nBRIENNE: I don't think that's wise.\nBRIENNE: The battle might start at any moment.\nBRIENNE: Half cup.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And you?\nBRIENNE: No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.\nBRIENNE: All right. Just a bit.\nDAVOS: Well, what do we have here?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ser Davos, join us.\"\nDAVOS: No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this.\"\nDAVOS: I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.\nTORMUND: It could be our last night in this world, you know.\"\nBRIENNE: Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.\"\nBRIENNE: Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Would you like a drink?\nTORMUND: Brought my own.\nTORMUND: They call you \"\"King Killer.\"\"\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm sure someone does.\nTORMUND: They call me \"\"Giantsbane.\"\" Want to know why?\"\nTORMUND: I killed a giant when I was ten. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.\nTORMUND: When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk.\"\nDAVOS: Maybe I will have that drink.\nSANDOR: You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.\nARYA STARK: Guess I've changed.\nARYA STARK: What are you doing up here?\nSANDOR: What's it look like?\nARYA STARK: No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?\"\nSANDOR: I fought for you, didn't I?\"\nSANDOR: Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding.\"\nBERIC: My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.\nSANDOR: Was he on your list?\nARYA STARK: For a little while.\nBERIC: That's all right.\nBERIC: The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-\nSANDOR: Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back nineteen times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall.\"\nSANDOR: Where are you going?\nARYA STARK: I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.\nARYA STARK: That for me?\nARYA STARK: This'll work.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…\"\nARYA STARK: What did the Red Woman want with you?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.\nARYA STARK: Why your blood?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me.\"\nARYA STARK: Was that your first time?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.\"\nARYA STARK: Your first time with a woman.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.\nARYA STARK: Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?\nARYA STARK: Or after?\nARYA STARK: You don't remember?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Yes, I was.\"\nARYA STARK: One? Two? Twenty?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Well, I didn't keep count.\"\nARYA STARK: Yes, you did.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Three.\nARYA STARK: We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Arya, I-\"\nARYA STARK: I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together.\"\nBRIENNE: At least we'll die with honor.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I think we might live.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.\nDAVOS: All without a shred of combat ability.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.\"\nTORMUND: She's not a ser? You're not a knight?\nBRIENNE: Women can't be knights.\nTORMUND: Why not?\nBRIENNE: Tradition.\nTORMUND: Fuck tradition.\nBRIENNE: I don't even want to be a knight.\nTORMUND: I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you ten times over.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'll prove it.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Kneel, Lady Brienne.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.\nJAIME LANNISTER: In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!\nJORAH MORMONT: We have all we need to win this war.\nLYANNA: I have trained my men, women and children. I have fought before. I can fight again.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house.\"\nLYANNA: I don't need you to remind me of that.\nJORAH MORMONT: You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-\nLYANNA: I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight.\"\nSAM TARLY: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-\"\nLYANN: It's all right. We're done here.\nLYANNA: I wish you good fortune, cousin.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Thank you, my lady.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: What have you got there?\nSAM TARLY: It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.\nJORAH MORMONT: You still have a family.\nSAM TARLY: Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.\nSAM TARLY: I'll see you when it's through.\nSAM TARLY: I hope we win.\nJAIME LANNISTER: We'd better get some rest.\nTYRION LANNISTER: No, let's stay a bit longer.\"\nDAVOS: We're out of wine.\nTYRION LANNISTER: How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?\nDAVOS: You'll pray for a quick death.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ser Brienne?\nTORMUND: Mm-mm.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Mmm.\nPODRICK: High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most.\"\nPODRICK: The ones who'd been gone for so very long.\nPODRICK: She couldn't remember their names. They spun her around on the damp old stones.\nPODRICK: Spun away all her sorrow and pain. And she never wanted to leave\nPODRICK: Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.\nPODRICK: Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Who's that?\nJON SNOW: Lyanna Stark.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her.\"\nJON SNOW: He didn't. He loved her.\nJON SNOW: They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard.\"\nJON SNOW: My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: That's impossible.\nJON SNOW: I wish it were.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Who told you this?\nJON SNOW: Bran. He saw it.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He saw it?\nJON SNOW: And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?\nJON SNOW: It's true, Dany. I know it is.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.\"\nMAN: Form up! Get yourselves back!",
