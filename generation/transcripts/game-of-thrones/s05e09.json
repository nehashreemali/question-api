  "transcript": "DAVOS: A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Horses?\nDAVOS: We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?\nDAVOS: The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Put last night's guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them.\"\nDAVOS: Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell, and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: We're not returning to Castle Black.\nDAVOS: Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can't march forward, and we won't march back…\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Have the dead horses butchered for meat.\nALLISER: Open the gates.\nJON SNOW: It was a failure.\nSAM: It wasn't.\nJON SNOW: I went to save them, I failed.\"\nSAM: You didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else.\"\nJON SNOW: I don't think that fact's lost on them.\nALLISER: You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed.\"\nDAVOS: You sent for me, Your Grace.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I'm sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes.\"\nDAVOS: Your Grace, you've named me your Hand.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Yes.\nDAVOS: The King's Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: You're not abandoning me, you're obeying a command.\"\nDAVOS: A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don't come back empty handed.\"\nDAVOS: Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: My family stays with me.\nDAVOS: At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.\nDAVOS: What's this one now?\nSHIREEN: The Dance of Dragons\nDAVOS: Well that sounds like a proper story.\nSHIREEN: Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection.\"\nDAVOS: But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield.\"\nSHIREEN: And burnt him to a crisp.\nDAVOS: Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess.\"\nDAVOS: Do you like it?\nSHIREEN: He's beautiful.\nSHIREEN: Thank you.\nDAVOS: You're very welcome.\nSHIREEN: Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?\"\nDAVOS: Of course I will.\nSHIREEN: But why am I getting a present?\nDAVOS: Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back.\"\nSHIREEN: You'll just have to read it yourself.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Prince Doran.\nDORAN: Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Princess Myrcella.\nMYRCELLA: Uncle.\nJAIME LANNISTER: What a lovely dress.\nMYRCELLA: You don't like it?\nJAIME LANNISTER: You must be cold.\nMYRCELLA: Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Prince Trystane. How's your jaw?\nTRYSTANE: A fleabite.\nELLARIA: What are you doing in Dorne?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella.\"\nDORAN: And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.\nJAIME LANNISTER: We received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.\nMYRCELLA: That necklace was stolen from my room.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.\nDORAN: We can't behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I've seen war. I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I've seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don't want to lead my people into that hell.\nELLARIA: No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.\"\nDORAN: And that is precisely what we are doing. Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.\"\nDORAN: King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm afraid he does.\nDORAN: I cannot disobey my King's command. She will return with you to King's Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I accept.\nDORAN: One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You have my word.\nELLARIA: The word of a Kingslayer.\nELLARIA: No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.\nDORAN: You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won't.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: May I inquire into the fate of my man?\nDORAN: Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.\nDORAN: Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he's to rule one day. I'll let him decide.\nTRYSTANE: I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You're a good man.\nTRYSTANE: On one condition.\nNYMERIA: Why do we play? I'm better than you, I'll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don't think, I can't recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- -- pain? That one hurt didn't it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister.\"\nTYENE: You're going to miss.\nNYMERIA: I never miss.\nTYENE: You will. You're thinking too much. Now you're nervous. “What if she's right?”\nNYMERIA: Luck.\nTYENE: Now it's my turn.\nNYMERIA: You're too slow. You've always been too slow.\nBRONN: Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?\nAREO: You'll find out very soon.\nTYENE: Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?\"\nBRONN: The most beautiful woman in the world.\nTYENE: And that's the truth!\nNYMERIA: Slut.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.\"\nBRONN: Only the one.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.\nBRONN: Prince. Sorry about the other day.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He's agreed to grant you your freedom.\nBRONN: I'm glad to hear it. The pie looks good.\nJAIME LANNISTER: There was one condition.\nDORAN: Perhaps some soup instead?\nARYA STARK: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--\"\nMAN: How much for your little clam?\nARYA STARK: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!\"\nTHIN MAN: Come on.\nTHIN MAN: Some oysters, girl! I'm talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!\"\nBANKER: Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free.\"\nMACE: Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.\nBANKER: And how goes the harvest in the Reach?\nMACE: Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I'll be sure to send the Arbor's finest your way.\"\nBANKER: I'm afraid I don't partake.\nMACE: Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course.\"\nBANKER: I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.\nMACE: Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.\nBANKER: Most unfortunate for the glovers.\nMACE: If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble.\"\nBANKER: We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.\"\nMACE: You are the worldo s best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.\nBANKER: I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.\nMACE: Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?\"\nBANKER: I don't have that gift.\nMACE: It's not a gift, it's a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”\"\nMERYN: I thought that old shit would never stop singing.\nMAN: It wasn't bad, though.\"\nMERYN: The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.\"\nMERYN: This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos.\"\nMAN: You're buying?\nMERYN: Oh, I'm buying. But I never was good at sharing.\"\nBROTHEL KEEPER: Sell your fish somewhere else.\nPROSTITUTE: Oh let her in, Brusco, I'm hungry. Come here, sweetness.\"\nPROSTITUTE: They say oyster's get the juices flowing. We'll take half a dozen.\nARYA STARK: Three coppers.\nJON SNOW: Here's a silver because the lady likes you.\nMERYN: Too old.\nHEAD PROSTITUTE: Brea.\nHEAD: I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you.\"\nMERYN: Do you have what I want or not?\nHEAD: Of course. Of course.\nMAN: Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry.\"\nMAN: Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.\nMAN: I'll have one.\nHEAD: Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!\nMERYN: Good.\nMERYN: I'll tell you when we're done.\nMERYN: You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.\nHEAD: Of course.\nHEAD: I'll have you whipped, girl! Go on!\"\nMAN: Valaar morghulis.\nJAQEN HGHAR: And?\nARYA STARK: The Thin Man wasn't hungry today.\nJAQEN HGHAR: Perhaps that's why the man is thin.\nARYA STARK: Tomorrow.\nJAQEN HGHAR: Tomorrow.\nJAQEN HGHAR: A girl has work to do.\nDORAN: Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die.\"\nDORAN: I believe in second chances. I don't believe in third chances.\nELLARIA: You write like a 7 year old.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.\nELLARIA: He didn't try to make you pay?\nELLARIA: Then maybe he's changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you'll be bringing her daughter home\nJAIME LANNISTER: She will.\nELLARIA: You love her very much, don't you?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Of course, she's my niece.\"\nELLARIA: I wasn't talking about her.\nELLARIA: You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.\"\nELLARIA: I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.\nSHIREEN: Father. Aren't you cold?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: No. What are you reading?\nSHIREEN: The Dance of Dragons.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: What's it about?\nSHIREEN: It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?\nSHIREEN: That's just what they call it.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Doesn't make much sense.\nSHIREEN: I think it's poetic.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?\"\nSHIREEN: I wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.\"\nSHIREEN: It's alright, father.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: You don't even know what I'm talking about.\nSHIREEN: It doesn't matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Yes there is.\nSHIREEN: Good, I want to. I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I'm your daughter.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Forgive me.\nSHIREEN: Where's my father? I want to see my father.\nMELISANDRE: It will all be over soon, Princess.\"\nSHIREEN: Where's my father? No you can't do this, father where are you?!\"\nSHIREEN: Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!\"\nSELYSE: It's what the Lord wants. It's a good thing. A great thing.\nMELISANDRE: The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.\"\nSELYSE: If we don't act then we'll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…\"\nMELISANDRE: Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!\"\nSHIREEN: Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!\"\nSELYSE: I can't.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: There's no other way. She has King's blood.\nMELISANDRE: Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!\"\nSHIREEN: Mother, don't do this please! Please help! Don't do this! Please, father! Mother, help!\"\nSELYSE: No...\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Where have you been?\nHIZDAHR: Just making sure everything's in order.\nANNOUNCER: Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!\"\nANNOUNCER: My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph\"\nQUICK: I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.\"\nSTRONG: I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.\"\nHIZDAHR: They're waiting for you. Clap your hands.\nDAARIO: That one, the smaller man, no question, that's where you should put your money.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: The smaller man it is.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm not putting my money anywhere.\nHIZDAHR: Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.\nDAARIO: People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.\nHIZDAHR: I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?\"\nDAARIO: Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn't get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.\"\nHIZDAHR: You don't approve?\nTYRION LANNISTER: There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.\nHIZDAHR: Fair enough, yet -- it's an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.\nHIZDAHR: I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: That is greatness?\nHIZDAHR: That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.\nTYRION LANNISTER: My father would have liked you.\nANNOUNCER: We ask again\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.\nHIZDAHR: At your command?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: If need be.\nANNOUNCER: A Meereenese champion?\nHIZDAHR: How many people will die to make this happen?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.\nHIZDAHR: Those men think they're dying for a good reason.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Someone else's reason.\nHIZDAHR: So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don't know their own minds, but you do.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.\"\nANNOUNCER: or a Westerosi Knight?!\nJORAH MORMONT: I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen.\"\nHIZDAHR: Your Grace--\nDAARIO: Shut your mouth.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You can end this.\nHIZDAHR: She cannot.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You can!\nDAARIO: Protect your queen!\nHIZDAHR: Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Stay close!\nJORAH MORMONT: This way!\nDAARIO: The other side, follow me!\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Drogon!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Valahd..\nEND: EPISODE",
