Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You have made a mistake One you will regret I am the wife of the Great Khal\nDOTHRAKI MATRON: We know who you are I remember you eating the stallion's heart Why didn't you come to us after Khal Drogo died?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you\"\nDOTHRAKI MATRON: You were the wife of the Great Khal You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side He didn't I was the wife of the Great Khal Khal Savo I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side You're young We were all young once But we all understand the way things are You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen\nDOTHRAKI MATRON: Yes Immediately after the death of their khal But you went out into the world That is forbidden All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons It is the best you can hope for, now\"\nVARYS: I don't know how you stand it in all that leather\nVARYS: If we could have the room\nVARYS: You look lovely today, my dear You really do How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat\"\nWOMAN: If you're going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it\"\nVARYS: I am not a torturer\nVARYS: Though it so often is what people deserve\nVARYS: And it does provide answers But they're usually the wrong answers My job is to find the right answers Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy I'd like to make you happy, Vala That's your name, isn't it, Vala?\"\nVARYS: That's all right I know who you are and what you've done You've done a lot You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons\"\nVALA: The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history\nVARYS: I understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I'm afraid I don't really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away\"\nVALA: Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you? You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son\"\nVARYS: Children are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem\"\nVALA: If I tell you anything, they'll kill me So either you kill me or they do\"\nVARYS: Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem There is a third option, though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again\"\nVARYS: Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or…\nTYRION LANNISTER: What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things\nTYRION LANNISTER: You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here?\"\nGREY WORM: Patrol When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied What we see on patrol Who we captured on patrol\nTYRION LANNISTER: That's good That's very good\nTYRION LANNISTER: But that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms\nMISSANDEI: Who said this?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Me Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You don't play games, either one of you, ever?\"\nGREY WORM: Games are for children\nMISSANDEI: My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games\nTYRION LANNISTER: There, that's a start\"\nMISSANDEI: Only the girls\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games\"\nMISSANDEI: We do not drink\nTYRION LANNISTER: Until you do\nTYRION LANNISTER: Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, you took your time\"\nVARYS: Sorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you can't rush\nMISSANDEI: You found out?\nVARYS: The good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis\nTYRION LANNISTER: You see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it\nGREY WORM: We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once We will do it again and execute the Masters\nTYRION LANNISTER: If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?\"\nGREY WORM: If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?\"\nMISSANDEI: We cannot The Masters only speak one language They spoke it to me for many years I know it better than my mother tongue If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them May it be the last thing they ever hear\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You may be right\nGREY WORM: So we will fight them?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Possibly\nMISSANDEI: Possibly?\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's a conversation\nTYRION LANNISTER: Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis\"\nVARYS: Of course Man can be fickle, but birds always trust\"\nQYBURN: Your eye looks much better, Arthur How's your mother's jaw?\"\nARTHUR: Better\nQYBURN: And your father?\nARTHUR: No one's seen him\nQYBURN: And no one will That worked out rather nicely\nLITTLE BIRD: Will Lord Varys ever come back?\nQYBURN: I don't think so Do you miss him?\nLITTLE BIRD: He was nice\nARTHUR: He called us his little birds He gave us sweets\nQYBURN: It's funny you should mention that Guess what I happened to find today Candied plums from Dorne\nQYBURN: Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me All I need in return are whispers\"\nQYBURN: No need to be afraid This is Ser Gregor He's friends with all my friends\nQYBURN: Run along now\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Varys's little birds\nQYBURN: Your little birds now, your Grace\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: What did you do to him exactly I haven't been able to get a clear answer\nQYBURN: Oh, a number of things\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Does he understand what we're saying I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place\"\nQYBURN: He understands well enough\nJAIME LANNISTER: So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can't face them all And he won't have to He'll only have to face one\nJAIME LANNISTER: Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Not yet\nJAIME LANNISTER: That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Don't stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are\"\nMAESTER PYCELLE: As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse I told them all I told them He's arrogant, dangerous You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason And no one listened to my advice, so here we are\"\nMAESTER PYCELLE: And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination We never sanctioned this, this experiment And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --\"\nKEVAN: Can I help you\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Why are you here\nMACE TYRELL: My mother...\nLADY OLENNA: I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen's imprisonment\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Thank you for bringing it up It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured\nLADY OLENNA: Margaery is the queen You are not the queen because you're not married to the king I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family\nKEVAN: This is a Small Council meeting You have no position on the Small Council\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm Lord Commander of the Kingsguard The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?\"\nMAESTER PYCELLE: Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King's council Of course, that was the Mad King King Robert saw things differently\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What about Myrcella's death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne We've got a lot to discuss All of us together\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it\"\nKEVAN: No, we cannot make you leave And you cannot make us stay Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all\"\nSPARROW: Oh, your Grace\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: My mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place\nSPARROW: Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace That's not possible Not yet\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: When will it be possible?\nSPARROW: When she's fully atoned for her sins\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: You've cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city That wasn't a full atonement?\nSPARROW: No She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I am the king\nSPARROW: You are\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: And what does that mean to you\nSPARROW: It means a great deal to me The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world Do you know who told me that Your mother\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?\nSPARROW: How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother's presence? It was through their own mothers There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world Because it doesn't come from this world But you know that You've felt it You've seen her when she talks to you\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Yes\nSPARROW: It's a great gift One I never had Envy One more thing for me to atone for\nSPARROW: You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Of course\nSPARROW: When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I still don't understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured\nSPARROW: It's not what I want It's what the gods want They make their will known to us and it's up to us to either accept or reject it\nSPARROW: Please\nSPARROW: If we're to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can And no one is wiser than the gods\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: My grandfather once said something similar Except for the part about the gods\nSPARROW: The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not As they work through your mother There's so much good in all of us The best we can do is to help each other bring it out\nWAIF: Who are you\nARYA STARK: No one\nWAIF: Who were you before you came here\nARYA STARK: Arya Stark\nWAIF: Tell me about Arya Stark's family\nARYA STARK: Her father was Eddard Stark Her mother was Catelyn Stark She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers\"\nARYA STARK: Three brothers\nARYA STARK: Rob, Bran, Rickon And a half-brother, Jon\"\nWAIF: And where are they now?\nARYA STARK: They may be dead for all a girl knows\nWAIF: Tell me about The Hound\nARYA STARK: Also dead\nARYA STARK: Arya Stark left him to die He was on her list\nARYA STARK: He was not on her list anymore She'd taken him off it\nWAIF: Why?
