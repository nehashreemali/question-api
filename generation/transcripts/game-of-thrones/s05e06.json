I'm not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I'm doing it.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",waif,You will know why.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,When?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",waif,When it's time. Not before. Get back to work.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,When do I get to play the game?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",waif,Game?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,The game. The game of faces.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",waif,You tried already. You failed.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,I didn't even know I was playing.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",waif,Who are you?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,No one.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,Well who are you? What are you doing here? How'd you get here?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",waif,\"I'm from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I've been serving them ever since.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",waif,Was that true or a lie?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,What?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",waif,Did you believe every word I said?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaqen hghar,Who are you?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,Arya.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaqen hghar,And where did you come from?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaqen hghar,A lie.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,\"A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn't. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,I hated him.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,I hated him!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,That's not a lie!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaqen hghar,The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,Yes.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaqen hghar,We never stop playing.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can't live on berries and roots.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,I can.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,You're not hungry?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,Of course I'm hungry.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,I am not your travelling companion.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,We are travelling together. In each other's company. Therefore…\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,Do you ever shut up?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,Why?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,I'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,What do you know about my father?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,How?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,I only know what I heard\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,We better keep moving.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",man,Valar morghulis.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,Valar dohaeris.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",man,I have nowhere else to go. I've taken her to every healer in Braavos. I've spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",girl,It hurts.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,\"I know. Don't be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",arya stark,I've devoted my life to him now. You don't want to hurt anymore. Drink.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaqen hghar,\"Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaqen hghar,No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,Do you believe in anything?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,I believe in many things.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,\"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,No.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,\"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,It's hard to be a cynic after that.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,No it doesn't.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,First we have to conquer the world.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,Then she rules.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,She is the rightful heir.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,Shh! It's a slave ship\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,Why is it anchored?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,They probably came ashore for--\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,water.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sam tarly,PLACE - LATER\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,\"Got a lot of fight in you, huh?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",slaver,Salt mines.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",slaver,What about the dwarf?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,Worthless. Cut his throat.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf's cock has magic powers.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",slaver,It will be a dwarf-sized cock.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,Guess again.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,\"We're bound to Volantis, not Slaver's Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,Him.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,Him? He's got to be 60 years old.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,Is that true?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,\"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",tyrion lannister,The Kingslayer!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,Jousting. You're talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",malko,Liar.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jorah mormont,\"It's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",lancel,Lord Baelish.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,Yes? Lancel Lannister.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",lancel,Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,That's quite a family to abandon.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",lancel,\"The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,Well done.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",lancel,\"Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You'll find that there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,\"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,\"Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,\"House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,One's choice of companion is a curious thing.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,\"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,Good. If there's nothing else.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,\"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,That's not possible.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,\"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,We were fools to trust a turncloak.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,\"I would counsel patience, your grace.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,\"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,\"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,\"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,\"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,\"Ser Jaime, then.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,\"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,\"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,\"You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,And if you succeed?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,Name me Warden of the North.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",petyr baelish,As I said. I live to serve.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",trystane,I'm going to ask him tomorrow.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,What if he says no?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",trystane,He won't. You've waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,\"Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,We can't. Not yet.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",trystane,Why not?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,You know why not. Someone will see.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",trystane,You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",trystane,I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,\"They don't go squinty, and you didnt answer the question.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",doran,They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",areo,\"Yes, my prince.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",doran,You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",areo,I remember how.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaime lannister,\"Alright, thats enough.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,I'm coming to the best part.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaime lannister,We're trying to blend in. We don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,This song really is all about the ending.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaime lannister,It can wait. Up there.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaime lannister,That's the Water Gardens.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,\"Once we got the princess, then what?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaime lannister,I like to improvise.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,That explains the golden hand.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",ellaria,\"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sand snakes,For Oberyn.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,\"Well, she's made herself at home.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaime lannister,Myrcella.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,\"Uncle Jaime? I don't understand, what are you doing here?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaime lannister,Let's speak in private.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",trystane,I am Trystane Martell.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,Trystane is my intended.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaime lannister,Excellent. Good to meet you.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",trystane,\"We weren't expecting you, Ser Jaime.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,\"Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,Let's not do something stupid.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,No!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,That was something stupid.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaime lannister,\"We have to go, Myrcella, now.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,You hurt him!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",jaime lannister,\"You'll be fine, I promise, but we have to--\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,Oh for fuck's sake.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",obara,You're coming with me.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myrcella,I don't want to!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",obara,\"I wasn't asking, princess.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",areo,Drop you weapons!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",obara,I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",areo,Drop your weapons!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",areo,\"When you were whole, it would have been a good fight.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",bronn,You fight pretty good for a little girl.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",rider,Halt!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,\"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,\"Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",margaery tyrell,Everyone knew about him and Renly.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",margaery tyrell,But he was the king's brother.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,\"And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",margaery tyrell,Cersei is behind this.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,\"Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,\"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,You must be exhausted.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,\"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren't writing anything.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,\"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,Beg your pardon.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,If you apologize for that comment perhaps--\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,You'll get your apology when I get Loras.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,\"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,\"As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,What veil?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,\"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",loras,I don't pay attention to rumors.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,\"You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis' army closed in\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",loras,He was my friend. He was my king.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,\"Wasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",loras,I was wrong to support Renly's claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,Wearing Renly's armor.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",loras,Why does it matter what I wore?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,\"Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",loras,Of course I deny them.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,You never lay with Renly Baratheon.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",loras,Never.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,Nor any other man.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,That will be all Ser Loras.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,Well I think that's quite enough of that.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",margaery tyrell,You call me forward?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,Yes. We have some questions for you.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",margaery tyrell,I am the queen.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,\"You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,How do you respond to these charges against your brother?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",margaery tyrell,They are lies.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,All of them?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",margaery tyrell,All of them.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,\"Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",margaery tyrell,\"Yes, I swear it.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,\"Thank you, your grace.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,Do you know this man?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olyvar,\"Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,How did you come to meet?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olyvar,I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,And what occurred in his chamber?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olyvar,We engaged in intimate relations.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,You laid with him?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olyvar,That night and many others.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",loras,Liar! He's a liar!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,Is there anyone else who can support your claim?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olyvar,\"Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn't seem surprised.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",cersei lannister,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olyvar,\"He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",loras,Liar!\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",olenna tyrell,What are you doing? Let us pass.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",margaery tyrell,What?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sparrow,Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any.

You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don't you?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myranda,\"You're so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sansa stark,What others?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myranda,I shouldn't gossip. It's good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myranda,\"Let's see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith's daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don't they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sansa stark,Hunt?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",myranda,\"Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty.

He'll punish me.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sansa stark,Do you think I care what he does to you.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",roose,Who comes before the Old Gods this night?\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",theon greyjoy,\"Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",ramsay bolton,Ramsay of House Bolton.

We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don't you think?\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",sansa stark,Yes sir.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",ramsay bolton,Good. Now take off your clothes.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",ramsay bolton,\"Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time.\"\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",ramsay bolton,Reek? I told you to watch.\n UNBENT:  Unbroken\",ramsay bolton,You've known Sansa since she was a girl.
