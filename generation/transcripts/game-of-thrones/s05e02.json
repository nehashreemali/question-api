He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies.\"\nARYA STARK: He's just a statue.\nMAN: Don't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.\nARYA STARK: I'm not afraid.\nMAN: The House of Black and White\nMAN: Here, I leave you.\"\nARYA STARK: Thank you for bringing me.\nMAN: Any man of Braavos would have done the same. Valar morghulis.\nARYA STARK: Valar dohaeris.\nARYA STARK: Hello. Valar Morghulis.\nARYA STARK: Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.\nOLD MAN: No one here by that name.\nARYA STARK: Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.\nOLD MAN: You have everywhere else to go.\nARYA STARK: But wait!\nARYA STARK: Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant.\"\nARYA STARK: The Mountain, Meryn Trant.\"\nPODRICK: Must be good food if it's crowded.\nWAITRESS: Ale? Ale?\nSANSA STARK: Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: You are becoming an observant young lady.\nSANSA STARK: My mother used to say, \"\"dark wings, dark words\"\".\"\nPETYR BAELISH: An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.\nSANSA STARK: So it was good news.?\nPETYR BAELISH: My marriage proposal has been accepted.\nSANSA STARK: I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.\nWAITRESS: Ale?\nSANSA STARK: I'll have some.\nPODRICK: My lady!\nBRIENNE: What is it?\nPODRICK: Sansa Stark. Don't look!\nBRIENNE: You sure?\nPODRICK: She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.\"\nBRIENNE: Littlefinger?\nPODRICK: A bunch of knights with him.\nBRIENNE: Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?\nPODRICK: 10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--\"\nBRIENNE: Ready the horses.\nPODRICK: We only have one horse.\nBRIENNE: Find more.\nPETYR BAELISH: Do you like the taste?\nSANSA STARK: I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?\nPETYR BAELISH: It gives some men courage.\nSANSA STARK: Does it give you courage?\nGUARD: That's far enough.\nBRIENNE: Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, \"\"You're a loyalty comes free of charge.\"\" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.\"\nBRIENNE: Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?\"\nBRIENNE: I was.\nPETYR BAELISH: Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.\nBRIENNE: It was after Renly's murder.\nPETYR BAELISH: Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him.\"\nBRIENNE: I tried to save him.\nPETYR BAELISH: But you were accused.\nBRIENNE: By men who didn't see what happened.\nPETYR BAELISH: Then what did happen?\nBRIENNE: He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.\nPETYR BAELISH: A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?\nBRIENNE: Why should you have any say in her affairs?\nPETYR BAELISH: Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders.\"\nBRIENNE: Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--\"\nSANSA STARK: No.\nBRIENNE: Please, my lady. If I could explain--\"\nSANSA STARK: I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.\nBRIENNE: Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.\nSANSA STARK: And sometimes we do. You should leave.\nPETYR BAELISH: We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?\nKNIGHT: He asked you to stay.\nGUARD: After her!\nBRIENNE: Podrick!\nPODRICK: Stop, stop, stop! That's a good boy.\"\nKNIGHT: I guess that means you're unarmed.\nBRIENNE: Down, Podrick, down!\"\nBRIENNE: Podrick?\nPODRICK: Yes, my lady?\"\nBRIENNE: You can stand now.\nPODRICK: Yes, my lady. Sansa Stark?\"\nBRIENNE: Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We'll follow them.\"\nPODRICK: My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow.\"\nBRIENNE: I swore to their mother I'd protect those girls.\nPODRICK: If they don't want your protection--\nBRIENNE: Do you think she's safe from Littlefinger?\nPODRICK: No, my lady.\"\nBRIENNE: Get your horse.\nJAIME LANNISTER: A summons from the queen.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: There are only two like it in the world\nJAIME LANNISTER: It's a threat.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Of course it's a threat! Our daughter's in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. \"\"It's a threat.\"\"\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: No note.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Softer.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Not so loud.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Our daughter's in danger, and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly!\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: The world can't know knows she's our daughter.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Then don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her.\nJAIME LANNISTER: If I was the father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'll make things better.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You never made anything better.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm going to Dorne. I'll bring our daughter home.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She's promised his son.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm not going to ask him anything.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You go there with an army, it's an act of war.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: No army. Do you know where they're keeping her?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I never said I was going alone.\nLOLLYS STOKEWORTH: No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?\"\nLOLLYS: Don't they?\nBRONN: Don't who?\nLOLLYS: People eat pigeon pie in the capital.\nBRONN: They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do.\"\nBRONN: It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this.\"\nLOLLYS: You won't.\nBRONN: Pardon?\nLOLLYS: We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older.\"\nBRONN: Oh.\nLOLLYS: She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking.\"\nBRONN: You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.\nLOLLYS: She is.\nBRONN: I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another.\"\nLOLLYS: Who's that?\nBRONN: Jaime fucking Lannister.\nBRONN: Ser Jaime.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.\nBRONN: I was very sorry to hear about your father.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Thank you.\nBRONN: This is my betrothed, Lollys.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: A pleasure.\nBRONN: Run along, love.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?\nBRONN: Just get on with it.\nJAIME LANNISTER: On with what?\nBRONN: What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It's very good for you.\nBRONN: Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Mmm.\nBRONN: We made a deal, your sister and I.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I would have advised against that.\nBRONN: How is this good for me?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle.\"\nBRONN: Return from where?\nJAIME LANNISTER: As far south as south goes.\nTRYSTANE: My future queen.\nAREO: The prince does not wish to be disturbed.\nELLARIA: Remove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--\"\nDORAN: Captain. Let her pass.\nELLARIA: Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing.\"\nDORAN: Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder.\"\nELLARIA: Your brother--\nDORAN: You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.\nELLARIA: What will you do about his death.\nDORAN: I will bury him. I will mourn for him.\nELLARIA: You would have me go to war?\nDORAN: You would have me go to war?\nELLARIA: The whole country would have you go to war.\nDORAN: Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.\nELLARIA: The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.\nELLARIA: Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?\"\nDORAN: I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.\nELLARIA: And how long will that be?\nDAARIO: The Unsullied are too conspicuous.\nDAARIO: Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?\"\nDAARIO: My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it...\"\nGREY WORM: No one here. We go.\nDAARIO: In a hurry? You're afraid?\nGREY WORM: Unsullied fear nothing.\nDAARIO: Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide.\"\nDAARIO: Fear is useful that way.\nMOSSADOR: Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: It would send a message.\nBARRISTAN: I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Why?\nBARRISTAN: For one thing, he may have valuable information.\"\nDAARIO: The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.\nBARRISTAN: How do you know that?\nDAARIO: Because I questioned him.\nHIZDAHR: And the information you did get, he is young and poor.\"\nMOSSADOR: He is born free.\nHIZDAHR: Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.\nMOSSADOR: They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.\nHIZDAHR: And how do you know this?\nMOSSADOR: Everyone knows this.\nHIZDAHR: I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family.\"\nBARRISTAN: We do not know what this man did or didn't do. Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way.\"\nMOSSADOR: I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Thank you all for your counsel.\nBARRISTAN: Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: About what?\nBARRISTAN: About your father. About the Mad King.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.\nBARRISTAN: Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Go on.\nBARRISTAN: When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm not my father.\nBARRISTAN: No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.\nBARRISTAN: Your Grace.\nTYRION LANNISTER: There's a bug.\nVARYS: Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?\"\nVARYS: You don't like it?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I want to take a walk.\nVARYS: You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.\nTYRION LANNISTER: She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.\"\nVARYS: Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?\nVARYS: The road to Meereen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?\nVARYS: I told you. A ruler.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.\nVARYS: You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I didn't rule. I was a servant.\nVARYS: Still, a man of talent.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Managed to kill a lot of people.\nVARYS: Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.\nVARYS: Why?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.\nVARYS: People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I find us repulsive.\nVARYS: And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're right. Let's go for a walk.\nVARYS: No.\nTYRION LANNISTER: How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Not him.\nMERYN: Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made.\"\nHUNTERS: Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Take the head.\nQYBURN: Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Very good.\nQYBURN: Over there will be fine.\nMERYN: You heard the man. Over there.\nKEVAN: You're the Hand of the King?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.\"\nMACE TYRELL: Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin.\"\nMACE: Oh, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.\nMACE: The honor is all mine, Your Grace.\"\nPYCELLE: Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.\nPYCELLE: Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have.\"\nPYCELLE: I must say I cannot see--\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title.\"\nKEVAN: That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The king is very busy at this moment.\nKEVAN: He should be here, learning what it means to rule.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.\"\nKEVAN: I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.\nKEVAN: What mission?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That is not your concern as Master of War.\nKEVAN: I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You would abandon your king in his time of need?\nKEVAN: If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock.\"\nSHIREEN: Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.\nGILLY: Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!\nSHIREEN: Right, very good!\"\nSAM: Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?\"\nGILLY: I know \"\"S\"\".\"\nSHIREEN: You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things.\"\nGILLY: Well, you're a wonderful teacher. Very patient!\"\nSAM: I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read.\"\nGILLY: That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.\nGILLY: How old were you when you learned to read?\nSHIREEN: Three.\nSAM: Three?! Who taught you, your mother?\"\nSHIREEN: No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...\nGILLY: What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?\"\nSHIREEN: Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?\nGILLY: I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?\nSHIREEN: I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?\"\nGILLY: My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.\nSAM: Did you ever see them?\nGILLY: Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.\"\nSHIREEN: What did he do to them in the woods?\nSHIREEN: Mother.\nSELYSE: Leave us.\nSAM: Your Grace.\nSELYSE: You need to stay away from that girl.\nSHIREEN: Why?\nSELYSE: She's a wildling.\nSHIREEN: Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.\nSELYSE: She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.\nSHIREEN: Gilly wouldn't do that.\nSELYSE: You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you.\"\nJON SNOW: With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Who then? You?\nJON SNOW: No. Only one of their own.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?\nJON SNOW: The Lord Commander's niece.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response.\"\nJON SNOW: Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: That amuses you?\nJON SNOW: I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.\nDAVOS: Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.\"\nJON SNOW: Most likely.\nDAVOS: Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?\nJON SNOW: Unpleasant, I expect.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.\nJON SNOW: I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: You can give me the North.\nJON SNOW: I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell.\"\nSAM: He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?\nJON SNOW: It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again.\"\nSAM: You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.\nJON SNOW: I'm going to refuse him.\nSAM: But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.\nJON SNOW: I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?\"\nALLISER: Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.\nAEMON: Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?\nJANOS: Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings.\"\nMEN: Hear, hear.\"\nJANOS: He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.\nAEMON: Is there anyone else?\nSHADOW TOWER BROTHER: Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better.\"\nAEMON: If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--\"\nSAM: Maester Aemon.\nAEMON: Samwell Tarly. Go on.\nJANOS: Sam the Slayer.\nJANOS: Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?\nSAM: Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.\nJANOS: Lies!\nSAM: A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making.\"\nSAM: Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading.\"\nSAM: Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest.\"\nALLISER: I can't argue with any of that. But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?\"\nAEMON: It is time.\nBROTHER: It appears to be a tie, Maester.\"\nBROTHERS: Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!\nMAN: You. You!\nMAN: What have you got there?\nMAN: I said--\nARYA STARK: Turn around and go. Turn around and go.\nMAN: That's a nice little sword. Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that.\"\nARYA STARK: Nothing's worth anything to dead men.\nMEN: Quickly, go, go!\"\nARYA STARK: Who are you? Why were they scared of you?\nOLD MAN: You lost this.\nARYA STARK: You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.\nJAQEN HGHAR: There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.\nARYA STARK: Well who are you then?\nJAQEN HGHAR: No one. And that is who a girl must become.\nHARPY: She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her \"\"Mhysa\"\", she will never be your mother.\"\nMOSSADOR: For you, Mhysa. You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right.\"\nMOSSADOR: He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.\nMOSSADOR: Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting.
