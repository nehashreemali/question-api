The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You fell in love with a whore.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.\nTYRION LANNISTER: At least I got to tell them what they really are.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It is tempting.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: If he wins.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No. Not Ser Meryn.\nGUARD: Go on, move it.\"\nGUARD: And you. Come on.\nPRISONER: Mercy. Please. Please, mercy.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You seem to be in good form.\nMOUNTAIN: Who am I fighting?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Does it matter?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Could be food.\nARYA STARK: Could be soldiers.\nARYA STARK: You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.\nDYING MAN: Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Who were \"\"they\"\"?\"\nDYING MAN: I stopped asking a while ago.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: That's not gonna get better.\nDYING MAN: Doesn't seem so.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?\nDYING MAN: Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.\nARYA STARK: So why go on?\nDYING MAN: Habit.\nARYA STARK: Nothing could be worse than this.\nDYING MAN: Maybe nothing is worse than this.\nARYA STARK: Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.\nDYING MAN: Who are you?\nARYA STARK: My name is Arya. Arya Stark.\nDYING MAN: You her father?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.\nDYING MAN: A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work.\"\nDYING MAN: Wish it were wine.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: So do I.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: The fuck you doing?\nRORGE: There's a price on your head.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.\nRORGE: The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?\"\nARYA STARK: You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?\nARYA STARK: He can't be. I don't know his name.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: What's your name?\nRORGE: Rorge.\nARYA STARK: Thank you.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You're learning.\nMAN: Rangers returning!\nMAN: They return!\nJON SNOW: Greetings.\nMAN: Didn't think I'd see you again.\nSAM: All right, Jon?\"\nMAN: Welcome back, brother.\"\nALLISER: Lord Snow.\nALLISER: This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.\nJON SNOW: Come on, Ghost.\"\nJON SNOW: Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.\nJANOS SLYNT: I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?\"\nJON SNOW: We need to prepare.\nALLISER: We've been preparing.\nJON SNOW: We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.\nALLISER: And how would we range north?\nJON SNOW: We wouldn't.\nALLISER: Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?\"\nGRENN: We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.\nALLISER: This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.\"\nJON SNOW: Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.\"\nALLISER: The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.\nJON SNOW: They won't stop them.\nALLISER: Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.\"\nJON SNOW: The stewards.\nALLISER: Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?\nJON SNOW: No.\nALLISER: Who would that be?\nJON SNOW: The builders.\nALLISER: Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?\"\nYARWICK: No.\nALLISER: Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.\"\nALLISER: Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.\"\nYARWICK: Aye.\nBRONN: My lord.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You have new clothes.\nBRONN: Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I sent for you days ago.\nBRONN: I've been a bit busy.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Doing what?\nBRONN: My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.\nBRONN: I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.\nTYRION LANNISTER: She's dim-witted.\nBRONN: If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?\"\nBRONN: Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And you understand the rules of inheritance?\nBRONN: Falyse is forty and barren.\nTYRION LANNISTER: She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.\nBRONN: She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.\nBRONN: What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?\nBRONN: You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Is it two wives you want or two castles?\nBRONN: One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.\nBRONN: I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?\nTYRION LANNISTER: You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.\nBRONN: Your sister's a Lannister, too.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.\"\nBRONN: If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Does he frighten you so much?\nBRONN: I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Because you're my friend.\nBRONN: Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?\"\nBRONN: I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I understand.\nBRONN: I'm sorry it has to be this way.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.\nBRONN: We had some good days together.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, we did.\"\nBRONN: What will you do?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?\nBRONN: I hope to hear them sing it one day.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,\"\nDAARIO: But your window is not.\nDAARIO: I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Don't do that again.\nDAARIO: Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you.\"\nDAARIO: Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Tell me why you're here.\nDAARIO: I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.\nDAARIO: You've ordered us to be night watchmen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.\"\nDAARIO: There is only one, and she does not want me.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You swore me your sword.\nDAARIO: My sword is yours till the day I die.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?\nDAARIO: I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Very well.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Do what you do best.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Take off your clothes.\nSELYSE: Oh.\nMELISANDRE: Come in, my queen. Please.\"\nSELYSE: I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.\"\nMELISANDRE: You could never disturb me.\nSELYSE: I just wanted to speak with you before we left.\nMELISANDRE: Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.\nMELISANDRE: No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one.\"\nMELISANDRE: When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, \"\"Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count.\"\" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid.\"\nSELYSE: It was. I- humor isn't my strength.\nMELISANDRE: That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.\nSELYSE: If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?\"\nMELISANDRE: Not always.\nMELISANDRE: Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust.\"\nSELYSE: Did you use it with Stannis?\nMELISANDRE: No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.\nMELISANDRE: It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.\nSELYSE: No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home.\"\nMELISANDRE: I understand how you feel.\nSELYSE: Hmm.\nMELISANDRE: But that is impossible.\nSELYSE: Why?\nMELISANDRE: You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself.\"\nMELISANDRE: However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her.\"\nDAARIO: Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.\nJORAH MORMONT: Khaleesi.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You're here early.\nJORAH MORMONT: Later than some.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You don't approve?\nJORAH MORMONT: It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You neither approve nor trust.\nJORAH MORMONT: Why would I? The man's a sellsword.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?\nJORAH MORMONT: I did.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I trust you.\nJORAH MORMONT: Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.\nJORAH MORMONT: You have?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I have.\nJORAH MORMONT: Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?\nJORAH MORMONT: It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.\nJORAH MORMONT: I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And now you are helping me show them to freedom.\nJORAH MORMONT: I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.\nJORAH MORMONT: Hizdahr zo Loraq?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Yes, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No. Tell him you changed my mind.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Rat cunts. Fucking whore.\nARYA STARK: You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: No fire.\nARYA STARK: It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: No fire!\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.\nARYA STARK: Why?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?\"\nARYA STARK: Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.\nBRIENNE: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.\nPODRICK: Couldn't agree more, my lady.\"\nBRIENNE: Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.\nPODRICK: Yes, my lady.\"\nBRIENNE: Don't get drunk.\nPODRICK: No, my lady.\"\nHOT PIE: Can I get you anything else?\nBRIENNE: No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful.\"\nHOT PIE: Thanks. I do my best.\nHOT PIE: A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?\"\nBRIENNE: No.\nHOT PIE: Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?\"\nBRIENNE: We're looking for someone.\nHOT PIE: Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-\nBRIENNE: A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.\"\nHOT PIE: Starks? What, like them lot from \"\"Winterhell\"\"?\"\nHOT PIE: No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here.\"\nBRIENNE: I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.\nHOT PIE: Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?\nBRIENNE: What?\nPODRICK: It's nothing, my lady.\"\nBRIENNE: You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.\nPODRICK: Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't.\"\nBRIENNE: You're not interesting enough to be offensive.\nPODRICK: The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.\nHOT PIE: My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?\nBRIENNE: What about? Not kidney pie.\nHOT PIE: You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.\nBRIENNE: No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.\nHOT PIE: She weren't when I last spoke to her.\nBRIENNE: When was that?\nHOT PIE: Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry.\"\nBRIENNE: So what happened to her?\nHOT PIE: Well-\nBRIENNE: The quick version.\nHOT PIE: The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.\nPODRICK: The Hound.\nHOT PIE: That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.\"\nBRIENNE: Um, you were saying?\"\nBRIENNE: Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.\"\nPODRICK: They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.\"\nBRIENNE: Why the Eyrie?\nPODRICK: Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.\"\nBRIENNE: Sansa could be there, too.\"\nPODRICK: Aye, my lady. Could be.\"\nBRIENNE: You sure about this?\nPODRICK: No.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.\nOBERYN MARTELL: I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Your sister.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.\nOBERYN MARTELL: It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.\nTYRION LANNISTER: She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I think I would have remembered that.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You and my family have more in common than you might admit.\nOBERYN MARTELL: The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: That would have made things so much easier.\nOBERYN MARTELL: When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, \"\"Soon.\"\" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. \"\"That's not a monster,\"\" I told Cersei. \"\"That's just a baby.\"\" And she said, \"\"He killed my mother.\"\" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. \"\"It doesn't matter,\"\" she told us. \"\"Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long.\"\"\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: I disagree.\nOBERYN MARTELL: I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion.\"\nSANSA STARK: Hello, Robin.\"\nROBIN: What are you doing?\nSANSA STARK: I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time.\"\nROBIN: Why did you leave?\nSANSA STARK: It's a long story.\nROBIN: I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.\nSANSA STARK: Yes, you certainly are.\"\nROBIN: When will you go back?\nSANSA STARK: Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.\nROBIN: Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?\nSANSA STARK: No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.\"\nROBIN: That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?\nSANSA STARK: We don't.\nROBIN: What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?\nSANSA STARK: I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.\nROBIN: Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door.\"\nSANSA STARK: I like the sound of that.\nROBIN: Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.\nSANSA STARK: All right.\nROBIN: It can go in here in this big tower.\nSANSA STARK: Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.\nROBIN: I didn't ruin it.\nSANSA STARK: You did.\nROBIN: It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.\nSANSA STARK: Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.\nROBIN: I didn't ruin it!\nSANSA STARK: You're being stupid.\nSANSA STARK: Robin, I'm sorry, I-\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Children.\nSANSA STARK: I hit him.\nPETYR BAELISH: Yes, I saw.\"\nSANSA STARK: I shouldn't have done that.\nPETYR BAELISH: No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction.\"\nSANSA STARK: If he tells Aunt Lysa...\nPETYR BAELISH: Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.\nSANSA STARK: I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.\nPETYR BAELISH: A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.\"\nSANSA STARK: Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.\nPETYR BAELISH: I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: You're more beautiful than she ever was.\nSANSA STARK: Lord Baelish...\nPETYR BAELISH: Call me Petyr.\nSANSA STARK: You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?\"\nLYSA: Come here, Sansa.\"\nLYSA: Do you know how far the fall is?\nSANSA STARK: No.\nLYSA: Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did.\"\nSANSA STARK: I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-\"\nLYSA: Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr.\"\nSANSA STARK: I didn't. You don't understand.\nLYSA: I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.\nSANSA STARK: He kissed me. I pulled away.\nLYSA: Liar! Whore! He is mine!\nSANSA STARK: Please!\nLYSA: My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Lysa! Let her go.\nLYSA: You want her? This empty-headed child?\nPETYR BAELISH: Let her go.\nLYSA: She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?\nPETYR BAELISH: I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister.\"",
