Lord of Light, give us wisdom. For the night is dark and full of terrors.\"\nMEN: For the night is dark and full of terrors.\nTHOROS: Get back.\nMEN: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.\nARYA STARK: Kill him!\nTHOROS: Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished. Restore it.\"\nTHOROS: For the night is dark and full of terrors. Lord, cast-\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Arya, don't!\"\nTHOROS: Bring him back from death and darkness\nARYA STARK: No! Let go of me! Let me go!\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.\nARYA STARK: Burn in hell!\nBERIC: He will. But not today.\nTORMUND: Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know.\nJON SNOW: There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies.\"\nORELL: How often do these patrols go out?\nJON SNOW: It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.\"\nORELL: You'd like to know that.\nTORMUND: There are nineteen castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?\nJON SNOW: Three.\nORELL: You sure of that?\nORELL: Which three?\nJON SNOW: Castle Black.\nORELL: Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?\"\nJON SNOW: Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.\nTORMUND: How many men remain in Castle Black?\nJON SNOW: A thousand.\nORELL: Liar.\nJON SNOW: What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?\nYGRITTE: He's no crow.\nORELL: Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.\nYGRITTE: I'm not afraid of you.\nTORMUND: I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat.\"\nJON SNOW: A thousand men.\nTORMUND: We'll find out soon enough.\nJON SNOW: I don't need you to protect me.\nYGRITTE: Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.\nJON SNOW: Give it back.\nYGRITTE: Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.\"\nJON SNOW: Ygritte! Ygritte!\nJON SNOW: Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!\nYGRITTE: Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.\nJON SNOW: Ygritte.\nYGRITTE: You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.\nYGRITTE: All of me.\nJON SNOW: We shouldn't.\nYGRITTE: We should.\nYGRITTE: Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-\"\nYGRITTE: That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?\nJON SNOW: I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.\nYGRITTE: Hmm.\nJON SNOW: You seemed to like it.\nYGRITTE: Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?\"\nJON SNOW: There's been no one else. Only you.\nYGRITTE: A maid. You were a maid.\nJON SNOW: I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?\nYGRITTE: What do you think?\nJON SNOW: Who was he?\nYGRITTE: Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.\"\nJON SNOW: Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-\"\nYGRITTE: I'm not done with you yet.\nYGRITTE: How long's it been since you had a bath?\nYGRITTE: Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I want my gold.\nTHOROS: It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.\nANGUY: We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass.\"\nARYA STARK: You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.\nBERIC: Not in the eyes of god.\nARYA STARK: You can't!\nBERIC: Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.\nBERIC: Go in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.\"\nMAN: Riders coming through!\nMAN: The Kingslayer.\nMAN: Down!\nLOCKE: On your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.\"\nROOSE BOLTON: Pick him up, Locke.\"\nROOSE BOLTON: You've lost a hand.\nLOCKE: No, my lord, he has it here.\"\nROOSE BOLTON: Take this away.\nLOCKE: Send it to his father?\nROOSE BOLTON: You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.\nROOSE BOLTON: Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now.\"\nBRIENNE: Thank you, my lord.\"\nROOSE BOLTON: Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Lord Bolton.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Is there word from the capital?\nROOSE BOLTON: You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.\nROOSE BOLTON: Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Will I die?\nQYBURN: No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?\nQYBURN: The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I don't need my right hand to kill you.\nQYBURN: I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Mmm.\nQYBURN: With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: No milk of the poppy.\nQYBURN: There will be pain.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'll scream.\nQYBURN: Quite a bit of pain.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'll scream loudly.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Lord Baelish.\nPETYR BAELISH: Your Grace.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.\nPETYR BAELISH: Of course, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.\nPETYR BAELISH: I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.\nPETYR BAELISH: Myself, I often find them a hindrance.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I shall do my best.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?\nPETYR BAELISH: I assure you that it will.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern.\"\nPODRICK: Pardon, my lady.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Naturally.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.\nOLENNA TYRELL: What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I understand that.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Good.\nTYRION LANNISTER: But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: And?\nTYRION LANNISTER: And we're at war, Lady Olenna.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, and maintaining supply lines-\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.\nOLENNA TYRELL: As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I would.\nOLENNA TYRELL: And traditionally paid for by the royal family.\nOLENNA TYRELL: I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: My lady-\nOLENNA TYRELL: Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Quite sufficient. Thank you.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Give me that.\nARYA STARK: What are you doing?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Just mending Lord Beric's armor.\nARYA STARK: Why?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.\nARYA STARK: Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.\nARYA STARK: You don't have to do this.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I want to. They need good men.\nARYA STARK: Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving.\"\nARYA STARK: You just said you were serving Lord Beric.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family.\"\nARYA STARK: I can be your family.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.\nMARTYN: Willem. Willem!\nWILLEM: Is this a rescue?\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Lannister filth! Take him!\nMARTYN: Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-\"\nROBB STARK: Bring them in.\nROBB STARK: Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance.\"\nROBB STARK: Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.\nROBB STARK: They were boys! Look at them.\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.\nROBB STARK: My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.\nRICKARD KARSTARK: It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?\"\nROBB STARK: Leave him.\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?\nROBB STARK: Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.\nMAN: Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards.\"\nROBB STARK: This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.\nMAN: Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!\"\nEDMURE: Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.\nROBB STARK: Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?\nEDMURE: It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.\nROBB STARK: I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die.\"\nCATELYN STARK: The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.\nTALISA: Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.\"\nROBB STARK: You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.\nTALISA: And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.\nCATELYN STARK: Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.\nEDMURE: A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed.\"\nRICKARD KARSTARK: The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin- Stark and Karstark.\"\nROBB STARK: That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.\nRICKARD KARSTARK: I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.\nROBB STARK: Kneel, my lord.\"\nROBB STARK: Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?\"\nRICKARD KARSTARK: Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.\nARYA STARK: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?\nTHOROS: At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.\nARYA STARK: I'm a hostage and you're selling me.\nTHOROS: Don't think of it that way.\nARYA STARK: But it is that way.\nTHOROS: It is. And it isn't.\nARYA STARK: More is than isn't.\nTHOROS: Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.\"\nARYA STARK: So why don't you?\nTHOROS: We need the gold.\nBERIC: Do I frighten you, child?\"\nARYA STARK: No.\nBERIC: You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.\nARYA STARK: I thought he killed you.\nBERIC: He did.\nARYA STARK: But how?\nBERIC: Thoros how many times have you brought me back?\nTHOROS: It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.\nBERIC: How many times?\nTHOROS: Five, I think. No, this makes six.\"\nBERIC: Six.\nTHOROS: There was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.\nBERIC: Then I was stabbed in the belly.\nTHOROS: Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.\nBERIC: Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?\nTHOROS: Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.\nTHOROS: And the Hound makes six.\nBERIC: Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.\nTHOROS: You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know.\"\nBERIC: I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away.\"\nARYA STARK: Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.\nTHOROS: I don't think it works that way, child.\"\nBERIC: He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him.\"\nARYA STARK: I would. You're alive.\nSELYSE: Lord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors.\"\nSELYSE: I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: My lady.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I meant to come sooner. The battle-\nSELYSE: I know of your troubles, My king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Yes, of course.\"\nSELYSE: You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I believed that once.\nSELYSE: You are the one godo s champion and the finest man I've ever known.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.\nSELYSE: No.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I've wronged you. I have shamed you.\nSELYSE: You're doing godo s work.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-\nSELYSE: I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy.\"\nSELYSE: Oh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you - nothing.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: That's not true.\nSELYSE: So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: She's my daughter. I want to see her.\nSELYSE: You are a king. You don't need my permission.\nSHIREEN: Under the sea I know, I know/ Oh, oh, oh\"\nSHIREEN: The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Shireen.\nSHIREEN: Father!\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: You've grown since I last saw you.\nSHIREEN: Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: No.\nSHIREEN: Did the Onion Knight come back with you?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: He did. He fought bravely.\nSHIREEN: He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: He won't be visiting, child.\"\nSHIREEN: Why not? He's my friend. Look.\nSHIREEN: He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.\nBRIENNE: What are you doing here?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Now get out.\nBRIENNE: There's another tub.\nJAIME LANNISTER: This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.\"\nBRIENNE: Why should I care how you die?\nJAIME LANNISTER: You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-\nBRIENNE: Don't you mock me.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.\nBRIENNE: You need trust to have a truce.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I trust you.\nJAIME LANNISTER: There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?\nBRIENNE: Of course.\nJAIME LANNISTER: The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.\"\nBRIENNE: If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?\nBRIENNE: Help! Help! The Kingslayer!\nJAIME LANNISTER: Jaime. My name is Jaime.\nSHIREEN: Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.\nDAVOS: Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?\"\nSHIREEN: Shh, you'll wake Bert.\"\nDAVOS: Bert?\nSHIREEN: He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.\nDAVOS: Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-\nSHIREEN: he said you Were a traitor. Are you?\nDAVOS: I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price.\"\nSHIREEN: I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.\nDAVOS: Aye. So they did.\nSHIREEN: You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.\nDAVOS: Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.\"\nSHIREEN: Take it. I have more.\nDAVOS: My lady, I can't read the words.\"\nSHIREEN: You can't?\nSHIREEN: I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.\nDAVOS: No. No. No.\nSHIREEN: It's easy. It'll be fun.\nDAVOS: Go. We can't.\nSHIREEN: Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?\"\nDAVOS: I wouldn't know where to start.\nSHIREEN: At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'\"\nJORAH MORMONT: It was a bitch of a siege.\nBARRISTAN: Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?\"\nJORAH MORMONT: The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his.\"\nBARRISTAN: Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?\nJORAH MORMONT: Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.\nBARRISTAN: Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: You swore an oath.\nBARRISTAN: Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?\"\nJORAH MORMONT: With all my heart.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: These are the ones?\nMISSANDEI: Yes, khaleesi. The officers.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Remove your helmet\nGREY WORM: This one has the honor.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What is your name?\nGREY WORM: Grey Worm.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Grey Worm.\nMISSANDEI: All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride.\"\nGREY WORM: Grey Worm\"\" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: King Robert wanted her dead.\nBARRISTAN: Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.\nJORAH MORMONT: I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.\nBARRISTAN: I didn't sit on the small council.\nJORAH MORMONT: No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-\nBARRISTAN: Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion.\"\nBARRISTAN: He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.\nJORAH MORMONT: Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over.\"\nBARRISTAN: Mm-hmm.\nJORAH MORMONT: Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.\"\nBARRISTAN: She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Which men do you have in mind?\nBARRISTAN: Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.\nBARRISTAN: I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.\nJORAH MORMONT: Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man.\"\nBARRISTAN: We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?\nJORAH MORMONT: You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.\nBARRISTAN: If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.\nTALISA: Come to bed.\nROBB STARK: You were right.\nROBB STARK: The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.\nTALISA: Don't let him.\nROBB STARK: What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.\nTALISA: We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.\nROBB STARK: Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children.\"\nTALISA: Give them a new purpose.\nROBB STARK: What?\nTALISA: Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is.\"\nROBB STARK: Here. And we're here. King's Landing-\nTALISA: What is it?\nROBB STARK: I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not.\"\nROBB STARK: And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.\nTALISA: Can you do it?\nROBB STARK: I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.\nSANSA STARK: He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.\nSANSA STARK: Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.\nLORAS: Squire!\nOLYVAR: Well fought, ser.\"\nLORAS: That was no fight. I don't know you.\nOLYVAR: Olyver, if it please you.\"\nOLYVAR: I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.\"\nLORAS: How did you know?\nOLYVAR: Know what?\nLORAS: That I wanted to.\nLORAS: My lord, I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.\"\nOLYVAR: They rarely do, in my experience.\"\nLORAS: You have a good deal of experience, do you?\"\nOLYVAR: With the husbands.\nPETYR BAELISH: That didn't take long.\nOLYVAR: Well, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Is he? And who's the lucky girl?\nPETYR BAELISH: She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?\"\nSANSA STARK: What is?\nPETYR BAELISH: It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different.\"\nSANSA STARK: Is it?\nPETYR BAELISH: Lady Margaery wears it that way.\nSANSA STARK: Many ladies wear it this way.\nPETYR BAELISH: I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.\nSANSA STARK: You still want me to come with you?\nPETYR BAELISH: It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?\"\nSANSA STARK: Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend.\"\nSANSA STARK: I do, Lord Baelish.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Petyr.\nSANSA STARK: Petyr.\nPETYR BAELISH: If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: We'll speak again when I return.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You're late.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What's she doing here?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Our business concerns her, too. Sit.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Your jokes are not appreciated.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It wasn't my best, but-\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And how do we do that?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: We find Sansa Stark a different husband.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Wonderful.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Yes, it is.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You can't mean it.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I can and I do.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: She's a child!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And if I refuse?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I was wed. Or don't you remember?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Only too well.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What do you mean?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You'll marry Ser Loras.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I will not.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No, I won't do it.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Father, don't make me do it again, please.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.\nSHIREEN: It's always summer / Under the sea / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The rain is dry / and snow falls up / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The stones crack open / The water burns / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to play / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to stay.\"",
