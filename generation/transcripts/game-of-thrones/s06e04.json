My own brothers You want me to stay here after that?\"\nMAN: Riders approaching!\nMAN: Open the gate!\nSANSA STARK: This is good soup Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?\nJON SNOW: With the peas and onions?\nSANSA STARK: Mmm\nJON SNOW: We never should have left Winterfell\nSANSA STARK: Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don't go, you idiot”\"\nJON SNOW: How could we know?\nSANSA STARK: I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you I wish I could change everything\nJON SNOW: We were children\nSANSA STARK: I was awful, just admit it\"\nJON SNOW: You were occasionally awful I'm sure I can't have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played\nSANSA STARK: Can you forgive me?\nJON SNOW: There's nothing to forgive\nSANSA STARK: Forgive me\nJON SNOW: All right All right, I forgive you\"\nJON SNOW: You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale\"\nSANSA STARK: Where will you go?\nJON SNOW: Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me\"\nSANSA STARK: Where will we go?\nJON SNOW: I can't stay here, not after what happened\"\nSANSA STARK: There's only one place we can go Home\nJON SNOW: Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?\nSANSA STARK: We'll take it back from them\nJON SNOW: I don't have an army\nSANSA STARK: How many wildlings did you save?\nJON SNOW: They didn't come here to serve me\nSANSA STARK: They owe you their lives\nSANSA STARK: You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?\nJON SNOW: Sansa\nSANSA STARK: Winterfell is our home It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's Wherever they are, it belongs to our family We have to fight for it\"\nJON SNOW: I'm tired of fighting\nJON SNOW: It's all I've done since I left home I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch I've killed wildlings I've killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost\nSANSA STARK: If we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe I want you to help me But I'll do it myself if I have to\"\nDAVOS: My lady\nMELISANDRE: Ser Davos\nDAVOS: Will you stay here at Castle Black?\nMELISANDRE: I will do as Jon Snow commands\nDAVOS: You serve Jon Snow now?\nMELISANDRE: He's the prince that was promised\nDAVOS: Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis\"\nDAVOS: What happened down there?\nMELISANDRE: There was a battle Stannis was defeated\nDAVOS: And Shireen? What happened to the princess?\nBRIENNE: I saw what happened I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field\nDAVOS: My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth\"\nBRIENNE: We've met before I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic\nDAVOS: That's in the past now\nBRIENNE: Yes, it's in the past It doesn't mean I forget Or forgive He admitted it, you know\"\nDAVOS: Who did?\nBRIENNE: Stannis Just before I executed him\nPETYR BAELISH: The Defender of the Vale!\nROBIN: Uncle Petyr!\nPETYR BAELISH: My lord Come and see\nPETYR BAELISH: I missed your name day Go on\nROBIN: A falcon!\nPETYR BAELISH: A gyrfalcon The greatest and rarest of birds\nYOHN ROYCE: Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Indeed I was\nYOHN ROYCE: And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell\"\nPETYR BAELISH: On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting\"\nYOHN ROYCE: Do you take me for a fool?\nPETYR BAELISH: Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else\"\nYOHN ROYCE: Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Your home is the Vale The Lord of the Vale stands before us And only his judgment concerns me\nROBIN: Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?\nYOHN ROYCE: My lord My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn To your father, to your mother, and now to you.\"\nROBIN: Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Lord Royce has served the Vale well He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come\"\nYOHN ROYCE: You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I think he deserves one more chance What do you say?\nROBIN: Fine\nPETYR BAELISH: I bring good news My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell I expect she's headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her\"\nROBIN: She's my cousin We should help her\nPETYR BAELISH: That was my instinct as well\nPETYR BAELISH: Our lord has spoken Gather the Knights of the Vale The time has come to join the fray\nGREY WORM: You invite the enemy into our city?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I did As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”\"\nGREY WORM: I don't make peace with the queen's enemies I kill the queen's enemies\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach\"\nMISSANDEI: Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her\nTYRION LANNISTER: We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution\nMISSANDEI: How many days were you a slave?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Long enough to know\nMISSANDEI: Not long enough to understand\nYEZZAN: I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor And somehow you've risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen It's most impressive\nTYRION LANNISTER: And now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHere's to reversals of fortune\nRAZDAL: We came here to meet the queen and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch\nTYRION LANNISTER: Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want\"\nBELICHO: We want you to leave Slaver's Bay Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go\nTYRION LANNISTER: Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward\nRAZDAL: When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs She refused them\"\nMISSANDEI: She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains\"\nRAZDAL: As they have since the dawn of time\nGREY WORM: Not anymore\nYEZZAN: You think you're a free man now? You still follow orders Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she's not a master\nTYRION LANNISTER: Friends, friends, friends, please\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world I'm not here to change the way of the world\nYEZZAN: Slavery is the way of our world\nTYRION LANNISTER: You don't need slaves to make money There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen's proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order\nYEZZAN: What does that mean?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy\"\nYEZZAN: We do not support the Sons of the Harpy\nTYRION LANNISTER: Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests…\nTYRION LANNISTER: Give freedom a chance See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before\nTYRION LANNISTER: My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time\nMISSANDEI: Perhaps I should translate for you\nMAN: We speak the Common Tongue\nTYRION LANNISTER: Excellent\nMAN: You met with the slavers today\nTYRION LANNISTER: I did\nMAN: Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them\nTYRION LANNISTER: I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled\nTYRION LANNISTER: But I am not your ruler I'm not the Breaker of Chains I'm not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons\nMAN: You are a stranger here So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --\nMAN: When does she return?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Soon You have my word\nMAN: We don't know you We don't trust you We know Torgo Nudho We fight with him against the Masters We trust him\nTYRION LANNISTER: And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace\"\nMAN: You have made peace with the slavers?\nTYRION LANNISTER: We offered terms\nMAN: And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers' arms and sold us at auction like cattle?\"\nGREY WORM: I am a soldier, not a politician But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it\"\nMAN: Missandei, you know what these men are How can you trust them?\"\nMISSANDEI: I do not trust them I will never trust them\nMISSANDEI: But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”\"\nGREY WORM: Do not use me for your lies\nTYRION LANNISTER: Those men respect you\nGREY WORM: They respect me because they know who I am They know I am loyal\nTYRION LANNISTER: As do I\nGREY WORM: I am loyal to my queen, not you If you betray her work, you are my enemy\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city\nMISSANDEI: You promised the slavers they could keep slavery\nTYRION LANNISTER: For a short time\nMISSANDEI: Seven years is not a short time for a slave\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today\nGREY WORM: You are wrong to trust these men\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest\nGREY WORM: You don't know them You don't understand them We are not human in their eyes They look at me and see a weapon They look at her and see a whore\nTYRION LANNISTER: They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage\nGREY WORM: You will not use them They will use you That is what they do\nDAARIO: You all right? Why don't you sit and catch your breath?\nJORAH MORMONT: I'm fine\nDAARIO: I don't think you could ride the dragon 20 years ago, maybe\"\nJORAH MORMONT: What?\nDAARIO: Our queen She's wild, you know Don't let her size fool you It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man You, I don't think your heart could take it\"\nDAARIO: Must make you angry that our queen chose me\nJORAH MORMONT: Makes me sad You'll disappoint her before long She'll move on\nDAARIO: We'll all disappoint her before long\nJORAH MORMONT: We need each other right now After we're done needing each other --\nDAARIO: Oh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal What do I have to gain? If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man\"\nJORAH MORMONT: You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?\"\nDAARIO: None\nJORAH MORMONT: The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Eastern Market, Western Market When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals That's where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen\"\nDAARIO: What are you doing?\nJORAH MORMONT: It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city\nDAARIO: Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?\nJORAH MORMONT: If they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons…\"\nDAARIO: You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth\nJORAH MORMONT: There's 100,000 of them down there We can't fight our way out We wait till dark, and then we'll find her\"\nDAARIO: Uh…\nDAARIO: I'm very attached to this knife\nJORAH MORMONT: Don't worry it didn't touch you\nDAARIO: You know what happens?\nJORAH MORMONT: I know what happens\nDAARIO: I'll do it myself.\nDAARIO: I should have been born a Dothraki\nJORAH MORMONT: Come on\nJORAH MORMONT: My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost Could you show us the way back?\nDOTHRAKI: What do you sell?\nJORAH MORMONT: Wine Come down to my stall tomorrow, I'll give you a cask of the Arbor's finest\"\nDOTHRAKI: You're not merchants\nDOTHRAKI: Get the others\nDAARIO: Told you, I'm very attached to this knife\"\nDAARIO: You all right?\nJORAH MORMONT: If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us\"\nDAARIO: Huh\nLEADER: Some of them don't think Dothraki should breed with foreigners They are stupid old women They don't realize that we have always diluted our blood This one is Lhazareen Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village How old were you?\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: Twelve\nLEADER: A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter How did he show his happiness?\"\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: He broke my ribs\nLEADER: We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom Our lives have meaning\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: That is more than most have\nLEADER: When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us The other possibilities are not so pleasant\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I need to make water\nLEADER: You can't run from Dothraki You know this\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I will never run from Dothraki\nLEADER: Go, show her\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I needed fresh air The old women stink\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: They do stink\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You must have been very young when your Khal died\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: Sixteen\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Too bad he didn't die sooner\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: Yes, too bad\"\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: Is it true you have three dragons?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Mm-hmm\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: And they breathe fire?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They do Would you like to see them one day?\nLHAZAREEN WOMAN: I am Dosh Khaleen I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No, don't hurt her\"\nDAARIO: She'll give us away\nJORAH MORMONT: We have to go now\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive\nJORAH MORMONT: All we can do is try\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No We can do more than that And you're going to help me\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi Do not betray me\"\nSPARROW: If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I'd go to my brother, my husband, my family\"\nSPARROW: Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power Seeking out your family means seeking out sin I'm not maligning you I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else My father was a cobbler He died with I was young and I took over his shop He was a simple man and he made simple shoes But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time Time most of all Dozens of hours spent on a single pair\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Quality takes time\nSPARROW: Yes I imagine you've worn a year of someone's life on your back The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness Book of the Stranger, verse 25\"\nSPARROW: You know\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Septa Unella reads it to me At me\nSPARROW: Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people You're close But it wasn't a graveyard It was a feast I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor I woke before dawn I could barely stand Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes The truth of their bodies laid bare I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn And I saw it with perfect clarity I saw what my sins were The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position It was all part of a story A story I was telling myself about who I was A collection of lies that would disappear in the light The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: So what did you do?\nSPARROW: I left to go and find them I didn't even put on my shoes I walked out the door and never went back\nSPARROW: Come, let's go and see him\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Who?\nSPARROW: Your brother\nMARGAERY TYRELL: enters her brother's cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Loras. Loras.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Listen to me. You need to stay strong.\nLORAS: I can't stay strong. I never was strong.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family.\"\nLORAS: I don't care about that.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don't care?\nLORAS: I just want it to stop. Help me.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That's why he's letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.\"\nLORAS: Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.\nLORAS: begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: All right.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: is walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.\nMAESTER PYCELLE: And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that's the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: enters the room\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What are you doing here?\nMAESTER PYCELLE: I am advising the king on our current predicament.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Leave.\nMAESTER PYCELL: I am a member of the Small Council. The king's small --\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Is this a Small Council meeting?\nMAESTER PYCELL: Obviously not. I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now.\"\nMAESTER PYCELL: Your Grace.\nMAESTER: PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Since I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: As have we all, unfortunately.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk. He's dangerous.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: You don't like Margaery, do you?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Mother...there's something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You've spoken with him?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told --\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me.\"\nKEVAN: and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.\nKEVIN: and LADY OLENNA stand up.\nLADY OLENNA: I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You're not welcome.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.\nLADY OLENNA: My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What's left to work with?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.\"\nLADY OLENNA: Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I agree.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody.\"\nKEVAN: The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?\"\nKEVAN: No, but if the king should call on me --\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?\nKEVAN: Of course I want him back.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.\nKEVAN: If it doesn't go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We'll have civil war. Many will die.\"\nLADY OLENNA: Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.\nTHEON GREYJOY: approaches Pyke Castle by boat.\nYARA GREYJOY: They told me you were home and I didn't believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He's dead. He's been dead a long time.\"\" He let you go?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I escaped.\nYARA GREYJOY: I can't hear you.\nYARA GREYJOY: Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm sorry.\nYARA GREYJOY: You were my brother. You're a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I know. I know and I'm sorry.\nYARA GREYJOY: Stop saying that.\nTHEON GREYJOY: He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.\nYARA GREYJOY: I know.\nTHEON GREYJOY: You don't know.\nYARA GREYJOY: He send us one of those pieces. That's why I came for you.\nYARA GREYJOY: Why did you come here?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Where else could I go?\nYARA GREYJOY: You heard father was dead and thought you'd claim the crown?\nTHEON GREYJOY: No, no. I only heard he died after we docked.\"\nYARA GREYJOY: You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I didn't know.\nYARA GREYJOY: You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you've done?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I don't want to be king.\nYARA GREYJOY: What do you want?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I shouldo ve listened to you. You're the only one --\nYARA GREYJOY: That doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying. Look at me. Tell me what you want.\nTHEON GREYJOY: You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: peels an apple with a knife. The door opens. A guard ushers OSHA into the room. RAMSAY nods. The guard leaves and closes the door.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?\nOSHA: A lord?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Yes. A lord. You've seen my banners?\nOSHA: The flayed man.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Does that worry you at all?\nOSHA: You eat them after?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: No.\nOSHA: Then I've seen worse.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: peels the skin of the apple and puts it on the table with the knife. OSHA looks at the knife. RAMSAY waves for OSHA to come to him. She walks towards him.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You served the Starks?\nOSHA: Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I've served them.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon.\"\nOSHA: He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn't get no wages. Way I see it, I'm owed.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He's mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?\"\nOSHA: I can give you what you want.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Are you sure you know what that is?\nOSHA: comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.\nOSHA: Same thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You're a good talker.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I like that.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.\nOSHA: That so?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: He told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it.\"\nOSHA: gets up and tries to stab RAMSAY with the knife, but RAMSAY stabs her in the neck first. She falls on the ground, with blood running from her neck. She dies. RAMSAY cleans his knife and continues to peel the apple. He bites a piece.\"\nSANSA STARK: JON SNOW, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and DOLOROUS EDD are eating at a table. SANSA looks at the meat on her fork. JON SNOW, DOLOROUS EDD, and TORMUND eat vigorously. BRIENNE looks around at the men eating. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks away. TORMUND smiles. DOLOROUS EDD notices their interaction.\"\nDOLOROUS EDD: Sorry about the food. It's not what we're known for.\nSANSA STARK: That's all right. There are more important things.\nMAN: A letter for you, Lord Commander.\"\nJON SNOW: I'm not Lord Commander anymore.\nJON SNOW: SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.\nJON SNOW: To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.\"\nJON SNOW: SNOW looks at SANSA.\nJON SNOW: His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --\"\nSANSA STARK: Go on.\nJON SNOW: It's just more of the same.\nJON SNOW: SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading.\"\nSANSA STARK: You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.\"\nJON SNOW: Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.\nSANSA STARK: His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.\nJON SNOW: We don't know that.\nSANSA STARK: Yes, we do.\"\nTORMUND: How many men does he have in his army?\nSANSA STARK: I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack.\"\nJON SNOW: How many do you have?\nTORMUND: That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people.\"\nSANSA STARK: You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.\nSANSA STARK: A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.\nJON SNOW: SNOW nods.\nKHAL MORO: It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city. It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.\nKHAL: So we don't spill blood.\nKHAL MORO: Well… there's always a little blood.\nKHAL: Someone crushed his head with a rock.\nKHAL MORO: Aggo belonged to my khalaser. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo.\nKHAL: 1 sits down.\nKHAL MORO: Bring in Drogo's widow.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: enters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads.\"\nKHAL: Who cares about her? She's a midget.\nKHAL: I like her.\nKHAL: She's paler than milk.\nKHAL: I'd like to know what a khaleesi tastes like.\nKHAL: Good. You can suck my dick.\nKHAL MORO: She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.\nKHAL: The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They're offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?\"\nKHAL MORO: Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I'll take their horses for myself.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Don't you want to know what I think?\nKHAL MORO: You'd rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No. I don't want either of those things.\nKHAL MORO: We don't care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.\nKHAL MORO: And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.\nKHAL MORO: And you were dumb enough to believe him?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.\"\nKHAL MORO: All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we'll take turns fucking you. And then we'll let our bloodriders fuck you.\nKHAL MORO: And If there's anything left of you, we'll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: lays her hand on a fire pit.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You're not going to serve. You're going to die.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: knocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows.\"",
