  "transcript": "TYRION LANNISTER: Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Perhaps we should take shelter.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The city is on the rise?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: it proves that no one needs a Master.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Good. Shall we begin?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Do we have a plan?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You don't approve?\nTYRION LANNISTER: You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: This is entirely different.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.\nRAZDAL: Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.\"\nYEZZAN: The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine.\"\nRAZDAL: I imagine it's difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My reign has just begun.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Dracarys.\nGREY WORM: You men have a choice\nGREY WORM: fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.\"\nMISSANDEI: Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?\"\nRAZDAL: Him. He should die.\nBELICHO: Yes, him.\"\nRAZDAL: He's not one of us. He's an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us.\"\nYEZZAN: Please.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.\"\nJON SNOW: You don't have to be here.\nSANSA STARK: Yes, I do.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: My beloved wife. I've missed you terribly.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy.\"\nJON SNOW: You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?\"\nJON SNOW: Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?\"\nSANSA STARK: How do we know you have him?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Now, if you want to save —\"\nSANSA STARK: You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: She's a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you're all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard.\"\nJON SNOW: If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.\"\nDAVOS: That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power.\"\nJON SNOW: It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...\"\nTORMUND: It's not his men that worry me. It's his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.\nTORMUND: You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.\nJON SNOW: We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.\"\nTORMUND: stares blankly at JON SNOW.\nJON SNOW: A pincer move.\nJON SNOW: They won't be able to hit us from the sides.\nTORMUND: Good.\nDAVOS: It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides.\"\nTORMUND: Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?\nJON SNOW: No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.\nDAVOS: We should all get some sleep.\nTORMUND: Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.\"\nSANSA STARK: So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.\"\nJON SNOW: Aye, for what they're worth.\"\nSANSA STARK: You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?\"\nJON SNOW: You're right.\nSANSA STARK: You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.\nJON SNOW: He's overconfident.\nSANSA STARK: He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.\nJON SNOW: Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.\"\nSANSA STARK: You don't know him.\nJON SNOW: All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?\"\nSANSA STARK: We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long.\"\nJON SNOW: We can't give up on our brother.\nSANSA STARK: Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.\"\nJON SNOW: Of course he does. What should I do differently?\nSANSA STARK: I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.\nJON SNOW: Aye, that's good advice.\"\nSANSA STARK: You think that's obvious?\nJON SNOW: Well, it is a bit obvious.\"\nSANSA STARK: If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?\"\nJON SNOW: When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!\nSANSA STARK: It's not enough!\nJON SNOW: Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.\"\nSANSA STARK: If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?\"\nJON SNOW: SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise.\"\nSANSA STARK: No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.\nDAVOS: You think there's hope?\nTORMUND: I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?\"\nDAVOS: It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.\nTORMUND: You saw these demons?\nDAVOS: What?\nDAVOS: No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons.\"\nTORMUND: Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn't have demons in his skull. He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you.\"\nDAVOS: Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.\"\nTORMUND: Jon Snow's not a king.\nDAVOS: No, he's not.\"\nTORMUND: I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.\nDAVOS: No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle.\"\nTORMUND: So what do you do all night?\nDAVOS: I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.\nTORMUND: Happy shitting.\nJON SNOW: My lady. You weren't at the war council.\nMELISANDRE: I'm not a soldier.\nJON SNOW: Any advice?\nMELISANDRE: Don't lose.\nJON SNOW: If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back.\"\nMELISANDRE: I'll have to try.\nJON SNOW: I'm ordering you not to bring me back.\nMELISANDRE: I am not your servant, Jon Snow.\"\nJON SNOW: You're in my camp. I'm the commander.\nMELISANDRE: I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.\nJON SNOW: How do you know what he commands?\nMELISANDRE: I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you.\"\nJON SNOW: Why?\nMELISANDRE: I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.\nJON SNOW: What kind of god would do something like that?\nMELISANDRE: The one we've got.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: It was a long time ago.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.\nYARA GREYJOY: And he paid for them.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Not my claim. Hers.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And what's wrong with you?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm not fit to rule.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We can agree upon that at least.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?\nYARA GREYJOY: No more than Westeros.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.\nYARA GREYJOY: You and I have that in common.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Will their ships be enough?\nTYRION LANNISTER: With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: There are and Euron is building more. He's going to offer them to you.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So why shouldn't I wait for him?\nTHEON GREYJOY: The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --\nYARA GREYJOY: His big cock, I think he said. Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won't get one without the other.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?\nYARA GREYJOY: I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Seven Kingdoms.\nTHEON GREYJOY: All of them.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And that's all?\nYARA GREYJOY: We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Reasonable.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What if everyone starts demanding their independence?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.\"\nYARA GREYJOY: That's our way of life.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No more.\nYARA GREYJOY: No more.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Do you like games, little man? Let's play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That's it. That's the game. Easy. Ready? Go.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules.\"\nTORMUND: Don't.\nDAVOS: Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!\nDAVOS: Go! Go! Follow your commander!\nTORMUND: Run and fight!\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Now.\nKARSTARK: Cavalry, charge!\"\nDAVOS: We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Loose!\nJON SNOW: Get word --\nDAVOS: We may as well be taking shits back here.\nDAVOS: Follow!\nRAMSAY BOLTON: It's time, go.\"\nSMALLJON: Who owns the North?\nALL: We do!\nSMALLJON: Show me!\nTORMUND: Hey!\nMAN: Infantry, advance!\"\nDAVOS: With me, lads! Break their line!\"\nMAN: Tormund!\nMAN: Get him back!\nTORMUND: Fuck this, come on!\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Their army's gone.\nMAN: Our army's gone.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: We have Winterfell. They don't have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You suggested one on one combat, didn't you?\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I've reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.\nJON SNOW: We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.\nSANSA STARK: Jon.\nSANSA STARK: Where is he?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I'll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That's all right. You can't kill me. I'm part of you now.\"\nSANSA STARK: Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: My hounds will never harm me.\nSANSA STARK: You haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: They're loyal beasts.\nSANSA STARK: They were. Now they're starving.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!",
