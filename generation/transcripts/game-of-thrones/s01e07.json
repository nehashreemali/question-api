  "transcript": "JAIME LANNISTER: Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Attacking him was stupid.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Lannisters don't act like fools.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Catelyn Stark took my brother.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Why is he still alive?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Tyrion?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Ned Stark.\nJAIME LANNISTER: One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: It wouldn't have been clean.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Clean...\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I could care less what anyone thinks of me.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Now that's what you want people to think of you.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It's the truth.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: When you hear them whispering \"\"Kingslayer\"\" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Of course it bothers me.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..\nTYWIN LANNISTER: No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Hmm.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're in pain.\nEDDARD STARK: I've had worse, my lady.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Perhaps it's time to go home.\nEDDARD STARK: The South doesn't seem to agree with you.\nEDDARD STARK: I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?\"\nEDDARD STARK: Has he done this before?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Jaime would have killed him.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.\nEDDARD STARK: Your brother Or your lover?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.\nEDDARD STARK: My son saw you with him.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Do you love your children?\nEDDARD STARK: With all my heart.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No more than I love mine.\nEDDARD STARK: And they are all Jaime's.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Thank the Gods.\nEDDARD STARK: You've always hated him.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Hated him? I worshiped him.\nEDDARD STARK: When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Oh, but it was.\"\nROS: Come here.\nPETYR BAELISH: No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?\"\nROS: Yes, My Lord.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman.\"\nROS: Why don't you join us, My Lord?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I'm saving myself for another.\nROS: What she doesn't know won't hurt her.\nPETYR BAELISH: A stupid saying.\nROS: She must be very beautiful.\nPETYR BAELISH: No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.\"\nROS: I do believe my lordo s in love.\nPETYR BAELISH: For many years. Most of my life really.\nROS: Is she still married to him?\nPETYR BAELISH: Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.\nROS: And what do you want?\nPETYR BAELISH: Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?\nOSHA: Where is it you come from?\nTHEON GREYJOY: The Iron Islands.\nOSHA: They far away?\nTHEON GREYJOY: You've never heard of the Iron Islands?\nOSHA: Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore.\"\nOSHA: And what's that?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Lord.\nOSHA: Why?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.\"\nOSHA: What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I will be lord after my father.\nOSHA: So you're not lord now?\nTHEON GREYJOY: No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?\"\nOSHA: I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm not a Southerner.\nOSHA: You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.\nTHEON GREYJOY: You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?\"\nOSHA: Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what \"\"impunent\"\" means.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.\nMAESTER LUWIN: Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I thought she was our prisoner.\nMAESTER LUWIN: Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?\nMAESTER LUWIN: Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.\nOSHA: I'm used to worse than him.\nOSHA: I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.\nMAESTER LUWIN: Why did you come here?\nOSHA: Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.\nMAESTER LUWIN: Why? What are you afraid of?\nOSHA: There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.\nMAESTER LUWIN: Owls and Shadowcats and...\nOSHA: I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.\nMAESTER LUWIN: The \"\"things\"\" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years.\"\nOSHA: They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping.\"\nSAM TARLY: I miss girls.\nJON SNOW: Why is he alone?\nSAM TARLY: One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for...\"\nJON SNOW: There's no rider.\nNIGHT WATCH STABLE BOY: Whoa, boy, whoa.\"\nJON SNOW: That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.\nRENLY BARATHEON: Ned! It's Robert.\nROBERT BARATHEON: I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Robert, my sweet...\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Out, all of you!\"\nEDDARD STARK: You damned fool.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Give it to the council after I'm dead.\nEDDARD STARK: I will.\nROBERT BARATHEON: And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: My memory.\nEDDARD STARK: Give him milk of the poppy.\nBARRISTAN SELMY: He was reeling from the wine.\nEDDARD STARK: No man could have protected him from himself.\nLORD VARYS: I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?\"\nBARRISTAN SELMY: His squire, from the king's own skin.\"\nEDDARD STARK: His squire? The Lannister boy?\nLORD VARYS: Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.\nEDDARD STARK: His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.\nLORD VARYS: I'm afraid those birds have flown.\nKHAL DROGO: The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world.\"\nKHAL DROGO: The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea.\"\nKHAL DROGO: Not dirt. Lands.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Lands, yes...\"\nKHAL DROGO: Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: It's not a chair. It's a...\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen.\"\nKHAL DROGO: A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Can't you help me make him understand?\nJORAH MORMONT: The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And because he had dragons.\nJORAH MORMONT: Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You don't believe it.\nJORAH MORMONT: Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report.\"\nDEANERYS TARGARIAN: Well, I'll come with you.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.\"\nLITTLE BIRD: Psst, Jorah the Andal.\"\nWINE MERCHANT: Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.\"\nWINE MERCHANT: My Lady, you are from Westeros.\"\nDOREAH: You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen.\nWINE MERCHANT: Princess.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.\nWINE MERCHANT: That? Dornish swill.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You honor me, Ser.\"\nWINE MERCHANT: The honor...the honor is all mine.\nRAKHARO: Huh-uh, huh-uh.\"\nWINE MERCHANT: You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I hope to repay your kindness someday.\nJORAH MORMONT: Rakharo.\nRAKHARO: Huh.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Is something wrong?\nJORAH MORMONT: I have a thirst. Open it.\nWINE MERCHANT: The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.\nJORAH MORMONT: Open it.\nJORAH MORMONT: Pour.\nWINE MERCHANT: It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Do as he says.\nWINE MERCHANT: As the princess commands.\nWINE MERCHANT: Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: You first.\nWINE MERCHANT: Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You will drink.\nDOREAH: Khaleesi! Stop him!\nJORAH MORMONT: Come.\nJEOR MORMONT: Here you begin anew.\nJON SNOW: I do, my lord.\"\nJEOR MORMONT: You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.\nJON SNOW: Yes, my lord.\"\nJEOR MORMONT: You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe.\"\nSAM TARLY: my lord, might I go as well?\"\nJEOR MORMONT: Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?\nSAM TARLY: No, my lord.\"\nSAM TARLY: The Night's Watch is my house now.\nJEOR MORMONT: As you wish, lad.\"\nJAREMY RYKKER: Rangers with me.\nOTHELL YARWYCK: Builders!\nMAESTER AEMON: Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.\"\nJON SNOW: Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.\nMAESTER AEMON: Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.\nJON SNOW: Do you take me for a servant?\nMAESTER AEMON: We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.\nJON SNOW: May I go?\nMAESTER AEMON: As you wish.\nSAM TARLY: Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?\"\nJON SNOW: I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.\"\nPYPAR: Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.\nSAM TARLY: I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?\nPYPAR: You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?\nSAM TARLY: Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.\"\nSAM TARLY: Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.\nJON SNOW: I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger.\"\nSAM TARLY: I always wanted to be a Wizard.\nRENLY BARATHEON: She won't care.\nEDDARD STARK: And what should I do with a hundred swords?\nRENLY BARATHEON: Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.\nEDDARD STARK: What about Stannis?\nRENLY BARATHEON: Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?\nEDDARD STARK: Stannis is your older brother.\nRENLY BARATHEON: This isn't about the bloody line of succession.\nEDDARD STARK: Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.\nRENLY BARATHEON: Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert.\"\nTELL ME SOMETHING: Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?\nEDDARD STARK: I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.\nEDDARD STARK: You will sail to dragonstone tonight.\nTOMARD: Yes, My Lord.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Now leave us.\nPETYR BAELISH: My Lord protector.\nEDDARD STARK: The King has no true born sons.\nPETYR BAELISH: So when the King dies...\nEDDARD STARK: The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.\nPETYR BAELISH: So it would seem. Unless...\nEDDARD STARK: There is no \"\"unless\"\".\"\nPETYR BAELISH: And he cannot take the throne without your help.\nEDDARD STARK: Do you have a shred of honor?\nPETYR BAELISH: You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.\nEDDARD STARK: We?\nPETYR BAELISH: You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest.\"\nEDDARD STARK: What you suggest is treason.\nPETYR BAELISH: Only if we lose.\nEDDARD STARK: Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy..\"\nEDDARD STARK: No. I won't do it.\nPETYR BAELISH: So it will be Stannis and war?\nEDDARD STARK: There is no other choice. He is the heir.\nPETYR BAELISH: So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly.\"\nEDDARD STARK: You promised Catelyn you would help me.\nPETYR BAELISH: Look at you. You know what you want me to do.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He will not have my son.\nKHAL DROGO: Moon of my life. Are you hurt?\nKHAL DROGO: Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did.\"\nKING JOFFREY: Liar!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You think he stands alone?\nKING JOFFREY: Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!\"\nEDDARD STARK: Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.\nJANOS SLYNT: Men of the Watch!\nEDDARD STARK: I want no bloodshed.\nPETYR BAELISH: Now!\nPETYR BAELISH: I did warn you not to trust me.",
