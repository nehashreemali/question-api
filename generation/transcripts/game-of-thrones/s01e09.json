Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.\"\nEDDARD STARK: On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?\nVARYS: You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want.\"\nEDDARD STARK: l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.\nVARYS: When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Huh. Can you free me from this pit?\nVARYS: l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero.\"\nEDDARD STARK: What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?\"\nVARYS: Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.\nEDDARD STARK: Robb? He's just a boy.\nVARYS: Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.\nEDDARD STARK: Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.\nVARYS: Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.\nEDDARD STARK: You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?\"\nVARYS: l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.\"\nEDDARD STARK: You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.\nVARYS: Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?\"\nROBB STARK: lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Or so Walder Frey would have you think.\nCATELYN STARK: Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.\nROBB STARK: He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?\nGREATJON UMBER: Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.\nROBB STARK: Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.\nGREATJON UMBER: Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.\nCATELYN STARK: The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.\"\nROBB STARK: Have my horse saddled and ready.\nGREATJON UMBER: Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.\nROBB STARK: My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.\"\nCATELYN STARK: l agree. l'll go.\nEVERYONE: You can't!\nCATELYN STARK: l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.\nGREATJON UMBER: Unless there was a profit in it.\nWALDER FREY: What do you want?\nCATELYN STARK: lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.\"\nWALDER FREY: Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?\"\nSTEVRON FREY: Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –\"\nWALDER FREY: Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?\"\nRYGER RIVERS: Father, please –\"\nWALDER FREY: l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.\"\nCATELYN STARK: ls there somewhere we can talk?\nWALDER FREY: We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!\nCATELYN STARK: l'm sure she will give you many sons.\nWALDER FREY: Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.\nCATELYN STARK: He is quite ill, my lord.\"\nWALDER FREY: Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.\"\nCATELYN STARK: My lord, l –\"\nWALDER FREY: Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.\nCATELYN STARK: l'm sure there were reasons –\nWALDER FREY: l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?\nCATELYN STARK: To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.\"\nWALDER FREY: Why should l let him?\nCATELYN STARK: lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.\"\nWALDER FREY: There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husbando s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.\"\nCATELYN STARK: You swore an oath to my father.\nWALDER FREY: Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Why don't you?\nWALDER FREY: Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?\"\nVOICES OUTSIDE: And engage!\nJEOR MORMONT: When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?\nJON SNOW: Soon, he says.\"\nJEOR MORMONT: Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.\"\nJON SNOW: This is Valyrian steel.\nJEOR MORMONT: lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.\"\nJON SNOW: My lord, you honor me, but l can't –\"\nJEOR MORMONT: Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?\"\nJON SNOW: Yes, my lord.\"\nJEOR MORMONT: Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it.\"\nJON SNOW: l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.\nJEOR MORMONT: No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.\"\nUNIDENTIFIED NIGHTS WATCHERS: Well done. Well done.\nNIGHTS WATCHER: You earned that, Snow.\"\nNIGHTS WATCHER: Well done.\nPYP: Go on, let's have a look.\"\nJON SNOW: At what?\nGRENN: The sword! Show us the sword.\nALL: Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!\nPYP: Let's have a look.\nGRENN: Piss off.\nPYP: Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!\"\nGRENN: Look at its eyes.\nJON SNOW: What is it?\nSAM TARLY: l - l can't.\nJON SNOW: You can't what?\nSAM TARLY: l'm really not supposed to say.\nJON SNOW: And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…\nSAM TARLY: There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.\nJON SNOW: What? What about him?\nSAM TARLY: He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe.\"\nJON SNOW: l should be there. l should be with him.\nGREATJON UMBER: lf we do that, they'll never get back across.\"\nROBB STARK: Well? What did he say?\nCATELYN STARK: Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well.\"\nROBB STARK: Huh.\nCATELYN STARK: Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.\nROBB STARK: What does he want in return?\nCATELYN STARK: You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.\nROBB STARK: Fine, fine. And?\"\nCATELYN STARK: And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.\nROBB STARK: She won't be happy about that. And?\nCATELYN STARK: And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.\nROBB STARK: l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?\nCATELYN STARK: l did.\nROBB STARK: And?\nCATELYN STARK: One was – Do you consent?\nROBB STARK: Can l refuse?\nCATELYN STARK: Not if you want to cross.\nROBB STARK: Then l consent.\nJON SNOW: Sam said you wanted to see me?\nMAESTER AEMON: l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?\"\nJON SNOW: No.\nMAESTER AEMON: So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?\"\nJON SNOW: He would do whatever was right, no matter what.\"\nMAESTER AEMON: Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?\"\nJON SNOW: Sam told you.\nMAESTER AEMON: We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose.\"\nJON SNOW: And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?\nMAESTER AEMON: Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know.\"\nJON SNOW: You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.\"\nMAESTER AEMON: The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South\nJON SNOW: Who are you?\nMAESTER AEMON: My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King.\"\nJON SNOW: You're Aemon Targaryen.\nMAESTER AEMON: l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.\nKHAL DROGO: My horse…\nCOHOLLO: Blood of my blood…\nKHAL DROGO: No, l must ride.\"\nQOTHO: He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here.\"\nQOTHO: This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.\nQOTHO: You do not command me, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.\nQOTHO: The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.\nQOTHO: Hyah! Hyah!\nKEVAN LANNISTER: Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.\"\nKEVAN LANNISTER: The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Shagga likes axes.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?\nKEVAN LANNISTER: They do seem rather ferocious.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: There'll be no more discussion on the matter.\nTYRION LANNISTER: lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?\nBRONN: l took her.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Took her? From whom?\nBRONN: From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And he didn't have anything to say about it?\nBRONN: He said something.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.\"\nBRONN: Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Who are you?\nPROSTITUTE: Who would you like me to be?\nTYRION LANNISTER: What did your mother call you?\nPROSTITUTE: Shae. What did your mother call you?\nTYRION LANNISTER: My mother died giving birth to me.\nSHAE: ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?\nTYRION LANNISTER: What sort of accent is that?\nSHAE: Foreign.\nTYRION LANNISTER: For-\nSHAE: What do you want from me?\nTYRION LANNISTER: What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.\"\nSHAE: And what do l get?\nTYRION LANNISTER: One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular.\"\nSHAE: Who told you this? Women you paid?\nTYRION LANNISTER: And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?\nSHAE: Let's start with your last night in this world.\nJORAH MORMONT: Khaleesi.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.\nJORAH MORMONT: He will die tonight, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He can't. He can't. l won't let him.\nJORAH MORMONT: Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: l won't leave him.\nJORAH MORMONT: He's already gone, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.\"\nMIRRI MAZ DUUR: The wound has festered.\nQOTHO: You did this, witch.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Stop it! l don't want her hurt.\nQOTHO: No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.\nQOTHO: Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.\nQOTHO: The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: l think you're right.\nMIRRI MAZ DUUR: You've saved me once more.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And now you must save him.\nMIRRI MAZ DUUR: He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.\nMIRRI MAZ DUUR: There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Do it. Save him.\nMIRRI MAZ DUUR: There is a price.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You'll have gold, whatever you want.\"\nMIRRI MAZ DUUR: lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My death?\nMIRRI MAZ DUUR: No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.\"\nRAKHARO: Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Kill her and you kill your khal.\nRAKHARO: This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.\nMIRRI MAZ DUUR: Go. Now.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Take her and leave. Take her!\nMIRRI MAZ DUUR: You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No one will enter.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Bring him back to me.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: l have to save him.\nQOTHO: This must not be.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: This must be.\nQOTHO: Witch.\nRAKHARO: Nothing good will come of this.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No, you can't.\"\nIRRI: Khaleesi!\nJORAH MORMONT: No further, horselord.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Are you hurt?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The baby –\nJORAH MORMONT: Hmm?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: is coming.\nJORAH MORMONT: Fetch the midwives.\nRAKHARO: They will not come. They say she is cursed.\nJORAH MORMONT: They'll come or l'll have their heads.\nRAKHARO: The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.\nSHAE: Are you in agony, my lion?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: No.\nSHAE: You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?\"\nSHAE: Just used to it.\nBRONN: Drink.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Let's play a new game.\nBRONN: There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?\nBRONN: Not if you win.\nTYRION LANNISTER: No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.\"\nSHAE: What are you good at?\nTYRION LANNISTER: l happen to be a great judge of character.\nBRONN: This sounds like a boring game.\nTYRION LANNISTER: lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying.\"\nSHAE: l don't want to play this game.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.\nBRONN: But my mother hit harder.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You killed your first man before you were 12.\nBRONN: lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You've been north of the Wall.\nSHAE: What brought you up there?\nBRONN: Work.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.\"\nSHAE: l don't want to play.\nTYRION LANNISTER: lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.\nSHAE: Drink.\nTYRION LANNISTER: All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And we've established the rules about lying?\nSHAE: Drink!\nTYRION LANNISTER: You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.\nBRONN: The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.\nTYRION LANNISTER: So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Are you sure –\nSHAE: Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.\"\nSHAE: My turn.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.\"\nSHAE: Who were you in love with?\nTYRION LANNISTER: That's not how the game works.\nSHAE: l don't care the way the game works.\nBRONN: Our lord here used to be married.\nSHAE: Married?\nTYRION LANNISTER: How did you hear that?\nBRONN: You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Another night, perhaps.\"\nSHAE: Not another night. This night.\nTYRION LANNISTER: lt's not a pleasant story.\nSHAE: Oh, maybe l will cry.\"\nBRONN: l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.\nTYRION LANNISTER: So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.\"\nBRONN: For three chickens, l should hope so.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.\"\nBRONN: Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.\"\nBRONN: l would have killed the man who did that to me.\nSHAE: You should have known she was a whore.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.\"\nSHAE: A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.\nTYRION LANNISTER: As l said, l was young and stupid.\"\nSHAE: You are still young and stupid.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What is it? What do you want?\nBRONN: You're sleeping through the war.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What?\nBRONN: They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Get my squire!\nBRONN: You don't have a squire.\nTYRION LANNISTER: lf l die, weep for me.\"\nSHAE: You'll be dead. How will you know?\nTYRION LANNISTER: l'll know.\nLANNISTER SOLDIER: Watch out! Move!\nLANNISTER SOLDIER: Out of the way! Move aside!\nBRONN: Stay low.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Stay low?\nBRONN: lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!\"\nTRIBESMEN OF VALE: Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!\nTYRION LANNISTER: To battle!\nBRONN: You're a shit warrior.\nTYRION LANNISTER: l'm alive?\nBRONN: You're alive.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Did we win?\nBRONN: We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.\nTYRION LANNISTER: How did our tribesmen do?\nBRONN: Yeah, good.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: lt's nice to see them getting along.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You're wounded.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Good of you to notice. l hear we won.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand].\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Did we get the Stark boy, at least?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: He wasn't here.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Where was he?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: With his other 18,000 men.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And where are they?\nRODRIK CASSEL: We should go, my lady.\"\nCATELYN STARK: No!\nRODRIK CASSEL: My lady!\nSTARK BANNERMEN: Hyah! Hyah!\nROBB STARK: By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it.\"\nCATELYN STARK: lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.\nJAIME LANNISTER: l've lost them too, l'm afraid.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.\"\nROBB STARK: He's more use to us alive than dead.\nCATELYN STARK: Take him away and put him in irons.\nJAIME LANNISTER: We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.\"\nROBB STARK: lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.\"\nGREATJON UMBER: Come on, pretty man.\"\nROBB STARK: l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.\nROBB STARK: Aye.

A lemon one or any of them.\nKINGS LANDING BAKER: Three coppers.\nARYA STARK: How about a nice fat pigeon?\nKINGS LANDING BAKER: Oh, piss off now.

Coward!\nEDDARK STARK: Baelor!\nPOPULACE: Traitor! Traitor!\nEDDARK STARK: I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say\"\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women.

Please, someone stop him!\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My son, this is madness.\"\nPOPULACE: Put him down!\nYOREN: Don't look!\nARYA STARK: Let me go.\nYOREN: Shut your mouth.
