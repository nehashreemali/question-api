BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.\nBRONN: Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --\"\nBRONN: You're fucked.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Don't you mean we're fucked?\nBRONN: No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I have to tell Cersei.\nBRONN: pauses and looks at JAIME.\nBRONN: Best well jump back in that river.\nBRONN: stands up and walks away. JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.\nTYRION LANNISTER: is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Step forward, My Lord.\"\nRANDYLL: takes several steps towards DAENERYS and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You will not kneel?\nRANDYLL: I already have a queen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.\"\nRANDYLL: There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.\nTYRION LANNISTER: turns to speak to DAENERYS.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall.\"\nRANDYLL: You cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.\nDICKON: You will have to kill me too.\nRANDYLL: pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.\nRANDYLL: Step back and shut your mouth.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Who are you?\nRANDYLL: A stupid boy.\nDICKON: I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.\nDICKON: looks to RANDYLL. RANDYLL nods to his son.\nDICKON: I will not.\nTYRION LANNISTER: turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm not beheading anyone.\nTYRION LANNISTER: pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your Grace --\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Dracarys.\nDROGON: draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men. They are instantly engulfed in flames. They both collapse into ash after a few seconds. There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood. The Lannister men recoil in horror. Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground. DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.\nJAIME LANNISTER: is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers.\"\nQYBURN: My Lord.\nJAIME LANNISTER: passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How many men did we lose?\nJAIME LANNISTER: We haven't done a full counting.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: shakes his head.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: turns and walks away from JAIME.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.\nJAIME LANNISTER: He didn't.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: After all this time it still amazes me --\nJAIME LANNISTER: It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?\nJAIME LANNISTER: After.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And you believed her?\nJAIME LANNISTER: If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: looks away, then sits down.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.\nJAIME LANNISTER: She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.\nJON SNOW: SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They're beautiful, aren't they?\"\nJON SNOW: That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.\nJON SNOW: You weren't gone long.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: turns back to JON.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No.\nJON SNOW: And?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.\nJON SNOW: pauses and doesn't say anything.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You're not sure how you feel about that?\nJON SNOW: No, I'm not.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?\nJON SNOW: Thousands.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.\nJON SNOW: Ser Davos gets carried away.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So it was a figure of speech?\nJON SNOW: doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.\nGUARD: This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He is my friend.\nJORAH MORMONT: kneels before DAENERYS.\nJORAH MORMONT: Your Grace.\nJORAH MORMONT: stands.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend.\"\nJON SNOW: I served with your father. He was a great man.\nJORAH MORMONT: nods to JON.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You look strong. You found a cure?\nJORAH MORMONT: I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: It would be my honor.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: steps forward and hugs JORAH.\nBRAN STARK: s eyes are pure white. They wash back to their normal color. He is sitting in front of the Weirwood. Maester Wolkan stands next to him.\nBRAN STARK: Ravens. We need to send ravens.\nWOLKAN: nods his head to BRAN.\nARCHMAESTER: MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table. MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents. SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls. MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.\nMAESTER: I put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes.\"\nMARWYN: I remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.\nMAESTER: The north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company.\"\nMAESTER: A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.\nSAM: stops working and turns around.\nMARWYN: It is a bit much. Still we ought to --\nSAM TARLY: Brandon Stark --\nSAM TARLY: the crippled boy.\nMARWYN: Do you know him?\nSAM TARLY: I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.\nMARWYN: And?\nSAM TARLY: Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.\"\nMAESTER: Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.\nMARWYN: I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.\nSAM TARLY: steps forward and clears his throat.\nSAM TARLY: Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good.\"\nMARWYN: It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.\nMAESTER: That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.\nSAM TARLY: Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it.\"\nMARWYN: We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.\nSAM TARLY: Archmaester --\nMARWYN: That will be all, Tarley.\"\nSAM: turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.\nMAESTER: It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest.\"\nMAESTER: Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.\nMAESTER: Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?\nMARWYN: I'm afraid so.\nMAESTER: Horrible business.\nMARWYN: I don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.\nMARWYN: crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.\nMARWYN: Right. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...\nVARYS: and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.\nTYRION LANNISTER: All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?\nVARYS: Not burn him alive alongside his son.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her.\"\nVARYS: That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.\nVARYS: reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks.\"\nVARYS: It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, \"\"I'm not the one doing it.\"\" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, \"\"I'm not the one doing it.\"\" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, \"\"I'm not the one doing it.\"\"\"\nVARYS: drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Daenerys is not her father.\nVARYS: And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Who is that for?\nVARYS: Jon Snow.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Did you read it?\nVARYS: It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.\nTYRION LANNISTER: pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What's it say?\nVARYS: Nothing good.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.\nJON SNOW: I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.\nJON SNOW: Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --\nVARYS: The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --\nJON SNOW: interrupts VARYS.\nJON SNOW: I need to go home.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You said you don't have enough men.\nJON SNOW: We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?\nJON SNOW: I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.\nTYRION LANNISTER: begins walking around the table closer to JON.\nTYRION LANNISTER: So bring the dead to her.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.\nDAVOS: Is that possible?\nJON SNOW: The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.\nVARYS: Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And how would you get into King's Landing.\nDAVOS: I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: nods his head.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men.\"\nVARYS: Fair point. How do you propose to find one?\nJON SNOW: pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.\nJORAH MORMONT: With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: turns to look at JORAH.\nJORAH MORMONT: You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.\nJON SNOW: The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.\nDAVOS: They won't follow Ser Jorah.\nJON SNOW: They won't have to.\nDAVOS: You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.\nJON SNOW: I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I haven't given you permission to leave.\nJON SNOW: With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.\nROBETT: The King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have.\"\nYOHN: The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.\"\nSANSA STARK: You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best.\"\nSANSA STARK: and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.\nSANSA STARK: I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.\nARYA STARK: He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.\nSANSA STARK: Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud.\"\nARYA STARK: These are mother and father's chambers.\nSANSA STARK: And?\nARYA STARK: Nothing.\nSANSA STARK: Don't do that.\nSANSA STARK: turns around to face ARYA.\nARYA STARK: What?\nSANSA STARK: Say what you mean.\nARYA STARK: You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.\nSANSA STARK: drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.\nSANSA STARK: Are you angry with me?\nARYA STARK: They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.\nSANSA STARK: I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.\"\nARYA STARK: Their opinions are important to you?\nSANSA STARK: Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army.\"\nARYA STARK: Not if they lose their heads first.\nSANSA STARK: Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together.\"\nARYA STARK: And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want.\"\nSANSA STARK: How can you even think such a horrible thing?\nARYA STARK: You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away.\"\nSANSA STARK: and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.\nSANSA STARK: I have work to do.\nSANSA STARK: turns and walks away from ARYA.\nARYA STARK: My lady.\nARYA STARK: exits the room.\nDAVOS: and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.\nDAVOS: Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.\nTYRION LANNISTER: turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.\nDAVOS: There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.\nTYRION LANNISTER: begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're not staying here?\nDAVOS: I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What if someone takes the boat?\nDAVOS: Then we're fucked. Best hurry.\nBRONN: and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.\nJAIME LANNISTER: We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.\nBRONN: All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.\nBRONN: And here I am ready to train.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Why down here?\nBRONN: I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Today might be the day I kill you by accident.\nBRONN: Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.\"\nBRONN: stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.\nBRONN: I'll leave you to it.\nBRONN: turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.\nJAIME LANNISTER: remains silent and stares at TYRION.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Don't talk about our father.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Listen to me --\nJAIME LANNISTER: I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.\nTYRION LANNISTER: glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.\nJAIME LANNISTER: shakes his head and says nothing.\nTYRION LANNISTER: He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: What do you want?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.\nDAVOS: I wasn't sure I'd find you.\nDAVOS: I thought you might still be rowing.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: chuckles and DAVOS smiles.\nDAVOS: I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?\nDAVOS: I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.\nDAVOS: walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY.\"\nDAVOS: Anybody give you any trouble?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.\nDAVOS: Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: nods.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: You came to get me. You want me to come with you.\nDAVOS: I think you need to understand --\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I'm ready. Let's go.\nDAVOS: You should know what you're heading into.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: is tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.\"\nDAVOS: You might want to bring one of those swords.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: removes a giant war hammer from the wall.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: this I know.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.\nDAVOS: and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.\nDAVOS: Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: and DAVOS arrive at the boat. GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo. DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope. Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Who should I say I am?\nDAVOS: turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.\nDAVOS: I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --\"\nGUARD: You there.\nDAVOS: No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?\"\nGUARD: Is that your boat?\nDAVOS: It is.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.\nGUARD: The docks are that way.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.\nDAVOS: Still five gold dragons?\nGUARD: Are you joking?\nGUARD: You must be even older than you look. 15.\nDAVOS: 15?\nGUARD: Apiece.\nDAVOS: angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.\nDAVOS: I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.\nDAVOS: turns and begins walking back to his boat.\nGUARD: What's in the boat?\nDAVOS: pauses and turns back to the guards.\nDAVOS: Not more gold.\nGUARD: Wine?\nGUARD: Mmm.\nGUARD: I like wine.\nGUARD: Or hams.\nDAVOS: Come and have a look.\nDAVOS: Fermented crab.\nGUARD: What?\nDAVOS: Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste.\"\nDAVOS: scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.\nDAVOS: I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.\nGUARD: Oi, Dwarf!\"\nDAVOS: quickly walks to cut the guards off.\nDAVOS: I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.\nGUARD: That dwarf --\nGUARD: Where did you get that scar?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.\nGUARD: We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.\nDAVOS: is still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.\nDAVOS: Perhaps there's some arrangement?\nGUARD: Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: can be seen behind the backs of the guards. He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2. He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guardo s head. The man drops. As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face.\"\nDAVOS: is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.\nDAVOS: This is Gendry.\nTYRION LANNISTER: He'll do.\nJAIME LANNISTER: opens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That won't be necessary.\nQYBURN: bows his head and walks to leave the room. As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.\nQYBURN: Ser Jaime.\nQYBURN: closes the door as he leaves. JAIME and CERSEI are alone. CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Why was QYBURN here?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I met with Tyrion.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What did our brother have to say?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Daenerys wants to meet.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: To discuss a surrender?\nJAIME LANNISTER: To discuss an armistice.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: smirks and looks away from JAIME.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Are you going to punish him?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Tyrion?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Bronn.\nJAIME LANNISTER: looks confused.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?\nJAIME LANNISTER: You let it happen. Why?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Who will you say is the father?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You.\nJAIME LANNISTER: People won't like that.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Do you remember what father used to say about people?\nJAIME LANNISTER: The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.\nJAIME LANNISTER: reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Never betray me again.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave. Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave. DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.\nDAVOS: We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I understand.\nDAVOS: He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: You don't have to worry.\nDAVOS: You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Understood.\nDAVOS: and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave. JON is walking along the corridor.\nDAVOS: Begging your pardon, Your Grace.\"\nJON SNOW: stops and turns around to face DAVOS.\nJON SNOW: You survived King's Landing.\nDAVOS: Yet again.\nJON SNOW: Your Grace, this is --\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: steps forward in front of DAVOS.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: It's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son.\"\nJON SNOW: looks to DAVOS.\nDAVOS: He was meant to keep that to himself.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?\nJON SNOW: I saw your father once at Winterfell.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I met yours in my shop.\nJON SNOW: You're a lot leaner.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: You're a lot shorter.\nJON SNOW: stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.\nJON SNOW: I grew up on stories about them.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: All I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you.\"\nDAVOS: Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: No, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.\"\nJON SNOW: Do you know how to use one?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: shakes his head.\nJON SNOW: Well, that's a problem.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I prefer a hammer.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: looks to DAVOS.\nDAVOS: He can handle himself.\nJON SNOW: nods.\nJON SNOW: We could use the help.\nDAVOS: As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I owe you my life. Twice over. But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war.\"\nDAVOS: Yeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.\nTYRION LANNISTER: This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?\nJORAH MORMONT: It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.\nTYRION LANNISTER: smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.\nJORAH MORMONT: nods to TYRION. DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We should be better at saying farewell by now.\nJORAH MORMONT: Your Grace, I --\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS.\"\nJON SNOW: If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: smiles.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: But I've grown used to him.\nJON SNOW: I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.\nJON SNOW: Heave!\nSAM: is seated at a table surround by papers and candles. He is writing notes into a book. Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome. SAM JR. is playing on the bed.\nGILLY: Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?\nSAM: No.\nGILLY: 15,782.\"\nSAM: looks up from his work annoyed. He remains silent and continues working.\nGILLY: Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.\nSAM TARLY: looks away and pauses.\nSAM TARLY: None anymore.\nGILLY: That's true. This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything. He even recorded his own bowel movements. What does \"\"annulment\"\" mean?\"\nSAM TARLY: It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.\nGILLY: Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Is that a common thing --\nSAM TARLY: isn't paying much attention to GILLY. He loudly interrupts her.\nSAM TARLY: These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored. But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynardo s 15,782 shits.\"\nGILLY: Steps. That number was steps.\nSAM TARLY: is dismayed. He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr. He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door.\nSAM: is walking through a dark library. He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate. He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel. After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library. He pauses before he leaves and turns around. He glances back at the library. It is many stories tall lined with countless shelves of books. SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door.\"\nSAM TARLY: is loading a wagon with his things. He walks around to the driver seat. GILLY and SAM JR. are already in the wagon dressed for the road. SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand.\nGILLY: Are you sure you want to do this? You always wanted to be a maester.\nSAM TARLY: I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.\nARYA STARK: is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation. The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear. ARYA can't hear the conversation. ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll. The servant turns to leave. BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished. BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.\nARYA STARK: is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH. He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE. She can't hear what's being said. BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men. ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.\nARYA STARK: is walking down the hallway. She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters. BAELISH appears and unlocks his door. Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him. She continues watching the men.\"\nWOLKAN: I found it, my Lord.\"\nWOLKAN: hands BAELISH a raven scroll.\nWOLKAN: It took some searching. Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.\nPETYR BAELISH: reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.\nPETYR BAELISH: Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?\nWOLKAN: Yes, my Lord.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Lady Stark thanks you for your service.\nWOLKAN: turns and walks away. BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door. ARYA continues watching. A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves. After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve. She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll. She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value. She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing. She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding. She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll. She unrolls it and reads the contents.\"\nJON SNOW: and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.\nTORMUND: JON, DAVOS, GENDRY, and JORAH sit at a table having a conversation.\"\nTORMUND: Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?\nDAVOS: I've been failing at that job of late.\nTORMUND: How many queens are there now?\nJON SNOW: Two.\nTORMUND: And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?\nJON SNOW: Both.\nTORMUND: How many men did you bring?\nJON SNOW: looks around the table.\nJON SNOW: Not enough.\nTORMUND: The big woman?\nJON SNOW: smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.\nJORAH MORMONT: We were hoping some of your men could help.\nDAVOS: I'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.\nTORMUND: nods his head.\nTORMUND: You are.\nTORMUND: turns to look at JON.\nTORMUND: You really want to go out there again?\nTORMUND: You're not the only ones.\nTORMUND: My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall. Said they were on their way here.\nJON SNOW: You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.\nSANDOR: pulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on.\nTORMUND: They want to go beyond the Wall too.\nBERIC: We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to. Our lord told us the great war is coming.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Don't trust them. Don't trust any of them.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: They're the Brotherhood. And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.\nJORAH MORMONT: Thoros?\nTHOROS: sits up from a dark corner.\nJORAH MORMONT: I hardly recognized you.\nTHOROS: Ser Jorah Mormont --\nTORMUND: turns and angrily looks at JORAH.\nTHOROS: They won't give me anything to drink down here. I haven't been feeling like myself.\nTORMUND: You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?\nJORAH MORMONT: He was my father.\nTORMUND: He hunted us like animals.\nJORAH MORMONT: You returned the favor, as I recall.\"\nBERIC: Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.\nDAVOS: Our reasons aren't your reasons.\nBERIC: It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.\nBERIC: stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.\nBERIC: There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --\nSANDOR: For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Don't you want to know what we're doing?\nTHOROS: Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?\nJON SNOW: He's right. We're all on the same side.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: How can we be?\nJON SNOW: We're all breathing.\nTORMUND: hands the cell keys to JON. JON opens the door and let the men out.\nEND: CREDITS",
