He had no one else.\nEDDARD STARK: He'd never worn this armor before.\nBARRISTAN SELMY: Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.\nEDDARD STARK: Who determines the draw?\nBARRISTAN SELMY: All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.\"\nBARRISTAN SELMY: Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.\nEDDARD STARK: I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.\"\nBARRISTAN SELMY: You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.\nEDDARD STARK: My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.\nBARRISTAN SELMY: He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.\"\nEDDARD STARK: And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?\nBARRISTAN SELMY: Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.\nEDDARD STARK: Yes. That will never happen.\nBARRISTAN SELMY: Robert tends to do what he wants.\nEDDARD STARK: If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.\"\nLANCEL LANNISTER: It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.\nEDDARD STARK: You're too fat for your armor.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Oh, it's funny, is it?\"\nLANCEL LANNISTER: No, Your Grace.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: No? You don't like the Hando s joke?\nEDDARD STARK: You're torturing the poor boy.\nROBERT BARATHEON: You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!\"\nEDDARD STARK: The breastplate stretcher?\nROBERT BARATHEON: How long before he figures it out?\nEDDARD STARK: Maybe you should have one invented.\nROBERT BARATHEON: All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.\"\nEDDARD STARK: You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!\nEDDARD STARK: And who's going to hit you back?\nROBERT BARATHEON: Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!\nEDDARD STARK: There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?\nEDDARD STARK: Aye.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Drink.\nEDDARD STARK: I'm not thirsty.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.\nEDDARD STARK: Your squire... A Lannister boy?\nROBERT BARATHEON: Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. \"\"Cersei Lannister will make a good match\"\", he told me. \"\"You'll need her father on your side.\"\" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Robert?\nROBERT BARATHEON: What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!\"\nEDDARD STARK: Where's Arya\nSANSA STARK: At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.\nSANSA STARK: Thank you, Ser Loras.\"\nSANSA STARK: Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.\nEDDARD STARK: Hey.\nSANSA STARK: I can't watch.\nPETYR BAELISH: 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.\nRENLY BARATHEON: I'll take that bet.\nPETYR BAELISH: Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?\nRENLY BARATHEON: Or you could even buy a friend.\nSANSA STARK: He's going to die.\nEDDARD STARK: Ser Loras rides well.\nRENLY BARATHEON: Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.\"\nSANSA STARK: Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.\nPETYR BAELISH: No honor but quite a bit of gold.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Stop this madness in the name of your King!\nLORAS TYRELL: I owe you my life, Ser.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I'm no Ser.\nCATELYN STARK: Remove his hood.\nMARILLION: On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.\nCATELYN STARK: I did... often and loudly.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?\"\nCATELYN STARK: And why would I do that?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.\nCATELYN STARK: Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?\"\nCATELYN STARK: Five years ago.\nTYRION LANNISTER: She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I am not a murderer, Lannister.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!\nCATELYN STARK: The dagger found\nTYRION LANNISTER: What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?\nRODRIK CASSEL: Should I gag him?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Why? Am I starting to make sense?\nRODRIK CASSEL: My Lady, this way.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Untie me. If I die, what's the point?\"\nCATELYN STARK: Rodrik?\nRODRIK CASSEL: I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.\"\nBRONN: Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, I'm willing if she is.\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: Bran...\nBRAN STARK: The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - \"\"We do not sow\"\".\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: Lords?\nBRAN STARK: The Greyjoys.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: And failed rebellions.\nBRAN STARK: Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.\nMAESTER LUWIN: Good.\nBRAN STARK: Words - \"\"Ours is the fury\"\". Lords - the Baratheons.\"\nBRAN STARK: The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.\nMAESTER LUWIN: Hmm...\nBRAN STARK: Words - \"\"A Lannister always pays his debts.\"\"\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: No. A common saying, but not their official motto.\"\nBRAN STARK: Lords - the Lannisters.\nMAESTER LUWIN: We're still on their words.\nBRAN STARK: I don't know them.\nMAESTER LUWIN: You do know them. Think.\nBRAN STARK: Unbowed, unbent, unbroken\"\".\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: That's House Martell.\nBRAN STARK: Righteous in wrath\"\".\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: House Hornwood.\nBRAN STARK: Family, duty, honor\"\".\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?\nBRAN STARK: Family, duty, honor\"\"... Is that the right order?\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: You know it is.\nBRAN STARK: Family comes first?\nMAESTER LUWIN: Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.\nBRAN STARK: How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?\"\nMAESTER LUWIN: Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.\nBRAN STARK: And then she left!\nMAESTER LUWIN: When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.\"\nBRAN STARK: Why did she leave?\nMAESTER LUWIN: I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.\"\nBRAN STARK: Do you know where she is now? Today?\nMAESTER LUWIN: No, I don't.\"\nBRAN STARK: Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?\nMAESTER LUWIN: Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.\nBRAN STARK: I'll never shoot another arrow.\nMAESTER LUWIN: And where is that written?\nBRAN STARK: You need legs to work a bow.\nMAESTER LUWIN: Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.\"\nBRAN STARK: Really?\nMAESTER LUWIN: Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.\nROS: I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Important enough for the likes of you.\nROS: You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.\nROS: Jealous?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Why should I be jealous?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.\nROS: Might surprise you.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Hmm?\nROS: He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.\nROS: You are jealous.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.\"\nROS: And what about the Starks?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.\nROS: A “ward”, that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.\nROS: You're a very serious boy.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm not a boy.\nROS: Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I don't want to pay for it.\nROS: Then get yourself a wife.\nARYA STARK: Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.\nVARYS: How is your son, my Lord?\"\nEDDARD STARK: He'll never walk again.\nVARYS: But his mind is sound?\nEDDARD STARK: So they say.\nVARYS: A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?\nVARYS: If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?\nVARYS: I didn't trust you.\nEDDARD STARK: So why do you trust me now?\nVARYS: The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.\"\nEDDARD STARK: What sort of doom does the King face?\nVARYS: The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Who gave it to him?\nVARYS: Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.\"\nEDDARD STARK: The squire, Ser Hugh?\"\nVARYS: Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.\"\nEDDARD STARK: If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?\"\nVARYS: Someone who could afford it.\nEDDARD STARK: Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?\nVARYS: He started asking questions.\nVARYS: He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.\nILLYRIO MOPATIS: And when he knows the truth, what will he do?\"\nVARYS: The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.\"\nILLYRIO MOPATIS: What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?\"\nVARYS: This Hand is not the other.\nILLYRIO MOPATIS: We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.\nVARYS: Delay,\"\" you say. \"\"Move fast, \"\" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.\"\nILLYRIO MOPATIS: It never was.\nVARYS: The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.\nPETYR BAELISH: You do move quietly.\nVARYS: We all have our qualities.\nPETYR BAELISH: You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.\nVARYS: I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.\nPETYR BAELISH: Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.\"\nVARYS: Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important.\"\nVARYS: Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.\nVARYS: And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.\nPETYR BAELISH: Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.\"\nVARYS: Strictly speaking.\nPETYR BAELISH: Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.\"\nVARYS: Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?\nVARYS: Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Saw me with your own eyes?\nVARYS: Eyes I own.\nPETYR BAELISH: Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.\nVARYS: Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...\nPETYR BAELISH: One shudders at the thought.\nVARYS: Oh.\nPETYR BAELISH: But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.\nVARYS: Have you?\nPETYR BAELISH: Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.\"\nVARYS: Was that you under the bed?\nPETYR BAELISH: And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.\"\nVARYS: Oh, please.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --\nRENLY BARATHEON: What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: To a small council meeting?\nVARYS: Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?\nGUARD: Off with you. No begging.\nARYA STARK: I'm not a beggar. I live here.\nGUARD: D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?\nARYA STARK: I want to see my father.\nGUARD: I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.\"\nGUARD: You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.\"\nARYA STARK: My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?\"\nEDDARD STARK: You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.\nARYA STARK: They said they were going to kill you.\nEDDARD STARK: Who did?\nARYA STARK: I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Oh, Arya.\"\nARYA STARK: I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.\nEDDARD STARK: Where did you hear this?\nARYA STARK: In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.\"\nEDDARD STARK: What were you doing in the dungeons?\nARYA STARK: Chasing a cat.\nJORY CASSEL: Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Your name, friend?\"\nYOREN: Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.\"\nARYA STARK: I'm a girl!\nEDDARD STARK: Did Benjen send you?\nYOREN: No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Ah, we'll find recruits for you.\"\nYOREN: Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Know what?\nYOREN: Best said in private, my Lord.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Go on. We'll talk more later.\nEDDARD STARK: Jory, take her safely to her room.\"\nJORY CASSEL: Come along, my Lady. You heard your father.\"\nARYA STARK: How many guards does my father have?\nJORY CASSEL: Here in King's Landing? Fifty.\nARYA STARK: You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?\"\nJORY CASSEL: No fear on that count, little Lady.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Well?\nYOREN: It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp.\"\nVARDIS EGEN: You're far from home, Lady Stark.\"\nCATELYN STARK: To whom do I speak?\nVARDIS EGEN: Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?\"\nCATELYN STARK: There was no time to send word.\nVARDIS EGEN: May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?\"\nCATELYN STARK: That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.\nVARDIS EGEN: He doesn't look like a prisoner.\nCATELYN STARK: My sister will decide what he looks like.\nVARDIS EGEN: Yes, my Lady. She will at that.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.\nBRONN: Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I like you.\nSTEWARD: Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I need to see the King first -- alone.\nSTEWARD: The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Is it about my wife?\nSTEWARD: No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: The whore is pregnant.\nEDDARD STARK: You're speaking of murdering a child.\nROBERT BARATHEON: I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.\"\nEDDARD STARK: You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!\"\nEDDARD STARK: Then we're no better than the Mad King.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Careful, Ned. Careful now.\"\nEDDARD STARK: You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?\nVARYS: No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Based on whose information?\nVARYS: Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.\nEDDARD STARK: Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?\nPETYR BAELISH: Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.\"\nEDDARD STARK: He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?\nEDDARD STARK: The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.\nVARYS: I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.\"\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?\"\nRENLY BARATHEON: We should have had them both killed years ago.\nPETYR BAELISH: When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: She dies.\nEDDARD STARK: I will have no part in it.\nROBERT BARATHEON: You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.\"\nEDDARD STARK: And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!\"\nEDDARD STARK: I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.\nJORY CASSEL: Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word \"\"treason\"\" was mentioned.\"\nEDDARD STARK: What can I do for you?\nPETYR BAELISH: When do you return to Winterfell?\nEDDARD STARK: Why? What do you care?\nPETYR BAELISH: If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I don't have the time.\nPETYR BAELISH: It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.\nEDDARD STARK: Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?\nJORY CASSEL: Heward and Wyl.\nEDDARD STARK: Find them and meet me at the stables.\nLYSA ARRYN: You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, \"\"the seed is strong.\"\" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-\"\nLYSA ARRYN: To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!\nROBIN ARRYN: Mommy? Is that the bad man?\nLYSA ARRYN: It is.\nROBIN ARRYN: He's little.\nLYSA ARRYN: He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.\nLYSA ARRYN: You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.\"\nROBIN ARRYN: You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!\"\nLYSA ARRYN: Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.\"\nROBIN ARRYN: Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.\nLYSA ARRYN: Perhaps you will, my little love.\"\nCATELYN STARK: This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.\nLYSA ARRYN: Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.\"\nMORD: You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!\"\nLORAS TYRELL: Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.\nRENLY BARATHEON: Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.\"\nLORAS TYRELL: You're jealous.\nRENLY BARATHEON: Are you sure this won't hurt?\nLORAS TYRELL: Only if I slip.\nRENLY BARATHEON: And you prefer me like this?\nLORAS TYRELL: Mhmm.\nRENLY BARATHEON: If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.\"\nLORAS TYRELL: I want you.\nRENLY BARATHEON: My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?\"\nLORAS TYRELL: Hold still.\nRENLY BARATHEON: All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.\"\nLORAS TYRELL: You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.\nRENLY BARATHEON: His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!\nLORAS TYRELL: He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.\nRENLY BARATHEON: Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.\nLORAS TYRELL: It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.\nRENLY BARATHEON: I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.\"\nLORAS TYRELL: Yes well, I guess we'll never know.\"\nRENLY BARATHEON: Everywhere?\nLORAS TYRELL: Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?\nRENLY BARATHEON: It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.\"\nLORAS TYRELL: It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.\nRENLY BARATHEON: He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.\"\nLORAS TYRELL: I have an outrageous amount of money.\nRENLY BARATHEON: Not as much as the Lannisters.\nLORAS TYRELL: But a lot more than you.\nRENLY BARATHEON: Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.\"\nLORAS TYRELL: Hmm... How did that ever happen?\nRENLY BARATHEON: Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.\nLORAS TYRELL: Do you know who should be King?\nRENLY BARATHEON: Be serious.\nLORAS TYRELL: I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.\"\nRENLY BARATHEON: I'm fourth in line.\nLORAS TYRELL: And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.\nRENLY BARATHEON: Stannis?\nLORAS TYRELL: Stannis has the personality of a lobster.\nRENLY BARATHEON: He's still my older brother.\nRENLY BARATHEON: What are you doing?!\nLORAS TYRELL: Look at it.\nRENLY BARATHEON: You cut me!\nLORAS TYRELL: It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.\"\nLORAS TYRELL: You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.\nROBERT BARATHEON: I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?\nROBERT BARATHEON: I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.\nROBERT BARATHEON: It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Is my father wrong?\nROBERT BARATHEON: Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We still outnumber them.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Which is the bigger number -- five or one?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Five.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What do you want?\nROBERT BARATHEON: We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Our marriage.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Every day.\nROBERT BARATHEON: How long can hate hold a thing together?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Yes, it is.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Yes, it tis. What was she like?\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: So why now?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?\nROBERT BARATHEON: You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I felt something for you once, you know?\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: I know.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: No. Does that make you feel better or worse?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It doesn't make me feel anything.\nMHAEGEN: She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.\"\nMHAEGEN: Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I will.\nMHAEGEN: And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.\"\nEDDARD STARK: When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?\"\nMHAEGEN: He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.\"\nEDDARD STARK: She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.\nPETYR BAELISH: Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.\"\nEDDARD STARK: What do you know of King Robert's bastards?\nPETYR BAELISH: Well, he has more than you, for a start.\"\nEDDARD STARK: How many?\nPETYR BAELISH: Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.\"\nEDDARD STARK: And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?\nPETYR BAELISH: He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.\nEDDARD STARK: Come.\nEDDARD STARK: Jory!\nJORY CASSEL: My Lord.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Such a small pack of wolves.\nJORY CASSEL: Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.\nPETYR BAELISH: What's the meaning of this, Lannister?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.\"\nEDDARD STARK: I remember him well.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?\"\nEDDARD STARK: He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.\nPETYR BAELISH: My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!\nJAIME LANNISTER: Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.\"\nJORY CASSEL: If you threaten my Lord again...\nJAIME LANNISTER: Threaten? As in, \"\"I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?\"\nEDDARD STARK: You kill me, your brother's a dead man.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!\nJAIME LANNISTER: My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.\"",
