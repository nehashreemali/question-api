Do you feel like a victor?\"\nROOSE: I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?\"\nROOSE: A reckoning will come We need the North to face it The entire North They won't back us without Sansa Stark We no longer have Sansa Stark You played your games with her You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they're both gone\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds They won't get far\nROOSE: I'm glad to hear it Without Sansa, you won't be able to produce an heir.
