Why come, then?\"\nARYA STARK: You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.\nJAQEN HGHAR: A man teaches a girl. . Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. .\"\nARYA STARK: I want to serve. .\nJAQEN HGHAR: A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one.\"\nARYA STARK: Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.\nJAQEN HGHAR: There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.\nARYA STARK: Where are they taking him?\nBYSTANDERS: Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Did I hurt you?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: No. You were lovely.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: It all happened so fast.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Yes. .\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Wouldn't that be glorious? . Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: So strange… Husband.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Wife. . Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, , and it's all because my brother died.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Do you like to sail?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I love to sail.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I do, too.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. .\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Well, but I'm a man now.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: You are. And the king. . But you'll always be her baby-boy.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I suppose.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. . Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: That's where you grew up. . You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: This is my real home now. Where my family lives.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I want you to be happy, mother.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I said, \"\"Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?\"\" . And he said, \"\"Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it.\"\"\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Mother! . Welcome.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: You are very sweet.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. .\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I'll leave you to it then. .\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: There's no need for such formalities.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Won't that be a lovely day.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Remember. Anything you need.\nROOSE: We can't hold the North with terror alone.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.\nROOSE: I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.\"\nROOSE: He left you no choice.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch.\"\nROOSE: And?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.\nROOSE: I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.\nROOSE: We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Our pact with the Lannisters protects -\nROOSE: I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. . Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.\"\nSANSA STARK: That's Moat Cailin.\nPETYR BAELISH: Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before.\"\nSANSA STARK: On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Home.\nSANSA STARK: The Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: No.\nSANSA STARK: Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!\nPETYR BAELISH: He did.\nSANSA STARK: He serves the Lannisters.\nPETYR BAELISH: For now.\nSANSA STARK: I won't go.\nPETYR BAELISH: Winterfell is your home.\nSANSA STARK: Not anymore.\nPETYR BAELISH: Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.\nSANSA STARK: I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.\nPETYR BAELISH: You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -\"\nSANSA STARK: No!\nPETYR BAELISH: Sansa -\nSANSA STARK: No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them.\"\nPODRICK: How do we get through there?\nBRIENNE: We don't. We go around. .\nPODRICK: It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.\nBRIENNE: Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.\nBRIENNE: Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?\nPODRICK: He hates that nickname.\nBRIENNE: Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?\"\nPODRICK: I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.\"\nBRIENNE: He borrowed it?\nPODRICK: He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.\"\nBRIENNE: As punishment. For both of you.\nPODRICK: It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.\nBRIENNE: Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.\"\nPODRICK: I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.\nBRIENNE: I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.\nPODRICK: If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.\nBRIENNE: You want to be a knight, Pod?\"\nPODRICK: Yes.\nBRIENNE: Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.\"\nPODRICK: Thank you.\nBRIENNE: I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.\"\nPODRICK: I suppose that's more important.\nPODRICK: You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?\"\nBRIENNE: I was.\nPODRICK: Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.\nBRIENNE: He was.\nPODRICK: But how did you end up serving Renly?\nBRIENNE: When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.\"\nPODRICK: But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...\nBRIENNE: Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly.\"\nPODRICK: But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?\nBRIENNE: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Lord Commander.\nJON SNOW: Your Grace.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I'd like to speak alone.\nJON SNOW: Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Very well. . Have you considered my offer?\nJON SNOW: I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Say the word and you will be.\nJON SNOW: But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.\nJON SNOW: I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.\nJON SNOW: I can imagine no higher praise.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you.\"\nJON SNOW: May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Are you bored of us already?\nJON SNOW: You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.\nJON SNOW: And the wildlings?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.\"\nJON SNOW: Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. .\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.\nJON SNOW: I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.\nDAVOS: He sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.\"\nJON SNOW: I'm sorry I disappointed him.\nDAVOS: The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.\nJON SNOW: As long as he's ruling them.\nDAVOS: He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.\nJON SNOW: I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.\nDAVOS: Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.\nOLLY: Night gathers and now my watch begins -\nDAVOS: Not that bit, the bit at the end.\"\nOLLY: I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -\"\nDAVOS: Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.\"\nJON SNOW: And what needs to be done?\nDAVOS: As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion.\"\nARYA STARK: What do you want?\nWAIF: Who are you?\nARYA STARK: What?\nWAIF: You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. . Who are you?\"\nARYA STARK: No one.\nARYA STARK: Ow! Cunt!\nWAIF: A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?\"\nARYA STARK: I told you, I'm no - . Do that again and -\"\nARYA STARK: You're about to find out.\nJAQEN HGHAR: What are you doing?\nWAIF: We were only playing. The game of faces.\nJAQEN HGHAR: A girl is not ready.\nWAIF: Clearly not.\nARYA STARK: I am ready.\nJAQEN HGHAR: For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.\nJAQEN HGHAR: Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?\"\nARYA STARK: What do we do with them after we wash them?\nMAN: Open gates!\nROOSE: Lady Sansa, welcome.\"\nSANSA STARK: Lord Bolton.\nROOSE: May I introduce my son, , Ramsay Bolton?\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: It's an honor to meet you, my Lady.\"\nWOMAN: I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.\nSANSA STARK: Thank you.\nWOMAN: Welcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers.\"\nJON SNOW: Sam. . Maester Aemon?\nSAM: He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.\nJON SNOW: Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.\"\nJON SNOW: Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.\"\nJON SNOW: Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.\nJANOS: Greyguard is a ruin.\nJON SNOW: Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -\"\nJANOS: I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.\nSAM: Alright, alright! Enough of that.\"\nJON SNOW: You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.\"\nJANOS: I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!\"\nJON SNOW: Are you refusing to obey my order?\nJANOS: You can stick your order up your bastard arse.\nJON SNOW: Take Lord Janos outside.\nJON SNOW: Olly, bring me my sword.\"\nJANOS: You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! . Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.\"\nJANOS: A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!\"\nJON SNOW: If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.\"\nJANOS: I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! . My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid.\"\nOLYVAR: You have served us well, my son.\"\nSEPTON: Thank you, Father.\"\nOLYVAR: Which of the Seven will you worship today?\nSEPTON: The Maiden.\nOLYVAR: Where is the Maiden?\nSEPTON: And the Stranger.\nOLYVAR: Two is extra, you realize?\"\nSEPTON: Yes, yes.\"\nOLYVAR: What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -\nLANCEL: You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.\nSEPTON: I am the High Septon of the -\nLANCEL: You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.\nCROWD: Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!\nMAN: Repent!\nCROWD: Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!\nMAN: Shame on you!\nCROWD: Sinner! Sinner!\nSEPTON: Your Grace, , Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, , uh…\"\nQYBURN: It doesn't matter. .\nSEPTON: As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You were assaulted?\nSEPTON: I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows'. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive.\"\nQYBURN: I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.\nMACE: High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.\"\nSEPTON: I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.\"\nQYBURN: So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?\nPYCELLE: A man's private affairs ought to stay private!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What do you want from us, High Septon?\"\nSEPTON: Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?\nMERYN: I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?\"\nMAN: Seven blessings.\nMAN: Thank you.\nMAN: Just a little more...\nWOMAN: Thank you ever so for the soup!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?\nSPARROW: High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. . So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me.\"\nWOMAN: Seven blessings to you.\nSPARROW: Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. .\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Why no shoes?\nSPARROW: Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?\nSPARROW: Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Perhaps they're right.\nSPARROW: It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?\"\nSPARROW: Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.\"\nSPARROW: I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another.\"\nQYBURN: Your Grace.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. .\"\nQYBURN: At once, Your Grace. .\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How's your work coming along?\nQYBURN: Very well.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You've made progress?\nQYBURN: More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word \"\"immediately\"\".\"\nQYBURN: Shh. Easy, friend.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.\nPETYR BAELISH: I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She's suffered enough.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I'll never hurt her. You have my word.\nPETYR BAELISH: I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.\nROOSE: And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. .\"\nPETYR BAELISH: He seems pleased.\nROOSE: Shouldn't he be?\nPETYR BAELISH: I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must.\"\nROOSE: I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Then I have delivered everything I've promised.\nROOSE: And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.\nPETYR BAELISH: The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.\"\nROOSE: The Queen will be enraged.\nPETYR BAELISH: Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.\"\nROOSE: And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. . A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken.\"\nROOSE: I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.\nROOSE: I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?\nPETYR BAELISH: The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply.\"\nROOSE: I'd like to read the reply.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I have to get out of this wheelhouse.\nVARYS: Volantis is a large city.\nVARYS: The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.\"\nVARYS: I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.\nVARYS: It's a perfectly good face.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm losing my mind.\nVARYS: If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Slaves.\nVARYS: Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. . Flies for dung shovelers. . Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores. Lest they forget.\nPRIESTESS: Lord cast your light upon us.\nCROWD: Lord cast your light upon us.\nPRIESTESS: For the night is dark and full of terrors.\nVARYS: We should keep moving.\nCROWD: For the night is dark and full of terrors.\nPRIESTESS: I was once as you are now.\nPRIESTESS: Bought and sold, , scourged and branded...\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.\nPRIESTESS: The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...\nTYRION LANNISTER: Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .\nPRIESTESS: He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!\nTYRION LANNISTER: We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Come on. Let's find a brothel.\nMAN: It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.\nTYRION LANNISTER: See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.\"\nVARYS: Thank you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Curious... hair. .\nMAN: The mother of dragons!\nTYRION LANNISTER: It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.\nVARYS: Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.\nMAN: What makes you worth that much?\nBLONDE PROSTITUTE: I'm magic. .\nMAN: I bet you bloody are.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, , she's taken.\"\nVARYS: Where're you going?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I need to speak to someone with hair.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Hello?\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Hello.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You've got no drink.\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You've got no money.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.\"\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: That's because they've never met a queen.\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: You're just saying that.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.\"\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Why?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Because you have a skeptical mind.\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Alright, then. I'm warning you. We're gonna have to wash you first.\"\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Come on.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.\"\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Of course you can. You're shy.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm not.\nBLACK HAIRED PROSTITUTE: Have another drink.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes.
