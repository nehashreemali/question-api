She'll blow us straight to the gates.\"\nMATTHOS: You're coming home.\nDAVOS: King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.\nMATTHOS: This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain.\"\nDAVOS: Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment.\"\nMATTHOS: Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand.\"\nDAVOS: Gods be good.\nMATTHOS: God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us.\"\nDAVOS: But not over them?\nMATTHOS: Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike.\"\nDAVOS: Well, first, we have to put it there.\"\nMATTHOS: Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.\nDAVOS: Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire.\"\nMATTHOS: I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.\nSHAE: Are you afraid, my lion?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid.\"\nSHAE: I won't let them hurt you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.\nSHAE: It is now.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You can't fuck your way out of everything.\nSHAE: I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.\nPYCELLE: As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Your words are always wise and measured.\nPYCELLE: If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You brought me something?\nPYCELLE: Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I know what ten drops will bring.\nPYCELLE: Your Grace, if I may ask-\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.\nPYCELLE: Yes. A siege is very-\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many.\"\nPYCELLE: Your Grace.\nMEN: And so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his halls / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls / And not a soul to hear-\"\nBRONN: To the boys!\nSOLDIER: Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?\nBRONN: Drunk Lannisters.\nPROSTITUTE: You've got a pretty voice.\nBRONN: Thank you very much.\nPROSTITUTE: And I like your nose. How many times you break it?\nBRONN: Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker.\"\nPROSTITUTE: Oh.\nBRONN: It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.\nBRONN: Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-\"\nBRONN: Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.\"\nPROSTITUTE: Poor nose.\nBRONN: Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.\nBRONN: Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me.\"\nBRONN: I don't think he likes me.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You think you're a hard man?\nBRONN: I know it.\nBRONN: It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Only smaller.\nBRONN: And quicker. Eh?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.\nBRONN: Aye I expect he will someday.\nMAN: Here we are.\nBRONN: One more drink before the war? Shall we?\nVARYS: I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: A wedding.\nVARYS: Exactly. Podrick, is that it?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Is that it?\"\" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.\"\nVARYS: I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.\nVARYS: Do you trust him?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oddly enough, I do.\"\nVARYS: Good.\nVARYS: The map you asked for.\nTYRION LANNISTER: There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.\nVARYS: Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.\"\nVARYS: That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, I'm not.\"\nVARYS: For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: What of it?\nVARYS: You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?\"\nVARYS: I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself.\"\nVARYS: And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: No, I don't believe you have.\"\nVARYS: One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.\"\nMATTHOS: They're welcoming the new king.\nDAVOS: I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.\nMATTHOS: Drums!\nTYRION LANNISTER: Remember, wait till the ships-\"\nBRONN: The ships are in the bay.\nTYRION LANNISTER: They must be far enough in-\nBRONN: I know what \"\"in\"\" means. Do you know how to use that?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood.\"\nBRONN: I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.\nBRONN: Don't get killed.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Nor you, my friend.\"\nBRONN: Oh, are we friends now?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.\nBRONN: Enhances it, really.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh! \"\"Enhances.\"\" Fancy word for a sellsword.\"\nBRONN: Been spending time with fancy folks.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Lady Sansa and Sheila.\nSHAE: Shae.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.\"\nSANSA STARK: She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Sansa.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Always been a great romantic, my nephew.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Sansa, come here.\"\nSANSA STARK: I will pray for your safe return, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Will you?\nSANSA STARK: Just as I pray for the king's.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Stay safe, my lady.\"\nSHAE: And you, my lion.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.\nSANSA STARK: Will you slay him yourself?\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.\nSANSA STARK: So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.\nSANSA STARK: I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.\"\nSHAE: Some of those boys will never come back.\nSANSA STARK: Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.\nSHAE: Shh. Come, my lady.\"\nLANCEL: Where's our fleet?\nTYRION LANNISTER: On the way.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Why isn't it here now? They're coming.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: The king has asked you a question.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy.\"\nLANCEL: The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.\"\nDAVOS: Where are their ships?\nMATTHOS: It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.\nDAVOS: Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.\nMATTHOS: If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied.\"\nDAVOS: Maybe.\nSANSA STARK: I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.\nSHAE: Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.\nSANSA STARK: I doubt it.\nSHAE: Maybe she's jealous of you.\nSANSA STARK: Why would she be jealous?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Sansa.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?\"\nSANSA STARK: Yes.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine.\"\nSHAE: I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: So? I didn't offer you water.\nSANSA STARK: What's he doing here?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.\"\nSANSA STARK: But we have guards to defend us.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors.\"\nGOLD CLOAK: The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.\nSANSA STARK: You said he was here to protect us.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: There they are.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Archers to their marks.\nSOLDIER: Archers, to your marks!\"\nSOLDIER: Archers! Nock your arrows!\nSOLDIER: Nock arrows!\nTYRION LANNISTER: Hold fast.\nSOLDIER: Hold fast!\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: What are you doing? We need to attack them.\nSOLDIER: Boulders ready!\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?\nMATTHOS: There's only one ship.\nDAVOS: Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock.\"\nMAN: Nock and set!\nDAVOS: Draw! Hold.\nMAN: Hold.\nDAVOS: There's no one on board.\nMAN: More rocks coming up!\nDAVOS: Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!\nDAVOS: Matthos! Get down!\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Prepare to land.\nSOLDIER: Your Grace.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: The dwarf has played his little trick.\nSOLDIER: The wildfire.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: He can only play it once.\nSOLDIER: We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers- Hundreds will die.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Thousands.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Come with me and take this city!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Sansa, come here, little dove.\"\nSANSA STARK: My queen.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What are you doing?\nSANSA STARK: Praying.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?\"\nSANSA STARK: For the gods to have mercy on us all.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Oh. On all of us?\nSANSA STARK: Yes, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Even me?\nSANSA STARK: Of course, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Even Joffrey?\nSANSA STARK: Joffrey is my-\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four.\"\nSANSA STARK: Your father doesn't believe in the gods?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: One for her.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Here. Sit. Drink.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Not like that. Drink, girl.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.\nSANSA STARK: They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.\"\nSANSA STARK: And if the city should fall?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.\"\nMAN: More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: They're coming. They're coming ashore.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Rain fire on them.\nMAN: Archers!\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: There are too many.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now.\"\nPODRICK: Yes, my lord.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts.\"\nMEN: Pull, pull! Go!\"\nSOLDIER: Nock! Draw!\nMEN: Draw! Draw!\nMEN: Kill the Lannisters!\nMEN: Loose! Loose!\nMAN: Form the line!\nMEN: Draw! Draw! Loose! Loose!\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: To the Mud Gate, go now!\"\nMEN: First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.\"\nSANSA STARK: You were Robert's queen.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Pretty.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?\nSHAE: A few weeks, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: When did you leave Lorath?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?\nSHAE: Ten years ago, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?\"\nSHAE: Shae, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Tell us a story, Shae.\"\nSHAE: When I was thireen, I-\"\nLANCEL: Your Grace!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What news?\nLANCEL: The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Where is Joffrey?\nLANCEL: On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Bring him back inside at once.\nLANCEL: Your Grace-\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What?\nLANCEL: The king's presence is good for morale.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Bring him back to his chambers now.\nLANCEL: Not here?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?\nLANCEL: No, but I-\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Now!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.\"\nMAN: Help me!\nMAN: Fall back! Fall back!\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Get the ladders up!\nMAN: Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum!\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Someone bring me a drink.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Fuck the water. Bring me wine.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Eat shit, dwarf.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're on the wrong side of the wall.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.\nMAN: Loose!\nMAN: Put your backs into it!\nMAN: All right, get up!\"\nMAN: Clear!\nMAN: Forward!\nMAN: Forward ladders!\nMEN: Heave! Heave!\nLANCEL: Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: If you won't defend your own city, why should they?\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: What would you have me do?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?\nLANCEL: She did not say, Your Grace.\"\nMAN: All men to the battlements!\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle.\"\nMAN: Archers, hold your line or I'll kill you myself.\"\nMAN: Stand fast!\nMAN: No! Get up, you fool.\"\nMAN: We need more arrows!\nMAN: Where is the king? Why isn't he with us?\nMAN: Who are we fighting for?\nMAN: Who leads us?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!\nMAN: Yes.\nMAN: What are you talking about?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?\"\nMAN: The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.\nTYRION LANNISTER: There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape.\"\nMEN: Heave! Heave! Heave!\nTYRION LANNISTER: Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.\nLANCEL: The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Where is my son?\nLANCEL: I want to escort him back to the battle.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Why do I care what you want? Bring me-\nLANCEL: Now listen to me-\nSANSA STARK: Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy...\"\nALL: Save our sons from war, we pray.\"\nSHAE: You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.\nSANSA STARK: Come with me.\nSHAE: I need to say goodbye to someone.\nSANSA STARK: The queen said they'd rape everyone.\nSHAE: No one is raping me.\nSHAE: Go. Run.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: The lady is starting to panic.\nSANSA STARK: What are you doing here?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Not here for long. I'm going.\nSANSA STARK: Where?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be.\"\nSANSA STARK: What about the king?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: He can die just fine on his own.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?\nSANSA STARK: I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.\nSANSA STARK: You won't hurt me.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: No, little bird, I won't hurt you.\"\nMEN: Heave!\nMAN: Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Attack!\nMEN: Roll it over!\nALL: Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, fuck me.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Shh! Be calm, my sweet.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: They're still fighting.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: The Kingswood?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Like what?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Like stags.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And wolves.\nPODRICK: My lord.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, \"\"You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid.\"\"\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And the cub said, \"\"Will I be strong and fierce like my father?\"\"\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Yes,\"\" said his mother. \"\"You will be strong and fierce just like your father.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you.\"\nMAN: Back to the boats!\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: No!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Father.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The battle is over. We have won.\nMALE SINGER: And who are you,\"\" the proud lord said / \"\"That I must bow so low?\"\" / \"\"Only a cat of a different coat / That's all the truth I know / In a coat of gold or a coat of red / A lion still has claws / And mine are long and sharp, my lord / As long and sharp as yours\"\" / And so he spoke, and so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his hall / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall / And not a soul to hear\"",
