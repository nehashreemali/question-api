Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.\"\nEDDARD STARK: He butchered my men.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Quiet, woman.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I took you for a king.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Hold your tongue.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I shall wear this like a badge of honor.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.\nROBERT BARATHEON: See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.\nEDDARD STARK: If we don't act… there will be a war.\nROBERT BARATHEON: So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.\"\nEDDARD STARK: And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?\nROBERT BARATHEON: I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters - I can't rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats, so enough!\"\nEDDARD STARK: As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt.\"\nEDDARD STARK: The hunt?\nROBERT BARATHEON: Killing things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.\nEDDARD STARK: The Targaryen girl -\nROBERT BARATHEON: Seven hells! Don't start with her again! The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister.\"\nIRRI: Khaleesi?\nIRRI: Oh, Khaleesi!\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You're hurt.\nROBB STARK: Not too fast.\nBRAN STARK: Come on, Dancer.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: When are you gonna tell him?\nROBB STARK: Not now.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.\nROBB STARK: You're talking about war.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm talking about justice.\nROBB STARK: Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.\nTHEON GREYJOY: A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -\nROBB STARK: You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!\nTHEON GREYJOY: You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.\nROBB STARK: And it's not your duty, because it's not your House.\"\nROBB STARK: Where's Bran?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I don't know. It's not my House.\nBRAN STARK: Robb?\nOSHA: All alone in the deep dark woods.\nBRAN STARK: I'm not alone, my brother is with me.\"\nWILDLING: I don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?\nOSHA: Oh, that's a pretty pin. Silver.\"\nWILDLING: We'll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.\nBRAN STARK: I can't. The saddle, the straps.\"\nWILDLING: What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?\nBRAN STARK: I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!\"\nWILDLING: Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.\nOSHA: the boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood. Think what Mance would give us.\nWILDLING: Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far south as south goes. There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.\nROBB STARK: Drop the knife. Let him go and I'll let you live.\nBRAN STARK: Robb!\nWILDLING: Shut up! Drop the blade!\nBRAN STARK: No, don't.\"\nWILDLING: Do it.\nROBB STARK: Are you all right?\nBRAN STARK: Yes, it doesn't hurt.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done.\"\nROBB STARK: Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?\nTHEON GREYJOY: He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.\nROBB STARK: You don't have the right -\nTHEON GREYJOY: To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.\"\nROBB STARK: What about her?\nOSHA: Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours.\"\nROBB STARK: We'll keep her alive.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!\nMORD: Dwarf man making noise!\nTYRION LANNISTER: How would you like to be rich?\nMORD: Dwarf man still making noise.\nTYRION LANNISTER: My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold.\"\nMORD: No gold!\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, I don't have it here.\"\nMORD: No gold! Fuck off.\nARYA STARK: I don't want to practice today.\nSYRIO FOREL: No?\nARYA STARK: They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.\nSYRIO FOREL: You are troubled.\nARYA STARK: Yes -\nSYRIO FOREL: Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.\"\nARYA STARK: I don't like dolls and k -\nSYRIO FOREL: You're not here. You're with your trouble. If you're with your trouble when fighting happens…\nSYRIO FOREL: More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?\"\nSYRIO FOREL: The old and the new.\nSYRIO FOREL: There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - “Not today.”\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse.\nJORAH MORMONT: She's doing well.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: She'll never keep it down.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Tell me what she is saying.\nJORAH MORMONT: The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”\nJORAH MORMONT: She's going to have a boy.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: He won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true dragon.\nJORAH MORMONT: The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: They love her.\nJORAH MORMONT: She truly is a queen today.\nJORAH MORMONT: Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: It's not my law.\nJORAH MORMONT: They don't belong to you.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Whatever is hers is also mine.\nJORAH MORMONT: Once, perhaps.\"\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: And you have all three.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: I need a large army… I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: You can go, but you can't have the eggs.\"\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?\nJORAH MORMONT: It means everything to me.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: And yet here you stand?\nJORAH MORMONT: And here I stand.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!\nMORD: Noise again!\nTYRION LANNISTER: About the gold -\nTYRION LANNISTER: Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.\"\nMORD: Where?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -\"\nMORD: You want free? Go be free.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.\"\nMORD: What message?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.\nLYSA ARRYN: You wish to confess your crimes?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.\"\nLYSA ARRYN: Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -\"\nLYSA ARRYN: Silence!\nROBIN ARRYN: What happened next?!\nLYSA ARRYN: What do you think you're doing?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Confessing my crimes.\nCATELYN STARK: Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that.\"\nLYSA ARRYN: You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial.\"\nLYSA ARRYN: If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I understand the law.\nLYSA ARRYN: We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.\nLYSA ARRYN: You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.\nLYSA ARRYN: You have that right.\nKNIGHT: My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.\"\nKNIGHT: The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.\nKNIGHT: I'll fight for you, my Lady.\"\nKNIGHT: It'll be my honor.\nKNIGHT: The honor should be mine.\nROBIN ARRYN: Make the bad man fly!\nLYSA ARRYN: Ser Vardis… You're quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?\nSER VARDIS: With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Agreed.\nLYSA ARRYN: You demanded a trial by combat.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.\"\nSER VARDIS: My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.\"\nLYSA ARRYN: The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait.\"\nLYSA ARRYN: The trial will be today.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Do I have a volunteer?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Anyone?... Anyone?\nLYSA ARRYN: I think that we can assume that no one is willing -\nBRONN: I'll stand for the dwarf.\nLANCEL LANNISTER: More wine, your Grace?\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Oh, what was I saying?\"\nRENLY BARATHEON: A simpler time.\nROBERT BARATHEON: It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it, Selmy?\"\nBARRISTON: It was, your Grace.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today.\"\nRENLY BARATHEON: Sounds exhilarating.\nROBERT BARATHEON: Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?\"\nRENLY BARATHEON: Once, I think.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”\"\nRENLY BARATHEON: Those were some lucky girls.\nROBERT BARATHEON: You ever make the eight, Barristan?\"\nBARRISTAN SELMY: I don't believe so, your Grace.\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Those were the days!\nRENLY BARATHEON: What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?\"\nROBERT BARATHEON: Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.\"\nRENLY BARATHEON: I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”\nMAN: They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.\"\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: Brigands, most likely.\"\nMAN: They weren't thieves, they didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace.\"\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the king. The king is hunting.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?\nEDDARD STARK: These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner.\"\nMAN: None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.\nEDDARD STARK: You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.\nPETYR BAELISH: I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, it would be -\"\nPETYR BAELISH: It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: Wel…\nEDDARD STARK: I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion.\"\nEDDARD STARK: You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.\nBERIC DONDARRION: As you command.\nEDDARD STARK: In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.\"\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.\nEDDARD STARK: Grand Maester Pycelle.\nGRAND MAESTER PYCELLE: My Lord.\nEDDARD STARK: Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.\"\nEDDARD STARK: Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?\nROBIN ARRYN: Is it over?\nLYSA ARRYN: You don't fight with honor!\nBRONN: No. He did.\nROBIN ARRYN: Can I make the little man fly now?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.\nTYRION LANNISTER: A Lannister always pays his debts.\nMORDANE: You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.\nSANSA STARK: Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the south.\"\nMORDANE: It's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.\nSANSA STARK: My mother isn't from the North.\nMORDANE: I'm aware of that.\nSANSA STARK: Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?\nMORDANE: Yes. I have hair.\nSANSA STARK: I've never seen it.\nMORDANE: Would you like to?\nSANSA STARK: No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?\"\nMORDANE: I come from a very small village in -\nSANSA STARK: Oh, wait. I just realized… I don't care.\"\nMORDANE: Sansa -\nSANSA STARK: Septa.\nMORDANE: Now you are being rude.\nMORDANE: My prince.\nSANSA STARK: My prince.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?\nSANSA STARK: It's beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: You'll be queen one day, it's only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?\"\nSANSA STARK: There's nothing to forgive.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: You're my lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my lady now, from this day, until my last day.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!\nROS: Going to King's Landing.\nTHEON GREYJOY: In a turnip cart?\nROS: I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.\nTHEON GREYJOY: And you can afford that?\nROS: Some of my friends are more generous than others.\nTHEON GREYJOY: There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.\nROS: I'll have lots of company…\nTHEON GREYJOY: Yes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.\"\nROS: And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Don't be a fool.\nROS: I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there's nothing more for me here. Let's go, Steffon.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Let me see it one more time?\nROS: See what?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm going to miss you!\nROS: I know.\nEDDARD STARK: I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.\nSANSA STARK: What?!\nEDDARD STARK: Listen -\nSANSA STARK: What about Joffrey?\nARYA STARK: Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?\nEDDARD STARK: What? No.\nSANSA STARK: Please, Father. Please don't.\"\nARYA STARK: You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.\nEDDARD STARK: This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.\nARYA STARK: Can't we take Syrio back with us?\nSANSA STARK: Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen and have his babies.\nARYA STARK: Seven hells.\nEDDARD STARK: When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong -\"\nSANSA STARK: I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.\"\nARYA STARK: The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father.\"\nSANSA STARK: He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king.\nEDDARD STARK: Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things.\"\nSANSA STARK: Wait!\nARYA STARK: Come on!\nSANSA STARK: It's not fair!\nEDDARD STARK: Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.” “Axel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.” “Robert Baratheon, black of hair.” “Joffrey Baratheon… golden-haired.”\"\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Daenerys! Where's my sister?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Stop him.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Where is she? I'm here for the feast. The whore's feast.\nJORAH MORMONT: Come.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Khal Drogo! I'm here for the feast.\nJORAH MORMONT: Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: That is no place for a king.\nKHAL DROGO: You are no king.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Keep away from me!\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Viserys, please.\"\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: There she is.\nJORAH MORMONT: Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: They can't kill us. They can't shed blood in their sacred city. But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. He can keep the baby. I'll cut it out and leave it for him.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: What's he saying?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold.\"\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!\nJORAH MORMONT: Look away Khaleesi.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No.\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can't!\"\nVISERYS TARGARYEN: Dany please!\nKHAL DROGO: A crown for a king.\nJORAH MORMONT: Khaleesi…\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.",
