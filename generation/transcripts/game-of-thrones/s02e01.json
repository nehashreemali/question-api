Here I am. . Sorry, Your Grace. . My deepest apologies. .\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Are you drunk?\nSER DONTOS: No. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Two cups? . That's not much at all. . Please, have another cup.\"\nSER DONTOS: Are you sure, Your Grace?\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Yes, to celebrate my name day. Have two, have as much as you like.\"\nSER DONTOS: I would be honored, Your Grace.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill.\"\nSANSA STARK: You can't!\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: What did you say? Did you say I can't?\nSANSA STARK: I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...\nSANDOR CLEGANE: The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.\"\nSANSA STARK: He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? . From this day, , you'll be my new fool.\"\nSER DONTOS: Thank you, Your Grace. . And you, My Lady, thank you.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Beloved nephew.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: What a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me.\"\nBRONN: Can't imagine why.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: We heard you were dead.\nMYRCELLA: I'm glad you're not dead.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!\nTYRION LANNISTER: But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.\nSANSA STARK: My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course you are.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: What work? . Why are you here?\nPYCELLE: The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory.\"\nVARYS: The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter.\"\nPYCELLE: A common superstition.\nPETYR BAELISH: We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, , we'll have fewer peasants.\"\nJANOS: The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?\"\nJANOS: I do, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And are you not a Lord at my command?\nJANOS: I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital.\"\nJANOS: Yes, Your Grace.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What are you doing here?\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What are you doing here? This is the small council.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Our father is Hand of the King.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, but in his absence…\"\nVARYS: Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Out! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. .\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I've done nothing.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I tried to stop it.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Robb Stark is a child.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What do you know about warfare?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Joffrey is King.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Joffrey is King.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You are here to advise him.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How?\nTYRION LANNISTER: You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: One.\nTYRION LANNISTER: One?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Arya, little animal, she disappeared.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.\"\nLORD: My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.\"\nLORD: The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.\"\nLUWIN: Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.\nLORD: Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.\"\nBRAN STARK: King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.\nLORD: Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men.\"\nBRAN STARK: Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?\"\nLORD: Of course I remember!\nLUWIN: We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?\"\nLORD: I - I believe it will.\nLUWIN: We didn't want him here all day, did we?\"\nBRAN STARK: I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.\nLUWIN: Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. . Lord Portan.\nPORTAN: My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.\"\nOSHA: Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.\nBRAN STARK: Don't have any pain.\nOSHA: Lucky for you.\nBRAN STARK: That way.\nOSHA: You've been having those dreams again.\nBRAN STARK: I don't dream.\nOSHA: Everyone dreams.\nBRAN STARK: I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. . They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.\nOSHA: Did they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father.\"\nOSHA: The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons.\"\nBRAN STARK: The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.\nDOREAH: What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He said they ate meat.\nDOREAH: He didn't tell you what kind of meat?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: She was Drogo's first gift to me.\nJORAH MORMONT: I remember.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?\nJORAH MORMONT: A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Does it ever end?\nJORAH MORMONT: This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And you're sure there's no other way?\nJORAH MORMONT: If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No one will take my dragons.\nJORAH MORMONT: They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: As you are mine.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast.\"\nRAKHARO: What do we seek, Khaleesi?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood.\"\nRAKHARO: I will not fail you, blood of my blood.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You never have.\nRAKHARO: This is… bad time to start.\nJON SNOW: Having a rough time of it?\nSAM: Nothing's killed me yet.\nGRENN: Your ass killed the sledge.\nSAM: You offered me a ride!\nGRENN: I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.\nEDD: I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times.\"\nSAM: Are those girls?\nEDD: Craster's daughters.\nSAM: I haven't seen a girl in six months.\nEDD: I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.\nGRENN: What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?\"\nEDD: He don't like people messing with his wives.\nEDD: He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes.\"\nSAM: That's foul.\nGRENN: It's beyond foul.\nEDD: All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.\nJON SNOW: What happens to the boys?\nSAM: Hmm?\nJON SNOW: He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?\nLORD MORMONT: He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.\nCRASTER: People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. . Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.\"\nJON SNOW: We're not Southerners.\nCRASTER: Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?\nJON SNOW: Jon Snow.\nCRASTER: Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North.\"\nLORD MORMONT: The lad meant no harm.\nCRASTER: I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -\nLORD MORMONT: No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. Now, sit down and shut your mouth.\"\nCRASTER: You bring any of that good wine with you?\nLORD MORMONT: We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?\nCRASTER: I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.\"\nLORD MORMONT: There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.\nWATCHMAN: Yes, commander.\"\nCRASTER: You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.\nLORD MORMONT: He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!\"\nCRASTER: Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall.\"\nLORD MORMONT: He's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?\nCRASTER: That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?\nLORD MORMONT: Give it here.\nLORD MORMONT: You'll have another one made at Castle Black. . Here.\nCRASTER: Oh, that's some lovely steel. . You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings.\"\nLORD MORMONT: And where does he plan marching this army?\nCRASTER: When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go.\"\nLORD MORMONT: These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.\nCRASTER: Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are.\"\nGILLY: This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.\nCRASTER: Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?\"\nLORD MORMONT: We chose different paths.\nCRASTER: Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. . You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.\"\nLORD MORMONT: A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.\nCRASTER: Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, , staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out.\"\nLORD MORMONT: Your roof, your rules.\"\nLORD MORMONT: Who am I? Who am I?\nJON SNOW: Lord commander.\nLORD MORMONT: And who are you?\nLORD MORMONT: Who are you?\nJON SNOW: Your steward.\nLORD MORMONT: You want to lead one day? . Then learn how to follow.\nMELISANDRE: Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods.\"\nMELISANDRE: Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors.\nGROUP: For the night is dark and full of terrors.\nMELISANDRE: After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed.\"\nCRESSEN: We need to stop her!\nMELISANDRE: The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.\nDAVOS: Not now.\nMELISANDRE: And the dead shall rise in the North.\nCRESSEN: All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?\nMELISANDRE: You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me.\"\nMELISANDRE: In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you.\"\nCROWD: Lord, cast your light upon us!\"\nMELISANDRE: For the night is dark and full of terrors.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: For the night is dark and full of terror.\nCRESSEN: This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.\nDAVOS: Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path.\"\nCRESSEN: King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation.\"\nDAVOS: I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.\nCRESSEN: As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. . If you tell him the truth…\"\nDAVOS: What's the truth?\nMATTHOS: And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-”\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: He wasn't my beloved brother. . I didn't love him, he didn't love me.\"\nDAVOS: A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: A lie. Take it out.\nMATTHOS: That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth -\"\"\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is.\"\nMATTHOS: And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.\"\nMATTHOS: Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. . Let all true men declare their loyalty.”\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.\"\nDAVOS: Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.\nDAVOS: Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.\"\nMELISANDRE: Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.\nDAVOS: And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?\nMELISANDRE: He has no need for ships.\nDAVOS: I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.\"\nCRESSEN: I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?\"\nDAVOS: Don't.\nCRESSEN: A cup of wine to honor the one true God.\nMELISANDRE: The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.\"\nROBB STARK: If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, \"\"Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?\nROBB STARK: Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy'? Insulted?\nROBB STARK: You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy.\"\nROBB STARK: You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. . Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. . He's your bastard son.\nJAIME LANNISTER: If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him.\"\nROBB STARK: My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.\nROBB STARK: Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?\nROBB STARK: I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.\nROBB STARK: No, but he's starting to know me.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Three victories don't make you a conqueror.\nROBB STARK: It's better than three defeats.\nSHAE: This city stinks Like dead bodies.\nTYRION LANNISTER: A bit corpsey, yes.\"\nSHAE: And shit.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I thought you wanted to come here.\nSHAE: I love it.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?\nSHAE: And cum and garlic and rum.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You can smell cum from the balcony?\nSHAE: I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And so did the country.\nSHAE: This is where I belong.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here.\"\nSHAE: No one will know.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.\"\nSHAE: What about you?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.\nSHAE: Truth? You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Lord Baelish.\nPETYR BAELISH: Your Grace.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.\nPETYR BAELISH: Of course, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.\nPETYR BAELISH: If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.\nPETYR BAELISH: Curious.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Yes.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.\nPETYR BAELISH: I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And which truth is that?\nPETYR BAELISH: Knowledge is power.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.\nROBB STARK: You're Ser Alton Lannister?\nALTON: I am, Your Grace.\"\nROBB STARK: I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals.\"\nALTON: An honorable request, Your Grace.\"\nROBB STARK: Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.\"\nSER RODRIK: The King in the North.\nOTHERS AT TABLE: King in the North.\nROBB STARK: Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.\"\nALTON: These are... Your Grace, these are...\"\nROBB STARK: These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead.\"\nALTON: King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.\"\nROBB STARK: Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: A word, Your Grace?\"\nROBB STARK: You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace' when no one's around.\nTHEON GREYJOY: It's not so bad once you get used to it.\nROBB STARK: I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.\nTHEON GREYJOY: The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?\"\nROBB STARK: Of course they are.\nTHEON GREYJOY: We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.\"\nROBB STARK: Men who fought my father.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together.\"\nCATELYN STARK: You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.\nROBB STARK: I need his ships. They say he has 200.\nCATELYN STARK: They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?\nROBB STARK: I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.\nCATELYN STARK: I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.\nROBB STARK: Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.\"\nROBB STARK: If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.\"\nCATELYN STARK: You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?\"\nROBB STARK: It's more complicated than that! You know it is.\nCATELYN STARK: It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.\nROBB STARK: You can't go to Winterfell.\nCATELYN STARK: I beg your pardon?\nROBB STARK: I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Why in the name of all the Gods -\nROBB STARK: Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -\nROBB STARK: Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good.\"\nCATELYN STARK: I will ride at first light.\nROBB STARK: We will all be together again soon, I promise.\"\nCATELYN STARK: You've done so well. Your father would be proud.\nROBB STARK: Give Lord Renly my regards.\nCATELYN STARK: King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What is all this?\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We can't find Arya Stark.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. .\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: His life is in danger.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: It's not a claim. The throne is mine.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What are you asking?\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. . That will be all, Mother.\"\nROZ: No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion.\"\nROZ: Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.\nROZ: We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.\"\nDAISY: Haystack Hall.\nROZ: Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. . Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.\nDAISY: Littlefinger's a fancy man.\nROZ: Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish.\"\nROZ: She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.\nDAISY: She's beautiful.\nROZ: She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. . Lord Commander. Good to see you, again.\"\nROZ: You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets.\"\nJANOS: Orders.\nROZ: Whose orders?\nJANOS: Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.\nMHAEGAN: No, you can't!\"\nMHAEGAN: No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.\nJANOS: Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.\nJANOS: Give it here.\nGOLD CLOAK: Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room.\"\nBLACKSMITH: Gendry! His name is Gendry.\nJANOS: Where is the bastard?\nBLACKSMITH: The Night's Watch! Please, stop!\"\nJANOS: Where?\nBLACKSMITH: They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!\"\nJANOS: How will we know him?\nBLACKSMITH: He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.\nJANOS: Find him.",
