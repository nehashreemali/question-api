You picked up some scars along the road.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's been a long road. But we're both still here.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm Tyrion Lannister.\nDAVOS: Davos Seaworth.\nTYRION LANNISTER: and DAVOS shake hands.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.\"\nDAVOS: Unluckily for me.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.\nMISSANDEI: Welcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.\nJON SNOW: Of course.\nMISSANDEI: Please, this way.\"\nDAVOS: Where are you from? I can't place the accent.\nMISSANDEI: I was born on the Island of Naarth.\nDAVOS: Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.\nDAVOS: This place has changed.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well.\"\nJON SNOW: She is.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Does she miss me terribly?\nTYRION LANNISTER: A sham marriage and unconsummated.\nJON SNOW: I didn't ask --\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on.\"\nJON SNOW: She's starting to let on.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.\nJON SNOW: As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.\"\nJON SNOW: My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.\"\nJON SNOW: True. But I'm not a Stark.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Come. Their mother is waiting for you.\nVARYS: I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?\nMELISANDRE: I've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.\nVARYS: Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.\nMELISANDRE: My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.\nVARYS: Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again.\"\nMELISANDRE: Neither of us is common folk anymore. I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor.\"\nVARYS: Why?\nMELISANDRE: Because of mistakes I made. Terrible mistakes. I would only be a distraction if I stayed.\nVARYS: So where will you go?\nMELISANDRE: Volantis.\nVARYS: Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here.\"\nMELISANDRE: I will return, dear spider. One last time.\"\nVARYS: My Lady --\nMELISANDRE: I have to die in this strange country, just like you.\"\nMISSANDEI: You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains.\"\nDAVOS: This is Jon Snow.\nDAVOS: He's King in the North.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough.\"\nJON SNOW: The winds were kind, Your Grace.\"\nDAVOS: Apologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. He's not a lord.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Forgive me --\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?\"\nDAVOS: I wasn't there, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Forever.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee.\"\nJON SNOW: I am not.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?\"\nJON SNOW: Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it.\"\nJON SNOW: You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Then why are you here?\nJON SNOW: Because I need your help and you need mine.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?\nJON SNOW: I did.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?\"\nJON SNOW: They're hard to miss.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: But still, I need your help?\"\nDAVOS: Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Almost.\nJON SNOW: But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.\"\nJON SNOW: Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You told me you liked this man.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I do.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.\nJON SNOW: Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.\"\nJON SNOW: I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The dead?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Is that another figure of speech?\nJON SNOW: The Army of the Dead is on the march.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Army of the Dead?\nJON SNOW: You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: No, I don't think you're either of those things.\"\nJON SNOW: The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --\nJON SNOW: we're finished.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.\nJON SNOW: You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --\nTYRION LANNISTER: whatever you saw beyond the wall.\nDAVOS: You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.\nDAVOS: But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him.\"\nDAVOS: All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --\"\nDAVOS: If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.\nJON SNOW: There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --\nTYRION LANNISTER: It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.\nJON SNOW: And why would I do that?\nJON SNOW: I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.\nJON SNOW: Am I your prisoner?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Not yet.\nVARYS: Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And?\nVARYS: Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: All of them?\nCAPTAIN: Your sister's dead?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Euron has her.\nCAPTAIN: You saw him take her? And you got away?\nTHEON GREYJOY: I couldn't save her. I tried.\nCAPTAIN: You wouldn't be here if you tried.\nEURON GREYJOY: This is the life. Look at them. Cheering for a Greyjoy.\nEURON GREYJOY: I have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?\"\nEURON GREYJOY: Oh no!\nEURON GREYJOY: What a twat.\nEURON GREYJOY: My queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.\nEURON GREYJOY: I give you --\nEURON GREYJOY: what no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.\nEURON GREYJOY: A bit more than a true friend.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.\nEURON GREYJOY: There's only one reward I want.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You shall have what your heart desires --\nCERSEI LANNISTER: when the war is won.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country.\"\nEURON GREYJOY: There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.\"\nEURON GREYJOY: Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Advice?\nEURON GREYJOY: Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?\nEURON GREYJOY: Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It doesn't matter now.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I imagine she is your favorite.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right.\"\nTYENE: Momma!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?\"\nQYBURN: The Long Farewell.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That's the one.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How long does the poison take?\nQYBURN: Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: But death is certain?\nQYBURN: Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Don't.\nJAIME LANNISTER: What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.\nMESSENGER: Forgive me, Your Grace. The visitor from Braavos has arrived.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.\nMESSENGER: At once, Your Grace.\"\nTYCHO: No, thank you.\"\nTYCHO: My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son. From all reports he was a fine young man.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.\nTYCHO: Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.\nTYCHO: Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Iron Bank wants its gold back.\nTYCHO: Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.\nTYCHO: Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.\nTYCHO: We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.\nTYCHO: Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.\nTYCHO: For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?\"\nTYCHO: The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?\nTYCHO: Your father's daughter indeed.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.\nJON SNOW: I'm a prisoner on this island.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.\"\nJON SNOW: Except to my ship. They took my ship.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I wouldn't say we took your ship.\nJON SNOW: I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.\"\nJON SNOW: It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --\nJON SNOW: You probably don't believe me.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I do actually.\nJON SNOW: You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.\"\nJON SNOW: How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Good question.\nJON SNOW: I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.\nTYRION LANNISTER: People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.\"\nJON SNOW: I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.\nJON SNOW: Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: So do you have anything reasonable to ask?\nJON SNOW: What do you mean?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Dragonglass?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Which wise man said this?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't remember.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?\nTYRION LANNISTER: You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.\nJON SNOW: Amazing thing to see.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You lost two brothers as well?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.\nJON SNOW: You've been talking to Tyrion?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He is my Hand.\nJON SNOW: He enjoys talking.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We all enjoy what we're good at.\nJON SNOW: I don't.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.\nJON SNOW: I never expected that you would.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.\nJON SNOW: I haven't either.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.\nJON SNOW: Thank you.\nJON SNOW: So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You better get to work, Jon Snow.\"\nSANSA STARK: How much do we have?\nWOLKAN: 4,000 bushels, My Lady.\"\nSANSA STARK: What does that mean?\nYOHN: For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.\"\nSANSA STARK: What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?\nWOLKAN: I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.\nSANSA STARK: You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell.\"\nWOLKAN: No, My Lady, most likely not.\"\nSANSA STARK: We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.\"\nYOHN: Very wise, My Lady.\"\nSANSA STARK: Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?\"\nSANSA STARK: Are they covering those breastplates in leather?\nYOHN: No, My Lady.\"\nSANSA STARK: Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?\"\nYOHN: They should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady.\"\nYOHN: You there, why isn't there leather on these?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.\nSANSA STARK: So they should be.\nPETYR BAELISH: I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --\nSANSA STARK: You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.\nPETYR BAELISH: I only meant to say --\nSANSA STARK: That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before.\"\nGUARD: Lady Sansa, at the gate.\"\nBRAN STARK: Hello, Sansa.\"\nSANSA STARK: I wish Jon was here.\nBRAN STARK: Yes. I need to speak to him.\nSANSA STARK: Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.\nBRAN STARK: I can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.\nSANSA STARK: I don't know what that means.\nBRAN STARK: It's difficult to explain.\nSANSA STARK: Try, please, for me.\"\nBRAN STARK: It means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready.\"\nSANSA STARK: How do you know all of this?\nBRAN STARK: The three-eyed raven taught me.\nSANSA STARK: I thought you were the three-eyed raven.\nBRAN STARK: I told you it's difficult to explain.\nSANSA STARK: Bran --\nBRAN STARK: I'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.\nSANSA STARK: I have to go back inside, Bran.\"\nBRAN STARK: I'll stay a bit longer.\nMARWYN: Hmm.\nMARWYN: Hmm. Does it hurt?\nJORAH MORMONT: A bit. Less than before.\nMARWYN: The infection no longer appears to be active.\nMARWYN: Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.\nJORAH MORMONT: I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.\nJORAH MORMONT: And the climate.\nMARWYN: The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer.\"\nMARWYN: Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: How bad is it?\nSAM TARLY: I suppose I'll find out this evening.\nSAM TARLY: Where will you go?\nJORAH MORMONT: I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.\nJORAH MORMONT: I owe my life to her and you.\nSAM TARLY: Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.\nJORAH MORMONT: Perhaps our paths will cross again?\nSAM TARLY: I hope they do.\nMARWYN: You treated him?\nSAM TARLY: Yes.\nMARWYN: Who told you to treat him?\nSAM TARLY: No one.\nMARWYN: Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?\nSAM TARLY: I seem to remember you.\nMARWYN: But you treated him anyway?\nSAM TARLY: I did.\nMARWYN: I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?\"\nSAM TARLY: I read the books and followed the instructions.\nMARWYN: That man is alive because of you. You should be proud.\nSAM TARLY: Thank you, Archmaester.\"\nMARWYN: Come here.\nMARWYN: All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.\nMARWYN: You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.\nVARYS: Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.\nTYRION LANNISTER: But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?\"\nMISSANDEI: They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's too great a risk. You're too important.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What about Casterly Rock?\nVARYS: The Unsullied will be there soon.\nMISSANDEI: And what will they face?\nVARYS: A difficult situation. They know we're coming.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.\nTYRION LANNISTER: No one has ever taken the rock.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: They will be ready.\nMAN: Draw! Loose!\nTYRION LANNISTER: The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.\nTYRION LANNISTER: No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: As a good friend of mine once said, \"\"give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch.\"\"\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.\nTYRION LANNISTER: But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump.\"\nUNSULLIED: There are none left.\nGREY WORM: There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.\nGREY WORM: Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?\nOLENNA TYRELL: It's done?\nJAIME LANNISTER: It is.\nOLENNA TYRELL: And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I suppose as well as can be expected.\nOLENNA TYRELL: It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.\nJAIME LANNISTER: The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: So you'll just let them take it?\nJAIME LANNISTER: For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Yes. You must be very wise by now.\nJAIME LANNISTER: My father always said I was a slow learner.\nOLENNA TYRELL: If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Widow's Wail.\nOLENNA TYRELL: He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Yes, it has.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I think we're done here.\nOLENNA TYRELL: How will it happen?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Will there be pain?\nJAIME LANNISTER: No. I made sure of that.\nOLENNA TYRELL: That's good.\nOLENNA TYRELL: I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me.\"\nEND: CREDITS",
