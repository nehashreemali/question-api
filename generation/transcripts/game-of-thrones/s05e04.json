Why no Lannister sails?\nJAIME LANNISTER: This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.\"\nBRONN: You ever been to Dorne?\nJAIME LANNISTER: No.\nBRONN: I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You should be happy to go back. .\nBRONN: There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. . And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,\"\nBRONN: Your niece?\nBRONN: I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. .\nJAIME LANNISTER: That's why you're here.\nBRONN: I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Because I don't want to start a war.\nBRONN: That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It has to be me.\nBRONN: If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, , who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -\"\nBRONN: You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Varys set him free.\nBRONN: Well, if you ever see the little fucker, , give him my regards.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards.\"\nMACE: The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How much can the Crown afford?\nMACE: With winter coming, half what they ask. Less.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?\nMACE: Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You've already given us too much. . No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.\"\nMACE: Absolutely.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: In person.\nMACE: Me? .\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.\"\nMACE: I will be honored, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. . He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.\nMACE: My very own Kingsguard? Please express -\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.\"\nMACE: Of course, of course, . I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.\"\nPYCELLE: The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Not small enough.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?\"\nSPARROW: No. .\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. .\nSPARROW: I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, , I don't like the taste.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Hmm.\nSPARROW: How may I serve?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.\nSPARROW: Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. . In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.\"\nSPARROW: Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy.\"\nSPARROW: An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven.\"\nSPARROW: An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Which is why you were chosen. . You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.\"\nSPARROW: All sinners are equal before the Gods.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.\nSPARROW: May the Father judge him justly. .\nMERCHANT: Help me! Help me!\nOLYVAR: This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.\nMILITANT: Cocksucker! . Boy fucker! You barbaric filth! There's a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind.\nCLIENT: Please, please, I'll pay! I'll pay all of you.\"\nMILITANT: Yes, you will! Seize him.\"\nMILITANT: Seize him.\nLORAS: Get your hands off of me.\nLANCEL: Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men.\"\nLORAS: Who do you think you are?\nLANCEL: Justice. .\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Why is my brother in a cell?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: We both know who did. . You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Are you saying my mother is behind this?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Aren't you and mother getting along?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Oh, my sweet, sweet King. . Do you have any affection for me at all?\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Of course I do. You're my Queen.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I'll set him free for you.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Do you promise?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Did I arrest him?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. . Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.\"\nKINGSGUARD: Halt!\nMILITANT: His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.\nKINGSGUARD: Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?\"\nKINGSGUARD: You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.\nMAN: Bastard!\nMAN: You're an abomination!\nMAN: You're born of sin!\nWOMAN: Filthy bastard!\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: We'll find another way.\nMAN: Abomination!\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: My Queen?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Are you? When?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I--I don't know.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: You don't know?\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: He was praying just now.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I have to send word to Grandmother.\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Will you come back later? .\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I need to be with my family, Your Grace. .\"\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: Of course.\nSELYSE: You think highly of this boy.\nJON SNOW: Good.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.\nSELYSE: A bastard by some tavern slut.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.\"\nSELYSE: I should have given you a son.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Not your fault.\nSELYSE: Whose then? . I gave you nothing but weakness. . And deformity. .\nMELISANDRE: Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.\nSELYSE: My Lady.\nMELISANDRE: Her father is the Lordo s chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.\nMELISANDRE: You march on Winterfell soon?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: We must. To beat the snows.\nMELISANDRE: Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I won't. I need you.\nMELISANDRE: You only need faith, my King.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: And you, my Lady, what do you need?\"\nMELISANDRE: To serve my Lord.\nSAM: Lord Ashford. . Lady Caulfield. . Lord Smallwood.\nJON SNOW: Never even heard of these people.\nSAM: They haven't heard of you either. . But we need men and they have some.\nJON SNOW: And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?\nSAM: More than Lord Wibberley.\nJON SNOW: Not him.\nSAM: I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North.\"\nJON SNOW: He murdered my brother.\nSAM: We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.\nSAM: Apologies, my Lady.\"\nMELISANDRE: Lord Commander.\nJON SNOW: How can I help you?\nMELISANDRE: Come with us when we ride south. . None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? .\"\nJON SNOW: Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.\nMELISANDRE: There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. .\nJON SNOW: You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.\"\nMELISANDRE: No visions. No magic. Just life.\nMELISANDRE: Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.\"\nMELISANDRE: The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.\"\nJON SNOW: I don't think Stannis would like that very much.\nMELISANDRE: Then we shouldn't tell him. .\nJON SNOW: I can't.\nMELISANDRE: Why?\nJON SNOW: I swore a vow. . I loved another.\nMELISANDRE: The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.\nJON SNOW: I know. But I still love her.\nMELISANDRE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Are you lonely?\nSHIREEN: Just bored.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.\nSHIREEN: Were you bored a lot, too?\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -\"\nSHIREEN: I like it. . I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. .\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Why do you say that?\nSHIREEN: She told me, \"\"I don't want to bring you.\"\"\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: She shouldn't have said that.\nSHIREEN: Are you ashamed of me, father?\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I thought I might find you here. . Your Aunt Lyanna.\nSANSA STARK: Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?\"\nSANSA STARK: Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Come. . Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. .\nSANSA STARK: Dressed for riding?\nPETYR BAELISH: I am.\nSANSA STARK: Where are you going?\nPETYR BAELISH: King's Landing.\nSANSA STARK: King's Landing?\nPETYR BAELISH: Cersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.\nSANSA STARK: You can't leave me here!\nPETYR BAELISH: I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long.\"\nSANSA STARK: How do you know?\nPETYR BAELISH: Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell.\"\nSANSA STARK: You don't know that.\nPETYR BAELISH: I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.\"\nSANSA STARK: You think he'll defeat the Boltons?\nPETYR BAELISH: He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man.\"\nSANSA STARK: And if you're right?\nPETYR BAELISH: Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North.\"\nSANSA STARK: But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North\"\nPETYR BAELISH: You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.\nSANSA STARK: What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.\"\nSANSA STARK: I don't know how to do that.\nPETYR BAELISH: Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.\nSANSA STARK: His father frightens me.\nPETYR BAELISH: He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learnt to maneuver from the very best. . I return before too long. . You'll be strong without me. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?\"\nSANSA STARK: I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.\nBRONN: Breakfast.\nBRONN: That would have been a shit way to die.\nJAIME LANNISTER: As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.\"\nBRONN: Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.\nBRONN: No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Sounds like all the rest.\nJAIME LANNISTER: What about you? What shit way would you choose?\nBRONN: In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.\nBRONN: I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?\nJAIME LANNISTER: In the arms of the woman I love.\nBRONN: She want the same thing?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Let's go.\nBRONN: The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Pentoshi.\nBRONN: And he's headed to Oldtown?\nJAIME LANNISTER: As I said. Why?\nBRONN: What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?\nJAIME LANNISTER: A bag of gold.\nBRONN: I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It was a heavy bag.\nBRONN: And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.\nBRONN: How many you count?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Four.\nBRONN: How many you think you can take?\nJAIME LANNISTER: One, if he's slow.\"\nRIDER: Halt!\nBRONN: Fucked in the arse. . Hiya! . Morning, lads. Glad we found you.\"\nRIDER: Who are you?\nBRONN: Cooper. . This is Darnell.\nRIDER: You're from King's Landing.\nBRONN: Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.\nRIDER: Why are you here?\nBRONN: Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I thought the sharks would get us. .\nRIDER: There are no sharks in Dorne.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I could have sworn those were shark fins.\nBRONN: Dolphins maybe.\nRIDER: Throw your swords in the sand.\nBRONN: Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home.\"\nRIDER: Swords in the sand! Now!\nBRONN: That one should be slow enough.\nBRONN: Nice move! .\nJAIME LANNISTER: Luck.\nBRONN: You had a wonderful teacher.\nBRONN: Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.\nJAIME LANNISTER: First we need to bury these bodies.\nBRONN: Birds have to eat too.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war.\"\nBRONN: Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really.\"\nTYENE: Nama!\nELARIA: Nym, Obara.\"\nOBARA: Will it be war?\nELARIA: Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.\"\nOBARA: Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.\nELARIA: We don't need an army to start a war. . Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them.\"\nNYMERIA: We may have a problem.\nOBARA: A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.\"\nELARIA: He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war.\"\nTYENE: I'm with you. Always. .\nELARIA: Nym? . Obara?\nOBARA: When I was a child, , Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl.\"\nOBARA: I made my choice long ago.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Thank you. . Who are you?\nJORAH MORMONT: Your captor.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Do you have wine?\nJORAH MORMONT: No.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I can't sleep without wine.\nJORAH MORMONT: Then stay awake.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.\nJORAH MORMONT: I'm not taking you to your sister.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You said you were taking me to the Queen.\nJORAH MORMONT: I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!\nJORAH MORMONT: What business would you have with the Queen?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?\nBARRISTAN: I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Why?\nBARRISTAN: He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He sang to them?\nBARRISTAN: Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And what did you do?\nBARRISTAN: I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. . Well he liked to see how much he could make.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He was good?\nBARRISTAN: He was very good. Viserys never told you?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .\nBARRISTAN: Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And what did you do with the money?\nBARRISTAN: Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. .\"\nDAARIO: Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How many others are there?\nDAARIO: Fifty a hundred.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?\"\nDAARIO: I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.\"\nBARRISTAN: Your Grace. .\nHIZDAHR: All men must die. But not all can die in glory.\nMISSANDEI: Glory?\nHIZDAHR: Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?\nHIZDAHR: Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I do not recognize this tradition.\nHIZDAHR: Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. . Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start.\"\nWOMAN: Sons of the Harpy.\nEND: EPISODE",
