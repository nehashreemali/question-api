Tansy!\nRAMSAY BOLTON: There you are.\nMYRANDA: I can't see her, Ramsay.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Tansy!\nRAMSAY BOLTON: If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Tansy.\nMYRANDA: Where is she?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too.\"\nMYRANDA: I only wounded her.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: A fine shot, master. My lady.\"\nTANSY: Please, my lord. It hurts.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon.\"\nMYRANDA: She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work.\"\nTANSY: Why? I did whatever you asked.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: But you made Myranda feel jealous.\nMYRANDA: Me jealous of her?\nTANSY: My lord, please.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Not so pretty now.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?\"\nPODRICK: Is it solid gold?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Gilded steel.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm not hungry.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Oh!\nPODRICK: I'll clean it up.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No, I'll do it. Leave us.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's only wine.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I can't fight anymore.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What about your left?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...\nTYRION LANNISTER: Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.\nBRONN: He tells me you shit gold just like your father.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Is this place safe?\nBRONN: There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Uh-huh.\nBRONN: Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.\"\nBRONN: I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to.\"\nBRONN: And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guardo s down.\"\nBRONN: Best time to attack a man.\nBRONN: Mind yourself. JAIME; If I still had my right hand...\nBRONN: Plan on growing it back?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Come on, then.\"\nMAN: Open the gates!\nMAN: Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to!\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Father. Welcome home.\nROOSE: Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: A pleasure, Mother.\"\nWALDA: Hello.\nROOSE: See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers.\"\nWOMAN: This way, my lady.\"\nROOSE: Where is your prize?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.\nLOCKE: Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Father.\nROOSE: What did you do to him?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned.\"\nROOSE: You flayed him.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.\nROOSE: This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.\nROOSE: My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-\nROOSE: You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.\nROOSE: I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us.\"\nROOSE: I placed far too much trust in you.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm sorry, my lord.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Give him the razor.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Go on, Reek. A nice close shave.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I don't know, my lord.\"\nROOSE: You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: No, my lord. Just two farm boys.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: And crisped them so no one would know.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Yes, my lord.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?\"\nROOSE: You ready for a hunt?\nMERYN TRANT: Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.\nLOCKE: Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Jon Snow is at Castle Black.\nLOCKE: Who the fuck is Jon Snow?\nROOSE: Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat.\"\nROOSE: You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?\nVARYS: I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, to be foreign.\"\nVARYS: Ahem.\nVARYS: Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.\nTYRION LANNISTER: So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.\nVARYS: No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Forgive me if I don't weep for you.\nVARYS: No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.\nTYRION LANNISTER: She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.\"\nVARYS: Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?\nMACE: From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup.\"\nMACE: May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?\"\nMACE: I shall be honored, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: A book?\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Lives of Four Kings.\"\" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor.\"\nPYCELLE: Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: So they say.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?\nMAN: Stormbringer.\nMAN: Terminus.\nMAN: Widow's Wail.\nMAN: Wolfsbane.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Don't.\nSHAE: You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Don't call me that.\nSHAE: What should I call you?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.\nSHAE: Our friendship?\nTYRION LANNISTER: There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.\nSHAE: What?\nTYRION LANNISTER: You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants.\"\nSHAE: What is this?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows.\"\nSHAE: She doesn't want you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I need to do right by her.\nSHAE: You don't want her.\nTYRION LANNISTER: By our children.\nSHAE: What are you afraid of?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm not afraid.\nSHAE: You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I need you to leave.\nSHAE: I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Shae.\nSHAE: We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?\nSHAE: How many whores have you been with?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.\nMELISANDRE: Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness.\"\nAXELL FLORENT: Sire, I served you well.\"\nMELISANDRE: Lord of Light, show us the way...\"\nAXELL FLORENT: Selyse, you're my sister!\"\nSELYSE: Yours are the stars that guide us.\nAXELL FLORENT: Tell him! Tell him!\nMELISANDRE: Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.\"\nSELYSE: Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?\nDAVOS: Lord Florent was your brother by law.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: He was an infidel.\nDAVOS: He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.\nDAVOS: How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: A good deal more than you.\nSELYSE: Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?\"\nDAVOS: I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Meat's off.\nSELYSE: Our larders are almost empty.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Serve fish, then. We're on an island.\"\nSELYSE: You hate fish.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.\"\nSELYSE: When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Of course I remember.\nSELYSE: Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?\"\nMELISANDRE: It's all I knew when I was a child.\nSELYSE: Until you found the Lord of Light?\nMELISANDRE: Until he found me.\nSELYSE: I fear for our daughter's soul.\nMELISANDRE: Every mother should fear for her childo s soul.\nSELYSE: She's a stubborn little beast.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: She's a child.\nSELYSE: You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: She's my daughter. You will not strike her.\nSELYSE: As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.\nSHIREEN: Come in.\nMELISANDRE: Were you sleeping, Princess?\"\nMELISANDRE: Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?\nSHIREEN: I heard it.\nMELISANDRE: And it frightened you?\nSHIREEN: Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.\nMELISANDRE: They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.\"\nSHIREEN: But they screamed.\nMELISANDRE: Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.\nSHIREEN: Afterward they aren't ash and bone.\nMELISANDRE: You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess.\"\nSHIREEN: And you didn't have this.\nMELISANDRE: No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?\"\nSHIREEN: I read \"\"The Seven-Pointed Star.\"\"\"\nMELISANDRE: Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war.\"\nSHIREEN: There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?\nMELISANDRE: There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now.\"\nHODOR: Hodor.\nBRAN STARK: Why did you wake me?\nMEERA: You've been gone for hours.\nBRAN STARK: I was hungry.\nMEERA: We're all hungry.\nBRAN STARK: I was just eating.\nJOJEN: Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran.\"\nJOJEN: Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human.\"\nMEERA: You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything.\"\nBRAN STARK: Hodor, take me to the tree.\"\nTHREEEYED RAVEN: Look for me... beneath the tree.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He saw us.\nTHREEEYED RAVEN: North.\nBRAN STARK: I know where we have to go.\nSEPTON: Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: With this kiss, I pledge my love.\"\nSANSA STARK: We have a new queen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Better her than you.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Bit much, wouldn't you say?\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: It feels proportionate.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Proportionate to what?\nOLENNA TYRELL: The expected extravagance.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.\nOLENNA TYRELL: You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?\nOLENNA TYRELL: No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. \"\"The Iron Bank will have it's due.\"\" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.\nOLENNA TYRELL: We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.\"\nBRONN: All taken care of.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You saw her board the ship?\nBRONN: Aye, she's on it.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You saw the ship sail away?\nBRONN: No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: How do you know?\nBRONN: Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: There's someone following you?\nBRONN: She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Hello.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Hello.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Not you.\nOLENNA TYRELL: You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: My lady. My lady.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.\"\nMUSICIAN: A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine, my lord...\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Very good. Very good. Off you go.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: My love, why don't we make the announcement?\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're an example to us all.\nLORAS: Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful.\"\nLORAS: As does yours.\nJAIME LANNISTER: So, looking forward to your wedding?\"\nLORAS: Yes, very much.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.\nLORAS: They certainly are.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her.\"\nLORAS: And neither will you.\nBRIENNE: Your Grace. My king. My queen.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.\nBRIENNE: I'm no lady, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Did you just bow?\nBRIENNE: Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.\nBRIENNE: I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Yes, yes.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Thank you. I hope we see more of you.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.\nBRIENNE: As you say, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.\nBRIENNE: In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Did he? Haven't heard that story before.\nBRIENNE: Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.\nBRIENNE: I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: But you love him.\nBRIENNE: Your Grace.\nPYCELLE: No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: She'll do no such thing.\nPYCELLE: Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice...\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.\nMAID: Your Grace.\nPYCELLE: Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?\nPYCELLE: Your Grace, I am a man of learning.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?\nPYCELLE: I never meant to annoy anyone.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.\nPYCELLE: Your Grace, Queen Margaery-\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You're in rather a good mood.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I suppose I am.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I won't ask why.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Small pleasures.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Your Grace. Lord Tywin.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Prince Oberyn.\nOBERYN MARTELL: I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand.\"\nELLARIA: My lord. My lady.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Charmed.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.\nELLARIA: We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No? How tolerant of you.\nOBERYN MARTELL: I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.\nOBERYN MARTELL: People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies...\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings.\"\nRENLY DWARF: I'm the rightful king.\nROBB DWARF: King in the North!\nJOFFREY DWARF: Yes!\nBALON DWARF: Traitor. You're a traitor.\nJOFFREY DWARF: For the Seven Kingdoms!\nJOFFREY DWARF: Let the war begin.\nSTANNIS DWARF: Renly, you're no king.\"\nBALON DWARF: Away, degenerate. Away. Away.\"\nRENLY DWARF: Ooh, careful.\"\nSTANNIS DWARF: Go on.\nRENLY DWARF: I want you to be my prince. Stannis!\nBALON DWARF: Who's got the gold now, Stark?\"\nROBB DWARF: I am the rightful king.\nBALON DWARF: Challenge me, ruffian.\"\nROBB DWARF: Take that.\nBALON DWARF: I'm drowning. I'm drowning.\nROBB DWARF: I am the King in the North!\nSTANNIS DWARF: Not wildfire!\nTYRION LANNISTER: Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.\nPODRICK: Yes, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: We'll have to find another way to thank the king.\nJOFFREY DWARF: Charge!\nJOFFREY DWARF: Ready, again.\"\nROBB DWARF: I am the King in the North! - Charge!\nJOFFREY DWARF: Charge! Yes!\nJOFFREY DWARF: Your head!\nJOFFREY DWARF: Fine gentlemen.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: It did not spill.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine?
