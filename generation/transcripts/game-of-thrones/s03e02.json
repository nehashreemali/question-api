There was a boy.\"\n DARK WORDS\": osha,I don't want to hear about it.\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,But you asked.\n DARK WORDS\": osha,We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,I didn't ask for black magic dreams.\n DARK WORDS\": osha,\"I know you didn't, little lord.\"\n DARK WORDS\": osha,We need to move.\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.\n DARK WORDS\": osha,And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,No.\n DARK WORDS\": osha,\"Some good he is, then.\"\n DARK WORDS\": osha,I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,\"My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds.\"\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,Did you ever think you'd marry one?\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,Never?\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,\"Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.\"\n DARK WORDS\": roose bolton,\"Pardon me, Your Grace. My queen.\"\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,Lord Bolton.\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,Let me guess which one is the good news.\n DARK WORDS\": roose bolton,Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,Something else?\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,\"By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.\"\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,Have you received any demands?\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,No.\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,Have you heard anything from Theon at all?\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?\n DARK WORDS\": torturer,I want to do this.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,Yes.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,So how shall we pass the time?\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,By putting one foot in front of the other.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,It's going to be a very dull walk.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.\"\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,\"If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,All the good it's done her.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,\"Not your concern, Kingslayer.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,How would you know?\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,Move.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,Were you pledged to Stannis?\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,\"Gods, no.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.\"\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,Shut your mouth.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you.\"\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,\"I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,Sounds like you quite fancied him.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,I did not fancy him.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"Oh, gods, you did.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,I'm not interested in foul rumors.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,Shut your mouth!\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love.\"\n DARK WORDS\": man,\"Where are you headed, then?\"\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,South. You?\n DARK WORDS\": man,\"Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"No, you really can't.\"\n DARK WORDS\": man,\"Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you.\"\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,And you.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,He knows who I am.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,He doesn't.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Make it tighter here.\n DARK WORDS\": cersei lannister,That's better. It makes you look very strong.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.\n DARK WORDS\": tailor,\"Yes, Your Grace.\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Bloody flowers. On the king.\n DARK WORDS\": cersei lannister,Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.\n DARK WORDS\": cersei lannister,Tell me what you think of her.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Who?\n DARK WORDS\": cersei lannister,Margaery.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,\"She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.\"\n DARK WORDS\": cersei lannister,\"It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent.\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,\"Yes, she is.\"\n DARK WORDS\": cersei lannister,Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Not to me.\n DARK WORDS\": cersei lannister,I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.\n DARK WORDS\": cersei lannister,Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.\n DARK WORDS\": cersei lannister,You need to ask yourself\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,I don't need to do anything.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Better. Much better.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,I still don't believe it.\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,Littlefinger's not in love with me.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,Love is not the thing he wants.\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,He's too old.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,No.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,\"If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.\"\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.\n DARK WORDS\": guard,\"Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.\"\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,Send him in.\n DARK WORDS\": loras,Lady Sansa.\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,Ser Loras.\n DARK WORDS\": loras,\"My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?\"\n DARK WORDS\": loras,\"I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.\"\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,\"You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose.\"\n DARK WORDS\": loras,Of course I did.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,It's more your color. You take it.\n DARK WORDS\": maid,Thank you.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,You're such a dear.\n DARK WORDS\": loras,I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,\"Thank you, Ser Loras.\"\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"Kiss me, child.\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,\"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant.\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.\"\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras.\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?\"\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,Lemon cake's my favorite.\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others.\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,I haven't had the pleasure.\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.\"\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,\"I-, I-\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,Has he ripped out your tongue?\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,\"Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?\"\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,Bring me some cheese.\n DARK WORDS\": servant,\"The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.\"\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,My father always told the truth.\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head.\"\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,Go on.\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her.\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.\"\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,He's a monster.\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,Ah. That's a pity.\n DARK WORDS\": sansa stark,\"Please, don't stop the wedding.\"\n DARK WORDS\": olenna tyrell,\"Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese.\"\n DARK WORDS\": rickard karstark,We're at war. This march is a distraction.\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.\n DARK WORDS\": rickard karstark,Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?\n DARK WORDS\": rickard karstark,Then it's a distraction.\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.\n DARK WORDS\": rickard karstark,\"Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference.\"\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,Have you lost faith in our cause?\n DARK WORDS\": rickard karstark,\"If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.\"\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,If you no longer believe-\n DARK WORDS\": rickard karstark,I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,You don't think we can win?\n DARK WORDS\": rickard karstark,\"May I speak my mind, Your Grace?\"\n DARK WORDS\": robb stark,\"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?\"\n DARK WORDS\": rickard karstark,I think you lost this war the day you married her.\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,\"Whoa, whoa.\"\n DARK WORDS\": man,Your Grace.\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,You're afraid of her. And she knows it.\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,\"I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?\"\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,No.\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,\"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-\"\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,You've made them before?\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,Twice.\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,Did they work?\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,\"Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.\"\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,Which boy?\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,\"Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.\"\n DARK WORDS\": talisa,And he lived.\n DARK WORDS\": catelyn stark,And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.\n DARK WORDS\": mance,Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?\n DARK WORDS\": jon snow,Yes.\n DARK WORDS\": mance,\"You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jon snow,I understand.\n DARK WORDS\": mance,\"Well, how could you understand?\"\n DARK WORDS\": jon snow,You want to protect your people.\n DARK WORDS\": mance,\"Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?\"\n DARK WORDS\": jon snow,No.\n DARK WORDS\": mance,I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.\n DARK WORDS\": tormund,Shouldn't be long now.\n DARK WORDS\": jon snow,What's wrong with him?\n DARK WORDS\": mance,\"He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us.\"\n DARK WORDS\": ygritte,\"What, you've never met a warg?\"\n DARK WORDS\": mance,Orell.\n DARK WORDS\": mance,Where were you this time?\n DARK WORDS\": orell,The Fist of the First Men.\n DARK WORDS\": mance,What did you see?\n DARK WORDS\": orell,Dead crows.\n DARK WORDS\": rast,\"What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to.\"\n DARK WORDS\": grenn,\"Hey. Get up, Sam.\"\n DARK WORDS\": sam,No.\n DARK WORDS\": grenn,Get up.\n DARK WORDS\": sam,I can't.\n DARK WORDS\": grenn,\"If you stop, you'll die.\"\n DARK WORDS\": dolorous edd,\"Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too.\"\n DARK WORDS\": sam,You don't care.\n DARK WORDS\": dolorous edd,Course we care.\n DARK WORDS\": sam,\"You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me.\"\n DARK WORDS\": dolorous edd,\"Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die.\"\n DARK WORDS\": grenn,Help me get him up.\n DARK WORDS\": rast,Looks like that piggy is done for.\n DARK WORDS\": grenn,Help us get him up.\n DARK WORDS\": rast,He's slowing us down.\n DARK WORDS\": grenn,Just get him up!\n DARK WORDS\": rast,Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.\n DARK WORDS\": jeor,\"What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?\"\n DARK WORDS\": grenn,\"Aye, I think so.\"\n DARK WORDS\": rast,\"If he can't, we may as well just go without him.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jeor,\"That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me?\"\n DARK WORDS\": rast,Why should the rest of us-\n DARK WORDS\": jeor,\"Rast, you're responsible for him.\"\n DARK WORDS\": rast,What am I supposed to do?\n DARK WORDS\": jeor,\"Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!\"\n DARK WORDS\": rast,\"I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?\"\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,Where's Rickon and Hodor?\n DARK WORDS\": osha,Looking for food.\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,What's out there?\n DARK WORDS\": osha,\"Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,I'm unarmed.\n DARK WORDS\": osha,That was poor planning.\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,My sister carries the weapons.\n DARK WORDS\": meera,I'm better with them. Drop the spear.\n DARK WORDS\": meera,Drop it.\n DARK WORDS\": osha,\"If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,You must be SUMMER.\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,\"I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go.\"\n DARK WORDS\": gendry baratheon,I'm just trying to understand.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,Would you please shut up about it?\n DARK WORDS\": gendry baratheon,Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,I'm not listening.\n DARK WORDS\": gendry baratheon,But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,Shut up.\n DARK WORDS\": gendry baratheon,You could have picked Tywin Lannister.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,\"Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?\"\n DARK WORDS\": gendry baratheon,But you could have ended the war.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,Where are we going?\n DARK WORDS\": gendry baratheon,North.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,\"If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now.\"\n DARK WORDS\": gendry baratheon,Maybe we already passed it.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,\"It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us.\"\n DARK WORDS\": gendry baratheon,Could be a minstrel.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,A lion still has claws...\n DARK WORDS\": hot pie,\"A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food.\"\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,Shh.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"And so he spoke, and so he spoke\"\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?\n DARK WORDS\": anguy,\"Just a dirty little cub, I think.\"\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,Loose a few more shafts.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,Don't.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"Put the sword down, girl.\"\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.\n DARK WORDS\": anguy,Generous.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,What friends?\n DARK WORDS\": anguy,The fat to your left and the lad beside him.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,Who are you?\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,\"No, who do you fight for?\"\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.\n DARK WORDS\": hot pie,I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way.\"\n DARK WORDS\": anguy,\"Here's the thing, fat\"\n DARK WORDS\": anguy,\"When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking.\"\n DARK WORDS\": anguy,Half the country's starving and look at this one.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,My lion.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,But you said I should come to you with any problems.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,Did anyone see you? No.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,No.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,All right. What is this problem?\n DARK WORDS\": shae,\"I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him.\"\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,Baelish doesn't have friends.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,I don't know her name.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,\"Oh, Ros? The redhead?\"\n DARK WORDS\": shae,How do you know her?\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,She's a whore.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,\"Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.\"\n DARK WORDS\": shae,You fucked her.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,\"Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice.\"\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,\"But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.\"\n DARK WORDS\": shae,And was she good? Did you like her?\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,\"Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?\"\n DARK WORDS\": shae,That Sansa shouldn't trust him.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?\n DARK WORDS\": shae,We have to protect her.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,\"We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name.\"\n DARK WORDS\": shae,\"A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?\"\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,\"Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you.\"\n DARK WORDS\": shae,You pervert. You want her? This child?\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,I don't even want to talk about her.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,But you are.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,Only because you're making me.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.\n DARK WORDS\": shae,\"Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me.\"\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,\"Hmm, yes.\"\n DARK WORDS\": shae,Now do you think I'm cruel?\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.\n DARK WORDS\": tyrion lannister,Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.\n DARK WORDS\": guard,\"Lady Tyrell, my king.\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Send her in.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"You wanted to see me, Your Grace?\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want.\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,You failed to do this.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,What makes you say this?\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me.\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,\"No, he was a known degenerate.\"\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,You are the king.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Yes. I am.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,The bolt goes here.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,And then you just aim and-\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman.\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,It's not unheard of.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,My father would never let me before-\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,May I? Please.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Could you do it? Could you kill something?.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,\"I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?\"\n DARK WORDS\": joffrey lannister,Yes.\n DARK WORDS\": margaery tyrell,Would you like to watch me?\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,Stop! Stop!\n DARK WORDS\": torturer,Tell us the truth.\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,About what?\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,I don't know what you want.\n DARK WORDS\": torturer,I want the truth.\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,What truth?\n DARK WORDS\": torturer,Why'd you take Winterfell?\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,I took it to-I took it-\n DARK WORDS\": torturer,Who gave the orders?\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,No one. I took it on my own.\n DARK WORDS\": torturer,Why?\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,To take the North while it was vulnerable.\n DARK WORDS\": torturer,What were you going to do once you took it?\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,Hold it. Rule it.\n DARK WORDS\": torturer,Good. That's very good.\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,Why did you do that?\n DARK WORDS\": torturer,I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,\"Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them.\"\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,What are you doing?\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,Please.\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,\"I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off.\"\n DARK WORDS\": ramsay bolton,Your sister sent me.\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,Yara?\n DARK WORDS\": ramsay bolton,I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.\n DARK WORDS\": theon greyjoy,\"No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go.\"\n DARK WORDS\": osha,\"Rickon, stay with us.\"\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,It's all right. The wolves will protect him.\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,\"You can get inside his head, see through his eyes.\"\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,Only when I'm asleep.\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,A three-eyed raven?\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,You've seen it?\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,Does it have anything to do with warging?\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,\"No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight.\"\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,Seeing things that haven't happened yet?\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.\n DARK WORDS\": osha,What's he telling him?\n DARK WORDS\": meera,Why don't you ask?\n DARK WORDS\": osha,\"Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?\"\n DARK WORDS\": meera,Where's the shame in that?\n DARK WORDS\": osha,Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.\n DARK WORDS\": meera,Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,\"When my father died, I dreamt it.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,\"You have the sight, too?\"\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,\"When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.\"\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,Yeah.\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,He saved my father's life during the rebellion.\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,\"Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too.\"\n DARK WORDS\": bran stark,What else have you seen?\n DARK WORDS\": jojen,Only one thing that matters-you.\n DARK WORDS\": man,\"I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand.\"\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,I don't drink ale.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.\n DARK WORDS\": man,Yeah!\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-\"\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,We're not children.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?\"\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"A smith, eh? Where'd you train?\"\n DARK WORDS\": gendry baratheon,King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.\n DARK WORDS\": gendry baratheon,That's because he's twice as good.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,Aha! A smith and a salesman.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,Gendry stole us weapons.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.\"\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,He knows how to use a sword and so do I.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,My brothers taught me.\n DARK WORDS\": men,Ooh!\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,To your brothers!\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.\n DARK WORDS\": arya stark,You'll free us?\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,I gave you my word.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-\"\n DARK WORDS\": anguy,\"Hey, hey.\"\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?\n DARK WORDS\": anguy,One waits for him to drink until he passes out.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,Poor man. You have my sympathy.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!\"\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"So good to see you again, Clegane.\"\n DARK WORDS\": sandor clegane,Thoros? The fuck you doing here?\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.\n DARK WORDS\": thoros,\"A pretty prize, lads.\"\n DARK WORDS\": men,Yeah!\n DARK WORDS\": sandor clegane,Girl.\n DARK WORDS\": sandor clegane,What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,\"Silence, Kingslayer.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river.\"\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,Good luck.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,Be quick about it.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,I need to rest.\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,Get up.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?\"\n DARK WORDS\": brienne,Get up now.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,This heel is ruined. There's no way-\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"You're good. Graceless, but good.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,\"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.\"\n DARK WORDS\": locke,\"Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman.\"\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.\n DARK WORDS\": locke,You sure he's the one?\n DARK WORDS\": man,\"That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.\"\n DARK WORDS\": locke,Give the man his silver.\n DARK WORDS\": jaime lannister,Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.\n DARK WORDS\": locke,\"Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours.\"",
