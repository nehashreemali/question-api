And may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead. In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name. King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Long may he reign!\"\nALL: Long may he reign!\nSEPTON: Special day.\nPYCELLE: Your Grace.\nVARYS: Your Grace.\nMAN: Your Grace.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Your Grace.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: There he is.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Long may he reign.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Long may he reign.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: He sits the throne like he was born to it.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: No, he wasn't.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You still mourn for Joffrey?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: He was my husband. My king.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He would have been your nightmare.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Your Grace, I feel...\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: No.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He will need help... if he's going to rule well.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: He has you.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Oh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.\nJORAH MORMONT: King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.\nBARRISTAN: And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace.\"\nDAARIO: The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Who told you to take the Navy?\nDAARIO: No one.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So why did you do it?\nDAARIO: I heard you liked ships.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How many ships?\nBARRISTAN: Ninety-three, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How many men can they carry?\nBARRISTAN: Ninety-three hundred, not counting sailors.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Would that be enough to take King's Landing?\nJORAH MORMONT: The Lannisters have more.\nBARRISTAN: They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. Eight thousand Unsullied, two thousand Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.\nBARRISTAN: The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.\nJORAH MORMONT: The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself \"\"His Imperial Majesty.\"\"\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Please leave me. Not you, Jorah.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.\nJORAH MORMONT: You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?\nJORAH MORMONT: You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.\nJORAH MORMONT: What, then?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I will do what queens do. I will rule.\nPETYR BAELISH: Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.\nSANSA STARK: But how would they know?\nPETYR BAELISH: You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.\nSANSA STARK: Is this the only way into the Eyrie?\nPETYR BAELISH: The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand.\"\nKNIGHT: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?\nPETYR BAELISH: Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne.\"\nKNIGHT: Stand to.\nKNIGHT: Stand to!\nKNIGHT: Welcome back, Lord Baelish.\"\nROBIN: Uncle Petyr!\nPETYR BAELISH: My lord.\nPETYR BAELISH: Oh. I have brought you a gift.\nLYSA: Lord Baelish.\nPETYR BAELISH: My lady.\nROBIN: Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.\nLYSA: A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.\nSANSA STARK: It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al...\"\nLYSA: Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me.\"\nLYSA: My flesh and blood.\nSANSA STARK: It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.\"\nLYSA: You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.\nSANSA STARK: Of course. I understand.\nLYSA: No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.\nSANSA STARK: I would never say a thing.\nLYSA: The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.\nROBIN: Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.\nSANSA STARK: They did, and my father's.\"\nROBIN: They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.\"\nSANSA STARK: Make him fly?\nROBIN: Through the Moon Door.\nLYSA: And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.\"\nSANSA STARK: They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.\nLYSA: I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?\nSANSA STARK: No. We never...\nLYSA: Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin.\"\nSANSA STARK: It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.\"\nLYSA: Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Go. We'll speak soon.\nLYSA: What took you so long?\nPETYR BAELISH: Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.\"\nLYSA: She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.\nLYSA: Let's get married tonight.\nPETYR BAELISH: Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?\nLYSA: There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I do think that we could wait until...\nLYSA: I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Like it was yesterday.\nLYSA: What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husbando s wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters...\"\nPETYR BAELISH: The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.\nPETYR BAELISH: Tonight it is, then.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.\"\nLYSA: I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: When will the wedding take place in your mind?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: A fortnight?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That seems reasonable.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: And your wedding to Loras?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Shortly after Tommen's.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Shortly?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A fortnight.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We had that in common.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Then whom can we trust?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Ourselves alone.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Robert wasn't particularly rich.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Haven't a clue.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Go on, your best guess.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Pounds, tons, ounces?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That can't be.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Then how do we pay for anything?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How much?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: A tremendous amount.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?\nARYA STARK: Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Would you shut up?\nARYA STARK: I can't sleep until I say the names.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: The names of every fucking person in Westeros?\nARYA STARK: Only the ones I'm going to kill.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.\"\nARYA STARK: If he were here right now, what would you do?\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.\"\nARYA STARK: I'm almost done. Only one name left.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Go on.\nARYA STARK: The Hound.\nSANSA STARK: Thank you.\nLYSA: Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?\"\nSANSA STARK: Really?\nLYSA: Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.\"\nSANSA STARK: My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.\"\nLYSA: This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?\"\nSANSA STARK: They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.\nLYSA: Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder.\"\nSANSA STARK: Yes. I'm very lucky.\nLYSA: He feels responsible for you.\nSANSA STARK: Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.\"\nLYSA: Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?\nSANSA STARK: Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much.\"\nLYSA: Loved your mother.\nSANSA STARK: No.\nLYSA: That's what you wanted to say.\nSANSA STARK: He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.\"\nLYSA: Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?\"\nLYSA: He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?\nSANSA STARK: No, never.\"\nLYSA: Are you pregnant?\nSANSA STARK: What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-\"\nLYSA: I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?\nSANSA STARK: Aunt Lysa, no, I-\"\nLYSA: Your young, pretty body.\"\nSANSA STARK: Nothing. I'm a virgin.\nLYSA: Don't lie to me.\nSANSA STARK: You're hurting me.\nLYSA: I'll know if you lie.\nSANSA STARK: I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever.\"\nLYSA: Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.\nBRIENNE: Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?\nPODRICK: Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters.\"\nBRIENNE: Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.\"\nPODRICK: That's a long way off.\nBRIENNE: Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point.\"\nPODRICK: Never, my lady. I'm your squire.\"\nBRIENNE: I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.\nPODRICK: All knights have squires, my lady.\"\nBRIENNE: I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.\"\nPODRICK: I swore an oath, my lady.\"\nBRIENNE: I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.\nPODRICK: I know.\nBRIENNE: What do you think will happen if you leave?\nPODRICK: They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: The hell you doing?\nARYA STARK: Practicing.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: What, ways to die?\"\nARYA STARK: No one's going to kill me.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: They will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight.\nARYA STARK: It's not fighting. It's water dancing.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?\nARYA STARK: The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Braavos. Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are.\"\nARYA STARK: What do you know about anything?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.\nARYA STARK: It was not.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Was? He dead?\nARYA STARK: Yes.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: How?\nARYA STARK: He was killed.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Who by?\nARYA STARK: Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?\nARYA STARK: He was outnumbered.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.\nARYA STARK: Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Your friendo s dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Your Grace.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?\nOBERYN MARTELL: A poem, actually.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: May I show you the gardens?\nOBERYN MARTELL: I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No, you couldn't.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I didn't realize you were a poet.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Not a very good one.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: For your paramour?\nOBERYN MARTELL: For one of my daughters.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You have several, don't you?\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Eight.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Eight? Eight daughters?\nOBERYN MARTELL: The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Beautiful name.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Which joke is that?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?\nOBERYN MARTELL: We can avenge them.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Yes, we can avenge them.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I know he did.\nOBERYN MARTELL: We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.\nOBERYN MARTELL: You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Anything at all.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.\nOBERYN MARTELL: I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.\nPODRICK: Oh, no, no, no.\"\nPODRICK: No, no, no, no.\"\nPODRICK: Hells. Gods.\nBRIENNE: Did you remove the skin?\nPODRICK: No, my lady.\"\nBRIENNE: Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?\nBRIENNE: Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?\nPODRICK: No, my lady. That was the cooks.\"\nBRIENNE: What are you doing?\nPODRICK: I'm helping you with your armor.\nBRIENNE: I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.\"\nBRIENNE: What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?\nPODRICK: I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.\nBRIENNE: Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?\"\nPODRICK: I killed a man.\nBRIENNE: Who?\nPODRICK: A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.\nBRIENNE: How did you kill a Kingsguard?\nPODRICK: I pushed a spear through the back of his head.\nBRIENNE: Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.\nRAST: Hey. Hey, get up. Get up.\"\nMAN: That's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing.\"\nMAN: Aye. What we need is a girl there.\nMAN: I've got to have a piss.\nMAN: Now keep quiet.\nMEERA: You need water.\nJOJEN: It doesn't matter.\nMEERA: Of course it matters.\nJOJEN: You mustn't let anything stop you.\nBRAN STARK: They already have stopped me.\nJOJEN: No. You're not here. You're far from here.\nMEERA: What does that mean?\nJOJEN: At the hill. A great weirwood tree.\nBRAN STARK: You've seen it, too.\"\nJOJEN: Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it.\"\nBRAN STARK: We will.\nJOJEN: This... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.\nMEERA: How... will we know the end?\nJOJEN: You'll know.\nLOCKE: Brothers.\nDOLOROUS EDD: You do move quiet.\nJON SNOW: How many?\nLOCKE: Eleven men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.\nGRENN: Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.\nLOCKE: Have you seen what I can do with a knife?\nGRENN: Not yet.\nLOCKE: There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.\nJON SNOW: Why?\nLOCKE: They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better.\"\nGRENN: New moon tonight.\nJON SNOW: Get some rest. We move at sundown.\nKARL TANNER: I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.\nKARL TANNER: Get her up.\nBRAN STARK: Stop.\nJOJEN: Stop. What are you doing?\nHODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.\nBRAN STARK: Stop. Stop!\nHODOR: Hodor. Hodor.\nBRAN STARK: Stop! Please.\nHODOR: Hodor.\nBRAN STARK: Please, get off her!\"\nBRAN STARK: Please! Please, leave her alone!\"\nBRAN STARK: Please, stop. Stop.\"\nBRAN STARK: What are you doing? Leave her alone!\nBRAN STARK: No!\nKARL TANNER: Shh. Shh, shh, shh.\"\nKARL: Shh.\nKARL TANNER: You've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?\"\nJOJEN: If you let my sister go, I can help you.\"\nKARL TANNER: You can help me?\nJOJEN: I can.\nKARL TANNER: And how you gonna do that?\nJOJEN: I have the sight. I can see things.\nKARL TANNER: That's very helpful.\nJOJEN: Things that haven't happened yet.\nKARL TANNER: What a fine thing. A fine thing.\nKARL TANNER: Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?\nJOJEN: No.\nKARL TANNER: Don't close your eyes.\nJOJEN: I saw you die tonight. I saw your body burn. I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.\nMAN: To arms!\nRAST: They're here, the Night's Watch.\"\nLOCKE: Rescue party is here, lads. Lady.\"\nBRAN STARK: Is Jon with you?\nLOCKE: Aye. I'll take you to him.\nLOCKE: You're Brandon Stark?\nLOCKE: The little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy.\"\nBRONN: Jon! Jon!\nLOCKE: Keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats. Starting with the idiot. Do you hear? Do you hear?\nHODOR: Hodor! Hodor! Hodor. Hodor.\nHODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.\nBRAN STARK: Hodor. Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose.\"\nBRAN STARK: Hodor, get his knife. Hodor. Cut me loose, Hodor.\"\nBRAN STARK: Jojen and Meera, free them. Go!\"\nBRAN STARK: Jon.\nBRAN STARK: Jon!\nJOJEN: If he sees you, he won't let you go north.\"\nBRAN STARK: He's my brother.\nJOJEN: And wants to protect you. He'll take you back to Castle Black.\nJOJEN: You have to decide. Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?\nBRAN STARK: Hodor.\nBRAN STARK: We need to free Summer. And we need to go.\nKARL TANNER: Lord Snow. Are you bringing me back for trial?\nKARL TANNER: We had a good thing here. We were free men. You'll never be free. You'll never know what that's like.\nKARL TANNER: You learn how to fight in a castle?\nKARL TANNER: Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?\"\nKARL TANNER: How to fight with honor?\nKARL TANNER: You know what's wrong with honor?\nKARL TANNER: You.\nJON SNOW: Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.\nJON SNOW: We lost four brothers?\nDOLOROUD EDD: Five.\nGRENN: What the seven hells could do that to a man?\nJON SNOW: I count ten dead mutineers.\nGRENN: Locke said there were eleven of them.\nDOLROUS EDD: Where's Rast?\nMAN: Here's another.\nGRENN: Jon.\nJON SNOW: Where in seven hells?
