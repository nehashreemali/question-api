You don't know?\nJON SNOW: When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad.\"\nYGRITTE: You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?\nJON SNOW: Most of the time, yes.\"\nYGRITTE: How do the men holding the banners fight?\nJON SNOW: They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.\"\nYGRITTE: And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?\"\nJON SNOW: Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.\nYGRITTE: So what good are they?\nJON SNOW: They help the men march.\nYGRITTE: How?\nJON SNOW: Well, it's- it's the rhythm.\"\nYGRITTE: Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.\"\nJON SNOW: No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.\"\nYGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.\"\nORELL: She's right, you don't.\"\nJON SNOW: I know you cut me loose on the Wall.\nORELL: Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are.\"\nJON SNOW: And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?\nORELL: People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her.\"\nBRYNDEN: That rain will cost us another day.\nROBB STARK: Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.\nCATELYN STARK: Lord Walder is prickly by nature.\nBRYNDEN: Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.\nCATELYN STARK: Yes, and that is why-\"\nBRYNDEN: I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.\"\nTALISA: I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits.\"\nCATELYN STARK: Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.\nEDMURE: He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.\nCATELYN STARK: He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.\nROBB STARK: Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.\nROBB STARK: If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again.\"\nTALISA: Attack. Attack.\nROBB STARK: Who are you writing?\nTALISA: My mother.\nROBB STARK: Is that Valyrian?\nTALISA: Gaaa.\nROBB STARK: Gaaa? Say hello for me.\nTALISA: Rytsas.\nROBB STARK: Ritsas.\nTALISA: That was close enough.\nROBB STARK: Does she know her daughter's a queen?\nTALISA: Not yet.\nROBB STARK: That will be a surprise, I expect.\"\nTALISA: Many surprises for her.\nROBB STARK: How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?\nTALISA: Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?\nROBB STARK: I will.\nTALISA: I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.\nROBB STARK: What, now? Are you certain?\"\nTALISA: Are you angry with me?\nROBB STARK: Angry? You're my queen.\nTALISA: And I have your little prince or princess inside me.\nROBB STARK: Maybe one of each.\nTALISA: Don't get greedy.\nTALISA: Can you leave the war for one night?\nROBB STARK: I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.\nTORMUND: Most men fuck like dogs.\nTORMUND: No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. Come on! Hey, come on.\"\nORELL: You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?\"\nYGRITTE: No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks.\"\nORELL: I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls.\"\nYGRITTE: What, you're jealous?\"\nORELL: Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.\nYGRITTE: And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.\nORELL: You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?\nORELL: Cause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?\nYGRITTE: Don't touch me.\nORELL: You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.\nSANSA STARK: Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Come on. Come walk with me.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother.\"\nMARGAERY TYRELL: You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.\nSANSA STARK: How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?\nSANSA STARK: No.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Has he been kind to you?\nSANSA STARK: He's tried.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: You don't want him, though.\"\nSANSA STARK: He's a Lannister.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?\"\nSANSA STARK: I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?\"\nSANSA STARK: My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-\nMARGAERY TYRELL: If it's the pain you're worried about-\nSANSA STARK: I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar.\"\nSANSA STARK: He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.\"\nSANSA STARK: And that's a good thing?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice.\"\nSANSA STARK: How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?\nMARGAERY TYRELL: Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: She's a child.\nBRONN: She's a foot taller than you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: A tall child.\nBRONN: What's the youngest you've ever had?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Not that young.\nBRONN: How much older?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Older.\nBRONN: You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Shae isn't going to like it.\nBRONN: Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I should never have told you about that.\nBRONN: You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.\nBRONN: You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.\nBRONN: You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Your Grace.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Grandfather.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You wanted to speak to me?\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Of course.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I have, yes.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: May I ask why?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: We could arrange to have you carried.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Where did you hear about this?\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Is it true?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Apparently so.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: Don't you think we ought to do something about it?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: And the biggest was the size of a carriage.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.\"\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: But I haven't been counseled.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You are being counseled at this very moment.\nJOFFREY LANNISTER: I should be consulted about such things.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Yunkai. The Yellow City.\nBARRISTAN: The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.\nJORAH MORMONT: We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How many slaves are there in Yunkai?\nJORAH MORMONT: Two hundred thousand if not more.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor.\"\nMISSANDEI: Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace.\"\nMISSANDEI: Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You may approach. Sit.\nMISSANDEI: Will the noble lord take refreshment?\nRADZAL MO ERAZ: Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.\nRADZAL MO ERAZ: If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.\"\nRADZAL MO ERAZ: The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.\nRADZAL MO ERAZ: There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My ship?\nRADZAL MO ERAZ: Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And what do you ask in return?\nRADZAL MO ERAZ: All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I have a gift for you as well. Your life.\nRADZAL MO ERAZ: My life?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy.\"\nRADZAL MO ERAZ: You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.\"\nRADZAL MO ERAZ: You swore me safe conduct.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother.\"\nRADZAL MO ERAZ: Take the gold.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out.\"\nBARRISTAN: The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?\nJORAH MORMONT: I don't know.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Find out.\nSHAE: Chains?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.\nSHAE: Golden chains.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You could buy a ship with these.\nSHAE: Do I need a ship?\nTYRION LANNISTER: What?\nSHAE: Am I going somewhere?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Of course you're not going anywhere.\nSHAE: So, am I invited to your wedding?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.\nSHAE: No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.\nTYRION LANNISTER: That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire.\"\nSHAE: Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't have a choice. My father-\nSHAE: Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.\nTYRION LANNISTER: What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.\nSHAE: And I'm Shae the funny whore.\nTYRION LANNISTER: My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.\nSHAE: While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I swear to you it will not be like that.\nSHAE: No? What will it be like?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for.\"\nSHAE: Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Listen. Listen to me, my lady.\"\nSHAE: I'm not your lady.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You are. You'll always be my lady.\nSHAE: I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: What happened?\nMELISANDRE: Wildfire. I should have been here.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started.\"\nMELISANDRE: Do you miss it?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: King's Landing?\nMELISANDRE: Your father's house.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Never had a father. Never wanted one.\nMELISANDRE: Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.\nMELISANDRE: Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up.\"\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I was born in Flea Bottom.\nMELISANDRE: Your blood is noble.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: Are you saying my father, he was some lord or-\"\nMELISANDRE: There. Your father's house.\nGENDRY BARATHEON: I'm just a bastard.\nMELISANDRE: The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood.\"\nBERIC: Come sit by the fire, child.\"\nTHOROS: Not talking, eh? That's a first.\"\nARYA STARK: I don't talk to traitors.\nBERIC: I didn't like giving up the boy.\nARYA STARK: But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.\nBERIC: The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey.\"\nARYA STARK: He's not my one true god.\nBERIC: No? Who's yours?\nARYA STARK: Death.\nANGUY: Spotted a Lannister raiding party.\nBERIC: How many?\nANGUY: No more than twenty.\nBERIC: How far?\nANGUY: Less than a day's ride south.\nTHOROS: What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?\"\nMEN: Yeah!\nARYA STARK: But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.\nTHOROS: It will still be west of here two days from now.\nARYA STARK: You swore.\nBERIC: To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first.\"\nARYA STARK: Why? So you can steal their gold?\nBERIC: I swear to you, this isn't-\"\nARYA STARK: I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all.\"\nBERIC: One day you'll understand, but now-\"\nBERIC: Anguy, bring her back.\"\nMAN: Come back, girl!\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good.\"\nBRIENNE: I thought you were gone.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Tomorrow.\nBRIENNE: Have they told you what they plan to do with me?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.\nBRIENNE: With Locke?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I owe you a debt.\nBRIENNE: When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.\nBRIENNE: Good-bye, Ser Jaime.\"\nQYBURN: Here. Let me.\nQYBURN: It will take time.\nROOSE BOLTON: Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain.\nJAIME LANNISTER: My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.\nROOSE BOLTON: You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.\nLOCKE: Safe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her.\"\nMYRANDA: Shh.\nVIOLET: Gentle, my lord. Gentle.\"\nVIOLET: Shh, shh, shh. Myranda knows what she's doing. Let her. She trained as a septa, only she had other urges.\"\nMYRANDA: So did the septons, only they lied about it.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Where is he?\nVIOLET: Who, my lord?\"\nMYRANDA: There's no one here but you, me, and Violet.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Please.\nVIOLET: Don't you want us to see it?\nMYRANDA: Oh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: He sent you.\nMYRANDA: Who sent us?\nVIOLET: We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.\"\nMYRANDA: We heard so much about it.\nVIOLET: Oh! There it is.\nVIOLET: Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.\nMYRANDA: Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Help me. If he comes back-\nVIOLET: We need to make him feel better.\nMYRANDA: And how can we make him feel better?\nVIOLET: I have an idea.\nVIOLET: Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls.\"\nMYRANDA: Maybe he doesn't know how we are.\nMYRANDA: Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy.\"\nVIOLET: As good as they say?\nMYRANDA: Mmm.\nVIOLET: And why should you get all the fun?\nMYRANDA: What? You like her better?\nVIOLET: Plenty there for both of us.\nMYRANDA: I was here first.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: But I was getting jealous.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.\nTHEON GREYJOY: No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!\"\nJON SNOW: You're gonna scare it off.\nYGRITTE: I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.\nJON SNOW: It's too far away.\nYGRITTE: Is that a palace?\nJON SNOW: It's a windmill.\nYGRITTE: Windmill. Who built it? Some king?\nJON SNOW: Just the men who used to live here.\nYGRITTE: They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.\"\nJON SNOW: Winterfell has towers three times that size.\nYGRITTE: I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.\nJON SNOW: If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.\"\nYGRITTE: What's swooning?\nJON SNOW: Fainting.\nYGRITTE: What's fainting?\nJON SNOW: When a girl sees blood and collapses.\nYGRITTE: Why would a girl see blood and collapse?\nJON SNOW: Well not all girls are like you.\nYGRITTE: Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow.\"\nYGRITTE: My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.\nJON SNOW: I'd like to see you in a silk dress.\nYGRITTE: Would you?\nJON SNOW: So I could tear it off you.\nYGRITTE: Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye.\"\nJON SNOW: Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.\nYGRITTE: Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.\nJON SNOW: Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that.\"\nYGRITTE: You know nothing-\nJON SNOW: Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed.\"\nYGRITTE: And how do you know that?\nJON SNOW: Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same.\"\nYGRITTE: Mance is different.\nJON SNOW: You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.\nYGRITTE: You don't know that.\nJON SNOW: I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you.\"\nYGRITTE: All of us.\nYGRITTE: You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live.\"\nJON SNOW: Yes, first we'll live.\"\nOSHA: What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?\nHODOR: Hodor.\nJOJEN: That's where we are.\nOSHA: What are you telling him?\nBRAN STARK: It's all right, Osha.\"\nOSHA: It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.\nMEERA: Leave him alone.\nOSHA: He can speak for himself.\nJOJEN: I don't fill his head with anything.\nOSHA: So what do you talk about?\nJOJEN: What's happening to him and what that means.\nOSHA: Go on, then. Tell us what it means.\"\nJOJEN: It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.\nOSHA: I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.\nJOJEN: We're not going to Castle Black.\nOSHA: What did you say?\nJOJEN: I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.\nOSHA: Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me.\"\nBRAN STARK: The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.\nOSHA: You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.\nBRAN STARK: What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?\nOSHA: Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.\"\nBRAN STARK: You don't understand. You don't know.\nOSHA: You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long.\"\nOSHA: I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.\"\nQYBURN: How is the pain, my lord?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?\nQYBURN: Well, we've stymied the corruption.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man.\"\nQYBURN: All the good it's done me.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.\nQYBURN: Faint praise, my lord.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?\nQYBURN: No, my lord. That's not my weakness.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: What is?\nQYBURN: Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You performed experiments on living men.\nQYBURN: On dying men.\nJAIME LANNISTER: With their permission?\nQYBURN: My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.\"\nQYBURN: How many men have you killed, my lord?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I don't know.\nQYBURN: Fifty? A hundred?\nQYBURN: Countless.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Countless has a nice ring to it.\nQYBURN: And how many lives have you saved?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?\nQYBURN: A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.\nJAIME LANNISTER: A fair offer.\nQYBURN: A fair offer. Locke won't take it.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Why not?\nQYBURN: He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.\nQYBURN: He feels he's being cheated.\nJAIME LANNISTER: They'd be fools to kill her.\nQYBURN: These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: We have to return to Harrenhal.\nSTEELSHANKS WALTON: Why?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I've left something behind.\nSTEELSHANKS WALTON: Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.\nJAIME LANNISTER: And what are those orders?\nSTEELSHANKS WALTON: To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You think you'll get a reward.\nSTEELSHANKS WALTON: I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-\nJAIME LANNISTER: You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.\"\nSTEELSHANKS WALTON: I had nothing-\nJAIME LANNISTER: Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Whoa.\nSTEELSHANKS WALTON: Eyes open, lads.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Be quiet.\nMEN: The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there / All black and brown and covered in hair / He smelled that girl in the summer air / The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!\"\nMAN: Don't spare her. Don't spare her!\nLOCKE: Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: A wooden sword?\nLOCKE: I thought you'd gone.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You gave her a wooden sword.\nLOCKE: We've only got one bear.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there.\"\nLOCKE: All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.\nLOCKE: This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.\nBRIENNE: Ah!\nJAIME LANNISTER: Get behind me.\nBRIENNE: I will not.\nLOCKE: What the fuck are you doing to my bear?\nSTEELSHANKS WALTON: Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Pull her up.\nBRIENNE: Hold my legs.\nBRIENNE: Pull him up!\nLOCKE: The bitch stays.\nJAIME LANNISTER: We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.\nLOCKE: She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.\nJAIME LANNISTER: What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires.\"",
