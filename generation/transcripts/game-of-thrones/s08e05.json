That's their job.\nVARYS: What have I told you, Martha?\"\nMARTHA: The greater the risk, the greater the reward.\"\nVARYS: Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.\nVARYS: The Northern armies?\nJON SNOW: Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?\nVARYS: She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.\"\nJON SNOW: She shouldn't be alone.\nVARYS: You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.\nJON SNOW: Aren't you worried for her?\nVARYS: I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.\"\nJON SNOW: We're not much for riddles where I'm from.\nVARYS: We both know what she's about to do.\nJON SNOW: That's her decision to make. She is our queen.\nVARYS: Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.\"\nJON SNOW: What do you want?\nVARYS: All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.\nJON SNOW: I don't want it. I never have.\nVARYS: I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true\"\nJON SNOW: She is my queen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your Grace?\nTYRION LANNISTER: There's something you need to know.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Someone has betrayed me.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Jon Snow.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Varys.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He knows the truth about Jon.\nTYRION LANNISTER: He does.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And Varys?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It was a mistake.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?\nTYRION LANNISTER: She trusts me.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: But it doesn't matter now.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No. It doesn't matter now.\nTYRION LANNISTER: It was me.\nVARYS: I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ...\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: sentence you to die. Dracarys.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What did I say would happen if you told your sister?\nJON SNOW: I don't want it, and that's what I told him.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.\nJON SNOW: I love you. And you will always be my queen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Is that all I am to you? Your queen?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: All right, then.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Let it be fear.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?\nTYRION LANNISTER: What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I beg you, my queen-\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.\nGUARD: Let them pass.\nGUARD: Through the gate.\nGUARD: Get going.\nDAVOS: The rearguard should be here by daybreak.\nTYRION LANNISTER: She wants to attack now.\nJON SNOW: Daybreak at the earliest.\nSOLDIER: Careful with that.\nSOLDIER: My lord.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?\"\nDAVOS: I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?\"\nSOLDIER: He's always better when he's got some food in him.\nSOLDIER: Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?\nSOLDIER: Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.\nSOLDIER: Ay up. Where you going?\nARYA STARK: I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow.\"\nSOLDIER: I need to go talk to my captain.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Go ahead, talk to him.\"\nSOLDIER: Where's he going?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I drink to eat the skull keeper.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I want to eat the skull keeper.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I want to see the ...\nUNSULLIED: We speak the common tongue.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.\nUNSULLIED: We have orders to guard the prisoner.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ordered by whom? The queen herself?\nUNSULLIED: No.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: How did they find you?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Did you consider taking it off?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Cersei once called me \"\"the stupidest Lannister.\"\"\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: And you're going back to her, to die with her.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You've underestimated her before.\nTYRION LANNISTER: She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Difficult to do from here.\nJAIME LANNISTER: When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.\nJAIME LANNISTER: The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The city will fall tomorrow.\nJAIME LANNISTER: She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Why?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-\nTYRION LANNISTER: There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Swear to me.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You have my word.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'll try.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Your queen will execute you for this.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You would have.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.\nSOLDIER: Eyes on the horizon!\nSOLDIER: Load the scorpion!\nSOLDIER: Archers, close up!\"\nMAN: Come on!\nSOLDIER: Up to the espringal!\nSOLDIER: To the back of it!\nSOLDIER: Archers, line up!\"\nWOMAN: This way! Come on!\nSOLDIER: Clear the streets now!\nWOMAN: No!\nMAN: In, now. And you, come on.\"\nSOLDIER: Inside, now!\"\nMAN: Quickly.\nSOLDIER: Yes. Follow down there. They're here. Get to the Red Keep.\nFATHER: My son!\nSOLDIER: Get inside!\nMAN: Just ahead of you, I can see it!\"\nSOLDIER: All right, move it!\"\nWOMAN: Come on!\nSOLDIER: Keep moving!\nSOLDIER: Keep going!\nSOLDIER: Quickly!\nSOLDIER: All the way!\nFATHER: Hold your mother's hand!\nSOLDIER: Make way for the Golden Company!\nSOLDIER: Close the gate!\nTYRION LANNISTER: If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men.\"\nSOLDIER: Move along now, lads.\"\nSOLDIER: That's it.\nSOLDIER: Go on, move it.\"\nSOLDIER: Come on, move, move. Faster, faster. Come on, move it. Keep going.\"\nSOLDIER: Keep moving.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Move.\nSOLDIER: Stay with him.\nMAN: Hold on.\nWOMAN: Hold my hand.\nNORA: Get behind there.\nSOLDIER: Close the gate! No more through!\nNORA: No!\nVICKY: No! Mommy!\nNORA: Vicky! Please!\nVICKY: No, please, sir!\"\nMAN: Open the gate!\nMAN: Open it!\nSOLDIER: Get back!\nNORA: Look, try that one! Go! Go!\"\nSOLDIER: The gates are locked now!\nWOMAN: Open!\nWOMAN: Open the gate! Soldier! Soldier!\nMAN: Please open the gate!\nSOLDIER: Go back to your homes!\nSOLDIER: Stay back! It's closed!\nJAIME LANNISTER: Soldier!\nSOLDIER: Move away! Stop!\nMAN: Let us in!\nMAN: We're not leaving!\nSOLDIER: Turn!\nEURON GREYJOY: Turn it around! Turn it around!\nEURON GREYJOY: Get back! Back!\nEURON GREYJOY: Fire!\nSOLDIER: I can see her! Ready!\nSOLDIER: Move!\nSOLDIER: Fire!\nSOLDIER: Reload!\nSOLDIER: Faster! Hurry!\nMAN: Go!\nMAN: Run!\nQYBURN: Your Grace.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: All we need is one good shot.\nQYBURN: The scorpions have all been destroyed, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay. Euron killed one of her dragons. He can kill another.\nQYBURN: Your Grace, the Iron Fleet is burning. The gates have been breached. The Golden Company-\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Our men will fight harder than sellswords ever could. They will defend their queen to the last man.\nQYBURN: Yes, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Red Keep has never fallen. It won't fall today.\nMAN: No, no, no!\"\nJON SNOW: Move, move!\"\nMAN: Run. Run! Come on!\nSOLDIER: Ring the bells!\nMAN: The bells!\nMAN: Ring the bells!\nWOMAN: Ring the bells!\nMAN: Ring the bloody bells!\nWOMAN: Tell the queen to ring the bells.\nMAN: Ring the bells! Ring the bell!\nWOMAN: This way.\nSOLDIER: Ring the bell!\nMAN: Ring the bell!\nMAN: Ring them!\nMAN: Help us!\nMAN: In the name of the-\nMAN: Queen! We're surrounded!\nMAN: Now! Come on!\nMAN: Hurry up!\nJON SNOW: No! Get back! Get back!\nJON SNOW: Stay! Stay!\nDAVOS: Quickly. Quickly.\nJON SNOW: Stop!\nSOLDIER: Get off me! Get off, bitch!\"\nWOMAN: No, get off! Help! Help! No!\"\nLANNISTER SOLDIER: Go! Go!\nJON SNOW: Find somewhere to hide.\nMAN: My God!\nEURON GREYJOY: The Kingslayer.\nJAIME LANNISTER: We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.\nEURON GREYJOY: Listen. That's the sound of a city dying. It's over.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Well, maybe for you.\"\nEURON GREYJOY: If you kill another king before you die they'll sing about you forever.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You're no king.\nEURON GREYJOY: Oh, but I am. And I fucked the queen. If I win, I'll bring your head to Cersei so you can kiss her one last time.\"\nQYBURN: Your Grace, it isn't safe here any longer.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Red Keep is the safest place in the city.\nQYBURN: The Unsullied have breached the gates of the Red Keep.\nQYBURN: Maegor's Holdfast would be a better place to wait out the storm.\nEURON GREYJOY: You fought well for a cripple.\nEURON GREYJOY: Another king for you.\nEURON GREYJOY: But I got you!\nEURON GREYJOY: I got you!\nEURON GREYJOY: I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Go home, girl. The fire will get her, or one of the Dothraki.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Or maybe that dragon will eat her. It doesn't matter. She's dead. And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.\nARYA STARK: I'm going to kill her.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You think you wanted revenge a long time? I've been after it all my life.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: It's all I care about. And look at me.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Look at me! You wanna be like me?\nSANDOR CLEGANE: You come with me, you die here.\"\nARYA STARK: Sandor.\nARYA STARK: Thank you.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Your Grace.\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Hello, big brother.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Ser Gregor, stay by my side.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Ser Gregor, I command you.\"\nQYBURN: Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.\"\nSANDOR CLEGANE: Yeah, that's you. That's what you've always been.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're hurt.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It doesn't matter.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're bleeding.\nOWEN: Alanna! Alanna! Have you seen my wife?
