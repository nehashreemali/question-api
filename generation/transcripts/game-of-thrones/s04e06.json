  "transcript": "DAVOS: Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: We've been here since midday.\nDAVOS: Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--\"\nTYCHO: Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit.\"\nTYCHO: What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?\"\nDAVOS: This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.\"\nTYCHO: The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.\nTYCHO: Yes, we have heard this story.\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: It's not a story. It's the truth.\nTYCHO: The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: Gold you loaned him.\nTYCHO: And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: More than any man living.\nTYCHO: Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like \"\"usurper\"\" and \"\"madman\"\" and \"\"blood right.\"\" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: 4,000.\"\nTYCHO: And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.\"\nDAVOS: 32.\nTYCHO: And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?\"\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: None.\nTYCHO: You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.\nDAVOS: My lord.\nTYCHO: I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.\"\nDAVOS: Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another. {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers.\"\nDAVOS: This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.\"\nTYCHO: The war is over.\nDAVOS: As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?\"\nTYCHO: Ser Davos...\nDAVOS: Humor me.\nTYCHO: Tywin Lannister.\nDAVOS: How old is Tywin Lannister?\nTYCHO: 67.\nSTANNIS BARATHEON: 67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?\"\nTYCHO: That is a problem for another time.\nDAVOS: Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.\"\nSALLADOR: The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, \"\"Bring me my red shirt.\"\" The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, \"\"Two pirate ships!\"\" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, \"\"Bring me my red shirt!\"\"\"\nSALLADOR: After the battle, the first mate asks, \"\"Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?\"\" The captain replies, \"\"So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed.\"\" The next morning the lookout screams, \"\"10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!\"\" The crew goes silent.\"\nSALLADOR: They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command. Calm as ever, the captain bellows...\"\nWOMEN: Bring me my brown pants!\nDAVOS: You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?\nSALLADOR: Davos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.\nDAVOS: Only half rotted.\nSALLADOR: Join us, my friend. Join us. This is Lhara. And this is--\"\nLHARA: I am Lhara.\nSALLADOR: She's an artist, this one, truly.\"\nDAVOS: No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.\"\nSALLADOR: We?\nDAVOS: You, me-- we.\"\nSALLADOR: Once I thought this man loved me. Now I know he despises me. He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold--\nDAVOS: You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.\nDAVOS: There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.\nSALLADOR: You're not my friend, my friend.\"\nDAVOS: I'll see you at sunrise.\nYARA GREYJOY: I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home. On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.\"\nMYRANDA: Yes!\nYARA GREYJOY: They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Your prince. Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you.\"\nMYRANDA: Yes! Yes!\nYARA GREYJOY: As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing.\"\nFIRST MATE: Go left.\nYARA GREYJOY: Theon Greyjoy.\nBOLTON GUARD: I don't know--\nYARA GREYJOY: I'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.\nBOLTON GUARD: He's not in the dungeons.\nBOLTON GUARD: Last cage on the right.\nYARA GREYJOY: Thank you.\nYARA GREYJOY: This way!\nYARA GREYJOY: We're going home.\nTHEON GREYJOY: No!\nYARA GREYJOY: It's all right. It's me, Yara.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: You can't trick me. Tell him. Tell him you couldn't trick me.\nYARA GREYJOY: I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Not Theon! Reek! Reek! My name is Reek!\nFIRST MATE: They're here.\nYARA GREYJOY: If they catch us in here, we're trapped. Help me with him.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: No, you can't! You can't!\"\nYARA GREYJOY: You're Theon Greyjoy.\nTHEON GREYJOY: No, I don't believe her! I know who I am! I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek! Good Reek! I've always been Reek!\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: This is turning into a lovely evening.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!\nYARA GREYJOY: Aah! Theon!\nYARA GREYJOY: Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: You've got bigger balls than he ever did. But with those big balls of yours...\nRAMSAY BOLTON: how fast can you run?\nYARA GREYJOY: Make for the ship, now.\"\nIRONBORN: But your brother.\nYARA GREYJOY: My brother is dead.\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I have a treat for you. A reward.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Reward?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Yes, Reek. Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away. And you didn't let them. You remained loyal.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: I-- I didn't want them to take me. I was so scared. I didn't want them--\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Yes, yes, Reek. It's a bath. For you. Remove those rags. Now.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: The britches, too, Reek. Take them off.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Do you love me, Reek?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Yes, of course, my lord.\"\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Good. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: But how can--\nRAMSAY BOLTON: I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Pretend to be who?\nRAMSAY BOLTON: Theon Greyjoy.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend.\"\nMISSANDEI: The Queen says you may approach and speak.\nMISSANDEI: He is a goatherd. He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I thank him for his prayers.\nMISSANDEI: It was your dragons, he says. They came this morning for his flock.\"\nMISSANDEI: He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: but I will see he is paid their value three times over.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Send the next one in.\nMANSERVANT: The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.\nHIZDAHR: Queen Daenerys. Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I thank you.\nHIZDAHR: Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Then it is my honor to receive you.\nHIZDAHR: My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks. This pyramid included.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him.\"\nHIZDAHR: You have, Your Grace. You crucified him. I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your father crucified innocent children.\nHIZDAHR: My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that.\"\nHIZDAHR: What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And what traditions do you speak of?\nHIZDAHR: The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.\"\nHIZDAHR: Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?\nHIZDAHR: Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.\"\nHIZDAHR: Thank you, my queen.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: How many more?\nMISSANDEI: There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: 212?\nOBERYN MARTELL: These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?\"\nMACE: Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--\nMACE: Lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I--\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?\nVARYS: Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: A coward and a traitor.\nVARYS: My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase \"\"fuck the king\"\" was uttered.\"\nPYCELLE: Disgraceful.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?\nVARYS: 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Make it 100. What else?\nVARYS: More whispers from the east, my lord.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The Targaryen girl?\nVARYS: Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Conquered with what?\nVARYS: She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace.\"\nPYCELLE: Mormont is spying on her for us.\nVARYS: No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.\nVARYS: A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.\nPYCELLE: How, my lord? By force?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?\"\nVARYS: Most certainly, my Lord Hand.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper.\"\nVARYS: Prince Oberyn.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Lord Varys...\nVARYS: Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.\nOBERYN MARTELL: And yet everyone does.\nVARYS: You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?\nOBERYN MARTELL: Five years.\nVARYS: May I ask why?\nOBERYN MARTELL: Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.\nVARYS: Most of us aren't princes.\nOBERYN MARTELL: You are from Essos. Where? Lys?\nVARYS: I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.\nOBERYN MARTELL: I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?\nVARYS: It's a long story.\nOBERYN MARTELL: One you don't like telling people.\nVARYS: People I trust.\nOBERYN MARTELL: My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but...\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: You did like boys before?\nOBERYN MARTELL: Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.\nVARYS: Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: What then?\nVARYS: Nothing.\nOBERYN MARTELL: Everybody is interested in something.\nVARYS: Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Such as?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Let me guess, I've been pardoned.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Really?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Father's orders.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.\"\nMAN: Kingslayer!\nTOMMEN LANNISTER: I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: No.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Not that I know of.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: How would you say he died, then?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Choked on his pigeon pie.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: So you would blame the bakers?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The crown may call its first witness.\nMERYN TRANT: Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Silence.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.\"\nPYCELLE: Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance... blind eye--\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store.\"\nPYCELLE: Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: By whom?\nPYCELLE: By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?\"\nPYCELLE: Without question.\nPYCELLE: This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?\nPYELLE: It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.\nMACE: Your own brother said this to you?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops.\"\nOBERYN MARTELL: Tyrion said, \"\"And you will know the debt is paid.\"\" What debt?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.\"\nMACE: Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?\nVARYS: I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, \"\"Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.\"\"\"\nMACE: And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?\nVARYS: Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You're excused, Lord Varys.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Father, may I ask the witness one question?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: One.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?\"\nVARYS: Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: We will adjourn for now.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Toll the bells in an hour's time.\nGUARD: Clear the court!\nJAIME LANNISTER: You'd condemn your own son to death?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.\nJAIME LANNISTER: This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I know nothing of the sort.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You've always hated Tyrion.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: He killed his king.\nJAIME LANNISTER: As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: It won't be murder. It'll be justice.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Justice?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: He'll be executed.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: No, he'll be punished accordingly.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: I'm well aware of your oath.\nJAIME LANNISTER: What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?\nTYWIN LANNISTER: What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?\nJAIME LANNISTER: It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Done.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You have my word.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: And you have mine.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Not going well, is it?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You're going to be found guilty.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, you think so?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.\nTYRION LANNISTER: How do you know?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Do you trust me?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: The crown may call its next witness.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: State your name.\nSHAE: Shae.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?\nSHAE: I swear it.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Do you know this man?\nSHAE: Yes. Tyrion Lannister.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: How do you know him?\nSHAE: I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?\nSHAE: I know that he's guilty.\nSHAE: He and Sansa planned it together.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Silence! Continue.\nSHAE: She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord.\"\nSHAE: He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.\nOBERYN MARTELL: How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?\nSHAE: I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.\nMACE: I beg your pardon? You said you were his...\nSHAE: His whore.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: How did you come to be in his service?\nSHAE: He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. \"\"You belong to me now,\"\" he said. \"\"I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world.\"\"\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Silence. Silence!\nOBERYN MARTELL: And did you?\nSHAE: Did I what?\nOBERYN MARTELL: Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.\nSHAE: I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him \"\"my lion,\"\" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, \"\"I am yours and you are mine.\"\"\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Shae. Please don't.\nSHAE: I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You wish to confess?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You admit you poisoned the king?\nTYRION LANNISTER: No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: You are not on trial for being a dwarf.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.\"\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Have you nothing to say in your defense?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.\nTYWIN LANNISTER: Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.",
