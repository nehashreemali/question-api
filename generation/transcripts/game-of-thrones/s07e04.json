He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.\nBRONN: You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.\nBRONN: There is no more High Septon.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No, there isn't, is there?\"\nBRONN: There is still the question of my prize.\nJAIME LANNISTER: is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.\nJAIME LANNISTER: That's a lot of money I just gave you.\nBRONN: It's not a castle.\nBRONN: turns and points to Highgarden.\nBRONN: How about that one? It's available.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You don't want Highgarden.\nBRONN: I beg to differ.\nJAIME LANNISTER: We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down.\"\nBRONN: Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.\nJAIME LANNISTER: They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.\nBRONN: Right. Just not to me.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you.\"\nBRONN: Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Stranger things have happened.\nBRONN: Like what?\nRANDYLL: TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback. RANDYLL addresses JAIME.\nRANDYLL: The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: The current harvest?\nDICKON: We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.\nJAIME LANNISTER: looks over to BRONN.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?\"\nBRONN: I'm not much for shoveling weight.\nJAIME LANNISTER: No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that.\"\nRANDYLL: My Lord.\nDICKON: My Lord.\nRANDYLL: DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance. Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.\nTYCHO: I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You're too kind, My Lord.\"\nTYCHO: I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.\nTYCHO: Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We must devise a way to raise their spirits.\nTYCHO: Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.\nTYCHO: I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.\"\nTYCHO: I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.\nTYCHO: Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives.\"\nBRAN STARK: is sitting in a wheelchair. PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him. BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN. It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.\nPETYR BAELISH: This is for you.\nPETYR BAELISH: flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.\nPETYR BAELISH: The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off.\"\nBRAN STARK: reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.\"\nBRAN STARK: Do you know who this belonged to?\nPETYR BAELISH: No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.\nPETYR BAELISH: To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --\"\nBRAN STARK: Chaos is a ladder.\nBRAN STARK: is staring at BAELISH. BAELISH stops speaking. The door opens and Meera appears.\nPETYR BAELISH: I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: stands up to leave.\nBRAN STARK: I'm not Lord Stark.\nPETYR BAELISH: bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.\nMEERA: notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.\nMEERA: What's that?\nBRAN STARK: Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.\nMEERA: It's a very good idea.\nBRAN STARK: You're leaving?\nMEERA: I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family. And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now. You don't need me anymore.\"\nBRAN STARK: No, I don't.\"\nMEERA: That's all you've got to say?\nBRAN STARK: Thank you.\nMEERA: Thank you?\nBRAN STARK: For helping me.\nMEERA: My brother died for you. Hodor and Summer died for you. I almost died for you. Bran!\nBRAN STARK: I'm not really, not anymore. I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now.\"\nMEERA: begins to cry.\nMEERA: You died in that cave.\nMEERA: turns to walk out the door. She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out.\"\nARYA STARK: approaches the main gate on foot. Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm. There's indistinct chatter. One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.\nMAN: Hey, oh. Where are you going?\"\nARYA STARK: In there. I live here.\nMAN: Fuck off.\nARYA STARK: I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.\nMAN: Arya Stark is dead.\nARYA STARK: Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.\nMAN: There's no Rodrick here.\nMAN: Maester's name is Wolkan.\nARYA STARK: Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother\"\nMAN: He's a thousand miles away.\nMAN: It's cold. We're busy. So, you know, best fuck off.\"\nMAN: Mm-hmm.\nARYA STARK: If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?\nMAN: The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark.\"\nARYA STARK: Which Lady Stark?\nMAN: You tell us. You're the one impersonating her sister.\nARYA STARK: Tell Sansa her sister is home.\nMAN: Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us. So for the last time, fuck off.\"\nMAN: 1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp.\nARYA STARK: I'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away...\"\nARYA STARK: keeps glancing at the men. They look uneasy. They bring her inside of the gate. They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.\nMAN: You sit there. Right there. Don't move.\nMAN: Go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.\nARYA STARK: is glancing around Winterfell. Men are working building tools and cutting wood. ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall. The two guards are still arguing.\nMAN: You tell her.\nMAN: I'm not.\nMAN: Because if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.\nMAN: We told her to wait. We were standing right next to her.\nSANSA STARK: sighs.\nMAN: When we turned around she had gone, My Lady. She was nothing. Some winter town girl.\"\nMAN: She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.\nMAN: Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady. We'll find her.\"\nSANSA STARK: You don't have to. I know where she is.\nARYA STARK: is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword. ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching. SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.\nARYA STARK: Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?\nSANSA STARK: hesitates for a moment.\nSANSA STARK: Yes.\nSANSA STARK: begins smiling then walking towards ARYA. SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.\nSANSA STARK: You shouldn't have run from the guards.\nARYA STARK: I didn't run. You need better guards.\nSANSA STARK: smirks at ARYA.\nARYA STARK: It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?\"\nSANSA STARK: He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.\"\nARYA STARK: That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.\nSANSA STARK: Everyone who knew his face is dead.\nARYA STARK: We're not.\nARYA STARK: turns to face SANSA.\nARYA STARK: They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?\nSANSA STARK: I wish I had.\nARYA STARK: Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.\nSANSA STARK: Your list?\nARYA STARK: Of people I'm going to kill.\nSANSA STARK: begins to laugh. ARYA joins her.\nSANSA STARK: How did you get back to Winterfell?\nARYA STARK: It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.\nSANSA STARK: Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.\nARYA STARK: Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet.\"\nSANSA STARK: No, they're not.\"\nSANSA STARK: Arya, Bran's home too.\"\nARYA STARK: smiles and looks at SANSA. SANSA doesn't smile back. The smile fades from ARYA's face.\nBRAN STARK: is sitting next to the Weirwood tree. SANSA and ARYA approach. BRAN turns to look at them. BRAN begins speaking to ARYA.\nBRAN STARK: You came home.\nARYA STARK: steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN. SANSA smiles in the background. ARYA lets go and steps back.\nBRAN STARK: I saw you at the crossroads.\nARYA STARK: You saw me?\nBRAN STARK: I see quite a lot now.\nSANSA STARK: Bran has visions.\nBRAN STARK: I thought you might go to King's Landing.\nARYA STARK: So did I.\nSANSA STARK: Why would you go back there?\nBRAN STARK: Cersei is on her list of names.\nARYA STARK: stares at BRAN. ARYA turns to look at SANSA.\nSANSA STARK: Who else is on your list?\nARYA STARK: Most of them are dead already.\nBRAN STARK: produces the Valyrian dagger that BAELISH gave him and unsheathes it.\nARYA STARK: Where did you get this?\nBRAN STARK: Littlefinger gave it to me.\nARYA STARK: Littlefinger, he's here?\"\nARYA STARK: turns to look at SANSA.\nSANSA STARK: He's declared for House Stark.\nSANSA STARK: steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.\nSANSA STARK: Why would he give you a dagger?\nBRAN STARK: He thought I'd want it.\nSANSA STARK: Why?\nBRAN STARK: Because it was meant to kill me.\nSANSA STARK: The cutthroat after your fall?\nARYA STARK: Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?\nBRAN STARK: Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.\nSANSA STARK: He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.\nBRAN STARK: It doesn't matter.\nSANSA STARK: What do you mean it doesn't matter?\nBRAN STARK: I don't want it.\nBRAN STARK: holds the knife out to ARYA. ARYA looks at BRAN.\nARYA STARK: Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.\nBRAN STARK: It's wasted on a cripple.\nARYA STARK: looks down at the dagger. She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.\nARYA STARK: is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs. BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.\nPODRICK: Catelyn Stark would be proud. You kept your vow.\nBRIENNE: I did next to nothing.\nPODRICK: You're too hard on yourself, My Lady.\"\nBRIENNE: I'm not a --\nBRIENNE: pauses for a moment.\nBRIENNE: Thank you, Podrick.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.\nMISSANDEI: Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Soon. They will come back to me.\nMISSANDEI: He better.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What happened?\nMISSANDEI: begins smirking.\nMISSANDEI: Many things.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Many things?\nJON SNOW: Your Grace.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: It's all right.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.\nJON SNOW: I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.\nJON SNOW: leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.\nJON SNOW: So this is it, all we'll ever need.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.\nJON SNOW: There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.\"\nJON SNOW: and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.\nJON SNOW: The Children of the Forest made these.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: When?\nJON SNOW: A very long time ago.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.\nJON SNOW: No.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.\nJON SNOW: They were here together the Children and the First Men.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Doing what? Fighting each other?\nJON SNOW: takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive.\"\nJON SNOW: and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.\nJON SNOW: Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: turns to look at JON.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?\nJON SNOW: No, I don't think I can.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: steps forward closer to JON.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.\nJON SNOW: My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?\nJON SNOW: and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What is it?\nTYRION LANNISTER: We took Casterly Rock.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: That's very good to hear.\nTYRION LANNISTER: and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Isn't it?\nDAVOS: You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We still have the largest army.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: If I've underestimated our enemies --\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Enough with the clever plans.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: turns back and looks at TYRION.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We've discussed this.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?\nTYRION LANNISTER: A smart one.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: looks over to JON SNOW.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What do you think I should do?\nJON SNOW: I would never presume to --\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm at war. I'm losing.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: begins walking close to JON.\nJON SNOW: looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.\nJON SNOW: I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.\nJON SNOW: glances back towards the dragons.\nJON SNOW: But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.\nBRIENNE: and PODRICK are sparring. BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.\nBRIENNE: Don't lunge.\nPODRICK: pushes himself back up and picks up his sword. PODRICK attacks again. Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again.\nBRIENNE: Don't go where your enemy leads you.\nARYA STARK: is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard. She begins to approach Brienne.\nBRIENNE: Up.\nBRIENNE: begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows. BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.\nBRIENNE: And don't --\nARYA STARK: Don't fight someone like her in the first place.\nPODRICK: stands up and retrieves his sword. ARYA walks closer to speak to BRIENNE.\nBRIENNE: Nice sword. Very nice dagger.\nARYA STARK: looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it. She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers. BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.\nSANSA STARK: and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.\nSANSA STARK: If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --\nSANSA STARK: sees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her.\nARYA STARK: It's been awhile since I've trained.\nBRIENNE: I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady.\"\nARYA STARK: He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.\nBRIENNE: chuckles.\nARYA STARK: You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?\"\nBRIENNE: nods her head in agreement.\nBRIENNE: Move aside, Podrick.\"\nPODRICK: backs away. ARYA draws her sword, Needle.\"\nBRIENNE: You can't use that, My Lady. It's too small.\"\nARYA STARK: I won't cut you. Don't worry.\nBRIENNE: smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.\nBRIENNE: I'll try not to.\nBRIENNE: strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack. BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling. ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword. BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA. BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony. ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back. BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt. BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground. ARYA quickly gets back to her feet. BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground. BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck. BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling.\"\nBRIENNE: Who taught you to do that?\nARYA STARK: No one.\nARYA STARK: collects her sword. SANSA walks away. BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him. BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.\nJON SNOW: and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.\nDAVOS: What do you think of her?\nJON SNOW: Who?\nDAVOS: sighs\nDAVOS: I believe you know of whom I speak.\nJON SNOW: I think she has a good heart.\nDAVOS: A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.\nJON SNOW: There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?\"\nDAVOS: Fewer.\nJON SNOW: What?\nDAVOS: and JON near the end of the path. MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.\nDAVOS: Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth.\"\nMISSANDEI: turns to looks at DAVOS and JON.\nMISSANDEI: Ser Davos, Lord Snow.\"\nDAVOS: King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?\"\nJON SNOW: It doesn't matter.\nMISSANDEI: Forgive me, but may I ask a question?\"\nJON SNOW: Of course.\nMISSANDEI: Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?\"\nJON SNOW: I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.\nDAVOS: Is the custom different in Naarth?\nMISSANDEI: We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.\nDAVOS: The sounds liberating.\nJON SNOW: Why did you leave your homeland?\nMISSANDEI: I was stolen away by slavers.\nJON SNOW: I'm sorry.\nDAVOS: If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?\"\nMISSANDEI: She bought me from my master and set me free.\nDAVOS: That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?\"\nMISSANDEI: I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.\nJON SNOW: And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --\nMISSANDEI: Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.\nJON SNOW: You believe that?\nMISSANDEI: I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose.\"\nDAVOS: You'll forgive me if I switch sides.\nJON SNOW: notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.\nJON SNOW: Is that a Greyjoy ship?\nTHEON GREYJOY: GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf. They pull the boat onto the sand. JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them. JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other. JON steps forward towards THEON.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Jon. I didn't know you were here.\nTHEON GREYJOY: steps closer to JON.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Sansa, is she all right?\"\nJON SNOW: grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.\nJON SNOW: What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.\nJON SNOW: releases THEON.\nDAVOS: We heard your uncle attacked your fleet. We thought you were dead.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I should be.\nDAVOS: Your sister?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.\nJON SNOW: The queen is gone.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Where did she go?\nRANDYLL: All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Good.\nRANDYLL: We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall. If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: We are stretched a bit thin.\nRANDYLL: With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Let's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.\nRANDYLL: is clearly disappointed. He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers. JAIME and BRONN exchange glances, then follow RANDYLL. BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks. DICKON TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation.\"\nDICKON: Ser Jaime.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Rickon.\nDICKON: Dickon.\nBRONN: openly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?\nDICKON: nods his head in agreement.\nJAIME LANNISTER: And?\nDICKON: It was glorious.\nBRONN: Come on. Your father's not here.\nDICKON: All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell. I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.\nJAIME LANNISTER: They didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.\nDICKON: I didn't expect it to smell like that.\nBRONN: Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?\nJAIME LANNISTER: looks over at BRONN\nBRONN: Well, I learned it when I was 5.\"\nBRONN: pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance.\nJAIME LANNISTER: What?\nBRONN: Listen.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Spears and shields! Spears and shields!\nJAIME LANNISTER: Spears and shields!\nBRONN: In line now!\nRANDYLL: is riding across the battlefield yelling orders to men.\nRANDYLL: Come on, lads. Not those wagons. Fall in line. Fall in line.\"\nDICKON: draws his sword. RANDYLL is yelling orders to the men.\nRANDYLL: Spears armed!\nBRONN: Get back to King's Landing.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I'm not abandoning my army.\nBRONN: You're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: We can hold them off.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Dracarys!\nDROGON: breathes fire into the first line of Lannister soldiers. The men burst into flames and start screaming. DICKON looks on in shock. A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down. JAIME attempts to issue orders to the men.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Hold the line!\nJAIME LANNISTER: Archers! Archers with me!\nJAIME LANNISTER: Knock!\nARCHERS: Knock! Draw!\nDROGON: loops around and is making a pass on JAIME and the archers. DAENERYS and DROGON are diving at the group of men.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Loose!\nJAIME LANNISTER: Qyburn's scorpion is over there.\nBRONN: Go get it then.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I can't shoot with one hand.\nJAIME LANNISTER: holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.\nBRONN: hesitates for a moment. He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow. JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Come on!\nBRONN: Where are you?\nTYRION LANNISTER: walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.\nGUARD: Your people can't fight.\nTYRION LANNISTER: is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Take cover!\nDROGON: spits flames into the Lannister position. The men standing there are reduced to standing ash. The wind blows them away. BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow. He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire. A bolt sails past DROGON and misses. BRONN reloads the machine. DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow. BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.\nBRONN: Come on you fucker.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Flee, you idiot!\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: looks at DAENERYS and readies himself. He spurs his horse onward.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Come on, boy. Come on!\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position. JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water. TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You fucking idiot.\nJAIME LANNISTER: is getting close. DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand. DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames. BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire. Their horses are instantly burned to death. JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water. JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight.\"\nEND: CREDITS",
