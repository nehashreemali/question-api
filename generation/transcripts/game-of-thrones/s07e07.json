Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Gold?\nBRONN: I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Family.\nBRONN: Not without a cock, you don't.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.\nBRONN: Yet, your brother--\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden.\"\nBRONN: I think we're about to be the downtrodden.\nMAN: Archers, stand tall!\"\nMAN: Cover that wall!\nJON SNOW: How many people live here?\nTYRION LANNISTER: A million, give or take.\"\nJON SNOW: That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?\nTYRION LANNISTER: There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Why isn't she with them?\nQYBURN: I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And the rest of them?\nQYBURN: They're on their way to the dragon pit now.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Including our brother.\nQYBURN: Yes, Your Grace.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king.\"\nMISSANDEI: Why did they build it?\nJORAH MORMONT: Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.\"\nDAVOS: Maybe it still is.\nBRONN: Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did.\"\nBRONN: I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.\nTYRION LANNISTER: A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.\nPODRICK: I never thought I'd see you again, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Supporting the enemy, no less.\"\nPODRICK: Hard to blame you.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Cersei will anyway.\nPODRICK: I'm glad you're alive.\nBRONN: Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.\nSOLDIER: What's in there?\nSANDOR: Fuck off.\nBRIENNE: I thought you were dead.\nSANDOR: Not yet. You came pretty close.\nBRIENNE: I was only trying to protect her.\nSANDOR: You and me both.\nBRIENNE: She's alive. Arya.\nSANDOR: Where?\nBRIENNE: Winterfell.\nSANDOR: Who's protecting her if you're here?\nBRIENNE: The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.\nSANDOR: It won't be me.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.\nPODRICK: It is, my lord.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.\"\nBRONN: I'm sure your new queen--\nTYRION LANNISTER: You've been thinking about our new queen.\nVARYS: And that would be double what now, exactly?\"\nBRONN: Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk.\"\nBRONN: I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: It's good to see you again.\nBRONN: Yeah, you, too.\"\nSANDOR: Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.\"\nBRONN: Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?\"\nSANDOR: I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?\nTYRION LANNISTER: You might.\nSANDOR: And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.\nTYRION LANNISTER: And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.\nSANDOR: Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Where is she?\nTYRION LANNISTER: She'll be here soon.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Didn't travel with you?\nTYRION LANNISTER: No.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: We've been here for some time.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: My apologies.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We are all facing a unique\nEURON GREYJOY: Theon! I have your sister\nTYRION LANNISTER: I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.\nEURON GREYJOY: Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.\nEURON GREYJOY: We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Perhaps you ought to sit down.\nEURON GREYJOY: Why?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Sit down or leave.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: We all know that will never happen.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Then why are we here?\nJON SNOW: This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.\nJON SNOW: This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Yes. That's all.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The word of a would-be usurper.\nTYRION LANNISTER: There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.\nJON SNOW: We can destroy them by burning them.\nJON SNOW: And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.\"\nJON SNOW: There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.\nJAIME LANNISTER: How many?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: A hundred thousand, at least.\"\nEURON GREYJOY: Can they swim?\nJON SNOW: No.\nEURON GREYJOY: Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What are you talking about?\nEURON GREYJOY: I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.\"\nEURON GREYJOY: I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: In return, the King\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Just the King\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son.\"\nJON SNOW: I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.\nBRIENNE: Ser Jaime.\nJAIME LANNISTER: It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.\nBRIENNE: We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.\"\nBRIENNE: Oh, fuck loyalty!\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Fuck loyalty?\nBRIENNE: This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.\nJAIME LANNISTER: And tell her what?\nDAVOS: I wish you hadn't done that.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing.\"\nJON SNOW: I know!\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen\nJON SNOW: I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.\nTYRION LANNISTER: That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.\nDAVOS: Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I didn't come all this way to have my Hand\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.\nJON SNOW: I did this. I should go.\nTYRION LANNISTER: She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.\nTYRION LANNISTER: You spoke with her?\nJAIME LANNISTER: At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I didn't know about that.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Cersei, I didn't know.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: the destruction of this family.\nTYRION LANNISTER: I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You killed our father\nTYRION LANNISTER: After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I have never been more sorry about anything.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I will not hear it, not from you.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I will not hear it!\nTYRION LANNISTER: All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I will not\nTYRION LANNISTER: I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.\nTYRION LANNISTER: If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Mm, not like this.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Yes.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Why?\nTYRION LANNISTER: Because I think she will make the world a better place.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You said she'd destroy King's Landing.\nTYRION LANNISTER: She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: You're pregnant.\nJON SNOW: No one is less happy about this than I am.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else.\"\nJON SNOW: You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I can't have children.\nJON SNOW: Who told you that?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The witch who murdered my husband.\nJON SNOW: Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different.\"\nJON SNOW: So, what now?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.\nJON SNOW: It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.\nSANSA STARK: No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.\nSANSA STARK: This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.\nSANSA STARK: What does that have to do with anything?\nPETYR BAELISH: Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.\nSANSA STARK: You think he wants to marry her?\nPETYR BAELISH: An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King.\"\nSANSA STARK: Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?\"\nSANSA STARK: Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?\nPETYR BAELISH: Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men.\"\nSANSA STARK: They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?\nPETYR BAELISH: She's your sister\nSANSA STARK: She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.\nPETYR BAELISH: Why did she come to Winterfell?\nSANSA STARK: To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.\nPETYR BAELISH: Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?\nSANSA STARK: To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.\nPETYR BAELISH: And after she murders you, what does she become?\"\nSANSA STARK: Lady\nJON SNOW: If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror.\"\nJON SNOW: It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Jon.\nTHEON GREYJOY: Can I speak with you?\nJON SNOW: All right.\nTHEON GREYJOY: What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.\"\nJON SNOW: We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.\nTHEON GREYJOY: You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step.\"\nJON SNOW: It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Not compared to me, you haven't.\"\nJON SNOW: No. Not compared to you.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.\nJON SNOW: Our father was more of a father.\nTHEON GREYJOY: He was.\nJON SNOW: And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.\nTHEON GREYJOY: I did.\nJON SNOW: But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.\nTHEON GREYJOY: But the things I've done.\nJON SNOW: It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. She needs me now.\"\nJON SNOW: So, why are you still talking to me?\"\nHARRAG: Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.\nHARRAG: Your sister--\nTHEON GREYJOY: She's not dead.\nHARRAG: She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: She's our queen\nHARRAG: She's your sister\nTHEON GREYJOY: I did. I ran from my uncle.\nHARRAG: So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves.\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: We're done with all that.\nHARRAG: Who says we are?\nTHEON GREYJOY: Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free.\"\nHARRAG: Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best.\"\nMAN: He needs to shut his mouth.\nMAN: Hey!\nMAN: Oh, yes!\"\nMAN: That's more like it.\nHARRAG: Stay down or I'll kill you!\nHARRAG: I said stay down or I'll kill you!\nTHEON GREYJOY: Not for me. For Yara!\nMEN: Yara!\nSANSA STARK: Have my sister\nARYA STARK: Are you sure you want to do this?\nSANSA STARK: It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.\nARYA STARK: And what does honor demand?\nSANSA STARK: That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.\nARYA STARK: All right, then. Get on with it.\"\nSANSA STARK: You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?\nARYA STARK: My sister asked you a question.\nPETYR BAELISH: Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused.\"\nSANSA STARK: Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I did it to protect you.\nSANSA STARK: You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Whatever your aunt\nSANSA STARK: You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.\nPETYR BAELISH: I know of no such letter.\nSANSA STARK: You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.\nPETYR BAELISH: I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.\nBRAN STARK: You held a knife to his throat.\nBRAN STARK: You said, \"\"I did warn you not the trust me.\"\"\"\nARYA STARK: You told our mother\nPETYR BAELISH: Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you.\"\nSANSA STARK: Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?\nPETYR BAELISH: If we could speak alone, I can explain everything.\"\nSANSA STARK: Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Sansa, please.\"\nSANSA STARK: I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.\nPETYR BAELISH: I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.\nJOHN ROYCE: I think not.\nPETYR BAELISH: Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.\"\nSANSA STARK: And yet, you betrayed her.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I loved you. More than anyone.\nSANSA STARK: And yet, you betrayed me.\"\nSANSA STARK: When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: Sansa! I--\nJAIME LANNISTER: Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.\nMAN: It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.\nJAIME LANNISTER: We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Ser Jaime.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Your Grace.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: My lords, I need a moment with my brother.\"\nMEN: Your Grace.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What are you doing?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Preparing the expedition north.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--\nJAIME LANNISTER: I made a promise.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Our child will rule Westeros.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Our child will never be born if the dead come south.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: And then what?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And then we rule.\nJAIME LANNISTER: When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: How many dragons did you see at the pit?\nJAIME LANNISTER: Two.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: What happened to the third?\nJAIME LANNISTER: For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You shouldo ve listened more when Father--\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?\nJAIME LANNISTER: You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I didn't conspire with him.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.\nJAIME LANNISTER: I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: And that will be treason.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Treason?\nCERSEI LANNISTER: Disobeying your queen\nJAIME LANNISTER: Doesn't matter what I'd call it.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: I told you no one walks away from me.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: There's one more yet to come.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Give the order, then.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I don't believe you.\nBRAN STARK: Come in.\nBRAN STARK: Samwell Tarly.\nSAM: I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.\nBRAN STARK: I remember everything.\nBRAN STARK: You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.\nSAM: Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?\"\nBRAN STARK: I became the Three-Eyed Raven.\nSAM: Oh! I don't know what that means.\nBRAN STARK: I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?\nSAM: Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him.\"\nBRAN STARK: He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this in a vision?\nSAM: Oh.\nBRAN STARK: He needs to know the truth.\nSAM: The truth about what?\nBRAN STARK: About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt.\nSAM: It's not.\nBRAN STARK: Dornish bastards are named Sand.\nSAM: At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.\"\nBRAN STARK: Are you certain?\nSAM: It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?\nRHAEGAR: Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.\"\nLYANNA: Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.\"\nBRAN STARK: Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt.\nBRAN STARK: He loved her. And she loved him.\nBRAN STARK: And Jon - Jon's real name.\nLYANNA: His name is Aegon.\nBRAN STARK: He's never been a bastard.\nBRANS VOICE: He needs to know. We need to tell him.\nARYA STARK: Are you all right?\nSANSA STARK: It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.\"\nARYA STARK: You did the right thing.\nSANSA STARK: You did it.\nARYA STARK: I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.\nSANSA STARK: Does that bother you?\nARYA STARK: I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.\nSANSA STARK: You would have. You're the strongest person I know.\nARYA STARK: I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.\nSANSA STARK: Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying.\"\nARYA STARK: In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another.\"\nSANSA STARK: Father\nARYA STARK: I miss him.\nSANSA STARK: Me, too.\"\nBERIC: It's a long way down.\nTORMUND: Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.\nMAN: I can see movement. Watch, on the tree line!\"\nMAN: What is it?\nTORMUND: Come on! Run! Run!",
