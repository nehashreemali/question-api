All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I wish I could remember it.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Good.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Not so many lions.\nVARYS: Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now...\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No.\nTYRION LANNISTER: We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I never properly thanked you for that.\nVARYS: They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?\"\nVARYS: I did.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And then you served the man who overthrew him?\nVARYS: I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.\nVARYS: Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?\"\nVARYS: Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.\nVARYS: Which you turned to your advantage.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Who gave the order to kill me?\nVARYS: King Robert.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Who hired the assassins?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?\nVARYS: Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: To keep yourself alive.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?\"\nVARYS: The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.\"\nVARYS: I swear it, my queen.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.\"\nVARYS: I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.\nGREY WORM: Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.\"\nMELISANDRE: Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?\nMELISANDRE: I am called Melisandre.\nVARYS: She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?\"\nMELISANDRE: No, it didn't.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?\"\nMELISANDRE: Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: What does your Lord expect from me?\nMELISANDRE: The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.\nMISSANDEI: Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: No, but I like it better.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: And you believe this prophecy refers to me?\nMELISANDRE: Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: You know him?\nTYRION LANNISTER: I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.\nVARYS: And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?\"\nMELISANDRE: As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: He sounds like quite a man.\nMELISANDRE: Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.\nSANSA STARK: Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.\nJON SNOW: Read the last bit.\nSANSA STARK: All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.\"\" What does that mean?\"\nJON SNOW: It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?\nSANSA STARK: Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. \"\"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny.\"\"\"\nDAVOS: Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming.\"\nJON SNOW: What?\nDAVOS: Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?\"\nSANSA STARK: You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?\nDAVOS: No, too dangerous.\"\nJON SNOW: But?\nDAVOS: But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her.\"\nRANDYLL: She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace. The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms. How do you propose to stop them?\"\nQYBURN: We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Lord Tarley.\nRANDYLL: Ser, Jaime. I believe you know my son.\"\nDICKON: Ser, Jaime.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Rickon, isn't it?\"\nDICKON: Dickon.\nJAIME LANNISTER: That's it.\nJAIME LANNISTER: Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.\nRANDYLL: If my queen summons me, I answer the call. And I've heard what she does to those that defy her.\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: Do you ride for Hornhill today?\nRANDYLL: I have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.\nJAIME LANNISTER: And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --\nRANDYLL: It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.\nRANDYLL: Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.\nJAIME LANNISTER: You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley.\"\nRANDYLL: I've known Olenna since I was a child.\nJAIME LANNISTER: She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?\"\nJAIME LANNISTER: When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.\nMARWYN: The infection has spread too far. You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.\nJORAH MORMONT: How long?\nMARWYN: It will be years before it kills you. It could be 10, could be 20.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: But how long 'till...\nMARWYN: Your mind? Six months, maybe fewer.\"\nSAM TARLY: Pardon, Archmaester. I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black. She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured. Isn't there some way --\"\nMARWYN: Does this look like a baby to you?\nSAM TARLY: No.\nMARWYN: Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?\nMARWYN: Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.\nMARWYN: This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser. Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men. As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day. How you choose to spend that time is up to you.\"\nMARWYN: Come, Samwell.\"\nSAM TARLY: Should we send word to your family, Ser...\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Jorah. Jorah Mormont.\nSAM TARLY: Mormont?\nJORAH MORMONT: There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.\nQYBURN: Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?\"\nCERSEI LANNISTER: No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room.\"\nQYBURN: Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.\nCERSEI LANNISTER: They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.\nQYBURN: Balerion the Dread. The beast that Aegon rode across the sea. Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel. Powerful, but not invincible.\"\nQYBURN: Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen. If they can be wounded, they can be killed.\"\nQYBURN: The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace. If you'd kindly pull that lever.\"\nYARA GREYJOY: If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.\"\nELLARIA: It's called war. You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.\nELLARIA: She was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I am not here to be queen of the ashes.\nOLENNA TYRELL: That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing.\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.\nTYRION LANNISTER: But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi.\"\nELLIA: And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?\nTYRION LANNISTER: You are.\nTYRION LANNISTER: Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.\nTYRION LANNISTER: The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.\nOLENNA TYRELL: So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?\"\nTYRION LANNISTER: The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Do I have your support?\nYARA GREYJOY: You have mine.\nELLIA: Dorne is with you, Your Grace.\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?\"\nDAENERYS TARGARYEN: I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.\nOLENNA TYRELL: Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?\"\nOLENNA TYRELL: He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon.\"\nGREY WORM: Enter.\nMISSANDEI: You leave tomorrow. Were you going to say goodbye?\nGREY WORM: I will see you when I return.\nMISSANDEI: But you don't know when that will be.\nGREY WORM: No one knows.\nMISSANDEI: I wish you good fortune.\nGREY WORM: Missandei --\nGREY WORM: It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.\nMISSANDEI: Why?\nGREY WORM: You know why.\nMISSANDEI: I don't.\nGREY WORM: You are my weakness.\nMISSANDEI: That's what I am? Your weakness?\nGREY WORM: When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always.\"\nMISSANDEI: I believe it.\nGREY WORM: Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth. Now I have fear.\nMISSANDEI: I do too.\nGREY WORM: No.\nMISSANDEI: I want to see you. Please.\nMARWYN: It might be useful. Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.\nSAM TARLY: Archmaester, I wanted to --\"\nMARWYN: And this one.\nMARWYN: Maester Faol was quite the opposite. A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.\nSAM TARLY: I wanted to ask you --\nMARWYN: If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research. If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style. I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread.\"\nMARWYN: What? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?\nSAM TARLY: Possibly something a bit more poetic?\nMARWYN: We're not poets, Tarley.\"\nSAM TARLY: Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.\"\nMARWYN: This is your moment. Use it wisely.\nSAM TARLY: I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.\nMARWYN: I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.\nSAM TARLY: Oh, you are?\"\nMARWYN: Yes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.\nSAM TARLY: Oh.\nMARWYN: The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.\nSAM TARLY: Hello.\nJORAH MORMONT: What are you doing?\nSAM TARLY: You're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.\nSAM TARLY: My name is Samwell Tarley. I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black. I knew your father. I was with him when he died. You're not dying today, Ser Jorah.\"\nSAM TARLY: Drink this.\nJORAH MORMONT: What is it?\nSAM TARLY: Rum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt.\"\nSAM TARLY: If you could take off your shirt.\nSAM TARLY: If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished.\"\nJORAH MORMONT: Have you ever done this before?\nSAM TARLY: No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --\"\nSAM TARLY: Shh, shhh. Again, I'm sorry. Please try not to scream.\"\nMAN: They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.\nMAN: Horse shit. Cersei is just trying to frighten us.\nMAN: If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple.\"\nMAN: As long as we get back there before they start.\nMAN: One more round. It's a long ride.\nHOT PIE: Ary!\nARYA STARK: Hello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?\"\nARYA STARK: Mmm. This is good.\nHOT PIE: You think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.\nARYA STARK: I didn't do that.\nHOT PIE: You've been making pies?\nARYA STARK: One or two.\nHOT PIE: I can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?\nARYA STARK: Big lady?\nHOT PIE: The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?\nARYA STARK: She found me.\nHOT PIE: What happened to you Ary?\nARYA STARK: You got any ale?\nHOT PIE: Where are you heading?\nARYA STARK: King's Landing.\nHOT PIE: Why?\nARYA STARK: I heard Cersei's queen now.\nHOT PIE: I heard she blew up the Great Sept. That must have been something to see. Boom.\nARYA STARK: Hmm.\nHOT PIE: I can't believe someone could do that.\nARYA STARK: Cersei would do that.\nHOT PIE: I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.\nARYA STARK: Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.\nHOT PIE: No. The Boltons are dead.\nARYA STARK: What?\nHOT PIE: Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards. He's King in the North now.\nARYA STARK: You're lying.\nHOT PIE: Why would I lie about that? He's your brother right?\nARYA STARK: Thanks for the pie.\nHOT PIE: Friends don't pay. I can't believe I thought you were a boy. You're pretty.\nARYA STARK: Thanks.\nARYA STARK: Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed.\"\nHOT PIE: No, I won't. I'm like you, Ary. I'm a survivor.\"\nJON SNOW: Come in.\nWOLKAN: A raven, My King, from the Citadel.\"\nJON SNOW: This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.\nJON SNOW: I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.\nJON SNOW: He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons.\"\nJON SNOW: Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.\nJON SNOW: We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.\"\nJON SNOW: But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone.\"\nSANSA STARK: Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.\nJON SNOW: I know that.\nSANSA STARK: She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap.\"\nJON SNOW: It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man.\"\nYOHN ROYCE: Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister.\"\nROBETT GLOVER: We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom.\"\nLYANNA MORMONT: Winter is here, Your Grace. We need the King in the North in the north.\"\nJON SNOW: You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it.\"\nSANSA STARK: Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.\nJON SNOW: Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.\nSANSA STARK: You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.\nJON SNOW: I'm leaving both in good hands.\nSANSA STARK: Whose?\nJON SNOW: Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours.\"\nPETYR BAELISH: I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.\nPETYR BAELISH: I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm.\"\nJON SNOW: You don't belong down here.\nPETYR BAELISH: Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.\nJON SNOW: I have nothing to say to you.\nPETYR BAELISH: Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother.\"\nJON SNOW: Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.\nARYA STARK: Nymeria?\nARYA STARK: Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me.\"\nARYA STARK: Come with me.\nARYA STARK: That's not you.\nNYMERIA: You can't have them all. It's not fair.\nOBARA: I'm oldest.\nTYENE: Momma will want Cersei for herself.\nOBARA: She's not my momma. You can have Cersei. I want The Mountain.\nNYMERIA: The Mountain killed father. He'll crush you with one hand.\nTYENE: Father got careless. That's what Momma says.\nOBARA: Will you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma.\"\nTYENE: Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.\nELLARIA: How can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?\"\nYARA GREYJOY: A few times. Never stayed long.\nELLARIA: A boy in every port?\nYARA GREYJOY: A boy, a girl. Depends on the port.\"\nELLARIA: Could we get some more?\nYARA GREYJOY: I thought it wasn't for you.\nELLARIA: I'm developing a taste for it.\nYARA GREYJOY: He's not your servant.\nTHEON GREYJOY: It's fine.\nELLARIA: So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.\"\nYARA GREYJOY: Once I kill my uncle.\nELLARIA: And what will you be, handsome?\"\nTHEON GREYJOY: Whatever my queen demands.\nYARA GREYJOY: He'll be my advisor, my protector.\"\nELLARIA: Oh, I see. Your protector.\"\nELLARIA: So if someone gets too close to you --\nYARA GREYJOY: He might have to intervene.\nELLARIA: hold that person back.\nYARA GREYJOY: Until they've made their intentions known.\nELLARIA: Why are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.\nYARA GREYJOY: Stay here.\nYARA GREYJOY: Euron.\nYARA GREYJOY: Your mother is below deck. Keep her safe.\nELLARIA: Kill us! Get it over with!\nEURON GREYJOY: Give your uncle a kiss.\nEURON GREYJOY: Theon!\nEURON GREYJOY: Ah, come on your cockless hound. I have her. Come and get her.\"\nEND: CREDITS",
