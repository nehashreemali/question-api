If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": bran stark,I don't want to go.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": theon greyjoy,\"Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": robb stark,Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": robb stark,\"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": maester luwin,He has no memory of that day.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,Curious.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": robb stark,Why are you here?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": bran stark,\"Kneel, Hodor.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"Do you like to ride, Bran?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": bran stark,\"Yes. Well, I mean I did like to.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": maester luwin,The boy has lost the use of his legs.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": bran stark,I'm not a cripple.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": bran stark,Will I really be able to ride?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": robb stark,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": robb stark,You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": theon greyjoy,\"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": theon greyjoy,He's not my master.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": theon greyjoy,She wasn't feeling well.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": theon greyjoy,My lady's whereabouts...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": theon greyjoy,Must have been a pretty sight.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": theon greyjoy,We were outnumbered 10 to one.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": theon greyjoy,\"Careful, Imp.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,\"Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grenn,What in seven hells is that?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": pyp,They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": alliser thorne,Tell them your name.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,\"Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": rast,Come to take the black pudding.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": alliser thorne,\"Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,\"I yield. Please, no more.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": alliser thorne,\"On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,Enough! He yielded.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": alliser thorne,\"Looks like the bastardo s in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,Are you sure you want to do this?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grenn,No. Yield yield yield! I yield.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": alliser thorne,We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": pyp,Well fought!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grenn,Piss off.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,Did he hurt you?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,I've had worse.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,\"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grenn,Why didn't you get up and fight?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,I wanted to. I just couldn't.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grenn,Why not?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,I'm a coward. My father always says so.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,The Wall's no place for cowards.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grenn,A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": pyp,You're too stupid to be a coward.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grenn,You're too stupid to be a...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": pyp,\"Quick now, before summer's over.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grenn,Come on here!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,\"I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,\"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,But if they did?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,\"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,And you know these men?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,\"I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,You sold slaves.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,Aye.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,Why?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,I had no money and an expensive wife.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,And where is she now?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,\"In another place, with another man.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,Your Grace?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,\"Yes, my dear?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,They call you the last dragon...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,They do.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,You have dragon's blood in your veins?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,It's entirely possible.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,\"The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,Really? Why dragons?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,\"They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,\"Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,I was not locked in. I have seen things.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,What have you seen?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,A pirate ship?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,A dragon.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,\"No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,What happened to the skulls?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,\"I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,That's very sad.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,\"Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,\"No, your Grace. To teach your sister.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,\"Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince...\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,What if I have a girl?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,\"Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,What if I only have girls?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,I wouldn't worry about that.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,\"Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,\"Yes, but it's highly unlikely.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,But what if?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,\"If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,And everyone would hate me.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,Nobody could ever hate you.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,Joffrey does.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,Please shut up about it.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,Aegon the Conqueror.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,And who built the Red Keep?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,Maegor the Cruel.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,And how many years did it take to build...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,\"My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,\"They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,The Mad King.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,Commonly known as the Mad King.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,Why were they killed?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,You should speak to your father about these matters.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,\"I don't want to speak to my father, ever.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,\"No, I won't.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": janos slynt,\"It's the Hando s tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": janos slynt,\"Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": varys,Dreadful.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": renly baratheon,\"If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": janos slynt,I need more men.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,I will?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": janos slynt,\"Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"The sooner this is over, the better.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": varys,\"The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Why?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,What did Jon want the night before he died?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,He came inquiring after a book.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,A book? What book?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,I'd like to read it.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Jon's death...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,Such a tragedy.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Did he say anything to you during his final hours?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"The seed is strong\"\"? What does that mean?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,What else could it be?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Poison.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Everybody knows that.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,I've taken enough of your time.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grand maester pycelle,\"No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor...\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Thank you. I'll find my own way out.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": arya stark,Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,It's a hard fall down these steps.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": arya stark,Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Cats? Syrio says…\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": arya stark,He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,He's right about that.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": arya stark,Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,He needs to get his strength back first.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": arya stark,\"He wants to be a knight of the King's Guard. He can't be one now, can he?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": arya stark,Can I be Lord of a holdfast?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": arya stark,No. That's not me.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,\"Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,\"No, that's all right. I'm fine.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,You're not. You're freezing.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,I don't like high places.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,\"You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,\"On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. \"\"You're almost a man now,\"\" he said, \"\"but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,\"\" he said, \"\"then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more.\"\" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,\"Yes, he is.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,\"I'm not going to get any better, you know?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,Well… You can't get any worse.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,I hear you're reading a boring book.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Pycelle talks too much.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,\"He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,I promised Cat that I'd help you.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Varys or the Queen?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Yes.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,\"The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,\"I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": hugh of vale,\"As you can see, I'm busy.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,\"I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": hugh of vale,\"I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,\"No \"\"ser.\"\" I'm not a knight.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": hugh of vale,\"I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,\"He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,\"You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Let them look.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tobho mott,\"The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,What did Lord Arryn want?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tobho mott,He always came to see the boy.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,I'd like to see him as well.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tobho mott,\"As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,This is fine work.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": gendry baratheon,It's not for sale.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tobho mott,\"Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet...\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": gendry baratheon,I made it for me.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tobho mott,\"Forgive him, my Lord.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": gendry baratheon,\"He just asked me questions is all, my Lord.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,What kind of questions?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": gendry baratheon,\"About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Your mother?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": gendry baratheon,\"Who she was, what she looked like.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,What did you tell him?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": gendry baratheon,She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,Find anything?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,King Robert's bastard son.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,This is for the King from Lord Stark.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jaime lannister,Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,Three? Four?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jaime lannister,He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,\"Forgive me, my Lord...\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jaime lannister,Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,\"We've met before, you know.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jaime lannister,\"Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jaime lannister,That's where you got your scar?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jaime lannister,Vicious sons of whores.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,They like their bloodshed.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jaime lannister,They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jaime lannister,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,Theon? He's a good lad.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jaime lannister,I doubt it.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": robert baratheon,I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jaime lannister,I don't serve Lord Stark.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grenn,Where have you been?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,Watch duty. With Sam.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": pyp,Prince Porkchop. Where is he?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,He wasn't hungry.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": pyp,Impossible!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,\"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": rast,\"You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,No one touches Sam.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": alliser thorne,\"What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": grenn,\"Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": alliser thorne,\"You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": doreah,\"Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,\"Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": irri,\"Yes, Khaleesi.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,Why did you hit her?!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,What's this?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,It's a gift. I had it made for you.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,Please.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,This stinks of manure. All of it.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,Stop - stop it.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,\"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,You do not talk back to me!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": viserys targaryen,You are a horselordo s slut. And now you've woken the dragon...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,I wouldn't doubt it.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,Sally on the side?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,\"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,\"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,I find that hard to believe.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,\"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,You didn't know where to put it?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,I know where to put it.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,Was she... Old and ugly?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,What color hair?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,Red.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,I like red hair. And her... Her...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,You don't want to know.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,That good?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,Better.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,What's my name?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,Jon Snow?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,And why is my surname Snow?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,Because... You're a bastard from the north.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,\"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,So... You didn't know where to put it?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": alliser thorne,\"Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sam tarly,It is a bit nippy.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": alliser thorne,\"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jon snow,I build my own fires.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": alliser thorne,\"That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,I hit him. I hit the dragon.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,He is still the true King.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,The truth now\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,\"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,\"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jorah mormont,Home.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": daenerys targaryen,I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,Lover's quarrel?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,I'm sorry. Do I...?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,\"Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known...\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": arya stark,Why do they call you Littlefinger?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,Arya!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": septa mordane,Don't be rude!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,\"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": robert baratheon,I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,\"Gods, who is that?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,And his opponent?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": robert baratheon,\"Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,\"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": sansa stark,I won't tell anyone. I promise.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": petyr baelish,\"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": jory cassel,\"My Lord, Her Grace the Queen.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Your Grace.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": cersei lannister,You're missing your tournament.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": cersei lannister,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,She likes it here.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": cersei lannister,\"The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,What are you doing here?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": cersei lannister,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": cersei lannister,\"You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"If that's my job, then so be it.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": cersei lannister,\"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": eddard stark,\"I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": cersei lannister,As was I.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": marillion,\"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": catelyn stark,And to you.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": rodrick cassel,\"Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": marillion,\"Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": rodrick cassel,I'd rather throw myself down a well.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": marillion,\"Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": masha heddle,\"I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": masha heddle,\"Truly, my lord, we have nothing.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": bronn,You can have my room.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": yoren,\"Aye, my Lord.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": marillion,My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": masha heddle,Lady Stark.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": catelyn stark,\"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": knight of house whent,\"It is, my Lady.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": catelyn stark,And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": knight of house whent,She is.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": catelyn stark,The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": knight of house bracken,Our lord is honored by his trust.\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": tyrion lannister,\"I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.\"\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": catelyn stark,Knight of House Frey\n BASTARDS AND BROKEN THINGS\": catelyn stark,\"This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice.\"",
