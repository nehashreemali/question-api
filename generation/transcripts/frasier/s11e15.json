It's just a sweater, It is not just a sweater, It is a work of art by Spain's fabled master weaver Diego, who uses only the soft chin hairs of Andalusian mountain goats . Our sweater man could only get one this year, Niles and I made a pact that neither of us would buy it, You can't even keep a simple sweater pact! Ah, Ronee- - there'sa gal who can keep a sweater packed, Stop that, The least you can do is let me borrow it sometime, Absolutely not, You know Diego'? weave conforms precisely to the contours of one's body, Five minutes on you, I'd neverbe able to wear it again, DAPHNE : Hello, Oh, hi, Daph, Hey, Daph, Hi, Daphne, Not a word about this, We're saving money for the baby's college fund, She'd kill me if she found out I spent half a semester on a sweater, You want this?

Oh, gosh, We weree, so young and immatur We'd have huge fights over nothing, But in the bedroom,,, Uh, Frasier,,, Oh, sorry, So, um,,, Nanny G gave you nice \"hugs\"? Oh, big hugs, No kiddin'? . We used to hug our brains out In fact, you know, the last time we saw each other, she wanted to have a little reunion hug, But, alas, I was stillmarried to Lilith and settling for my weekly handshake, So, you're hoping for another hug? Oh, the thought had crossed my mind, you know We used to have this wild attraction to each other, It was almost combustible, Truth be told, while it's been a since I, uh,,, romped with abandon through the perfumed gardens of Eros, Next time you say something like that, covermyears, And who is this for? Frasier, F-R-A,,, Frasier! Oh! It's so good to see you again! And you-- you look great, I've never seen such col or in your cheeks, Oh, this isn't Lilith, This is my coworker, RoZ, and her daughter, Alice, Hey, Alice, How old are you? now, I'm divorced Five, Wow, Five!

Donald will see us We'll say that you're short on something and send him to the store-- he's good at errands, I'm not going to send him on an errand, He's your husband, It's just business, It's nothing like what we had, Do you remember the passion,,, and the wildness? Well, we are running low on cornichons, Not only did we break house records in Boise and Topeka, but she hasn'? missed a show, She just,,, she lives to entertain children, Of all ages, Don, come out and look at the balcony, Dear God! Frasier, if you knew how bored I am being Nanny G,,, how trapped I feel, You have a wonderful career, But nothing ever changes, Do you have any idea what it's like to play the same character for 20 years? But,,, you've brought joy to-to countless small children, Yeah, well,,, there are times you want to bring joy to somebody big enough to throw a little back at you, Stop-stop it! Who wants wine? Oh, that'll cool her right down, Uh, none for us, We really have to go, Yeah, Uh, nice to meet you, Donald, and, uh, Fras, see you in a few hours So, looks like a threesome tonight, Maybe I'll just stay at Ronee's, Yes, well, uh,,, ) (clears throat Here we all are, (chuckling) (phone rings, playing \"Peek-a-boo\") Hello, Ar-Are you sure? Mr, Bunny's using again, Do you have anyone to replace him? Donald, we a re guests here, Take that outside, HonestIy, . The man has no manners Cut that out! I can't help myself, I've never stopped thinking about you Nor I you, but this is wrong, Oh, Frasier, you're so good, You always do the right thing, I have the exact same problem, (panting) Well, you're making great strides overcoming it, Well, I'm tired of being good, I've sung my songs and cheered people up, Haven't I earned the right to be a little bad? Isn't there a part of you that wants to be bad? Yes, and three guesses which one, I-I,,, I can't do it, Come to my dressing room after the show tomorrow, I have an hour when Donald's busy, .. I know an hour's not much, Trust me, an hour's more than ample, Shh, Shh, Well, I just hope he shows up tomorrow, That bunny suit is jus t so darn tight on me, Donald, you know, you really must try one of these Gruyre tarts, Oh, no, thanks, I'm watching the old cholesterol, NANETTE: So am I, but you know what? I just feel like being bad tonight, What about you, Frasier? Are you going to be bad? DONALD: Ah, go on, What's one little tart? Mmm, Well, it shows its face ? . What was t hat last night Relax, relax, Nothing happened, My problem now is that,,, she's invited me to her dressing room for an aprs-show tryst, You're not going? Well,,, Frasier, Niles, if you had any idea how much pain she's in, The woman is reaching out to me to rescue her from a loveless marriage, from,,, from a career she feels trapped in, If I could help her make a new beginning, wouldn't it be heartless of me to deny myself to her? Did you say something? hear, Your penis was talking so loud, I couldn't All right! I want her and she wants me! She's married, Yes, well, I married her first, Till death us do part, as I recall, Now, you may not take those vows seriously, but I do, Will you listen to yourself? Oh, this is more than just sex, Niles, This is passion, kismet, a gift the gods bestow on only a chosen few, Wouldn't the real sin be to refuse it? Isn't that your old second-piece-of-pie argument? Well, maybe it is, but I haven't had \"pie\" in six months, Frasier, you can rationaliZe this any way you want, but the real question is, if you do this, can you live with yourself afterwards? Ready for the concert? . Hey, Alice Hi, Uncle Niles, . Hi Come on, Mommy, Let's go, Oh, oh, oh, no hugs for Frasier? No,,, No hugs for Frasier, (knock at door) Frasier, I thought you were coming after the show, No, I can't, Well, we have ten minutes, Let me just get rid of,,, Donald! Huh? . No, no, I can' t do this at all What? Huh? Nothing, Just sit there, . God knows I'm temp ted, but,,, this is wrong I-I'm sorry you've been so unhappy in you r life lately, but,,, If you want to talk, we can meet later at the coffee shop next door, Why can't we talk now? ? . Don't you have a show to do They can't start without me, Here, come with me, What is this place? It's the prop room, This is where I come before every show to fight off the emptiness and the nausea that comes over me, You don't know how many time s I've sat down here, curled up in a ball vomiting like a wino, Hold me, Frasier, I can't, You're married, And these shoe s are suede, Look, I-I realiZe that you'r e at a crossroads right now, and if I can help you reach some decision,,, , I can't go on, Then don'? Make a break, Redefine yourself, No, I mean now, this show, I can't go on, What? Cancel? I can't go out there and sing and dance and pretend to be a happy lady when the love of my life has just rejected me, Oh, Nanette, I,,, I realiZe you're upset, but-but,,, think of little Alice and-and the children, Oh, let them learn now that life is filled with bitter disappointments, But, Nanette,,, Oh, make me a happy lady, Frasier, And then I can go on, For the children! Okay, All right, Take me, Frasier! Yes! Yes! Oh! Oh, God! How I've dreamed of this moment! Have you?! Are you kidding? I dreamed of it twice last night, Oh, my God! Already? Oh, no! I thought we had more time, ! . Quick, get off the bed Oh, dear God! Why is the ceiling opening up? ! . This is how I make my entrance Get off the bed! I can't, I can't, I'm tangled in the sheets, Jump! Jump? It's too high, Aim for your clothes, Dear God, my clothes! Oh, hide! For God' s sake, just hide! (cheering) You have got to get out of this bed, Can't I just hide here until the show's over? Trust me, that ain't gonna work, (cheering) When it's time to rise I yawn and rub my eyes Because I'm such a sleepyhead But rise I do 'Cause I'm dying to see what's new In Nanny's messy bed There might be treats Last week I found a piZZa And a chimpanZee named Fred So, kids, what say We see what we find today In Nanny's messy bed There's always something new It's Mr, Kangaroo?
