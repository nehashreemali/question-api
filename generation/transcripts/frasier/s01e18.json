  "transcript": "Remember, cosmetic surgery is only a superficial solution.' It can lift eyelids, but not the little cloud of pessimism hovering over you. Thank you for your call. OK, Roz, so who's our next caller? Roz? This'd be a good time to go to commercial break. We'll be right back after these messages. - Frasier? - Hello. Disturbing seeing no one there? I was finding out if they've announced the nominations for the SeaBs. I forgot, are those out today? You forgot? The biggest award in Seattle radio! I suppose it's the difference in our ages. I don't get excited about well, much anymore. Congratulations. - Yes! Yes! We got the nomination! - Who'd you hear it from? I haven't. I was congratulating you on a great show. If anyone deserves a nomination, you guys do. - Get out, Noel. - OK, catch you later. Well, I guess I'm a little more excited than I let on! - It'd be a feather in my cap to win. - Are you kidding?! In ten years, I've never produced a show that got nominated. (Phone rings) Hello hi, Millie you're kidding! - That's great! Thanks, bye. - We got the nomination? - No, Millie's getting married. - Damn it, Roz! She said she'd been seeing someone else - couldn't keep living a lie. I was dumbfounded. What about everything we'd gone through? Didn't that mean anything? Niles, a patient has a right to change therapists. - Frasier, thank God! - What're you doing here? What kind of agent would I be if I didn't tell you you've been nominated?! (Shouts) I was nominated! Ha-ha! Well I was! Yes, you Frasier Crane, MD, PhD, STUD, are the man of the hour! Bebe Glazer, Frasier's agent. Dr Niles Crane, Frasier's brother. - You're not a psychiatrist, too? - Yes. Oh, please, if I'm ever to have a breakdown, let me have it now. Double double decaf to go. So, this is quite a surprise. I forgot the nominations were out today. Oh, isn't he precious? You must be very proud of Frasier. Actually no. It's one more signpost on the road of celebrity my brother's chosen. Hope that's not sibling rivalry rearing its green snout?! Absolutely not. I believe psychiatry's a noble profession, tarnished by popularity contests and a bouncy radio programme! I bet you two had wicked little hair-pulling fights when you were tots! It's been delightful, I must run. My sexual addiction group - I don't like to leave them alone too long. - Frasier! - Roz! We did it! I know! Come sit down. I've never won before. Although back in prep school the existentialist club once named me most likely \"to be\"! You wanna hear the great part? I've a date for the ceremony - Brad Macnamara! The Channel Eight reporter? Television's most handsome man. He wouldn't give me time of day but one nomination - he knew who I was! Who are you? Roz Doyle, Frasier's producer. Oh, right. I've seen you bring him coffee. Would you mind getting mine? Better get on the ball. I've a lot to do! Not really, I got your tux, rented a limo, your tickets will be at the door. The only thing you haven't taken care of is finding me a date?! Your subtlety floors me! I'd love to! I'm thrilled, for you both - but I've got to run. Two clients weren't nominated. I have to tell them what a worthless award this is! Daphne, you may not be aware of this, but there's a secret to opening champagne. Especially a fine French champagne as unprepossessing as this one - $200 a bottle. In order to prevent spillage one does not simply twist out the cork. Instead, hold the cork stationary. Give the bottle three easy turns. One (Cork pops) Get some glasses! Quick! Oh oh, my god. Eddie, get out of there, you mangy little cur! Here Oh, Lord. That wasn't too bad. I believe we've salvaged most of it. A toast. To my number-one son, congratulations on your first nomination for well, anything! - Frasier, I'm proud of you. - Thanks, means a lot to me. Mm this champagne is delicious. Exquisite. Dad, what do you think? I was in the mood for something domestic! I must say, it's nice that although I'm an employee, you include me in family celebrations. Never doubt that I think of you as my equal in every way. (Doorbell) (Doorbell rings again) Oh, I'll get it. - Would you? - Like me to announce your visitor? (Shouts) Just open the door! Oh, hello, Roz! Congratulations Thanks. I couldn't believe it myself. Brad Macnamara! Roz, she was referring to your SeaB nomination. No, I meant Brad Macnamara. - Think he wears pants under the desk? - Not on my TV! Girls, can we cut out the pyjama party, please? - Hello, Mr C. - Hey, Roz, how's my girlfriend? Well, she's nominated. A glass of champagne? It's French and unprepossessing. Save your breath. It could come out of a box - Roz would have a glass of it! I'm so proud of you, Roz, being recognised in a male-dominated industry. - One more step for working women. - You're a credit to our gender. Thank you. That reminds me, do you have a push-up bra I could borrow? - I'll look. - Thanks. I'm sorry to barge in but I had to show you this, Frasier. A friend at \"Broadcast\" magazine sent me a copy. It's a full-page ad. 'Wendy Yashiro thanks the voting committee for her nomination 'and hopes they consider her for the award.' This is shameless self-promotion, very bad taste! I know! What'll we put in our ad? Wendy Yashiro's up against you? I like her - she's a cutie! You're suggesting we put an ad in? We're falling behind, Mike Sanchez has sent out tapes of his show. Mike Sanchez? Oh, I like him! Who knows what Fletcher Grey's doing? - Fletcher Grey!! - (Shouts) Thank you, Dad! Geez! Well, all right. As long as it's tasteful and understated. Great. My friend'll work something up for us. Wait. If we want to stand out, why run another boring ad? We should do something different. Last year's winner threw a party. OK, but we should do something else to keep our names in their minds. I know, personalized gifts from the new Tiffany's catalogue! - Ooh, that's good! - I saw incredible cigarette cases. No - sends out a bad message. A silver flask? We've already got your vote, Roz. I mightn't know about show business, but gifts for people who could do something for you, that's bribery! It's a thank you for a nomination! If I had to give a gift to get an award it's not worth having. You might as well just go down to the trophy store and buy one. - I really want that award. - Me, too. Get that catalogue! Well, are you coming in or not? This is a big moment. I want to drink it in. Me, too. Where's the bar? Not so fast. Me shoes are killing me! I should never have let that salesgirl talk me into them. - They look good on you. - You think so? Dr Crane. Bob Peterson, voting committee. - I wanted to wish you luck. - Thank you. - Oh, and thanks for the bathrobe. - Oh nothing! People get out of the shower, they're cold! Hey, Dr Crane, love the watch! Thanks, it was nothing. Pretty good likeness of me, isn't it?! Can we please sit down? I have got to sit down. Daphne, we're table eight. This isn't our table! It is now! - Isn't that Fletcher Grey? - I believe it is. You got your work cut out for you. A class act! I've listened to him for 20 years. I don't usually do this, but I'm going to shake his hand. Hey, guys. Oh, Roz. My fellow nominee. Everybody's talking about those gifts. Did you see valet parking? Half the key chains are ours! This is a big night for me. Please don't spoil it by making fun of who I brought. I thought you were bringing Brad Macnamara. He got called out on a story. Some hospital went up in flames. Do you know anyone who has worse luck than I do? Hi, Dr Crane. - Oh, hi, Noel - Noel Shempsky's your date? Uh, tip, Dr Crane? If you're nominated again, there's parking three blocks away - they don't check after 6.00! Oh, um here are the car keys so you can drive us home. I have night blindness. I wish I did. - Hi. I'm Noel. - Nice to meet you. Can you rub me feet? - Oh, Daphne! - Good evening, everybody. - Niles! Thanks for coming! I know how you feel about this award and coming downtown after dark. Don't be silly, you're my brother. - Hello, Daphne. - Can you rub me feet? - Yes. - Niles! - Where's Maris? - We were leaving when Maris glimpsed herself in the mirror At the end of this, will I roll my eyes? - I did. - Well, then, skip it! Listen, get me a Scotch, would you? That Fletcher Grey, he's aces! He remembered me from 1968! I worked on a murder case he covered. He looked at me and said, \"Hey, you're the guy who found the head!\" He's been nominated 11 times and never won. Really? Geez, I didn't know that. I'm afraid he'll have to lose again. If he does, you can cheer him up - send something from your gift shop! - Dr Crane? - Fletcher Grey! Been meaning to wish you luck even though you don't need it. That's kind, but I hardly think I have a chance against you! I hope you're right. I'd love to win. Oh, you'd have to lose 15, 16 times before you could feel ashamed. Would you believe, I considered campaigning this year? Sending out gifts, throwing a party. I bet you'd have something to say about someone that self-absorbed! He could do a whole hour on it! Dear, they're starting to serve the salads. Oh, Mom! I'm 60 years old and I'm still her little boy. - Dr Crane. My mother, Hannah. - Nice to meet you. Mom just flew in from Scottsdale. This is her 11th year. I hope he wins it this time. It's getting harder and harder to get on that plane. Why don't you go back to the table before your legs swell up? I'll get you another Pink Lady. No, no, no, Mom, over there. Sorry - been detained! Civilization won't advance one iota till they put more toilets in the ladies' room! - Thank you, Niles. - Oh, champagne! Uh, a diet root beer? I have to tell you the buzz in line was that those gifts you've been sending paid off. It looks like you're in a neck-and-neck race with Fletcher Grey, that wrinkled warhorse Hello, Mr Crane. You're more handsome than before! If I were 20 years older, they couldn't keep me away! That's why I keep this cane! Good evening, would everybody take their seats? I'm Keith Bishop, welcome to the 15th annual SeaB awards. Assisting me tonight in handing out the awards is Miss SeaB 1994, Tawny Van Deusen. I'm starting to feel uncomfortable about the campaigning. Fletcher's been nominated 11 times! He didn't lift a finger to win this. Don't worry about him, he can win it next year. Before we start this evening, I'd like to make a sad announcement. I just found out that the Dean of Seattle radio, my mentor, Fletcher Grey, will be retiring this year. (Audience) Ahhhh! Take a bow, Fletcher. We're gonna start with a bang! The award for achievement in informational programming. That's us! Can't see a thing without my glasses! (Audience laugh) Fletcher deserves this award. If we win - can't we just not accept it? I've waited ten years to get this. If I have to crawl over Fletcher's mother to get it, I'll do it! Roz, I've never seen you like this! - It isn't pretty - The nominations \"Community Forum\" - Wendy Yashiro: Talent, Mike Freedman: Producer. \"Consumer Update\" - Mike Sanchez: Talent, T J Chester-Nuevo: Producer. \"The Frasier Crane Show\" - Dr Frasier Crane: Talent, Roz Doyle: Producer. Bravo! \"Fletcher Grey: From Where I Sit\" - Fletcher Grey: Talent and producer. (Audience) Bravo! Bravo! If we win this thing, they're gonna lynch us! At least everyone will see my dress! Well, this is a first. It seems we have a tie. - Good, we can share it with Fletcher! - I'm already sharing it with you! And the winners are Wendy Yashiro and Mike Sanchez! - What? - What? (Applause) The party's over. Are you coming home? - No, Dad. - We'll just go without you. Fine. I don't agree with the way you went about it but I'm sorry you lost. It's never easy to lose. Thanks, Dad. Of course, if you'd joined sport at an early age - Dad - All right, sorry, wrong time! We'll talk about it over breakfast. OK, Daphne, let's get you home and soak your feet in Epsom salts. Oh, I have the life of a princess! Don't feel bad, Roz. It's an honour just to get a nomination. Will you stop saying that? OK, I'm leaving. Oh, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm just despondent. No, no, go ahead. Roz! Noel, Noel, I'm sorry. Thank you. I'll see you at work on Monday? - How are you? - Oh, I've been better. Thank you. When you feel the sting of losing you have to realise the fact that it's not about awards, it's not about accolades, it's about a body of work. If you can look in the mirror and say you've done a good job, that's what matters. If you can do that, let the awards fall where they may. Wow! All those nominations, nothing to show for it. He still walks out, head high, and a smile on his face. I'm never gonna get nominated again. - Oh, come on, Roz. - I'm not. The world's full of winners and losers - I'm a loser. - I wouldn't be with you if you were. - Come on, we're a team. Before we're done we're going to win lots of these things. You and I are amigos, compadres. OK? Now, I'm not going to leave your side till I see a little smile on that face. Dr Crane? I love your show and I was wondering - would you like to have a drink? (Sobbing) Do I see the beginning of a little smile? - Oh, go ahead. - Thanks, Roz. So, that's a very interesting name you have. - You mean \"Miss SeaB\"? - Well, actually, I, uh yeah. # Baby, I hear the blues a-calling Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Quite stylish # And maybe I seem a bit confused Well, maybe but I got you pegged # But I don't know what to do with those Tossed salads and scrambled eggs # They're calling again # Goodnight, Seattle, we love you!",
