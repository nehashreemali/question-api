  "transcript": "ROZ: Thank you for the coffee. FRASIER: Thank you. Oh, you don't have to thank me. We're not keeping score. Heh, heh. Life's too short to get worked up over who owes who for this or that or whatnot. Let's just enjoy ourselves. Whatever you want, Kenny, the answer is no. - Just hear me out. FRASIER: Okay. Look, I need a favour, but before I tell you what it is, I want you to look at this. \"KACL Psychographics\"? We hired a firm to sift through the program data and give us a kind of profile on each show's average listener. FRASIER: All right, let's see. Gil's average listener is a woman, mid-30s, well-educated. Hmm. What about my average listener? Who is she? Well, actually, uh, she's an older gentleman, who likes to keep the radio on for company. Ouch. Oh, and, Roz, it seems a number of listeners think you're a man. What? I'm sorry the station spent its money on this nonsense, but this research is patently absurd! Regardless, you could really stand to increase your audience in the youth market. Well, I thought we upped the advertising budget for that reason. I did, but I need some help. How would you like to be a guest on Teen Scene? I'm sorry, I've done that show before, I'm not doing it again. Doc, you could use younger listeners. You've seen the research. My show is fine. That so-called research is nothing but a bunch of confounded correlations and mediocre deductions. Excuse me. Are you Dr. Frasier Crane? - Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. - Can I get your autograph? - Ah, what's your name? - Lucy. But make it out to Paul. I volunteer at his hospice, and I think you're just about the only friend he has left anymore. Fine. I'll meet the kids. NILES: I have a little something for you. [DAPHNE LAUGHS.] Earrings. - They're beautiful. - Try them on. I have disinfected them with peroxide. Niles, it's a lovely thought, but, well, you kind of gave me the exact same pair last summer. - No, I did not. - Yeah, take a look. Ugh, I am so sorry. Oh, don't be silly. It was bound to happen sometime, after all the nice presents you give me. I'll have to get pierced somewhere else. Still, l [MOUTHS.] Really? DAPHNE: Well, well, look who's up. How was your company party, Mr. Crane? Fine. Sounds like it was more than just fine if you're getting up this late. - Yeah, he came in late too. - Didn't know there was a curfew. Oh, my God! Is that lipstick on your chin? It is! I got kissed, okay? Big whoop. - There's no lipstick on my chin. DAPHNE: Busted! [NILES LAUGHS.] NILES: Well, so, what's her name? - Yeah, when can we meet her? Her name's Peg, and nobody's meeting anyone. It was a just a little fooling around, that's all. - Well, are you gonna see her again? - No, and if she calls, I'm not here. Got it? I don't wanna encourage her. Well, why not? It sounds like you had fun. See, this is exactly the conversation I'm trying to avoid with Peg. You kiss a girl, and suddenly she wants to know: \"What does it mean?\" \"When can I see you again?\" \"Why don't you call me?\" - That's a wonderful attitude. MARTIN: Hey, it was great. I loved it, but I don't want to ruin it by making it more than it was. Women never let you have a bite of ham. They always make you sit down for spinach. KIRBY: Whoa! This is embarrassing, huh? All three of us going to the same place when we're skipping out on work. - We are not skipping out on work. - Right, we're all at the doctor's. Kirby, we don't work the same hours that you do. - We're done for the day. - Oh, yeah, that's good. It's better if we don't all use the same excuse. Kirby, I think it's time for you to straighten up. You show up late every day, you are inattentive, and you have a bad attitude. How do you expect to thrive in this job or any other job? I am this close to giving you a lecture! Hey, guys. Uh, doc, you got a minute? There's someone I want you to meet. Aw, dude, that's Emily Crowther, one of the nimrods from Teen Scene. You're not gonna do that show, are you? Those guys go to my old high school. Bunch of losers. For your information, Kirb Hey, I thought you were at the doctor. I was. Uh, he says everything is fine. He also said I probably shouldn't come in tomorrow till about 11:30. How dumb do you think I am? You will show up first thing tomorrow morning, after your Meals on Wheels delivery. You got it. Listen, Kenny, I'm actually just on my way out. Perhaps I could meet this young lady tomorrow? Oh, come on. Say hi to the kid. - She's a big fan. - Really? Well, gosh, I would hate to appear standoffish. After all, the young lady has built up a certain image of me in her mind, and that shouldn't be crushed, certainly. Do we have to go through this every time? Go over there. Emily Crowther, Dr. Frasier Crane. - Hello, Emily. - Pleased to meet you, Dr. Crane. I look forward to having you on our show. Well, technically, I haven't agreed to do it yet. You see, I had a rather bad experience on Teen Scene the last time. Are you familiar with the new Teen Scene? - Well, uh, no, actually, I'm not. EMILY: Then you don't know that we do hard-hitting journalism with a youthful bent. Of course, it's not nearly as distinguished as your show, which I adore. - Really? - Big fan. Dr. Crane, may I be frank? Having you on our show would be, in your own words: \"A great boon to us.\" A boon? - Do you really think so? - Oh, major boon. Well, then, consider it granted. I'm sure we'll have a splendid time. I may even learn something from you. Oh, you flatter me, Dr. Crane. NILES: Hello. FRASIER: Ah, Niles. - Who's manning the Pasquini? - Jimmy Ray. Capital. Uh, cappuccino, please. - Hello, Roz. ROZ: Hey, Niles. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be out buying Daphne another pair of earrings? Oh, please, don't make me feel any worse. - Actually, I thought it was sweet. - Well, I feel just awful. - You wanna know what I would do? - Uh Oh, what the hell? First of all, enough with the earrings. Everything doesn't have to be so fancy. Don't get me wrong, jewellery is terrific. But sometimes a woman likes to know that you're paying attention. Mix it up a little. Do something crazy, I mean, totally out there. Are you talking about scarves? Okay, let me give you an example. When I was 20, my boyfriend stole a Doyle's Pub sign for me. We were drunk, and we saw it, and he said: \"Hey, that's your name on that sign. You should have it.\" It was spontaneous, and a little dangerous, and very romantic. Spontaneous and dangerous. Thanks, Roz. You've given me something to mull over during my herbal wrap. Oh, good. I thought you were gonna miss Dr. Crane on the radio. How many times a day is that guy on? It's not his show. It's Teen Scene. MARTIN: Oh, I don't have time for that teenage crap. Did I get a call from a girl today? - You mean Peg? - Or any girl. Or Peg. Did Peg call? - No. It's been a few days, hasn't it? - Hmm. I really thought she'd try to spring that relationship stuff on me. Well, I guess I misjudged her. Unless she didn't like her free sample. [MARTIN CHUCKLES.] I think we can rule that out. When a lady gets the full Marty Crane treatment, she doesn't forget it. And Peg got the full Marty? I never give anything less. So, yeah, I guess I am a little surprised she hasn't called. I mean, mostly relieved, of course, but also surprised. Well, don't feel bad. Maybe you had an off night. [SCOFFS.] Anything's possible, I suppose. [TELEPHONE RINGING.] Hello? Well, yes, he is. One moment, please. [MOUTHS.] It's a woman. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH.] Uh-huh. Oh, I think that'd be fine. Thursday at 9. See you then. Well, look who's suddenly in a relationship. Shows you what you know. That was the dentist. - Thank goodness, right? - Right. I agree with you, sir. The difference between valedictorian and salutatorian is largely arbitrary. Thank you, Emily. Hmm. Didn't mean to go on like that, but the wound is still raw. - Hello, Kirby. - Hello, Emily. How's honours everything? Splendid, thank you. How's carrying a bunch of boxes around a radio station? Good. Emily, I was thinking that perhaps after the show I could invite you and your friends to a cheeseburger or some such. - Oh, we'd like that very much. - Ah. - Can I get you a coffee? - Oh, yes, thank you, Emily. You know, I asked for one a little while ago, and it never showed up. Now who's carrying a bunch of stuff around a radio station? Oh - Hi, Dr. Crane. - Oh - Andy McNiff. - Andy. I'm the moderator. I'm really glad you could make it. Yes, well, likewise. I look forward to some intergenerational by-play. Uh, by the way, Andy, are you going to be smoking all night? Yeah. Look, no matter what happens, I'm on your side. Thank you. What does that mean, exactly? Well, uh Hi, guys. - Your guest has arrived. - Here's your coffee, Dr. Crane. These are my colleagues, Ryan and Trent. Pleased to meet you. We're very excited. FRASIER: Likewise. Hello, Ryan. - Ten seconds, guys. FRASIER: Ah, right. You know, you may be surprised to learn that it was not so very many years ago when I myself occupied those tough years twixt 12 and 20. [CHUCKLES.] Hi, and welcome to Teen Scene, Seattle's premier talk show for young people. I'm Andy McNiff, and for the next 60 minutes we'll be engaged in some straight talk with our special guest. And here to get things rolling is our Teen Scene panel, Trent, Ryan and Emily. Trent. Tonight we're talking to Dr. Frasier Crane, a man who knows what makes us tick. But what do we know about him? Dr. Crane, you're a popular psychiatrist and radio personality. What would you say is the secret of your success? I suppose it has something to do with the fact that I am a good listener and have a friendly voice, and I also try to pass along some real psychological insight and advice. My research shows that your replies are typically less than five minutes long. Doesn't seem like a lot of time for substantive psychological advice. If I believe there's a real problem, I refer the caller to So if it's a real problem, you pass the buck? - Excuse me? RYAN: February 9th, 1993. Does that date mean anything to you? - Should it? - According to the Boston Globe, you spent two hours on a ledge threatening to jump if your wife left. How many of your listeners are aware that they're taking advice from a man who was nearly a stain on the sidewalk? Andy, isn't it about time for a commercial break? Actually, this show is a public service, therefore commercial-free. [MOUTHS.] Sorry. Splendid. [HUMMING.] [EDDIE BARKS.] [WHISTLES.] [WHISTLES.] [BARKING.] [WHISTLES.] Hi. Just, uh [WHISTLES.] [EDDIE BARKING.] [SIREN WAILS.] Well, hi, Peg. Jeez, I didn't know you were working the graveyard tonight. All this month. What brings you here? Actually, I was in the neighbourhood, and I wanted to make sure they'd fixed that elevator camera. But, see, I thought Rich was on tonight, which explains why I didn't know you'd be here. Right. - Well, it's fixed. - Well, that's good. Somebody broke it. Okay, then. - See you later. - See you. Hey, how come I never heard from you? Oh, jeez Well, I was under the impression we had some chemistry going. I think I deserved at least a phone call. Hey, we made out a little. Let's not ruin it by making it more than it was. - Just what I was thinking. - Good. Then it won't be awkward or anything if we pull the same shift, right? What are you talking about? Don't worry about me. - Watch yourself. Heh. - Ha-ha-ha. Okay. No worries. - So I'll see you around, then. - Yeah, see you. Hey, you going to Jerry's retirement party? - Uh, might drop in for a pop or two. - Yeah, same. - Maybe I'll see you there. - Yeah, maybe you will. [PEG CHUCKLES.] Again, I freely admit that I assisted my ex-wife in psychological experiments on lab animals. However, at that time putting a pair of sunglasses on a monkey did not constitute cruelty. We'll just agree to disagree. You know, I scarcely see how this line of questioning about my personal life - can benefit your listeners. - Well, Dr. Crane, every day you ask your listeners to blindly trust you. Isn't the public entitled to know a little more about that friendly voice that seems to have all the answers? Oh, I understand. This isn't about me at all. You see, your combative line of questioning is completely age-appropriate. The challenging of authority, the zeal for truth. RYAN: Speaking of truth, I have a few questions about your last tax return. I hate to interrupt, panel, but it's time for our regular news break. We'll be back with more Teen Scene fun after this. Dr. Crane, could I borrow you for a second? You're doing great. - Dude, you're in trouble here. - Thanks for the update. Take it easy, Mr. Snappy. I'm here to help you. Can you believe that Kirby guy works here? I can't believe they finally graduated him. Remember, guys, you're still goodwill ambassadors We weren't talking to you. Okay. - Everything okay, Dr. Crane? - Absolutely. I didn't fully appreciate the hard-hitting nature of your journalism, but I think I know how to handle it now. We're back with more Teen Scene, and our special guest, Dr. Frasier Crane. Now, Dr. Crane, where were we? I believe we were discussing my competence as a mental-health professional. And though it is true that I have suffered several emotional setbacks in my life, if we are to be honest, haven't we all? And that's your defence? That we all have problems? [ALL SCOFF.] Perhaps I can better illustrate my point by reading from a poem entitled: \"An Onion for Trisha.\" Where did you get that? My heart is like an onion Filled with layers of tears Why, oh, why did you leave me, Trisha? - Okay, give me that! - Trisha Sharpe? You said you never liked her. Ooh, Trent, tough blow! Yes, it seems that youthful relationships are fraught with emotional hazards. Especially in the case of a young woman who finds her first love at math camp. - What happened at math camp? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Uh, Dr. Crane - Yes, Ryan, or as the boys on the swim team call you So do you have any good advice for kids that wanna go to college? As a matter of fact, I believe I do. In short, caller, there is nothing wrong with you. And you're not going to get sick. But remember, the more frequently you do it, the less special it becomes. I hope that answers your question. MAN [OVER PHONE.]: Uh, yeah. Well, uh, thanks a lot. Well, that about wraps it up for tonight's Teen Scene. For Trent, Ryan and Emily, this is Andy McNiff, reminding you we're still taking applications for the moderator's job, and wishing you a teen-tastic week. Good night. - Thanks, kids. I had fun. - Yeah, thanks. Thank you. You made my month. [CHUCKLES.] Way to go, Dr. Crane! That was sweet. I'm not exactly proud of myself, Kirby. You should be, man. Those dinks brought it on themselves. They were like, \"We're gonna get this old dude.\" And then you were like, \"Old dude? Say what?\" And it was like: Wham! Wham! Smack-down! Boom! Boom! Doc Well said, Kirby. Uh And thank you for helping me out. By the way, how did you dig up all that stuff? Oh, let's just say I got a few operatives who were, uh, held back. Ah. Heh-heh-heh. KIRBY: Hey, you know, why don't you and I continue this conversation over a cheeseburger or some such? FRASIER: I'd like that very much.",
