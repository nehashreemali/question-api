  "transcript": "(symphony playing on stereo) (turns up volume) (orchestra playing softly) (orchestra begins loud, cadential flourish) (orchestra plays final chord) Boo! (high-pitched scream) (laughter) That is not funny! You don't sneak up on someone and startle them. and secondly, I only did it to prove a point. And you called it-- he does scream like a woman. I do not scream like a woman. It was a manly, throaty wail. Frasier, you may want to call security. As I got off the elevator, I heard a woman screaming hysterically. That was me. I was innocently conducting some Brahms when our madcap father decided to startle me. Oh, quit whining. I used to scare you kids all the time when we went camping -- you used to love it. Remember the story about the couple making out in the car who got slashed by the killer with the hook? Yes, I remember I couldn't kiss a woman in a c until I was 30. Yeah, well, your father doesn't have that problem-- Mr. Reclining Bucket Seats. (lascivious growl) You want me to scream again? Dad, when'd you get the new cane? Oh, Ronee got it for me. Yeah, he's too young for that old man can e. This is much more his style . Give me a top hat, and I'm Fred Astaire. Add a monocle, and you're Mr. Peanut. Hey, Frasier. Coulrophobia? I have a patient who suffers from it. What is it? It's a very rare disorder, a crippling fear of clowns . Yes, I'm treating a pediatric nurse who is terrified every time one comes to visit the child ren at her hospital. It's almost cost her her job. Poor thing. We're making great progress. Through some rather groundbreaking techniques I've devised, I think we're close to a cure. Really? Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if this may turn out to be my clowning achievement. (laughing) That sounded better in your head, didn't it? Vastly. Well, I don't blame her for hating clowns. They're weird and creepy. That was one of the reasons I never took you kids to the circus. Which I always resented. You know how much I wanted to be a trapeze artist. I even decorated a unitard in the style of the Flying Wallendas to wear when we visited the big top. That was the other reason. Well, I'll go check on dinner. I'm gonna have to make this an early evening. I'm leaving in the morning to visit my mother. She moved last year to Spokane. I remember your mom. She used to chaperone our dances, right? Oh, yeah. She also taught Sunday school andled the church choir. day Must've been a very windy when the apple fell from that tree. (music box playing \"Pop! Goes the Weasel\") You're doing fine, Mimi. There's nothing to be afraid of. Right. Just a tiny, inanimate piece of plastic-- it couldn't possibly hurt you. (music continues) I know. You're doing great. I feel good. (screaming hysterically) (gasping and whimpering) Much better. (chuckles) Really? Yes, yes. You're still in the room; you didn't throw up. That's a big improvement. All right, now give me your hand. Here's the tiny little hat. Tiny little hat, right. And the big red nose. A big red nose. Now, Mimi, is there anything you'd like to say to our little clown friend? Please don't kill me! ! . No No, Mimi. Oh, I-I mean, uh you're my friend, and I like you. Excellent, Mimi. (laughs) (chuckling): All right, then. Now, tomorrow we will take our biggest step yet. No, I really don't think No, no, I You are ready. You are. In the safety of this environment, you'll watch me transform myseIf into a real live clown. I will apply the makeup and then I'll put on the clown suit and the big funny shoes, and time permitting, I will make animal balloons. And you really think that'll work? or As long as you don't ask f anything too complicated, like a giraffe. up. Well, our time is Um all right, then, Mimi, I will see you tomorrow, and rest assured, I will talk you through every step of the way. There's nothing to be afraid of. There willbe no surprises. (screams) (chuckling) : I'm so so sorry! Here. There he goes. All right, now. I will see you later, then. All right. (screams) ) (chuckling Again, I'm so sorry-- little fellow really is he? full of mischief, isn't You mean you're not controlling it?! . Yes. Yes, of course I am Anyway, I will, uh, see you tomorrow. Yeah. Double session. (whimpering) (chuckles) Boo! (screeches) (laughing) What is the matter with you? You keep standing in empty rooms with your back to the door. an. I'm only hum Oh, I wish Ronee could've seen that one. I'm glad that your little girlfriend is making you feel young again, but you're acting Iike an irresponsible adolescent. (mocking) : Irresponsible adolescent. Mimicking me now. (mocking) : Mimicking me now. Stop it. Did you specifically come down here to torture me? No. I'm picking up Niles for a movie, but he's still got someone in his office. Yes, as do I, unfortunately. Now, off you go. Oh when did you forget how to have fun? You've turned into such a fuddy-duddy. Well, forgive me if I prefer humor of a more elevated level. , I tell you I might actually enjoy one of your little japes one day if you could come up with something with a bit more wit and sophistication. (phone ringing) Hello? Yes, well, I'm afraid my calendar's rather booked right now. Well, all right. I suppose I could try to squeeze you in somewhere. Uh yes, uh, and your last name, please? Rection. That's unusual. And your first name? That's not funny, either, Dad. Oh, hello, Roz Hi. Oh, thanks for bringing that over .No problem. I'm warning you, though, that clown makeup is a bitch to get off. , I wore it for Alice's birthday party and for a whole week afterwards, I looked like a Kabuki hooker. Oh, yes, that was around the time of the Seabee Awards ceremony. I remember, you looked rather comically made-up that night. I'd gotten it off by then. Yoo-hoo, Frasier. Don't be afraid. I'm coming in the door. Very funny, Dad. Roz, do you think it's funny when someone sneaks up behind you ? . and jolts you out of your skin -- Let me guess somebody screamed like a woman. Yes, all right. Good night, Roz. Bye. I thought you were having dinner with Niles. He canceled. Something else came up. I'm just gonna watch the game in my room. All right. But don't worry. If I come out for a beer, I'll call ahead. Wouldn't want you to think there was an intruder in the house. It's about ten years too late for that. Dad, I'm going to go out for a while! See you later! MARTIN: All right, see you! (jingles keys) (rings doorbell repeatedly) (vicious yell) (screams) (laughing) Oh, you were right, Dad. That's hilarious! Not such a fuddy-duddy now, am I? That's quite a comeback, Dad. A heart attack. Come on, get up. Dad. Dad, you can get up now. Dad! Frasier. Niles Dad? How's Well, he's resting, he's stable, his color is good. How did this happen? Well, there's so many factors in a case like this, Niles. It's impossible to pinpoint any one cause in particular. Why are you dressed like that? Hmm? . Well, uh.. Oh, all right. You remember my patient with the clown phobia? Oh, yes, of course. I'm sorry. Frasier, you feel terrible-- I was supposed to have dinner with him tonight and I canceled on him. I would have been there when it happened, but no, I had to try out those new bath emollients. There's no point in trying to assign blame . at a time like this, Niles We must remember that. You probably saved his life. Our father had a heart attack. This man saved his life. Well, I'm sure you would have done the same thing if you were in my shoes, Niles. Well, not these shoes, of course. (chuckles) Hey. Oh, Roz, hi. He's fine now, thanks to Frasier's grace under pressure. MAN: You know, they say the first few minutes are critical. Did you give him an aspirin? Uh yes, I did. He's been taking care of his dad for ten years. God bless him. What a good son. Uh, excuse me, Dr. Crane. I have to verify the paramedics' report. Around 7:00 this evening you pretended to leave your apartment Yes, that's right. It's all there. . Off you go Then you dressed up like a clown and lured your father into the living room where you leapt out waving a meat cleaver causing him to collapse. You scared him on purpose? It was a joke. You know how much he hates clowns. My father hates clowns. Yes, well, it was only meant as a playful little jolt. Why didn't you just throw a toaster in his tub? Dr. Crane. Oh, yes. Your father's doing well. He appears to have suffered a mild cardiac event. ? . And what does that mean exactly Basically, it's a warning. He'll need to change his diet, start exercising. Anyway, he should be able to go home tomorrow. What relief. He's going to be okay. No thanks to you. NILES: Look at you. You just stand there with a smile on your face. That's makeup, you idiot. May I remind you all that this was an accident. It was meant as a harmless amusement. I will not stand here and be demonized for this. ! . I am not a monster ) (screaming (screaming continues) Okay, Dad, just take it easy. I'm fine. Hey, there's my guy. Daddy's home fro m the little vacation your brother Frasier sent me on. All right, Dad. Daphne's on her way over to join us for a nice heart-smart dinner. Oh, and, Dad, you really should take a look at this list the hospital sent home with us. Now, the foods that have a little picture of a smiling heart next to them are good for you. Yeah, I cracked that code already. Frasier, I wish you'd stop coddling me. I know you're sorry and you didn't mean to give me a heart attack. Not a heart attack, Dad. A cardiac event. You know, maybe we can look on this as a sign that you should begin a healthier lifestyle. Perhaps one day we'll look back on this it. and you'll thank me for NILES: Oh, yes. Maybe then you can find a nice card for Frasier Iike, \"Now that I'm old and looking back, I thank you for my heart attack. \" Cardiac event. . Here. Give me this, will you No, Dad, here, I'll take this in your room for you. Why don't you just go sit down and rest. Were you able to reach Ronee at her mom's? No. Well, here, you can try now. What? She doesn't need to know every little thing that goes on in my life. Dad, you had a heart attack. Cardiac event. And it's over. - Dad - It's over. Dad, are you afraid she'll start seeing you differently? Well, you see me differently. \"Let me have that suitcase, Dad. \" \"Just sit down and rest. \" I don't need her thinking of me as some feeble old guy. Do you really want to keep such an enormous secret from her? Well, not forever. You and Niles can tell her after I'm dead. (doorbell ringing) Oh, that'll be Daphne. She's not cooking, is she? I just got out of the hospital. Ronee. Surprise, boys. ? . And start pouring. How you doing, sweetie . Hey. Thought you were at your mother's Oh, you know, I cut it short. . It was just too depressing Every since her operation, she just sits around all day Iike she's a hundred. Nice flowers. \"Get well soon\"? Oh, I got those for Frasier. He has a little man problem. Flares up every once in a while. (laughing): Frasier has a man problem. Shut up, you nit. Hey, thank God for antibiotics, huh? I'll be right back, and then you want to go out and get some ribs? Ribs sounds great. her. Well, I'm not telling You heard what she said about her mother. Watch me. And how are you going to explain the fact that you can't eat ribs tonight or the new medication that you're on or the fact that you can't have sex ? . for the next two weeks . Who says? It's on the list What little picture is next to that one? Dad Listen, if she's not able to handle something like this, isn't it better if you know now? Okay, Marty, let's go pig out. Niles, help me put this stuff away, will you? Good seeing you again, Ronee. Yeah, you, too, and I'm glad you're feeling better. Sorry? . You know, your man problem ! . Ha FRASIER: Keep laughing, you're going to have a man problem. Do you mind if we just sit for awhile? No, no, it's fine. You want me to go get you a beer? No, thanks. So, uh did you have good weather over there in Spokane? Oh, God, it rained the entire time. I basically just sat there and made boring small talk with my mother. God, I hate small talk. Oh, tell me. I just hope it doesn't scare her off. Maybe she'll surprise us. Does Ronee ever spend the night here? Yeah, on occasion. Oh, good. 'Cause there's some underwear in this drawer I was really hoping didn't belong to Dad. Oh, look at this. fun. Dad was right-- we're camping and we're having Look how happy we are. No, the car's packed. We're leaving. God, what pains we were. Didn't want to get our hands dirty, didn't want to go fishing, didn't want to sleep on the ground, but he kept taking us year after year just so he could spend time with us. And frighten us to death with stories of hook-armed slashers. You know, no matter how frightened I got, as soon as Dad started laughing again, I knew that everything was safe. I'm not ready to lose him, Niles. Me neither. And I don't want my child to miss knowing him. Who else is going to teach him how to catch a football ball? You know, 1 1 years ago when he moved in here, I couldn't imagine a bigger infringement . on my life Now I can't imagine my life without him. It would be very hard to walk into this apartment and see that chair and know that Dad wasn't here anymore. Oh, I'd get rid of that chair immediately. So you made it from Spokane on one tank? Wow. Yeah, that was really one for the books. Okay, Marty, what's going on? What? Well, I feel like you have something on your mind me. that you're not telling Boy, this is hard. say. I'm just nervous about what you're going to Marty, just , Yesterday I had a mild very mild cardiac event. A what? I had a little heart attack. And that's it? No surgery, home the next day. That's a bee sting. . Did they use the paddles? No . Well, talk to me after they've used the paddles You had the paddles? Let's just say I didn't have the best lipo guy. Well, I'm sorry if it' s not dramatic enough for you. Look, after all that buildup I just thought it would be something bigger, you know, Iike you were going to break up with me or pop the question or something. And FYI, the next time you're in the hospital, I would appreciate a phone call, if it's not too much trouble. . Fine. And FYI, I'm not breaking up with you Well, I know that now. And if I was going to do that other thing, it wouldn't be here. What other thing? Pop the question. Oh. sake. It'd be someplace romantic, for God's Tablecloths. Nice. nice. Damn right it'd be So? So what? So what would you have said ? How should I know? You didn't ask me. So say I am now. . What? Asking you Well, are you or aren't you? am. I Okay then. Okay. ? . Okay, what Okay, I will. Yeah ? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Maybe Dad's right. I'm getting stuck in my ways. I like the way things are. I don't want them to change. Well, don't worry. He's not going anywhere for awhile.
