  "transcript": "1 Oh, the there's a 7:15 at the ArcLight.  Well, that doesn't give us much time to eat.  We can eat afterwards.  I'm not gonna eat at 10:00 at night.  Who am I, Hemingway?  Why do you think Hemingway ate at 10:00?  He spent a lot of time in Spain. They eat dinner late.  He also spent a lot of time in Florida.  Last time I was there, people were eating dinner  at, like, 4:30.  KOOTHRAPPALI: You guys know  that Hemingway had cats with six toes?  Six toes per foot or six toes total?  WOLOWITZ: Okay.  It's official. We're never going to see the Avengers.  Guys, just come on. Make a decision.  I-I'm good with eating after.  - Mm, I'm kind of hungry now. - Yeah, me, too.  - Then we'll eat before. KOOTHRAPPALI: Okay.  So, then, we can see the 3-D at 9:00 or the 2-D at 9:30.  3-D. If I'm gonna see Thor,  I want to feel like I could lick those abs.  Actually, 3-D kind of makes me queasy.  No, but we have to see it in 3-D.  We saw part one in 3-D, and the 2-D part two  is not the part two of the 3-D part one.  He's got you there, Leonard. Or he doesn't.  I don't really care anymore. (laughs)  LEONARD: Okay, then,  we'll go see it in 3-D. PENNY: No.  Sweetie, you shouldn't do things that make you feel bad.  Well, I'm doing this.  And of course he is.  He is a textbook satisficer.  That's not even a word.  Uh, yes, it is.  According to Nobel Prize-winning economist Herbert Simon,  satisficing is a decision-making strategy  whereby a person accepts  whatever available option is satisfactory  rather than seeking out a course of action  that would make him happiest,  as I just did when I explained what satisficing was.  KOOTHRAPPALI: He's right.  No one wanted to hear at.  He knew it, yet he plowed ahead.  I'm just trying to find a plan  that makes everyone happy.  Except you.  Yeah, Leonard. What would make you happy?  I could tell you about satisficing again.  You know, what would make me happy  is if we just stop talking about this  and see whatever movie you guys want to see  whenever you want to see it.  Okay. But next time, we get to pick.  The Big Bang Theory 12x20  The Decision Reverberation Original Air D  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state   Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!   The Earth began to cool   The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools   We built the Wall  We built the pyramids   Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery   That all started with a big bang   Bang!    How's your headache?  It's better. The throwing up really helped.  Mm. I'm so sorry you missed the end of the movie.  Oh, it's okay.  Everyone talked about it so much on the ride home,  I feel like I saw it.  Well, to be fair, you talked about the bathroom so much,  we felt like we saw that, too.  I think I would've been okay  if we weren't sitting so close.  Well, then, why did we sit so close?  Sheldon said, \"Are these seats good for everyone?\"  What was I supposed to do, say no, like a maniac? - (scoffs)  Sweetie, you have got to stand up for yourself.  You know, maybe Sheldon's right.  Maybe you are that word he said.  Satisficer?  Yeah, that! That's the one.  Boy, sounds way more made-up when you say it.  I mean, come on, when was the last time  you did something totally selfish without worrying  about what anyone else wanted?  Uh  according to my mother,  I took my sweet time being born.  How is that selfish?  Apparently, she had dinner reservations.  And this is the telescope room  where I spend a lot of my evenings.  Where's the telescope?  Hawaii.  That's cool.  Yeah, so, you know  aloha.  What's that smell?  Uh, everyone has their own theory.  Dr. Tibourgh thinks it's mold.  I think it's Dr. Tibourgh.  So, what am I looking at?  Ah, this is live information  from the Keck telescope. It's pretty interesting.  So, I recently observed some optical flashes.  It could be light bouncing off a natural object,  but those tend to be less reflective,  so could be evidence of something alien-made.  Oh, this suddenly got exciting.  Oh. When you say \"exciting,\"  do you mean \"go back to my place\" exciting  or \"hold our breath and do it here\"?  Mahalo.  Do I want to ask?  Oh, w when I go upstairs,  Penny's gonna make me choose what we're gonna do tonight  without taking her feelings into consideration,  and I-I don't know if I'm up for it.  Poor baby. When I go upstairs,  Sheldon's gonna give me a 25-minute lecture  about what Hulk would be like if he were made of metal.  Part of his ongoing series,  \"What If Hulk Were Made of Other Things?\"  I-I've always been a people pleaser.  Is that so bad? It's gotten me this far.  What, almost up four flights of stairs?  Okay, if I go in there  and pick something I want to do that she also wants to do,  she's gonna think I'm just picking it to make her happy.  So I feel like  I have to pick something I know she doesn't want to do  or she's gonna be disappointed.  Right? What do you think?  Think I've got ice cream in this bag  that's starting to melt.  I'm sorry.  It's exhausting being in my head.  Look, when you wanted Penny, you didn't care  what anybody else thought or wanted,  including Penny.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah, there was something I wanted,  I went after it and I got it.  Now you're hiding from it on the stairs, so it all worked out.  (door opens) LEONARD: Hey.  I thought about what I want to do tonight,  and I didn't take your feelings into consideration at all.  Great.  I want to have sex.  Wow, sex with your wife.  You're really swinging for the fences there, Hofstadter.  Yeah, we don't have to.  No!  I like it. Let's go.  Oh, o-okay.  And then after that, we're gonna watch  Star Trek: Discovery. - All right.  Well, just a warning, I might be on my phone for most of it.  That's fine.  Wait, you mean just the Star Trek  Actually, I don't care.  And, with apologies to Lady Gaga,  that's how a star is born.  Told you he was gonna mention Lady Gaga.  At least he didn't talk about how much he cried  during that movie.  KOOTHRAPPALI: Although,  if you haven't seen that movie, you should.  I cried so much.  Well, that's the lecture for today.  Uh, let's open it up for questions.  Uh  Oh, you! Sir, yes.  You have a question?  Yeah. Actually, I have a two-part question.  Are you sure? I get the sense it's only one part.  No, no, it's two.  Part one: the new star  you were talking about--  how long did it take that light to reach Earth?  And part two:  is it true you plant your friends in the audience  to ask questions?  46,000 years.  And no, I don't plant my friends,  because apparently, I don't have any.  Uh, any other questions?  - Uh, yes. You, miss. WOMAN: Hi.  I read your paper on specular reflections. It was great.  - Oh, thank you so much. - In your conclusion,  you said you couldn't rule out that light flashes  could be evidence of alien civilization.  So does that mean you think it's aliens?  I was just illustrating that there are many unknowns,  and as scientists, we can't  preemptively rule out possibilities.  So you think it's aliens.  - A-Actually, no, that's WOLOWITZ: I have a question  about the aliens you found.  That's not what I said, Howard.  Hold on a second.  Do you two know each other?  MAN: Yeah.  My sister was--  a-and this is her term-- abducted.  Do you think those could be the same aliens  Okay, any other questions? Mm.  Not about aliens?  What?  Do you still want me to ask the one you gave me?  'Cause it kind of feels like we're past that.  Ooh, Leonard, I don't mean to alarm you,  but the Chinese food smells funny.  That's because it's barbecue.  But it's Chinese food night.  Um, I picked it. You're the one who told me  to stop being such a satisficer all the time.  What? I did not.  I just pointed out that you were one.  It's what I like best about you.  Well, that and those little notes you leave in my lunch.  I leave those!  Well, that's disappointing.  I already know that you heart me.  Now I don't know if Leonard does.  Well, this is what we're having for dinner.  You can eat it or not. I don't care.  I guess that answers the heart question.  I-It's fine. We'll have barbecue.  Oh, of course. I'm nothing if not flexible.  I'm sure that at some point  in the 3,000-year history of the Chinese empire,  a cavalryman crossing  the Gobi Desert was forced by hunger to eat his own horse  and roast it over a campfire,  hence, Chinese barbecue. Let's eat.  Gee, I'm sorry, I didn't watch the news today.  Has the whole world gone mad?  It's my house.  I'm tired of being told where I can and can't sit.  You did this.  Amy, grab your meat. We're leaving in a huff.  I'm sorry, if I don't go now, it's not a huff.  Don't take this the wrong way,  but that was even more exciting than the sex.  Don't take this the wrong way, but yes, it was.  Leonard, where are you going?  Well, to work.  Just trying out a different route.  Okay.  If we cross the county line, it's technically kidnapping.  Well, if you don't approve of my driving, too bad.  This is the new me. Get used to it.  Fine. Then this is the new me,  and he finds the new you tiresome.  How is that different than the old you?  The new me gives knowing winks.  Well, all these years,  I-I was afraid to say what I wanted.  You know, even at work,  you know, there's things I want to accomplish,  but I didn't want to ruffle any feathers or step on any toes.  Feathers and toes? Is the new thing you're trying  to accomplish ballroom dancing with a chicken?  Look at that-- the new me is hilarious.  Always wanted to be the principal investigator  on a plasma physics study.  Hey, look at that-- the new you's funny, too.  I'm serious. You know  I'm gonna put together a proposal  and tell President Siebert this is what I want to do.  If he doesn't let me,  there's plenty of other universities that will.  Sure there are.  Of course you don't want me to do that,  because you like it when you're successful and I'm not.  No, you're confusing causation and  \"Welcome to Alhambra.\" Where the heck are we?  Now I'm some sort of big joke.  I'm even on some alien conspiracy blog.  See? \"Caltech astrophysicist  finds proof of alien life''  Wow, that is not a great picture of you.  That's not the point.  Dr. Koothrappali.  I'm surprised to see you in here. Why is that?  Because the truth  is out there!  (laughing)  You see? That's what I'm talking about.  People have been doing that to me all day.  Relax. They're just having fun.  (Koothrappali sighs)  Oh, come on!  See? It's fun.  (chuckles)  Wow. DÃ©jÃ  vu.  Amy, you're a neuroscientist--  you know the latest research into dÃ©jÃ  vu suggests  it's nothing but the frontal regions of the brain  attempting to correct an inaccurate memory.  You telling me stuff I already know  is definitely dÃ©jÃ  vu.  How about telling me something I don't know,  like why you're sitting on the stairs.  How can I tell if I'm doing something for a noble reason  or a selfish reason?  Try saying the thing in your head  and see if you can add the words, \"That'll show 'em.\"  Leonard's about to demand a job  that I don't think the university will give him.  I'm worried he's making a giant mistake.  But maybe I only think that because  deep down I don't want him to succeed.  The fact that you're worried about your motivation  supports the idea that you genuinely care for your friend.  I do.  Thank you, Amy.  You know what?  After I've talked to Leonard,  you've earned yourself a bonus lecture on Sponge Hulk.  That'll show me.  So, I spent the whole day putting together this proposal,  and tomorrow I'm gonna tell President Siebert  that this is what I want to do.  Oh. Well, this  looks great.  - You didn't even open it. - Well, no,  it's got a nice, you know,  science-y heft to it. I  Really proud of you, sweetie.  Leonard?  - Hmm? - Um,  I have been agonizing  over whether or not to say something to you.  Aw. Let me help. Don't.  I have to.  I don't think that you should demand to be in charge  of a plasma project.  Well, big surprise.  You can't stand the idea of me succeeding.  No. I'll be honest.  New assertive Leonard is going to take some getting used to.  But so did cargo pants Leonard, hmm?  Who, for the record, I miss.  He always had gum.  Sheldon, if this is what he wants, he should ask for it.  I mean, what's the worst that happens? They say no.  Well, I'm not gonna let them say no.  If they don't want me to quit, this is what it's gonna take.  Wait, you're gonna quit?  Yeah. It's like you said, I have to go after what I want,  and if I can't get that at Caltech,  there are plenty of other universities in the world.  W In the world? (laughs)  I can't even get you to go to the beach,  and now you want to move to the world?  Well, I don't want to, but if that's what I have to do  Okay, don't you think  threatening to quit your job is something  you should run by me first?  You said I shouldn't worry about your feelings.  I meant feelings about things that I don't care about!  Now, I'm not quite sure when to jump in here  - Not now. - Okay.  Fine, you want to talk about it? Let's talk about it.  I-I'm not loving my job right now.  And this is something that would make me happy.  Don't you want me to be happy?  Oh, I've been dinged on this before.  Whatever you really think, you have to say yes.  - Of course I want you to be happy. - Well played.  Okay, I know this seems scary,  but I put together a strong proposal.  It's good for me, it's good for the university.  They're gonna give it to me.  No.  I'm sorry, President Siebert,  but I'm not taking no for an answer.  I speak a little Russian.  Will you take nyet for an answer?  I'm serious.  Oh. Well, that changes everything.  - Really? - Nyet.  I know a lot of people have been having fun  claiming that I said I found alien life.  (chuckles) I want to make it clear  that is not what I said.  I did say that was one possible explanation.  I don't think that's something to mock.  Right? It would be arrogant for us to assume  that we are alone in the universe.  And as scientists, we need to remain open  to the possibility that the truth may sound silly  or far-fetched.  Uh, the round Earth. Germs that cause diseases.  Subatomic particles.  All these at one time seemed fanciful.  So who's to say what science fiction of today  will be the reality of tomorrow?  Will there be colonies on Mars?  Uh, matter transporters?  Perhaps the Loch Ness Monster is real.  Who knows? I'm just saying that  the only way science moves forward  is to follow the evidence wherever it leads,  even if it makes us sound crazy sometimes.  Hey, Bernie, look at this.  \"Caltech astrophysicist claims  Loch Ness Monster is real.\"  (giggles)  - Hey. How did it go? - Great.  What, so you got the job?  I did not.  So you quit? Okay, Leonard, I can't move.  I just bought a six-month membership to SoulCycle.  Well, I-I didn't quit.  I said I was going to.  I walked out the door and started crying.  You know, \"Oh, my, God, oh, my God, oh, my God, what'd I do?\"  And then he called me back in.  (gasps) Then he changed his mind?  He did not.  I'm really confused about  how to react to this story.  President Siebert didn't want to lose me.  Even though they couldn't make me  a lead investigator on a plasma team,  there was an opening for a co-lead  on a photon entanglement team.  How cool is that?  You're gonna have to tell me.  It's really cool.  Yay! Oh, I am so happy for you.  I almost got what I wanted, and it never would have happened  if you hadn't almost believed in me. - Oh.  Let's celebrate. What do you want to do?  Oh, please don't make me decide another thing. (sighs)  Hey, you want to go to SoulCycle with me?  Give me a minute, I'll think of something.  Now, I know what You're you're thinking:  isn't Broccoli Hulk basically just the Jolly Green Giant?  That is what I was thinking.  Let's never discuss it again.  Really?  - Are you hiding from Penny again? - No. No, no, no.  I-I went to SoulCycle with her, and my legs hurt so bad, I  literally can't stand up.  Sheldon, why don't you keep him company.  All right.  Hello, Leonard. Hey.  (sighs)  Have you ever wondered  what the Hulk would be like if he were made of sherbet?  I give up.  Delicious.",
