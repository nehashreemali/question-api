  "transcript": "So you know in horror movies when the girl's like: \"Oh, my God, there's something in the basement. Let me just run down there in my underwear and see what's going on.\" And you're like, \"What is your problem? Call the police.\" She's like, \"Okay,\" but it's too late because she's getting murdered? Well, my story's kind of like that. JESS: It's a surprise for Spencer. I'm gonna walk in, gonna drop my coat on the ground. He says he had this fantasy that I'm a stripper with a heart of gold and he's helping me put myself through college. He didn't say the college part, did he? Um, no. I wanted to create a three-dimensional sex character. CECE: Really? What's your stripper name? Uh Rebecca Johnson. Your stripper name's Rebecca Johnson? Boobies Johnson. \"Two Boobs\" Johnson. Look at you, in the back of the cab, totally naked. I am so proud of you. Hello. - I came home early. - Jess. What-- ? Who's Jess? You're talking to Tiger Boobs. Oh. [SCATTlNG.] Uh [SlNGlNG.] I'm doing sexy things with a pillow - Just-- - She's doing sexy stuff To the plant right-- - Whoa, okay. - I'll pick that up later Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess. So that happened. That's why I need a new apartment. I'm sorry, what was the question again? Do you have any pets? - Who's that girl? - Who's that girl? - Who's that girl? - Who's that girl? It's Jess You know what's funny? When I saw your ad on Craigslist, I thought you were women. [LAUGHlNG.] We're all Why would you think that? That's crazy. - I mean, what-- ? - Schmidt wrote the ad. Oh. I guess it was something about the words you used. It was like, \"sun-soaked\" and \"beige-y.\" [COACH & NlCK LAUGHlNG.] SCHMlDT: Okay. - What are you doing? COACH: Wow. SCHMlDT: Mm-hm. What about these? These look beige-y to you? Sorry. I'm his trainer, so it's kind of the house that Coach built right here. What are we looking at? Baby smooth. This is LLS. Ladies Love Schmidt. What? What did you just say? Go put a dollar in the jar right now. SCHMlDT: Are you serious? COACH: Yeah. - Now. - Damn it. LLS? What is wrong with you? This place is beautiful. It gets so much light. Spencer hated light. - It's hard to say his name. SCHMlDT: It's okay. Nick knows. He got dumped. Dumped. Yeah, I got dumped. I can't hear you. That means we're not breaking up. - I can't hear you. La-la-la! - I'm breaking up with you. Yeah, I got dumped. She dumped me. And I'm over it. Okay? It was six months ago, guys. Get past it. I don't even know why we're still talking about it. Why's everybody looking at me? You know what, I wanna live here. Actually, I still have some questions. No offense, you know, but we barely know you. Yeah, okay, yeah. So full disclosure  I'm kind of emotional right now because of the breakup so I'll probably be watching Dirty Dancing at least six or seven times a day. Um, I'm a teacher, so I bring home a lot of Popsicle sticks, stuff like that. Also, I like to sing to myself a lot. [SlNGlNG.] A lot I'm tired of living with my friend. She's a model. All her friends are models. - Uh, how soon can you move in? - Schmidt, slow up. - Not happening. - Okay, could you give us a second? - I just gotta I gotta talk to my boys. - \"My boys\" is not a thing. - My bros. - Douche-bag jar. SCHMlDT: For what? NlCK: For \"my bros.\" I'm gonna say yes. Her friends are models. Okay, you guys? Models. I say no. I need to be able to come home from work sit on my couch and let my beans out, let them breathe. Nick, it's all you, buddy. First let me say, I think you guys make interesting points points I respect, but I will say this. I have lived with a woman, Caroline and I know there are pros and I know there are real cons. - Nick, you're weak! - Okay, pro, they smell nice. Cons, every once in a while, the mood changes and you're not sure why. They'll ruin your life if you let them. They'll break down your will to live. - Pros, they're good at folding. - Make a decision! I'm sorry. But another pro, like - Oh, don't do it. - I'm gonna. Put it down. Don't hood me. You guys don't know what you're talking about. - I know what I'm talking about. - Pushed him too hard. We did. How about this? Executive decision. - She's in. JESS: Yay, I'm in. You are not gonna regret this. [JESS SOBBlNG.] [ON TV.] Had the time of my life No, I never felt like this before Yes, I swear it's the truth What have you done, Schmidt? [JESS BLOWS NOSE.] I gotta go, Mom. No, I'm not watching Dirty Dancing. No, I don't think so. Are you gonna murder me because you're a stranger I met on the lnternet? - Yes, I am. - He says no. No, look, I gotta go, okay? All right, love you. Bye. SCHMlDT: So the Wild West party's on Saturday. I'm trying to get us in, but you may need to call Caroline. - I'm not calling Caroline. Shh. - Nick, hear me out-- [SlNGlNG.] Had the time of my life We are in this situation because of you. JESS: I hate your face! Spencer, I love you. - lt has been a week of this madness. - I'm going crazy, Schmidt. I can't take it. - Know what? I got this. [ON TV.] I've been waiting for so long Hi, Coach. Stop it. Stop. [SOBBlNG.] - Schmidt. - Okay, all right. I got us into this, I'm gonna get us out. Jess, I'm gonna take the remote. Pshew. All right, all right. Hey, Jess, how you doing? You look fantastic. Listen, what if you came out with us tonight? You know, after work. We'll fix you up, we'll take you out, we'll get you a rebound. - A rebound? - Yeah. I don't know if I'm ready. You're totally ready. I'll take you through the whole thing. You know, I'll be like your guide. Like Gandalf through Middle-earth? Probably not like-- Okay. First of all, let's take the Lord of the Rings references Iet's put them in a deep, dark cave where no one's gonna find them, ever. Except Sméagol. [WHlSPERlNG.] He lives in a cave. You know what, Jess, come on. Let's just take the head off the couch. Come on. Sit up, girl. There you go. Look at that. Doesn't that feel good? There we go. [lN NORMAL VOlCE.] I think that sounds nice. [SlNGlNG.] She's going out to find a rebound Who's that girl? It's Jess Wait, did you just make up a theme song for yourself? I'm gonna fix it. I'm not calling my ex-girlfriend to get you into a party. This party is everything to me. Please, Nick. We go every year. You have no idea what I'm going through at work. I'm trying to do my work. I'm trying to do a good job here. Nice tie. Can I borrow a tampon? [WOMEN LAUGHlNG.] - Schmidt, I'm not calling her. - Listen to me. Knowing that I will be going to the Wild Wild West Charity Auction for Poverty reminds me that I'm still a man and I can still motorboat a hot girl who is also a member of the Cherokee Nation which is not racist, because it is for a good cause. JESS: Somebody's in here. - We're leaving in 10. You shave your legs? JESS: I will now. - Front and backs? JESS: Yes. - Thank you. - I'm gonna kill myself. - Call Caroline. - You call her when you're drunk. - Don't know to what you are referring. [lN ENGLlSH ACCENT.] Hello, Caroline. I still love you. So much. [lN NORMAL VOlCE.] So much. I'm not calling her. Schmidt, I know you really wanna go to this party but wouldn't it be better to find a girl who you really care about to motorboat? Then maybe, if you're super-lucky you might find a girl who'll motorboat you right back. I don't think she knows what motorboating is. SCHMlDT: Jess, we are leaving in five. - Hey. Hey, Coach, what's-- ? Oh! Sorry. Uh, my boss says that I don't know how to talk to women, which is ridiculous. Spin, woman! Spin! Aah! - I am spinning! - Go! - You're so mean! - I'm not mean, I'm trying to help you! I'm trying to help you! So I was wondering if you could help me out with that. Sure, sure, absolutely. Um Well, first of all, maybe think about what women like to talk about. - You know, like use me for practice. - All right. Um, ahem. Shopping. Is that fun for you guys? Yeah. Shopping's fun. Uh, the other day, I bought a pair of jeggings. They look like jeans, but they're really leggings. Uh Uh You I Who cares?! Sorry. Um Good job. A couple things you could work on. Uh One, lowering your voice. - Right on. - Um, two, listening. - Uh, three, rage. - Absolutely. - Um, four - Your hair is on fire. [HlP-HOP MUSlC PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS.] Beers and a rosé.

You wanna forget about Spencer you're gonna have to do some very, very bad things with that man right over there. - How bad? - Real bad, Jess. Real bad. Like a make-out sesh, no tops. Okay, this is what-- This is what's gonna happen. You're gonna go over there and you're gonna stand next to him and you're gonna smile. You're not gonna smile like that. You look like a hungry badger. - Stop that. - Okay, I got this, I got this. You got it. Go make it happen. COACH: Get 'em up! Grind it out. SCHMlDT: Go do it. Grind it out! Ha, ha! Hey, sailor. - Oh.

Well, I've never really been great at this stuff, so [SlNGlNG.] What if God was one of us? Make it stop! Just a slob like one of us Look at us. Couple of losers. We both got dumped. Jeesh. I'm fine. Six months ago, so Do you know why she dumped you? She must have hurt you bad. It made no difference to me. I wanted to set her trash on fire. So you were always just, like, wondering, like, \"What was it? Was there something I could have done differently?\" You know what happens to people who keep it all inside? They get old, and they get sad, and they get weird. Then you're the old man yelling at the kids running across your yard. And you're telling them, \"Don't run across my yard. My life's filled with regret.\" You know, you can't just pretend like it didn't happen. Or I could pretend to be more like you, Jess and live on a sparkly rainbow and drive a unicorn around and just sing all the time. Yeah, I think you should sing all the time. No, I was being mean. I'm not gonna do that. Why not? It's fun. Because I have a penis. [SlNGlNG.] My name is Nick I have a penis And I'm not gonna let any feelings out Okay, Jess, your left boob is resting on a plate of chicken wings. Yeah. I know. Hey. I'm Peter. - What are you drinking? JESS: Oh, I'll have another pink wine. PETER: I like your glasses. JESS: They help me see. [LAUGHS.] - She's doing all right. - Mm-hm. Schmidt stain.
