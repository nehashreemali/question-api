You don't know me like that, but I need a TV. - Do you have a TV at Spencer's? - Yeah, I do. - It's just really big and thin and bright. - Go get it. No, I can't call Spencer I haven't talked to him since he cheated on me with that ho. Actually, that's not fair. She might be a really nice ho. I just don't wanna fight with Spencer. I wanna be friends eventually. Why do you wanna be friends with your ex? I don't wanna be friends with Caroline, and all she did was rip me open and tear out my heart with her perfect, perfect hands. He has a power over me. It's like he's a wizard and I'm his mage. I think it's his hair. He has this, like, really beautiful hair and whenever I see it, I get the whoo-whoos. - Oh, my God, I hate my life. - All right, guys. Jess, look. Jess, I know. Closure.

It's parfait. - Come on. Don't. - Oh, hello, you look beautiful today. - And smart. - Stop talking to me, Schmidt. - So you're making all the calls now. - Sure. - This must mean you are the top dog. - Yeah? Absolutely. You know, I'm glad you guys think that, because, you know, I think that too. One hundred percent. When I moved out, obviously there was a power vacuum. SCHMlDT: Mm-hm. - Yeah, I needed a leader. I didn't know which end was up. No, Nick's a bottom. You know what I mean. Absolutely. Say, Winston, do all top dogs need the biggest room or I don't know, is that kind of cheesy? Is it overkill? No, but I definitely see what you're saying though, definitely. Every top dog is different, every top dog is different. Hey, Schmidt, what kind of top dog are you? The kind with the big room. I'm so glad we're talking. Last time I saw you, you were so mad. - How's, um? - Rochelle. - Rochelle. Fancy name. - She's great. - Rochelle, like a mermaid. - Yeah. Hello, I'm Rochelle. I eat fish. Yeah, we have a lot in common. Obviously we both love bikes. - I love bikes. - Not enough. Um Spencer, I need my stuff back. My TV and all my winter clothes - and my plants. - Of course. I would have brought it today but I rode my bike here, you know, without the basket. When would be a good time for me to come-- ? - It's so good to see you. Shh. - Spencer, I really need my-- I need something too. [ON RADlO.] This here's a jam for all the fellas Thanks for taking me to the airport, Jess. Of course. All you have is your bike, Rochelle.

I'm gonna write down a figure and this is as high as I'll go. You drew a smiley face. I'm a teacher. Do it for the kids. For the kids, 550. I can't go home without a TV. I thought pawnshops were about helping people. And frankly, right now I feel taken advantage of. And I just got out of a long relationship and I don't know what I'm doing emotionally or, let's be honest, sexually. I'll just get out of here. Are you trying to rob me? [MAN SPEAKlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY ON PHONE.] - Hey, where's Winston at, man? - I think he's in his room, Schmidt. You really think I'm top dog? - Yes. - You think I'm head baller, shot caller? Yes, Schmidt, I feel that way. See that, man? That's my new thumb ring. How choice is that? Little skull. It's so nectar. - Did you just make up \"nectar\"? - No, it's a volleyball term. What is Winston doing there? He can't hang out in there. It's too small. NlCK: What's up? SCHMlDT: Yo, what up, Cece? - Hey, are you all right? - I'm sorry, I didn't get the TV. - What happened? - Ugh. I'm a terrible roommate. You guys told her to call Spencer?

I'm supposed to pick her up next Sunday. - Oh, my God, Jess. - What's wrong with me? I figured it out. This guy's your kryptonite. You need to stand up and you need to fight him. I tried to fight him, but I can't, because I'm powerless. You're not ready to let him go. I think you know deep down, once you get your stuff back you know, it's \"over\" over. I can't believe I'm actually gonna say this, but I agree with him. No, you guys are wrong. I really wanna move on. - You gotta fight. - All right, I wanna fight. - And get mad. - I wanna get mad. All right, then do this. Pretend this is Spencer's face. Punch it. Get him. Go on, do it again. Punch it like a man. - Harder than that. CECE: Come on, Jess. - Come on Jess, you're angry. Good.

Stay here until you find a better place to live. I don't like you, stretch. I don't like anything about you. - And I'm not afraid to-- - I got this. I've got a place to live, Spence. It's over. I spent six years trying to figure you out. All you are is a guy with really beautiful hair. I'm happy you cheated on me. Thank you, because if you hadn't, I would have married you. And then you would have hurt me all over again. And, yeah, I was scared to start over. I didn't know what to do. And, yeah, I'm living with three guys I met on the lnternet. And, yeah, stranger danger is real. But I love these guys. I barely know them, I just met him, but I love them. NlCK: I would just take it easy with the love stuff. All of them.

Yeah, well, I thought you were the love of my life, so Suck it, Mr. Crabs. - You hit that guy. - Whatevs. You know. [CHUCKLES.] You know what? Maybe I didn't have respect for you before because if this is what respecting you feels like this is definitely not how I felt. So you recognize. Represent, what? Okay, look, I'm gonna be completely honest. I've been messing with you. It's just that I wanted my old room back. You know, you're right. I've been away a long time and things have changed here. So I guess I kind of gotta get used to that. You can keep the big room. See, now you're just deep dogging me, man. I'm not scared of your mind games. I'm taking the small room, Winston. - Schmidt, that's not what I mean-- - No. Listen to what I mean. You can double reverse dog me until the cows come home. I'm not falling for it. What do you take me for, some kind of idiot? [WHlSPERlNG.] Yes. - Can't believe I got all my stuff back. - You did, but most of it's broken. Yeah, it's broken, but, I don't know, it's mine.
