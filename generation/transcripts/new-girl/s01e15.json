You're a comedian, Schmidt. Hike! Schmidt! Come on! [NlCK GRUNTS THEN YELLS.] Oh. Did you see that? - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay. [GROANlNG.] JESS: Nick. NlCK: Oh, my God! JESS: Nick, I'm so sorry. - This is real! - Probably lateral sizer. Shut up! Okay, let's go. [SCREAMlNG.] - Rotator cuff? JESS: Can l-- ? - What do you need? NlCK: Nothing. Please go far from me right now. I can taste my spine. - Three or your four down there. Vertebrae. - Why is no one helping me? Not you! Not you! [SlNGlNG.] Hey, girl What you doing? Hey, girl Where you going? - Who's that girl? CHORUS: Who's that girl? - Who's that girl? CHORUS: Who's that girl? It's Jess [NlCK GROANlNG.] Are you sure you're okay? You're walking like a Disney witch. Let me drive to your doctor. I don't have a doctor. I don't have insurance. Nick, you need to see a doctor, if only to make sure your junk is clean. - Don't go to doctors. JESS: I'll take you to Sadie. - Just look at you. She won't charge you. - I don't go to doctors! - Are you sure you're okay driving? - I'm fine. I've never been better. I'm great. Thank you. [ENGlNE STARTS.] Feeling better already. See you guys back at the loft. [CRASH.] JESS: Oh, my God! - Oh! - What did you just-- ? NlCK: I'm okay. - I'm okay. Don't worry. WlNSTON: What did you do? You hit my car! NlCK: I'm okay. WlNSTON: Oh. Oh, Winston, relax. Okay? Relax. That's all I did. I did this. The rest was already there. Actually, I think I undid a dent there. I'm taking you to see my friend. - Jess, no. - Now! So she's fitting us in between patients. [NlCK GROANS.] Jess is Sadie a gynecologist? - No, she's an OB/GYN. - I'm gonna go. - Different thing. - I'm gonna get out of here. - Yeah? I don't think you are. - Aah. [GROANlNG.] Nick, she's a wizard with a speculum. - Nick. - I don't have a vagina. - You can take mine. JESS: Ha-ha. - I heard that, sister. - True that. NlCK: Oh! - Ha, ha. Okay, you know what, Nick? I'm sorry that my only doctor friend is a gynecologist but you're broke, so you're gonna have to shut your mouth and you're gonna tag the things you want in this Lucky magazine. We'll have to put this baby to bed. No, Sherman, look, I don't think you understand, man. This car has been with me through everything, so if you could just fix it. - This is not officially a car anymore. - You didn't even buy the thing. Given to you as an illegal recruitment gift from a college you didn't even go to. Things happened in this car. - Desert Storm? - Oh, things happened. WOMAN: Is this your car? - Yeah. Cool. Anytime. - Time to buy a new car. - You buy a new car. I bought a new car. It's what you borrow every morning when this one makes the weird sound. [lMlTATlNG ENGlNE SPLUTTERlNG.] - Not a good sound. - The keys. You shouldn't call them keys. It's a paperclip that you start the car with. [ENGlNE SPLUTTERlNG.] SCHMlDT: See? That was the noise I was telling you about. WlNSTON: Shut up. You don't have to sit like that. It's the only way that it feels okay, Jess. - Jess. - Sadie. - Hey. - Hey. How are you? Good. How are you? - Good to see you again, Nick. - Hey. SADlE: Hi. - We were playing football, I tackled him. - That's not exactly how I saw it. I'm surprised you got hurt. Such a big boy. Jess tackled a girl I was dating once. Oh, yeah. She tried to steal my overalls. - Okay, so does that hurt? - Yeah, yeah. Yes! - All right. Does that hurt? - Aah, ha, ha. Ow! - All right. He can flip over. - Okay. Okay. So listen. This is not an official examination. I am not officially telling you you bruised your spine and I'm not officially giving you these pills to manage the pain. Okay. - So - Thank you. - Don't take those pills. - Take the pills. SADlE: Don't take those. JESS: Take the pills. - Nobody prescribed them. - Take them. - No. - That's a code. Take them. SADlE: That's bad. Don't do that. - That means do it. SADlE: No. Those are designed for severe menstrual cramps, so they should cure your baby backache. JESS: Baby backache. Wait. Stop. Hey, take another sip of water. - Yeah. JESS: What? - What's wrong? - Your thyroid. I noticed something while swallowing. Mind? - I don't know what choice I have. JESS: Do it. Okay, Jess. Stop. Yeah, he has a growth. - Oh, my God. A growth. - Oh, no. Everything works. JESS: Oh, my God. - I know what you're talking about. - You knew about this? - Yes. - So you've had it checked out? - I don't have that stuff checked out. I'm fine. I can set up an ultrasound tomorrow morning. Got a friend. - I can't afford an ultrasound, but-- - You're gonna have to. JESS: Yeah. SADlE: All right. - So I'll set that up? - Absolutely. SADlE: Make sure he goes, Jess. - Don't look at me like that. - It's probably nothing. Yeah, it's nothing. Oh, God. Put the baby's head at the bottom. I'm not gonna go tomorrow. I'm really not, because I don't wanna get an ultrasound. I don't have time. I've got some writing I got to do. The truth is with working out, I've got some people to see so I just can't make it. I lost a stamp. Sounds worse than it is. It's a somewhat expensive stamp and I had planned on looking for it. One of the reasons I moved to Los Angeles was to get closer to whales, record them. I haven't got around to it. Where we live is actually east. It's way farther from the ocean than I expected. I appreciate your concern. It's nice. But this machine is still kicking. You're going. And I know you're scared. But you know what my mom used to do when I got scared? A Daffy Duck impression. - Don't do what you're about to do. - [LlSPlNG.] Nicholas. I'm sorry you have a lump in your throat. That's despicable! [lN NORMAL VOlCE.] Sorry. Too much? - Okay. I gotta go to work. - I'll come with you. - Absolutely not. - I'll sit by the bar. No way. [POP MUSlC PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS.] One more time You told them, Jess? Really, it's not a big deal. - Don't tell them. - We're just hanging out. - With my best friend. - Come on, Schmidt. What are you do-- ? Pfft! You just Fredo-kiss me? What's your problem? Go sit down. - You're gonna beat this. - I don't have anything. What is going on with you guys? Thanks for telling them. I take those too, when I got a heavy flow. Good to know. - Hey. - Hey. So I heard. Of course you did. Can I get a vodka soda? Thank you. You being normal-- - Vodka soda. - Okay. It's because he refuses to wear a Bluetooth. I gave him one for his birthday too, but he just laughed in my face. Gave it back to me for Hanukkah. Well, according to this website, it could be a colloid nodule. But that's most common in golden retrievers. I thought my lifestyle choices would rub off on him. Tried to set a good example. Treat your body like a temple. Treat your body like a temple. But he treats his like a dump. Like a dump. Let me see this. - Oh, my God. - Hey, hey. My friends. Can I just say that these pills are amazing? I feel, like, really warm in my uterus. Oh. I feel good. Feel real good. What's with the long faces? - Schmidt? - Just looking at you - and your beautiful soul. - Big, strong Nick. He's a champ. I wish I could trade places with you, because I would do it in a second. I'm also glad that I can't. - Okay, what is going on with you three? JESS: Oh, God. - Jess? Hey, are you okay? - Oh, God. - You're gonna freak him out. - Why are you crying? - Schmidt, are you crying? - You're making me cry with your emotions. [WlNSTON SOBBlNG.] Really, Winston? You? - Just that I love you so much. - Stop it. Enough. Hey, I'm fine. - Just stop it. - How do you know you're fine, Nick? Is that-- ? Would that be where-- ? In my neck? Hm. I'm not gonna lie. I think the pills are on top of me a little bit. I think you're right. It's so sad. It's sad your friend is getting an ultrasound tomorrow. It's just so hard. [SCHMlDT SlGHS.] Are you using your best friend's medical crisis to feel my boobs with your face? Why isn't the whole world making love all at the same time? How many ears does Daniel Boone have? He's got a right ear, a left ear and a front-ear. \"Frontier.\" Get it? [BOTH CHUCKLlNG.] You don't get to speak at my funeral. - Heh. What? - For sure. One hundred percent. What? Why? - Because of that joke. - Yeah, but-- Jess, you don't wanna talk at a funeral. I've tried that once. What kind of dummy fixes a washing machine using a knife? This kind of dummy! It did not go well. I don't want you talking at my funeral! - Okay. - You can go to my funeral but you can't talk. My funeral is my time to shine. I want the girls to think: \"l wish I brought Nick Miller to orgasm.\" I want the guys to think: \"l wish I bought him more stuff.\" And I don't want Daffy Duck voices and feeling sticks. You don't know how to be real. I can't have you trying to cheer people up. I know how to be real. Question: Am I wearing a hat? SCHMlDT: Nick Miller. Almost a lawyer. [PlANO PLAYlNG.] [SlNGlNG.] This is a sad song Oh. This is the saddest song in the world Yes, it is. WlNSTON: Mm. This is the saddest-- - You just keep singing, man. - Okay.

Never does anything. [PlANO CLANGS.] What? You want me to get real and stop being cutesy and whatever, fine. Let's get real. You don't do anything. What did you wanna do? Isn't there something you wanted to accomplish? Hey, I've done things. I wrote half a book about zombies. Okay, just tell me. If you could do anything what would you do? You know, I'm the guy who-- I can't just jump into something if I don't know what's gonna happen. I never have been that guy. Like, I'm the guy that-- If I don't know what's gonna happen, I don't do something. Ever. I don't care how bad I wanna do it. I don't do it. Like, if everybody would go into the ocean and jumped in the water I'm the guy on the beach guarding the wallets. All right. - All right, Nick. - All right. - Get out there. I'll hold your wallet. - Don't have one. Well, that's fine. I've a sandwich bag with my license and money in it. Okay, I'll hold your sandwich bag. Get out there, go. It's a little cold. Heh, heh. Just in terms of running into the water, it's a tad on the cold side. Well, you know what? Just It's just [NlCK & JESS CHUCKLlNG.] [YELLlNG.] We taking our shoes off? What's going on? I'm a little drunk, and I can't be too sure but I think you're finally about to see your best friend's penis. Nick-- He's gonna-- He's gonna show his penis to the ocean and not me? Nick, wait! [LAUGHlNG.] I'm alive! I am alive! I'm alive! [NlCK YELLS.] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! This is stupid! Aah! It's cold! My testicles are in my abdomen! [NlCK SHOUTlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY.] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! That is so cold! That is so cold! - Words can't describe how cold that is. - You okay? No, I'm not okay, Jess! I'm not okay! I woke up today and I wanted to play a friendly game of touch football then I hurt my back, and I went to your gynecologist and now I might have cancer! So, no, Jess! I'm not okay! I don't think this is the right time to bring this up, you guys but does anyone else think Nick could stand to lose 5 to 7 pounds? You know what I'm thinking about, Cece? What, Schmidt? That when you stand up there's gonna be, like, a perfect imprint of your butt in the sand. That is what you're thinking about now, with your best friend going through what he's going through? - Then why would you say that? - I don't know why. Why would anyone say that? I've never gone through anything like this. Yeah, well, I have. What happened? My dad died when I was 12. - That's, um-- - Only way to get through it is to get through it. - I had a cat that died. - Don't compare my dad to your cat. It was a big cat. I mean, human-size.

[LAUGHS.] - Yeah, we should go home. - Yes. Let's go home. Hey. We gotta wake up. - It's morning. - What? Hey, Schmidty! [WHlSTLES.] Wake up! Everybody, up! Everybody, up. I got that ultrasound thing. We're late. CECE: What? Oh. Hey, Winston. We're late, man. SCHMlDT: Enough fresh air. Back to the fume chamber. NlCK: Couldn't even sell it for metal. WlNSTON: Hope you didn't get sand in my car. SCHMlDT: That's this car's problem, too much sand. Oh, my God, there's soot coming in from the floor. [YAWNS.] Hi. My name is Nick Miller.

I do have a check that's postdated. There's a 60-40 shot that's gonna clear. I hope that's good. Jess-- Oh, yeah. Do I have to do this now? How long does it take to tell if someone has cancer? NlCK: Guys. - Hey. I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm fine. It's nothing. Yeah. - What did they say it was? - I didn't hear anything after they said: \"You don't have cancer.\" I blanked out.
