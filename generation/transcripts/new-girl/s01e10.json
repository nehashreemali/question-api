SCHMlDT: Yeah. Apparently, my business isn't as important as Frankie Muniz's. They canceled. There's nothing I can do. The party's off. You should torch them on Yelp. I can do it. I have an account under the name Fantastic Jacques. He's a French diplomat with very little patience. Or you could just get another bus. In two days? Heh. Okay. Yeah, sure, Winston. Why don't I just go down to the party bus store where all the party buses have a state-of-the-art sound system a stripper pole, a love grotto and a steering wheel in the shape of a boob.

I can feel my \"it\" factor going away. - What am I gonna tell Benjamin? - Why are you worried about Benjamin? - He's your friend. - We have a very weird girl-style friendship where we kind of hate each other. We're \"bronemies.\" He's my \"fremesis.\" I'm so confused right now. Okay, Benjamin and l were suitemates in college. I can't wait to get to L.A. We're gonna have so much sex. In the morning, in the afternoon, at bedtime. Mm, peanuts. I'm telling you, I'm gonna run that town one day. You'll see.

I guess I'll just never be cool enough, Jess. get sidetracked Okay, I've got it. We are gonna throw Schmidt a birthday party. - No. - Yes, it's his 29th birthday and we care. Schmidt's world is different than ours. They speak a different language. They shorten every word to one syllable. Okay, he once called an oven an \"ovs.\" He calls an airport \"airp.\" - He called ketchup \"ketch.\" - Last month he went to a party called \"Bros Before Ho's on the Moon.\" What does that even mean? The dress code was \"yacht flair.\" - What? - Schmidt has a friend who legally - changed his name to Doinit. - Ted Doinit. Just one word: Doinit. You are not emotionally, mentally and spiritually prepared to throw these D-bags a party. I'm gonna do some research. Actually, I'm sorry, I do have to go. Where you going? Why you wearing - jury-duty pants? - I'm not, man, I'm just-- Mumble, mumble. Come on, it's a lawyer party, it's a classic fifth date. What are you talking about? I'm not gonna apologize. - Nothing to apologize for. I owe you nothing. - I'm having a fun time. I love wearing a Bill Cosby sweater in front of lawyers younger than me. [lMlTATES BlLL COSBY.] Hello, I'm Bill Cosby. Do you like pudding? My son's name is Theo and his best friend is Cockroach. - That supposed to be Cosby? - [lN NORMAL VOlCE.] As good as I can do. - Let's see yours. - How he sounds? [lMlTATES BlLL COSBY.] I want to get some more pudding. That's the worst Bill Co-- How about this? [lMlTATES BlLL COSBY.] I got a daughter named Rudy Huxtable, and she's the cutest of all my daughters. [lN NORMAL VOlCE.] I'm really glad that you're here with me. [lN NORMAL VOlCE.] Yeah, I'm happy you let me be here. No, I really am because I gotta kiss all the asses of these 24-year-old law students to try to get them to work here. - I went to law school. - You went to law school? Yes. I quit. - Quit law school, why? - Yes. Because I realized I hated lawyers. He says to the lawyer. And for some reason, I find you ridiculously attractive for saying that. Why don't you kiss my ass, then? Look, Julia, I got turned around. I thought we were doing a flirty-- I'm just kidding. I do want to do that. Oh, you would? We can make that happen. - Great. - Let's go. - Let's go to your place. - Go to your place. Do you mind? Are you married or what? No, no, no. I'm not married. I am the opposite of married. Before you, there was nothing. I've got, like, no girls on the horizon. In a hot way. Then why don't you ever invite me to your place? Or, like, tell me all that much about yourself? It's weird. I don't even know where you live. I'm 30 years old, and I live in a loft with three roommates. In a hot way. [lMlTATES BlLL COSBY.] But maybe you can kiss my butt when I talk like Bill Cosby. - All right, let's go. Uh-huh. - ls that gonna work? Weird stuff works with you. Hi, yes, I'd like to order a last-minute stripper. Oh, um, preferably of Asian heritage. Very bendy, with a heart of gold. And a crotch of gold. Hmm?

Give you the rest of the tour. - Great, yeah. - Great. JESS: Bye. NlCK: Bye. Okay, cool. - Hey, Winston, why'd you do that? - Are you hiding her from us? Are you ashamed of your friends? A hundred percent. You're not my friend now. You're my enemy. - Give me a kiss. NlCK: My enemy. NlCK: No, that's the problem. - Give me a kiss. Thank you, Ms. Phatbooty, you're the best. [JESS LAUGHS.] Yes, I just hired my first stripper. Anything else I should get? [SNlFFS.] Do you like jazz cigarettes? Hi, Tanya. Patti told me that-- Patti told you to break in my office to look for drugs? [LAUGHS.] Hey, J. K. kidding. J. K. kidding. You can do whatever you want. I didn't know you liked to shop at the confiscation station. So, what are you looking for? Grass? - I can do locker search on Monday. - Monday is too late because Oh.

Whoa, Jess, you really did all this for me? Okay, so over here is kosher yogurt and honey. - Kosher yog? - We got some condoms over here. - Small, large, whatever. - I would use-- I don't wanna know. And the R-rated section in the back with the stripper pole. It's normally used for stability. But tonight, it's gonna be used for 50-dollars' worth of semi-nudity. Coincidentally, I'm wearing my lap dance pants. - This is, like, your world, huh? - No. It is. It's you in your natural habitat. It's fascinating. I'm here for Schmidt. I don't know these people. - Nicholas. What's up, N-word? - Don't call me \"N-word.\" - I don't know this guy. - How's your family in Chicago? They're really good, thanks for asking.

Hilarity. BENJAMlN: Come on, man. - You really live with that guy, huh? - Yeah, I really do. Does he, like, tuck his shiny jeans into boots when he goes out at night?

Seriously, I think all of your friends seem completely awesome and nice and fun, so relax. You don't have to say that. You can tease them. - I don't wanna tease them. - I tease them. Schmidt's a d-bag. You know, not in a bad way. And Jess is a total nut. And Winston is like this competitive maniac who loves Sister, Sister and he's afraid of thunder. I'm the voice of-- - He's behind you. - Right now he is? Currently. - And he's also one of my best friends. - Oh, no, keep going. - You wanna go on the bus? - Yeah, let's go on the bus.

Oh, are you bringing the stripper? Because I'd really like to see her jugs first. You know, just so I do right by my bro. We have a little miscommunicado. Did you make the call?

We'll be going there next. Whose list are you on? Tristan's? Isn't it just like a bar or something? [HlP HOP MUSlC PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS.] What do you pull down a year in the game? Ever since I started doing full frontal, I pull down seven K a year, easy. Why? You interested in the life? Me? A male stripper? Come on. You're too kind. But you know, theoretically, if I were to get into the game what are they looking for, in the gator department? You know what I mean? Or is it just moving so fast that it doesn't really matter? It's all about storytelling, taking them on a journey. Let me ask you some basics. When you thrust what's your range of motion, side to side? Go left, fight right. What about your testicles? Are they, more or less, symmetrical? Size, yes. - Location, no. - What about your persona? - Like, a fireman or a cop? - I didn't ask you your character. Your persona. - I'm a Wolf-Hawk.

You're so quiet. - You're having a terrible time. - Don't mean-- I'm probably just intimidated. I'm sitting next to the inventor of bro juice. - I get it, okay? - That's-- I'm gonna brag about that. I did. I invented bro juice, okay? And now you want-- You're done. - What? - When we get off the bus - it's over. I blew it. - Ridiculous. I don't care about it. I really don't. Everyone's got embarrassing stuff. - I have stuff that you don't know about. - Like what? Just don't lie to me about stuff, and we'll be fine. Fine. When I work out, which isn't often I listen to Huey Lewis. It pumps me up. Not ironically. Wanna hear something else? - Okay. - I don't believe dinosaurs existed. I don't believe it. Wanna hear something else? I think I'm good. And I believe you, and I appreciate all of this truth-telling. - I don't think you have stuff. - All right. You're just perfect. Ha, ha. Yeah. - Hey, scooch. - Oh. Okay. Hi. - So I texted Tristan. - Oh. Okay. - He said he could get us into Plague. JESS: Oh. That's terrific. - Thank you. - Yeah. Just you and me, of course.

I go to all these class-- They're court-ordered classes. - And what was, like, all this stuff? - It's martial arts. I started doing martial arts  ironically, because I thought it would give me a little bit more Zen in my life. You must be really freaked out right now. - Yes, I am really freaked out. - I'm so sorry. I hate that I'm so turned on by your craziness-- - Go with it. - I'm going with it. - You guys cool waiting for the tow truck? - Fine. See you at the loft. Bye, guys. Happy birthday.
