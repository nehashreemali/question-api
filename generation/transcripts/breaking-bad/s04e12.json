  "transcript": "They're here, out front. -How many? -Nelson Brey, three others. -His toothbrush? -Got it. What about your stuff? Oh, we'll talk to them about stopping at your place. Skyler. Skyler. -What? -l'm not going. -What? -l'm not going to Hank and Marie's. -We're in danger. -Yes, that's true. Because of me. lt doesn't matter. All that matters is the rest of you are safe. And that's why l'm not going with you. l'm the real target. -But we'll all be safer at Hank's. -No, no, no. No one will be safe at Hank's if l'm there. Walt, it's the DEA. Skyler, you don't know these people. -l-- -No. Skyler, please. Trust me. This is how it has to be. Those agents outside. They're not gonna just leave you here. lt's protective custody. All they know is that Hank is the only person that's in danger. They're including us as a courtesy to Marie, to keep her happy. How am l supposed to explain that to Marie or Junior? Or Hank? l don't know. But you'll do it. You'll figure it out. Hank knows that Marie will be overreacting. Except she's not. l'll talk to Hank. You just back me up with everyone else. You really expect me to say, \"Okay, Walt, sure. Just stay here and\". No. There's gotta be another way. There isn't. There was. But now there isn't. Walt how long till you're safe? Till you can work this out? Oh, Skyler. No. -Skyler. -No. -l-- -Listen to me. l alone should suffer the consequences of those choices, no one else. And those consequences they're coming. No more prolonging the inevitable. Feed that belt through those seatbelt holders. Hank, l've got a car wash to run. l mean, you don't honestly believe that l'm in danger, do you? Me? Oh, Jesus, it's gonna go over like a lead balloon. lt'll be Marie that kills me. Well, just know that l'll get there as soon as l can. And let Steve Gomez know. l told his guys. And just stay safe. Oh, please. Whole thing's just a giant jerk-off. Yeah, yeah. But keep your head down anyway, all right? All right. All right, buddy. Take care. l know. Okay, sweetie. Okay, my love. Okay. Okay. Okay, my darling. lt's okay. We're all right. Okay. He's gonna risk his life over a stupid car wash? Does he understand what's going on with Uncle Hank? He'll come when he's able. That's pathetic. l-- How hard did you even try or did you? -Hey, hey, hey. Lay off your mom. -Well, you know, Hank we wouldn't be arguing about this if you and Steve would make him come. Why didn't your people put him in the car? -lt's not Nazi Germany, all right? -Oh, you-- Nazi Germany. lf l had a dollar for every time l heard that. l'm gonna call him. He's gonna get his behind here immediately. End of story. Thank you. At least somebody is listening. -Because we are all in danger here. -We're not all in danger here. Will you stop saying that? That is asking for trouble. Come on, Walt. He's not picking up. Look, could we just take this down a notch, okay? Everybody? You guys can stay here as long as you like. We got plenty of room. l wouldn't worry about any danger to Walt or any of us, okay? This whole thing is just a damn smoke screen. -How do you mean \"a smoke screen\"? -An anonymous threat against me? l'm stuck in a wheelchair, l'm not even on the job. No, someone didn't like the way l've been spending my free time. What? Minerals? Timing seem a bit odd to you, huh? l start looking into Fring, all of a sudden l'm on lockdown for my protection? -Gus Fring? -Did you say--? -What--? -From the chicken restaurant? Hank, what are you talking about? Just one man's humble opinion, that's all. l think Los Pollos Hermanos is a front for the biggest meth distributor in the Southwest. -Oh, my God. Oh, my God. -Steve, are you even looking into this? We're looking into everything. But we work on fact, not conjecture. And the fact is that the scumbags that hit you first were Mexican cartel not some German multinational whatever. Definitely not Colonel Sanders. Now, if we even had a shred of proof-- lsn't that what you get paid to go get? Remember that laundry l told you about? l'd start there. -Come on, man. -Jesus. lt's a perfect spot for a meth superlab. Oh, my God. Hey what if l'm right? Even if you were right-- And you ain't. --there's no way a judge is gonna give me a warrant. Warrant? What happened to good old-fashioned knock and talk? Oh, that's right. l forgot. You were never very good at those, were you? -Can l help you? -Yes, sir. We wondered if we could take a look around. Why? -Sorry, what's your name? -Dennis. Dennis. Hey. l'm Steve Gomez. l'm with the DEA. Drug Enforcement. ls there a problem? For you? No. No problem. We were just wondering if we could take a look around. Can l tell you a story? -Yeah. -l bust this chef. Well, he says he's a chef. Because you work at a restaurant that charges $14 for a burger that don't make you a chef. Makes you a burger-flipper. -Least in my book. -Yeah. Anyway, so we bust this chef, heroin possession. He says, \"Just because you found heroin in my chef whites doesn't make it mine. Maybe it came from the place that launders my chef whites.\" This place. -We don't do that stuff over here. -l know, l know. l'll say it for you. His story is a big load of steaming horse shit. We're gonna find heroin here like we're gonna find Jimmy Hoffa. Right? The thing is that this chef's daddy is a United States senator. l'm not gonna tell which one, but you know who he is. So now l gotta waste my time checking out this burger-flipper's story. lf l don't, his old man's gonna jam me up my ASAC, my whole entire office. Politics, huh? So, what do you think? Listen, l have to check on my boss. He's out of town. l can't promise l'll reach him anytime soon. Well, yeah. That's probably the way to go. l'll have to go get a warrant and we'll do it official. You have to close down for the day. -What--? Why? -Twenty agents poking around? lt'd be less trouble if it was just us. But your call. Just the two of you? You make it quick, right? Dennis, we'll be like the wind. -Okay. -Could you tell him? -Okay. -Okay. Can you clear out some of your people for us? Confuses the dog's nose. So how long we gotta be quiet down here? And what happens after this? Provided they don't find their way in here and bust our asses? l gotta be, like, snuck down here in a laundry hamper for the rest of eternity? Now, l'm going on record. This blows. Hello. For you. Yeah? Do you know what's happening upstairs? l have a pretty good idea. This is all the result of your former partner. Do you understand now? Do you see why this can't continue? l get it. The guy is a complete and total dick. But l can't. l'm not signing off. Okay? Like l said if something final happens to Mr. White we're going to have a problem. So, what are you gonna do? There will be an appropriate response. Appropriate? What does that mean? Hello? They're gone. We're good. You have reached Walter White. Please state your name, number and the reason for your call. Thank you. You have six new messages. Hey, kid. lt's me, Goodman. Give me a call, would you? Hey, need to hear from you. Hope l made myself clear about that. Call me as soon as you can. Pinkman, get over here. Stat, pronto. Don't call, just get over here. Would you just, please? l don't know if I'm speaking English here-- -What's up? He's waiting for me. -Hold up. Hold up. What the hell, man? Get off of me. Hey, Goodman. Get out here. -Hey. Yo, get your goon off me. -Not him, moron. Drop. Leave it. Go lie down. Sorry. You can't be too careful these days. Come on, come on. Lock the door, Frisky. Jesus. Take a break, H.T. Let's go. Stop calling me that or l'll hang you by your tie. Yeah, yeah. Stop showing off for the client. Honey Tits. l say it's endearing. So, what's so important? Well, they're here. The end times, kid. -End times. -What does that mean? Why'd you drag me here for? You want your money, don't you? l assume that you do. That couldn't wait? Ever hear of the expression, \"A fart in the wind\"? lnside of an hour, that will be me, l'm hitting the road. l'm out of here. -What, for, like, good? -For as long as it takes. l don't like my heat so hot if you catch my drift. l'm not catching anything you're saying. What is your problem? -You haven't talked to your partner? -Not since last night. Today, he didn't show up to work and the DEA just happened to raid us. Yeah, some coincidence, huh? Yeah, l don't know about that. All l know is when he tells me that your employer took him out threatening to murder his family, l take notice. Because after all, what am l, if not family? What are you talking about? When did that happen? l don't know. Forget it. l mean, he exaggerates, right? He does that. Hey, listen. Do me a favor. Put in a good word for me with Fring. l mean, just for old time's sake. l can't afford to butter the wrong bread here. Yeah? Hey. Nothing, huh? Clean as a whistle so he says. You've reached Walter White. State your name, number and the reason for your call. Thank you. lt's me again. l really wish you'd pick up. God, l just. Call me back, okay? Just. Just call me back, please. Hi. l'm sorry. ls it okay if l come out here for a few minutes? Sure. Just stay up here, if you would. Okay. Excuse me. l wonder if you have a-- An extra cigarette. l sure could use a smoke right about now. Sure. Thank you. Thanks. Hey, what's up? What? Hey. Hey. What's wrong with him? What hospital? Andrea. Jesse. -Where's Brock? -lnside. Grandma's with him. -They got me filling all this paperwork. -How is he doing? Tell me. The doctors, they don't know what it is exactly. lt's like he's got the flu. But he just keeps getting worse. Jesse, l don't understand. He was fine this morning. He was fine. -Andrea Cantillo? -Right here. Miss Cantillo, we're gonna go admit your son to the Pediatric lCU. -You can bring that with you. -Okay. -Sir, you're the boy's father? -No. Okay. Sorry. lt's just we try to keep it to two visitors maximum. Go, go, go. l'll be out here if you need me. Go. Go ahead. No. No, no. No. No. No. Come on. Come on. Come on. No. No! Andrea! Andrea. -Hey. No yelling. -l need to-- -We can't have you here. -l need to talk to her. -l need to tell her-- -Take this outside. -My son is sick in here. -No, just-- Come here. Jesse. What is it? Jesse, l can't go out. My son's in here. Okay. l'm thinking Brock may have been poisoned, okay? What? There's this stuff, this stuff called ricin. Sounds like rice. You need to tell the doctors about it. What? How do you know? Doesn't matter. Just tell them it's a guess. Okay? Ricin. They'll know what you're talking about. Jesse, if there's something you're not saying, you have to tell me. l gotta go. l gotta go see someone. -Jesse. -l'm sorry, l gotta go. Just tell them, okay? Now. Just do it. Hello. Could you buzz me in, please? Buzz me in! What do you want? We need to talk. -Who's with you? -No one. Just me. Let me in. l don't know what you're thinking coming here. Oh, Christ. What does it matter? Everything, it's all coming to an end. Do you even know what's happening? The full scope of what's happening? They took me out into the desert. They put a hood over my head and drove me out into the desert on my knees. They threatened my family, and not just Hank. My wife, my children. lt's just a matter of time now. l was able to protect them for now, but. Gus is gonna make his move. And l don't-- l don't know when. l don't know where or how. All l know is it's gonna happen. And l'm powerless to stop him. What are you doing? Why did you do it? -Why? -Jesse. Gus gave me no choice. l had to call the DEA to protect my family. What else could l do--? No. No, you son of a bitch. You know what you did. Okay, look, just-- Just put the gun down, okay? Just put it down and we'll talk, all right? You tell me what it is you think l did. Brock. Why did you poison him? -Who's Brock? -You saw him in my living room. You came and you looked right at him, so don't tell me you don't know him. The boy? Jesse, l have no idea who these people are. Now, please. Okay, that's Brock and he was poisoned? The ricin. He's dying because someone gave it to him. And only you and l were the only two people on earth who knew about it. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Maybe he went into your pockets-- No! l had it. l had the cigarette with the ricin in my pack this morning. The last time l saw Brock was last night. And this morning, l switched the cigarette into a new pack. There's no way Brock took it himself. Jesse, you're not thinking clearly. You said it yourself that you had it this morning. When could l have possibly gotten it? You had Saul do it. -What? -Yeah. Yeah. l went to his office. He called me in, had to see me today. His big bodyguard patted me down. That's when he must have stole it off me. Right? That's the plan? Was that the plan? Jesse. Why? Why in God's name would l poison a child? To get back at me. Because l'm helping Gus and this is your way of ripping my heart out before you're dead and gone. Just admit it. Admit what you did. Admit it. -l did not do this! -Shut up! Stop lying! Look, l'm not lying. l'm not lying. Just listen to me. What would l have to gain? What possible--? Possible could l--? Who--? who would--? Oh, my God. Hey. Stop laughing. Stop laughing! l have been waiting-- l've been waiting all day waiting for Gus to send one of his men to kill me. And it's you. Who do you know who's okay with using children? Jesse, who do you know who's allowed children to be murdered? Gus. He has been 1 0 steps ahead of me at every turn. And now, the one thing that he needed to finally get rid of me is your consent. And, boy, he's got that now. He's got it. And not only does he have that he manipulated you into pulling the trigger for him. No, only you and l knew about the ricin. No, you don't even believe that. Gus has cameras everywhere. Please. Listen to yourself. No, he has known everything all along. Where were you today? ln the lab? You don't think it's possible that Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker? Come on. Don't you see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You are everything that he's wanted. You're his cook now. You're the cook and you have proven that you can run a lab without me. And now that cook has reason to kill me. Think about it. lt's brilliant. So go ahead. Go on. lf you think that l am capable of doing this then go put a bullet in my head and kill me right now. -l'll do it. -Do it! -Do it. -l'll do it. Do it. -Where are you going? -Find the son of a bitch -and l'm gonna kill him. -No. Don't. He'll see you coming. You'll die before you get anywhere near him. l don't care. Jesse. Jesse, just get in your car. Just go. Just drive. No. l'm going to do this one way or another, Mr. White. Then let me help. Jesus. Mr. Pinkman, l'm not gonna keep telling you. Unless the family wants you in there, you're not allowed. You can't keep coming in here like this. You hear me? You understand? Mr. Pinkman, l'm gonna call security. All right, here l go. Come on now. Mr. Pinkman, final warning. Hey. You need to be at work, now. l already told you. l'm not going. Got a batch that'll be ruined and an employer who will be very upset if that happens. And l could give a shit. l'm not leaving here. lf my employer has a problem with that, he can tell me himself. Not his errand boy. ldiot. Hey, l don't know this guy. Call security. l'm being attacked. Yeah. That's right. We've got a situation. He'd like to speak with you. l told you, l'm not leaving. He's downstairs. Tyrus told me what's happening. The sick child. l understand your preoccupation, but, Jesse, l am running a business. l need you back at the lab to complete the cook. You can return when you're done. l can't. lt is, as you must know, in both of our best interests. That little boy upstairs is dying. l can't be away. l don't even wanna be here now. l can't be away, if something happens, if he-- l am very sorry. ls there anything l can do? l am on the board of this hospital. l can recommend doctors make sure he gets whatever he needs. The best treatment. He's not sick. He was poisoned. How did that happen? The doctors they don't know. This current batch is surely ruined now, correct? Stay with the boy. Tyrus will dump what's there and clean the tanks. You will start a new batch when you are ready to return. Next week. There you are. Keep going. Why did you stop? Come on. Come on. No, no, no. Don't go, don't go, don't go. No. No. Oh, shit. No.",
