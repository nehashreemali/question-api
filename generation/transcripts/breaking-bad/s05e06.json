  "transcript": "You guys didn't tell me this stuff smells like cat piss. Man, shit happens, huh? I mean, I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Obviously, I guess you see it different. Some of you. But I didn't see any other choice. I've been thinking about this all day, going over it in my head and it was the only way. Well, it's not like I wanted to. The kid was on a dirt bike. He could've just He could've gunned it and been gone before we even had a chance to blink. We never would've caught him. I thought on my feet. I saw a threat - and I took care of it. - A threat? The kid was waving at us. He wasn't going anywhere. He was saying hi. - Yeah, but you don't know that. - Yeah, I do. - He didn't know what he'd seen. - I didn't want to take that chance. The whole point of this was no one was supposed to know we were there. People weren't supposed to know anything got robbed. How could we let the kid go? He made us. If I hadn't done what I did, the mission would've failed. I'm real sorry. I really am, but I But did I make a mistake, Mr. White? Because to me, you know, respectfully I was looking out for the team. I didn't want to kill him. You gotta believe that. At the end of the day, it was him or us, and I chose us. And I would do it again. Okay, look. Todd, why don't you step outside for a few minutes so we can talk this through? Of course. Yeah, you guys talk. But I just want to make sure that you know that my priority is this business. Okay. That's fine, Todd. Thank you. I want to be a real part of this. All right? If you could just see that. I'm motivated and I've got connections. My uncle's got his hookups in prison who I think could be a real help to us if Okay. That dude? Wack job. - Let's just stick to the facts here. - Facts? Oh, okay. How about the fact that he shot a kid? A kid that he didn't need to shoot. Well, the boy had seen us. And, no, it didn't look like he knew what he was seeing. But what if he told somebody? What if he just mentioned it in passing? We can't know what someone-- Exactly. We can't know, because Ricky Hitler there shot him. We, us three, should've had a discussion about it. We would've figured it out. But that dickhead just went ahead and made the choice for us. - Is that how we do business now? - I understand you're upset. And what was that crap about his uncle with the prison connections? It's just some bullshit intimidation move. Come on. It's true, though. He does have some connections. - Is this a problem? - No. It's nothing to be concerned about. It came up in the background I did on him. Didn't worry me then. He's just flexing. All right. It seems to me that we have three options here and none of which are ideal. One, we fire Todd. - Yeah. - I'm not a fan of this option seeing that he knows way too much about this business at this point. And we'd most likely have to pay him to keep quiet. And God only knows we've got enough of that going on. Two: We dispose of him. Which leaves us option three. We keep him on payroll. Put him back on tenting houses, setting up the lab and so forth. We keep him close. Under our control. Now, option three would be my choice. Shall we vote? I vote three, kid. You're still in. Right on. Thank you so much. You guys totally made the right-- The next time you bring a gun to a job without telling me I will stick it up your ass sideways. - You understand? - Yes, sir. Hey, boss. What's up? I was just in the neighbourhood. Anything going on? No. He's just hanging out with his granddaughter. Well, isn't that sweet? Here, let me see. It's a dead drop. - What? - A dead drop. He just stashed something underneath that trash can. Write the time down. Roll on it. Looks like he's leaving. - Anybody coming for it? - Nope, not that I can see. Nobody in sight. Could be hours. Could be. What do you want to do? It's not my fault that Murtha's got his panties in a twist. It's an HR issue, Janice. I read the report. I'm calling again because that's the wrong case file number. All right? I don't know what kind of shoddy stan-- First off, Miracle Whip is not mayonnaise, okay? \"Looks like it\" doesn't equal \"tastes like it. \" Secondly, every time it's like they gotta slather an entire jar-- --bastard's screwing with us now. How'd he make you? What'd you do? We honked our horns and yelled \"yoo-hoo. \" What do you mean, what did we do? This guy is slippery as hell. He's been throwing every tail we put on him. - The guy's a pro. - Yeah, well, even pros make mistakes. One of these days, our pal Ehrmantraut's gonna slip up. Just gotta be there when he does. Teenagers. Sometimes you just want to strangle them. How's it going? Oh, you know. Well, this little munchkin, I could just keep her forever. She is just the sweetest little baby ever born. Yes, she is. I don't see much of Flynn. That car of his keeps him pretty busy. Yeah. More importantly, how are you doing? I'm okay. How's the therapy? I know Dave helped me so much when I was going through my little How's your guy'? - Peter. - Peter. He's Yeah, he's good. I feel like I'm making progress. That's great. You know, you just keep working through it. Honey. Babe, what is it? It's okay. It's all right. Why don't you let me take Holly, and then we'll talk about this? - No. - Okay. All right, that's fine. Then how about you just talk to me? Just tell me what's going on. I just I need to make the right decision. I need them to be safe. The kids? They're safe. Of course they are. I just miss them so much. I just want to be with them. Hey, you know we can bring them back home anytime you want. No. They need to stay. But I just I don't know what to do here. I Like, whatever I choose is wrong. Skyler, you gotta tell me what's going on. I know sometimes you-- I know you think I have a big mouth sometimes. I But if you felt like you couldn't talk to me, I don't know what I'd do. Okay. So, what's this about the kids not being safe? Safe from what? From us. From Walt and me. Like what? Like you're bad parents? Because you're not. Not even close. Marie there are things you just don't know that if you knew you'd never speak to me again. Try me. Okay, if you're not gonna say it, I will. Skyler, you have to forgive yourself for Ted. - What? - You can't keep beating yourself up over some stupid little affair. - Walt told you. - Please don't blame him. I practically forced him to, and I wasn't gonna say anything. But I cannot stand to watch you torture yourself like this. You have to forgive yourself, Skyler. You were having all these problems with Walt. And Ted is a really good-looking man. You're only human. Hell, I've even thought of, you know I mean, not seriously, but I totally get your temptation. Yeah. Doesn't it feel good to get it off your chest? Oh, yeah. - I feel better. - Yeah. For those who love the taste but not the price there's simulated caviar made of kelp, a type of seaweed. A fraction of the cost, it looks, smells and tastes similar to the real thing. Ready to get back at it? Unlike fish caviar-- We have breaking news into our newsroom. We've just learned that police are now expanding their search for a missing McKinley County boy after four days with no leads. Fourteen-year-old Drew Sharp was last seen by his parents Thursday morning. Authorities are extending their search today east from Crownpoint to Hospah and Whitehorse. Sharp was last seen riding his dirt bike into the desert behind his house. Investigators are asking any-- Jesse, nothing can change this. - Yeah, it's just that kid's parents - I know. Believe me. I haven't been able to sleep the past few nights just thinking about it. But, Jesse, now, finally, we're self-sufficient. Finally we have everything that we need and no one to answer to except ourselves. And in a year, year and a half once we've cooked through this methylamine and made our money there will be plenty of time for soul-searching. Until then we keep going. And we run our business our way and make sure that this never happens again. Okay? Look. Listen, I'll finish this up. Why don't you go on home? - You sure? - Absolutely. Yeah. I'll take care of this. You go on. Hey. Yeah, I was just leaving. All right. Hello? Walter? What are you doing here? I'm delivering the batch. What are you doing here? Might as well get this over with. Come in. Join us. - Hey. - Hi. Where's your cars? We parked around the block. You might consider doing that as well. Okay. So, what's going on? Just since this morning, I threw three separate tails. All DEA. - What? - The feds have been all over me. This has been going on for a while now. Did they follow you here? No. I said I threw them. I would never come to the headquarters of our illegal meth operation dragging a bunch of cops, Walter. - It would be unwise. - How can you be so sure? Well, I've been doing this a long time. It's pretty basic stuff. How long has this been going on? Since about the time we started this little venture. The DEA, in particular your peach of a brother-in-law has taken a keen interest in my activities. And you're just telling me this now? What, you didn't think this information would be of interest? - Wouldn't be germane? - I've been handling it, Walter. We're sitting on a thousand gallons of stolen methylamine. Jesus! How can you be so irresponsible? Calm down, would you, please? I can't believe that you kept this from me. From us. Did you know about this? - Mike just told me. - And I said calm down. - I've got it under control. - Oh, well, forgive me for not having complete confidence. - You know this can't go on, right? - Yeah, I know. And I've already decided. I'm out. Okay. Well Sorry to see you go, Mike. But I really don't see any other way. Neither do I. Obviously, Jesse you'll have to take over the distribution end of things. Mike, I trust that you'll bring Jesse up to speed on your side of the business? Yeah, about that Actually, Mr. White I'm out too. You're what? I don't think I can do this anymore. So I'm retiring, I guess. That methylamine that we stole, that we nearly killed ourselves trying to steal? That methylamine, when cooked, is worth nearly $300 million. And you're telling me that you're willing to walk away from that? We're walking away from the meth. Not the methylamine. Jesse and I will be taking our two-thirds and selling it. I've got a connection, a guy I knew from my time with Fring. This guy has the capital, and he's motivated. Highly. Mike's thinking we'll clear like 5 million. Each. I'll pay off my guys in lock-up out of my share. And those legacy costs you're so fond of you won't have to worry about anymore. And then I will be going on my way. Jesse too. It's a solid plan. You can come in on this with us. That'd be cool. Course, you know, you are free to hold onto your third and keep cooking. You'll be selling to my competitors. This guy and his crew are way out in Phoenix. It's a big country, Walter. Whole lot of meth-heads. Pennies on the dollar, Jesse. And that's what you're gonna sell out for? Pennies? Why? Five million isn't pennies. It's more money than I've ever seen. And when it comes down to it are we in the meth business? Or the money business? Relax, kid. There's no one there. You sure? I wouldn't be here if I wasn't. Glad to see you could make it out. I was surprised to get your call. Good surprise, I hope. There's one gallon, as discussed. You take that back home to your people, test it. If you're satisfied, I can get the other 665. All right. That's fair enough. Shall we talk money? That one's free. The price for the rest is 15,000 per. Six hundred and sixty-five gallons, that's 9,975,000. Although I would prefer you round it up to 10. Makes it easier for my partner and I to split. Steep. We good? I'll talk to my guys, but I should be able to put together that cash, yeah. Good. I gotta tell you, this is worth it just to get that blue stuff of yours off the market. The blue stuff will be off the market, right? Now, this whole time, I was thinking 666 that seems like an odd number. Two-thirds of an even thousand, though. When I look at it that way, it starts to make sense to me. That's not all the methylamine, is it? You two have a partner you haven't mentioned? This other party wouldn't be a problem for you. - His territory won't impact yours. - You see, that doesn't work for me. I'm not just buying this for the supply. I'm buying this for the demand. I'm looking to increase my market share. Well, I don't know what to tell you. I want you to tell me that Fring's blue will be off the streets. All right. Here's a new deal for you then. I'll pay you 15K a gallon for the full thousand gallons. Not a drop less. It's not mine to sell, Declan. Well, then, no deal, Mike. Yes? Yes. I guess. I don't know. Why don't you come over here? To my house. Yes, seriously. Hey. Yo, you sure this is okay? She's not here. Nobody's here. All right. So Something's come up. Mike wanted to come here to give you the hard sell but I figured it'd be better coming from me. Mike's connection won't buy mine and Mike's shares of the methylamine unless he gets your share too. He wants the entire thousand gallons. Absolutely not. Yeah, I figured you'd say that. But I've been thinking about it and it really makes sense. - Kind of. - It does, does it? Look, when you started this thing did you ever dream of having $5 million? I know for a fact that you didn't. I know for a fact all you needed was 737,000 because you worked it all out, like, mathematically. Look, if selling the methylamine now means that no one else ever gets killed then I vote for that, man. Hands down. And we could have it tomorrow. We would be out. Spend time with your family. No more worrying about them getting hurt or finding out about everything. Isn't this what you've been working for? I have not been working this hard just to sell out. - It's not selling out. - Yes, it is, Jesse. I have-- We have suffered and bled, literally, for this business. And I will not throw it away for nothing. I don't know how else to say it, Mr. White. Five million dollars isn't nothing. Jesse, have you heard of a company called Gray Matter? - No. - Well, I co-founded it in grad school with a couple of friends of mine. Actually, I was the one who named it. And back then, it was just-- Oh, it was just small-time. We had a couple patents pending. But nothing earth-shattering. Course, we all knew the potential. Yeah, we were gonna take the world by storm. And then this Well, something happened between the three of us. And I'm not gonna go into detail. But for personal reasons I decided to leave the company. And I sold my share to my two partners. I took a buyout for $5000. Now, at the time, that was a lot of money for me. Care to guess what that company is worth now? Millions? Billions, with a \"B.\" Two-point-one-six billion as of last Friday. I look it up every week. And I sold my share my potential, for $5000. I sold my kids' birthright for a few months' rent. This isn't the same thing. Jesse, you asked me if I was in the meth business or the money business. Neither. I'm in the empire business. I don't know. Mr. White, is a meth empire really something to be that proud of? Skyler, you remember Jesse. Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler. Hey, Mrs. White. Good to see you. You have a lovely home. - I was just heading out. - Why don't you stay for dinner? - No, Mr. White. I'm gonna go. - Stay. Come on. It'll be fun. It's okay with us, isn't it, Skyler? We don't have anything special planned tonight. Yeah. Sure. Why not? See? These are great green beans, Mrs. White. I like that you got the slivered almonds going. My mom always made them like that. You put lemon in there too? They are from the deli at Albertsons. Well you know, good work on your shopping then. Because these are choice. I eat a lot of frozen stuff. It's usually pretty bad. I mean, the pictures are always so awesome, you know? It's like, \"Hell, yeah, I'm stoked for this lasagna.\" And then you nuke it, and the cheese gets all scabby on top and it's like you're eating a scab. I mean, seriously, what's that about? It's like, yo, whatever happened to truth in advertising? You know? Yeah, it's bad. So, hey, how's business? The car wash. Mr. White said it's going really well. Says, like, you're a great manager. He did, huh? Yeah, he says you've got it running like a Like a machine. Like, well-oiled. Yeah. What else did he tell you about me? Oh, you know, just good stuff. Just really, you know, really good, good stuff. We don't really talk that much about you know, personal things. Did you also tell him about my affair? May I please be excused? You know my kids are gone? Thank God. No. I don't mean they're out for the night. They're gone. They're staying with my in-laws. She made me kick my own kids out of the house. She told me that she was counting the days until my cancer came back. My wife is waiting for me to die. This business is all I have left now. It's all I have. And you want to take it away from me. I thought you might try something stupid. - Look, Mike-- - Don't bother, Walter. Come join me in the office. I don't think so. That's not a request. Might as well get comfortable. This deal's going down tomorrow. It's happening, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. - Got it? - So it's okay for you to steal my-- To ensure that, you and I are gonna spend the rest of the night together in this office. - Like it's my birthday. - Mike When the deal is done, you'll get your money. I guarantee that. Let me cook it. I'll double your five and you still walk. You know, I have never seen anybody work so hard not to get $5 million. Mike, you need to listen to me. No, Walter. The last thing I need to do is listen to you. Now, sit down. All right. Walter, I've got a bit of a quandary here. I've got something I need to attend to before this deal happens. But for some reason, I don't trust you alone with the methylamine. I'm gonna have to restrain you. You gotta be kidding. Stand up for me, please. Stand up. Turn around for me. Arms out to the side. Up. - Oh, man. - Sit down. Sit down. Give me your wrist. 30\")'- Alrighty. To what do we owe the pleasure? Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss your illegal harassment of my client. This should be good. Mr. Ehrmantraut has become the subject of a vicious, relentless and unwarranted DEA persecution. - Gomie, does that sound right to you? - I have no idea what he's talking about. Play it as cool as you like, Fonzie. But we all know you've been following my client day and night. The man can't spend a few minutes with his granddaughter without you guys quivering in the bushes and peeping through your binoculars. It's Well, it's disturbing. And it's taken a toll on his mental and physical well-being. Your client looks fine to me. Well, some hurts only show on the inside. Now, you guys don't even have warrants for these tails, do you? Theoretically, these tails you refer to would be within the bounds of the law. We don't need a warrant to follow somebody through a public place. - Theoretically. - Yeah, that is theoretically correct. However, I would counter that an open-ended, unrestricted surveillance like this amounts to stalking. Which is illegal. Now, I don't know what it is you find so interesting about my client, and I'm not here to judge. Different strokes and all. But sadly, he's just not that into you. So I have filed for a temporary restraining order against the DEA on behalf of Mr. Ehrmantraut. Where'd you get your law degree, Goodman? The same clown college you got that suit? You know who likes this suit? Judge Papadoumian. She thinks I'm a snappy dresser. You know what Judge Papadoumian hates? Police harassment of a senior citizen. 30\")'- Expect a visit from the sheriff, agents. You should have your ex parte within the hour. Let's go. What kind of judge would issue this thing? Papadoumian, man. She's like Ho Chi Minh So, what do we do? Well, not a lot of choice, you know? We back off. For the moment. TRO won't stand up and Goodman knows it. I don't see what they're playing at here, but if Ehrmantraut wants a fight - he's gonna get one. - All right. - That was a hell of a gamble. - Worked. Yeah, well, not for long. And he's right about that TRO. It's gonna get tossed tout de suite. Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you just reached Uncle Miltie proportions. So have fun with that. How much time I got? Maybe 24 hours. It's enough. It better be. Whatever you got planned, you best pull the ripcord while you still have a chance. - Where is it? - Mike - Mike! - Get out of my way. You sit down. - Mike! Mike! Hold on, okay? - I am gonna count to three. Mr. White's got an idea. Mike, I'm serious. - One. Two. - It's a great idea. Look, you get your 5 million, we both do, and he gets his methylamine, all right? Just hear him out. Is that true, Walter? Everybody wins.",
