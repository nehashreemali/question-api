  "transcript": "You can do this. You have reached Walter White. Please state your name number, and the reason for your call. Thank you. Third try. Walt, if you're there, please pick up. I realty wanted to do this together but I can hear him getting up. It's not like I can keep him from seeing the thing. So, I'm sorry, but I've waited as long as possible and I  I guess I'm gonna have to go ahead without you. So call me. - Hey. - Hey. Happy birthday, sweet 16. Thanks, Mom. Of course, I thought you might sleep through it. So since it's almost, oh, noon I think your first big birthday decision is breakfast or lunch? - Pancakes? - Pancakes it is. Oh, could you do me a favour? I forgot to get the paper. Can you grab it for me? - Sure. - Thanks. Surprise. It's from me and your dad. It's pretty slick, huh? Yeah. Thanks, Mom. it's  it's great. I really did a lot of research and, I don't know, this car just really stood out to me. It's got a ton of great features, power everything, solid engine. It's really roomy so you can, you know, carpool with all your friends. And, of course, it is safe because I'm still your mother. And it has a CD player so you can listen to tunes while cruising around. So you know what? Breakfast can wait. You wanna take it for a spin? Maybe later. I'm kind of starving. Yeah, okay. Well, let's  Let's get those pancakes going. Saul, he's here. Bad idea. This is a bad idea. Saul? Send him in. Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman. Thank you for coming down. - Hey. - Yeah, hi. Have a seat, please. I I don't understand why I'm here. - Something to do with my creditors? - Creditors? No. Your Great-aunt Birgit passed away. I'm sorry, who? Apparently she passed away in Diekirch, Luxembourg. And this was-- Wow, eight years ago. I just assumed you two were close, given that  Well, maybe this is good news. Birgit left behind a sizable estate of which you, Mr. Beneke, are the primary beneficiary. What? She had no immediate relatives so the estate's just been sitting while the folks over in the EU searched for a living heir. Well, I don't know of any relatives in Luxembourg. Definitely no one who would name me in their will. Well  Well, here we go. She left no will. So that's probably why it took so long. They traced the inheritance to your father. But having passed\" My condolences. --you are the next in line to the tune of $621,552.33. And when does Don Eladio arrive? Let's see how the cook goes first. Who's the chemist? Is this a joke? He's asking if you're the chemist. I'm one of them. Okay, we've all met. Let's get to work. Where's the phenyl:-acetic acid? Please show him the phenyl:-acetic acid. We synthesize it ourselves. All the ingredients are here. They synthesize their own. What? I don't do that. What's the problem? Look, I get my phenylacetic acid from the barrel with the bee on it. That's how I know how to do it. Mr. Pinkman was under the impression that the phenylacetic acid would already be synthesized upon his arrival. Any sophomore chemistry student can make it. What kind of amateur have you brought us? - What's he saying? - We're working it out. This is ridiculous. I'm not letting some infant who can't even synthesize phenylacetic acid teach me my business. Tell this asshole if he wants to learn how to make my product he's gotta do it my way. The right way. I speak English. So you understand what \"asshole\" means. Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid, asshole. How long is it gonna take to get him what he needs? I don't know. I have no idea. Several hours, at least. I can wait. Gives us time to talk about the state of this lab. Don't you have standards? I mean, this place is disgusting. All right, we're gonna scour every vat, every tank, every cook surface. We clean up every possible source of contamination. And then we cook. Who do you think you are? I'm the guy your boss brought here to show you how it's done. And if this is how you run your lab, no wonder. You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass. Now, if you don't want that to happen I suggest you stop whining like a little bitch, and do what I say. Clean up! You have reached Walter White. Please state your name number, and the reason for your call. Thank you. Dad, you there? I'm outside. Are you okay? I know you're home, your car is here. You missed my party which feels like something's gotta be really wrong. I I'm gonna have to call 911. I don't know what else to do. Dad? Come in, if you're coming in. What happened to you? What happened? I got into a fight. What do you mean, a fight? Like--? What fight? Are you gonna talk to me here? What are you doing? - I'm calling Mom. - Don't do that. Look, I  I appreciate that you're concerned, but I'm fine. Just do not call your mother. Why not? Because I was gambling. If you tell your mother, I just-- I will never, never hear the end of it. So please. Can we just keep this between us? Would you do that for me? Just  Just keep it to yourself. I don't understand. How'd you get into a fight? And with who? I made a mistake. It's my own fault. - I had it coming. - Dad it's okay. It's all my fault. I just  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Dad. Come here. Come on. Dad, it's okay. No. Hey, hey, no. -It's okay. Come on, please. it's okay. - No. Look at me. Look at me. It's okay. It is. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's-- it's okay. Hey. How was your birthday? Good. Get some rest. Okay. The new car did you drive it here? Yeah. That's good. You like it? Sure. I do. It drives great. That's good, Jesse. Yes. - Yes. - Well done. The first of many. Yeah? What's that mean? You're staying. You belong to the cartel now. You can't come to my work like this. You're too recognizable. Your face is plastered on every bus bench within a five-mile radius. Celebrities have to get their cars washed just like everybody else. I wouldn't have come if it wasn't important. - Okay? - What is it? Well, I went ahead and met with your Mr. Beneke. Right? Which, I will say again, loudly and for the record, bad idea. Yes, but it is better than prison, correct? Marginally. Which is why I disbursed the funds as you requested. All right, good. Yeah. I can't believe he actually bought it. Great-aunt Birgit. What? But you called it. People see zeros dance before their eyes it's like highway hypnosis. - So, what's the problem? Let's just say, you and I don't wear the same rose-colored glasses where Johnny Fabulous is concerned. So I kept an eye on his bank accounts, and pulled his credit report. If you would, note the time on that. Three fifty-four p.m. yesterday. - Three hours after leaving my office. - He bought a Mercedes SL550. He's actually leasing it, but he put 4500 down. He's gonna pay 1830 a month. Fully loaded. He even got the heated steering wheel. But that's upwards of 6300 that won't be going to the IRS. I just thought you might like to know, loath as I am to say, I told you so. Where is he now? Hey. How you doing? Good. How are you? I'm fine, but your mother is going to be worried sick. I called her last night. On, God. I told her I was spending the night at Louis'. It's cool. So  How are you? I'm fine, son. I  I Well, I  I took these painkillers that I had leftover from my surgery and I made the brilliant decision to wash them down with a couple of beers. Not my most sterling moment, I admit. But I'm fine. I wish I could take back last night. It was your birthday. - This shouldn't be on your mind. -It's okay. No, it's not okay. I'm your father, and I don't want last night to be  I mean, you really can't think of me like Like what? I don't understand. My father died when I was 6. - You knew that, right? - Yeah. He had Huntington's disease. it's  It destroys portions of the brain affects muscle control leads to dementia, it's just a nasty disease. It's genetic. Terrified my mother that I might have it so they ran tests on me when I was a kid, but I came up clean. My father fell very ill when I was four or 5. He spent a lot of time in the hospital. My - My mother would tell me so many stories about my father. She would talk about him all the time. I knew about his personality how he treated people I even knew how he liked his steaks cooked. Medium rare. Just like you. I knew things about my father. I had a lot of information. It's because people would tell me these things. They would paint this picture of my father for me. And I always pretended that was who I saw too. Who I remembered. But it was a lie. In truth, I only have one real actual memory of my father. It must have been right before he died. My mother would take me to the hospital to visit him. And I remember the smell in there, the chemicals. It was as if they used up every single cleaning product they could find in a 50-mile radius. Like they didn't want you smelling the sick people. There was this stench of Lysol and bleach. I mean, you could just feel it coating your lungs. Anyway, there lying on the bed is my father. He's all  He's all twisted up. And my mom she puts me on her lap. She's sitting on the bed next to him so I can get a good look at him. But really, he just scares me. And he's looking right at me but I can't even be sure that he knows who I am. And your grandmother is talking trying to be cheerful, you know, as she does but the only thing I could remember is him breathing. This  This rattling sound. Like if you were shaking an empty spray paint can. Like there was nothing in him. Anyway that is the only real memory that I have of my father. I don't want you to think of me the way I was last night. I don't want that to be the memory you have of me when I'm gone. Remembering you that way wouldn't be so bad. The bad way to remember you would be the way  The way you've been this whole last year. At least last night you were  You were real, you know? - Bye. - Bye. Somewhere you should be? Well, basically it was a temporary hiatus. But you give us two weeks, we will be up and running 100 percent. All right, you talk to your people and get back to me, okay? - Hi. - Yeah, thanks, Tanya. Okay. You bet. Say hi to the kids for me. - Hey. - Hi. Nice surprise. What's up? Just thought I'd swing by, see how things are going. Well, things are  Things took a turn. it's kind of crazy. Oh, yeah? The universe is telling me something. I got some good news. Some very good news and I'm getting the business going again. I figure we haven't been down long so we should be able to get most of our old contracts back. Sit. Oh, thank you. That's-- Gosh, that's  That's wow. How is that even possible? Well, I got a very unexpected cash infusion. I guess someone's looking out for me. I guess so. Is that yours, outside? Yeah, well, you know I can't be driving a piece of crap. You got to present that successful image. Right. So the IRS stuff. That's resolved? Yeah, it's in progress. So you paid them? Well, not yet. But I will. When? Well, it's not that simple. Here's the thing: I never had proper legal counsel. So I was thinking I should hire someone good who can maybe hammer out a better deal. There will never be a better deal, Ted. The deal is you pay your back taxes you pay your penalty and you don't go to prison. That's a good deal. So  Let's keep our priorities straight. Well, my priority is getting my business back. And putting my employees back on the payroll so they can pay the mortgages. Right. But I think your employees would agree that you need to get your financial situation in control before you can help them. Boy, the IRS got you on commission? I'm just saying that, though I really understand the temptation to restart the business maybe the universe is telling you that you need to pay what you owe. Skyler this is my money. Why are we having this conversation? You're no longer a part of my life. A decision you made, by the way. So I don't understand why you're hectoring me about this. - Ted, this affects both of us. - No it doesn't. I'm telling you to drop this. You need to use that money to pay your bill. By the end of this month. Which you promised the IRS in writing that you would do. It is that simple. Okay. Okay, duly noted. What does that mean? Does that mean yes? Because I really need a yes here, Ted. All right, Skyler, I'll tell you what it means. It means in the most respectful way possible, there's the door. And I'm inviting you to, you know  And thank you for your concern, but I'm done talking about this. From whom exactly do you think you got that 600,000, Ted? Great-aunt Birgit? That was you? Yeah. What is this shit? I don't get a vote? I'm supposed to just stay down here forever? I promise you this: Either we're all going home or none of us are. Now settle down. On your feet. Gustavo. I'm so happy you finally came to your senses. May I present the cook. This is your new employer. You address him as Don Eladio. It's a term of respect. Hello, young man. He doesn't speak a word of Spanish, does he? And he's no chemist I'll tell you that. I don't care if he's a pig farmer. He cooks better meth than you do with all your fancy college degrees. And this one will have plenty of time to learn Spanish. What's in there? A gift? Gustavo, you're so generous. It's a token of respect. In honor of our renewed friendship. Let's see what's in here. No, impossible! Zafiro Añejo! Look at this. Even the bottle is a work of art. It's perfection! Perhaps it's too good to share. What do you think, Gustavo? It's yours to do with as you choose. I choose to drink it! Careful. That's beautiful stuff. If you spill a drop I'll cut off your hand. Come on, hurry up. Gustavo. Welcome to Mexico. Now you say: This one's an addict. To work, he must be sober. None for you! Enough business! Bring the girls! No. No, no, I don't  Gustavo. Cheer up, man. Gustavo I'm not angry. I had to spank you. But what choice did I have? Look, once every 20 years you forget your place. There's no place for emotion in this. You of all people should understand. Business is business. If you'll excuse me. - Where are you going? - To use your bathroom. If I may. Miguel! Show Gustavo the pisser. And make sure he doesn't get lost. Hurry up. Make yourself useful. Find a gun. Don Eladio is dead! His capos are dead! You have no one left to fight for! Fill your pockets and leave in peace! Or fight me and die! I hope to hell that works. Take him. Keys. No. No. Okay. Okay. Hey. Hey, you still with us? Go. Kid, get us out of here, kid. Come on.",
