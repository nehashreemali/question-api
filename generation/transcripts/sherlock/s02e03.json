  "transcript": "THUNDER RUMBLES  Why today?  Do you want to hear me say it? 18 months since our last appointment.  You read the papers?  Sometimes  And you watch telly?  You know why I'm here.  I'm here because  What happened, John?  Sherl  You need to get it out.  My best friend  Sherlock Holmes  is dead.  Falls Of The Reichenbach. Turner's masterpiece.  Thankfully recovered,  owing to the prodigious talent of Mr Sherlock Holmes.  APPLAUSE  A small token of our gratitude.  Diamond cufflinks All my cuffs have buttons.  He means thank you. Do I?  Just say it. Thank you.  Hang on.  Back together with my family, after my terrifying ordeal.  And we have one person to thank for my deliverance  Sherlock Holmes.  APPLAUSE  Tie pin. I don't wear ties. Shhh.  Peter Ricoletti Number one on Interpol's most wanted list since 1982.  We got him, and there's one person we have  to thank for giving us the decisive leads.  With all his customary diplomacy and tact.  Sarcasm. Yes.  We all chipped in.  Oh  Put the hat on. Put the hat on.  Yes, Sherlock, put it on.  Just get it over with.  \"Boffin!\"  \"Boffin Sherlock Holmes!\"  Everybody gets one.  Page five, column six, first sentence.  Why is it always the hat photograph?!  \"Bachelor John Watson. \" What kind of hat is it?  What are they implying?!  Is it a cap? Why has it got two fronts? It's a deerstalker.  \"Frequently seen in the company of bachelor John Watson.  \" What are you going to do, throw it?  \"Confirmed bachelor John Watson.\" A death frisbee! This is too much,  we need to be more careful. It's got flaps.  Ear flaps, it's an ear hat, John.  What do you mean, more careful?  I mean, this isn't a deerstalker now, it's a Sherlock Holmes hat.  I mean, you're not exactly a private detective any more.  You're this far from famous. Oh, it'll pass.  It better pass. The press will turn, Sherlock,  they always turn and they'll turn on you.  It really bothers you. What? What people say. Yes.  About me? why would it upset YOU?  Just try to keep a low profile. Find yourself a little case this week.  Stay out of the news.  MOBILE BLEEPS  That's your phone.  Hmm, it keeps doing that.  So, did you just talk to him for a really long time?  Oh, Henry Fishguard never committed suicide.  Bow Street runners missed everything.  Pressing case, is it? They're all pressing until they're solved.  Put your key back please. Thank you.  Excuse me, sir.  Any metal objects, keys, mobile phones?  You can go through.  Thank you.  Fancy a cuppa then, mate?  Yeah, why not?  Gilts at seven.  Dutch Telecoms in free-fall. Thank you, Harvey.  What are you saying?  Refuse them all parole and bring back the rope?  Let's begin.  ALARM SOUNDS  This is an emergency. Please leave.  Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.  DOOR BANGS  Sir, there's been a break-in.  Not our division.  You'll want it.  ALARM SOUNDS  The vault!  Hacked into the Tower of bloody London's security?! How?!  MOBILE RINGS  Tell them we're on our way!  There's been another one, another break-in.  Bank of England!  ALARM SOUNDS  Sir! Security's down, sir. It's failing.  What is it now?  Pentonville Prison.  Oh no!  POLICE SIRENS  No rush.  MOBILE BLEEPS  I'll get it, shall I?  Here. Not now, I'm busy.  Sherlock Not now! He's back.  That glass is tougher than anything.  Not tougher than crystallised carbon. He used a diamond.  Oh, sinnerman, where you gonna run to?  Sinnerman, where you gonna run to?  Where you gonna run to?  All on that day  Well, I run to the rock   Ready? Yes.  Stand back. Stand back. Mr Holmes. Mr Holmes.  Let them through. Thank you. Get in.  Oh, Lord  Please help me, Lord  Don't you see me praying  Don't you see me down here praying  But the Lord said  Go to the devil The Lord said  Go to the devil  He said Go to the devil  All on that day  So I ran to the devil  He was waiting   Remember Yes.  Remember Yes.  Remember what they told you. Don't try to be clever. No.  Please, keep it simple and brief. God forbid the  star witness at the trial should appear intelligent.  Intelligent, fine. Let's give \"smart-arse\" a wide berth.  I'll just be myself. Are you listening to me(?)  Today, outside the Old Bailey  This is the trial of the century The trial of James Moriarty  James Moriarty, earlier today accused of  attempting to steal the Crown Jewels.  At the Old Bailey we have Reichenbach hero Sherlock Holmes  Would you mind slipping your hand into my pocket?  Thanks.  It was boiling, I ran to the sea  It was boiling I ran to the sea   Crown v Moriarty, please proceed to Court 10.  You're him.  Wrong toilet. I'm a big fan. Evidently.  I read your cases, follow them all.  Sign my shirt, would you?  There are two types of fans. Oh?  Catch me before I kill again, Type A. Uh-huh.  What's Type B? Your bedroom's just a taxi ride away. Hmm.  Guess which one I am?  Neither. Really? No, you're not a fan at all.  Those marks on your forearm, edge of a desk.  You've been typing in a hurry, probably, pressure on, facing a deadline.  That all?  There's an ink smudge on your wrist, a bulge in your jacket pocket.  Bit of a giveaway? The smudge is deliberate,  to see if I'm as good as they say I am.  Hmm. Oil-based, used in newspaper print.  But drawn on with an index finger, your finger. Hmm.  Journalist. Unlikely you get your hands dirty at the press.  You put that there to test me. Wow! I'm liking you.  I'd make a great feature, \"Sherlock Holmes, the man beneath the hat\".  Kitty  Riley. Pleased to meet you.  I'm saving you the job of asking.  I won't give you an interview. No, I don't want the money.  You and John Watson, just platonic?  Can I put you down for a \"no\" there as well(?)  There's all sorts of gossip in the press about you.  Sooner or later, you're going to need someone on your side.  Someone to set the record straight.  You think you're the girl for that job, do you?  I'm smart and you can trust me  totally.  Smart? OK, investigative journalist.  Good. Well, look at me and tell me what you see.  If you're that skilful, you don't need an interview,  you can just read what you need.  No? OK, my turn.  I see someone who's waiting for their first  scoop, so their editor will notice them.  You're wearing an expensive skirt, that's been  rehemmed twice. Only posh skirt you've got.  Your nails, you can't afford to do them that often.  I see someone who's hungry,  I don't see smart. I don't see trustworthy.  I'll give you a quote. if you like. Three little words.  You repel me.  \"A consulting criminal.\" Yes.  Your words. Can you expand on that answer?  James Moriarty is for hire. A tradesman?  Yes. But not the sort who'd fix your heating?  No, the sort who'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination.  But I'm sure he'd make a decent job of your boiler.  Would you describe him as  Leading. What? You're leading the witness.  He'll object and the judge'll uphold. Mr Holmes.  Ask me how, HOW would I describe him?  What opinion have I formed of him? Do they not teach you this?  Mr Holmes, we are fine without your help.  HOW would you describe this man, his character?  First mistake.  James Moriarty isn't a man at all.  He's a spider.  A spider at the centre of a web, a criminal web with a thousand threads  and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances.  SHE CLEARS THROA  And how long? No, no. Don't, don't do that.  That's really not a good question. Mr Holmes!  How long have I known him? Not your best line of enquiry.  We met twice, five minutes in total.  I pulled a gun, he tried to blow me up.  I felt we had a special something.  Miss Sorrel, are you seriously claiming this man is an expert?  After knowing the accused for just five minutes?  Two minutes would have made me an expert, five was ample.  Mr Holmes, that's a matter for the jury. Oh, really?  One librarian, two teachers,  two high-pressure jobs, probably the City.  The foreman's a medical secretary, trained  abroad, judging by her shorthand. Mr Holmes?  Seven are married, two are having an affair with each other.  Oh, they've just had tea and biscuits.  Would you like to know who ate the wafer? Mr Holmes!  You've been called here to answer Miss Sorrel's questions,  not to give us a display of your intellectual prowess.  Keep your answers brief and to the point.  Anything else will be treated as contempt.  Do you think you could survive for just a few minutes  WITHOUT SHOWING OFF?!  CELL DOOR SLAMS  What did I say? I said don't get clever.  I can't just turn it on and off like a tap. Well? Well, what?  You were there for the whole thing, up in the gallery, start to finish.  Like you said it would be sat on his backside, never even stirred.  Moriarty is not mounting any defence.  Bank of England, Tower of London, Pentonville.  Three of the most secure places in the country  and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in,  no-one knows how or why.  All we know is He ended up in custody.  Don't do that. Do what?  The look. Look? You're doing the look again.  Well, I can't see it, can I?  It's my face.  Yes and you're doing a \"We both know what's really going on here\" face.  We do. No, I don't, which is why I find the face so annoying.  If Moriarty wanted the jewels, he'd have them.  If he wanted the prisoners freed, they'd be on the streets.  The reason he's still in a prison cell is because he chose to be there.  Somehow this is part of his scheme.  Mr Crayhill, can we have your first witness?  Your Honour, we're not calling any witnesses.  I don't follow.  You've entered a plea of not guilty.  Nevertheless, my client is offering no evidence.  The defence rests.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, James Moriarty stands accused  of several counts of attempted burglary.  Crimes which, if he's found guilty,  will elicit a very long custodial sentence,  and yet his legal team  has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever  to support their plea.  I find myself in the unusual position  of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly.  You must find him guilty.  Guilty.  You must find him guilty.  DOOR SLAMS  They're coming back. That's six minutes.  Surprised it took them that long, to be honest.  There's a queue for the loo!  Have you reached a verdict on which you all agree?  PHONE RINGS  Not guilty, they found him not guilty.  No defence and Moriarty's walked free.  Sherlock?  Are you listening? He's out, you know he'll be coming after you. Sherl  VIOLIN PLAYS  STAIRS CREAK  MUSIC STOPS  VIOLIN PLAYS AGAIN  DOOR CREAKS  Most people knock.  But then, you're not most people, I suppose.  Kettle's just boiled.  Johann Sebastian would be appalled.  May I? Please.  You know when he was on his deathbed, Bach,  he heard his son at the piano playing one of his pieces.  The boy stopped before he got to the end.  The dying man jumped out of bed, ran to the piano and finished it.  Couldn't cope with an unfinished melody. Neither can you, that's why you've come.  Be honest, you're a tiny bit pleased. What, with the verdict?  With me, back on the streets.  Every fairy tale needs a good old-fashioned villain.  You need me or you're nothing.  Because we're just alike, you and I,  except you're boring.  You're on the side of the angels.  You got to the jury, of course.  I got into the Tower of London,  you think I can't worm my way into 12 hotel rooms?  Cable network.  Every hotel bedroom has a personalised TV screen.  And every person has their pressure point.  Someone that they want to protect from harm.  Easy peasy.  So how are you going to do it?  Burn me?  Ah, that's the problem, the final problem.  Have you worked out what it is yet?  What's the final problem?  I did tell you but did you listen?  How hard do you find it, having to say \"I don't know\"?  I don't know. Oh, that's clever, very clever, awfully clever.  Speaking of clever, have you told your little friends yet?  Told them what?  Why I broke into all those places and never took anything? No.  But you understand? Obviously. Off you go, then.  Tell you what you already know? No, prove that you know it.  You didn't take anything because you don't need to. Good.  You'll never need to take anything ever again. Very good, because?  Because nothing in the Bank of England,  the Tower of London or Pentonville Prison could possibly match  the value of the key that could get you into all three.  I can open any door anywhere with a few tiny lines of computer code.  No such thing as a private bank account now, they're all mine.  No such thing as secrecy, I OWN secrecy.  Nuclear codes?  I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order.  In a world of locked rooms, the man with the key is king.  And honey, you should see me in a crown.  You were advertising all through the trial,  you were showing the world what you can do.  And you were helping.  Big client list rogue governments, intelligence communities,  terrorist cells.  They all want me.  Suddenly, I'm Mr Sex.  If you can break any bank, what do you care about the highest bidder?  I don't, I just like to watch them all competing.  \"Daddy loves me the best.\" Aren't ordinary people adorable?  Well, you know, you've got John. I should get myself a live-in one.  Why are you doing all of this? It must be so funny.  You don't want money or power, not really.  What is it all for?  I want to solve the problem.  Our problem.  The final problem.  It's going to start very soon, Sherlock the fall.  HE WHISTLES  But don't be scared, falling is just like flying,  except there's a more permanent destination.  Never liked riddles.  Learn to.  Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock.  I owe you.  KEYPAD BLEEPS  Er, excuse me, I'm looking for Mycroft Holmes?  Would you happen to know if he's around at all?  Can you not hear me?  Yes, all right. Anyone?  Anyone at all know  where Mycroft Holmes is, I've been asked to meet him here?  No takers, right. Am I invisible, can you actually see me?  Ah, thanks, gents. I've been asked to meet Mycroft Holmes. What the hell?!  MUFFLED CRIES FROM JOHN  Tradition, John, our traditions define us.  So total silence is traditional, is it?  You can't even say pass the sugar?  Three-quarters of the diplomatic service  and half the government front bench all sharing one tea trolley,  it's for the best, believe me.  We don't want a repeat of 1972.  But we can talk in here. You read this stuff?  Caught my eye. Mm-hm.  Saturday, they're doing a big expose.  I'd love to know where she got her information.  Someone called Brook. Recognise the name?  School friend, maybe?  HE LAUGHS Of Sherlock's?  But that's not why I asked you here.  Who's that? Don't know? No. Never seen his face before?  Um He's taken a flat in Baker Street, two doors down from you.  Hm, I was thinking of doing a drinks thing for the neighbours.  I'm not sure you'll want to.  Sulejmani, Albanian hit squad, expertly trained killer,  living less than 20 feet from your front door.  Well, it's a great location. Jubilee line's handy.  John What's it got to do with me?  Dyachenko. Ludmila.  Oh  Actually, I think I have seen her. Russian killer.  She's taken the flat opposite.  OK.  I'm sensing a pattern here.  In fact, four top international assassins relocate  to within spitting distance of 221b.  Anything you'd care to share with me? JOHN LAUGHS  I'm moving? It's not hard to guess the common denominator, is it?  You think this is Moriarty?  He promised Sherlock he'd come back.  If this was Moriarty, we'd be dead already. If not Moriarty, then who?  Why don't you talk to Sherlock, if you're so concerned about him?  Oh, God, don't tell me.  Too much history between us, John.  Old scores, resentments.  Nicked all his Smurfs? Broke his Action Man?  (Finished.)  We both know what's coming, John.  Moriarty is obsessed, he's sworn to destroy his only rival.  So you want me to watch out for your  brother because he won't accept your help?  If it's not too much trouble?  DOOR BANGS  Excuse me. Sorry.  Sherlock, something weird What's going on? Kidnapping. Rufus Bruhl.  The ambassador to the US. He's in Washington, isn't he?  Not him, his children. Max and Claudette, age seven and nine.  They're at St Aldates. Posh boarding place in Surrey.  School broke up, the boarders went home.  A few kids remained, including those two.  The kids have vanished.  The ambassador's asked for you personally. The Reichenbach hero.  Isn't it great to be working with a celebrity?  We shouldn't need to keep you for much longer. Thank you.  It's all right. Miss Mackenzie, House Mistress. Go easy.  Miss Mackenzie, you're in charge of pupil welfare,  yet you left this place wide open last night.  What are you, an idiot, a drunk or a criminal?! Quickly, tell me!  All the doors and windows were properly bolted.  No-one, not even me, went into their room last night.  You have to believe me! I do, I just wanted you to speak quickly.  Miss Mackenzie will need to breath into a bag now.  SHE SOBS  Six grand a term, you'd expect them to keep the kids safe for you.  You said the other kids had all left on their holidays.  They were the only two sleeping on this floor.  There's absolutely no sign of a break-in.  The intruder must have been hidden inside some place.  Show me where the brother slept.  The boy sleeps there every night.  Gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor.  He'd recognise every shape, every outline,  the silhouette of everyone who came to the door.  OK, so? So if someone approaches the door who he doesn't recognise,  an intruder, maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon.  What would he do?  In the precious few seconds before they came into the room,  how would he use them if not to cry out?  This little boy, this particular little boy,  who reads all of those spy books, what would he do?  He'd leave a sign?  HE SNIFFS  Get Anderson!  Linseed oil.  Not much use, it doesn't lead us to the kidnapper. Brilliant, Anderson.  Really? Yes, brilliant impression of an idiot.  Floor.  He made a trail for us. The boy was made to walk ahead of them.  On what, tiptoe? Indicates anxiety.  Gun held to his head.  The girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways.  He had his left arm cradled about her neck.  That's the end of it, we don't know where they went from here.  Tells us nothing after all.  You're right, Anderson, nothing.  Except his shoe size, his height, his gait, his walking pace.  SHERLOCK LAUGHS  Having fun? Starting to.  Maybe don't do the smiling. Kidnapped children?  How could he get past the CCTV? If all the doors were locked.  He walked in when they weren't locked.  But a stranger can't just walk into a school like that.  Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment.  Yesterday, end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff.  What's one more stranger among that lot?  He was waiting for them.  All he had to do was find a place to hide.  Molly!  Hello, I'm just going out. No, you're not. I've got a lunch date.  Cancel it, have lunch with me. What? I need your help.  One of your old boyfriends, we're tracking him down.  He's been naughty. Moriarty? Of course it's Moriarty!  Jim wasn't my boyfriend, we went out three times. I ended it.  Then he stole the Crown Jewels, broke into the  Bank of England and organised a prison break.  For the sake of law and order, I suggest you avoid  all future attempts at a relationship, Molly.  Oil, John. The oil in the kidnapper's footprint.  It'll lead us to Moriarty.  All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved.  The sole of the shoe is like a passport.  If we're lucky, we'll see everything he's been up to.  I need that analysis.  Alkaline.  Thank you, John. Molly. Yes.  I O U.  Glycerol molecule.  HE SIGHS What are you?  What did you mean, IOU?  You said IOU.  You were muttering it while you were working. Nothing, mental note.  You're a bit like my dad. He's dead. No, sorry.  Molly, please don't feel the need to make  conversation, it's really not your area.  When he was dying, he was always cheerful, he was lovely,  except when he thought no-one could see.  I saw him once, he looked sad. Molly.  You look sad, when you think he can't see you.  Are you OK? And don't just say you are, because I know what that means,  looking sad when you think no-one can see you.  You can see me. I don't count.  What I'm trying to say is, that if there's anything I can do,  anything you need, anything at all, you can have me.  No, I just mean, I mean, if there's anything you need, it's fine.  But what can I need from you?  Nothing. I don't know.  You could probably say thank you, actually.  Thank you?  I'm just going to go and get some crisps. Do you want anything?  It's OK, I know you don't.  Well, actually, maybe I'll I know you don't.  Sherlock? Hmm?  This envelope that was in her trunk, there's another one. What?  On our doorstep. Found it today. Yes, and look at that.  Look at that, exactly the same seal.  Breadcrumbs. Uh-huh. It was there when I got back.  A little trace of breadcrumbs.  Hardback copy of Fairy Tales.  Two children led into the forest by a wicked  father, follow a little trail of breadcrumbs.  That's Hansel and Gretel. What sort of kidnapper leaves clues?  The sort that likes to boast, that thinks it's a game.  He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me  \"All fairy tales need a good old-fashioned villain.\"  The fifth substance, it's part of the tale. The witch's house. What?  The glycerol molecule.  PGPR! What's that? It's used in making chocolate.  This fax arrived an hour ago.  PHONE RINGS  What have you got for us?  We need to find a place in the city where  all five of these things intersect.  Chalk, asphalt, brick dust, vegetation.  What chocolate?! I think we're looking for a disused sweet factory.  We need to narrow that down. A sweet factory with asphalt?  No, too general. Something more specific.  Chalk, chalky clay. That's a far thinner band of geology.  Brick dust?  Building site. Bricks from the 1950s.  There's thousands of building sites in London.  I've got people out looking. So have I!  Homeless network, faster than the police,  far more relaxed about taking bribes.  PHONES RING  John.  Rhododendron ponticum. Matches.  Addlestone. What?  A mile of disused factories between the river and the park, matches everything.  Right, come on. Come on!  SIRENS BLARE  OK, you look over there.  Look everywhere.  OK, spread out, please, spread out.  (Quietly, quietly!)  This was alight moments ago. They're still here! Sweet wrappers?  What's he been feeding you? Hansel and Gretel.  HE SNIFFS  Ugh!  Mercury. What?  The papers, they're painted with mercury, lethal.  The more they ate  It was killing them. But it's not enough to kill them on its own.  Taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them.  He didn't need to be there for the execution.  Murder by remote control, he could be 1,000 miles away.  The hungrier they got, the more they ate, the faster they died. Neat.  Sherlock. Over here!  I've got him, don't worry.  Right then, the professionals are finished.  If the amateurs want to go in and have their turn.  Now remember, she's in shock and she's just seven years old,  so, anything you can do to  Not be myself? Yeah, might be helpful.  Claudette, I  SHE SCREAMS No, no, I know it's been hard for you.  Claudette, listen to me. Out. Get out!  Makes no sense. Kid's traumatised.  Something about Sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper. What's she said?  Hasn't uttered another syllable. And the boy? No, he's unconscious.  He's still in intensive care.  Don't let it get to you,  I always feel like screaming when you walk into a room.  In fact, so do most people.  Come on.  SIREN BLARES OUTSIDE  Brilliant work you did finding those kids from just a footprint,  it's really amazing.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  Ah.  You OK? Thinking.  This is my cab, you get the next one. Why? You might talk.  'Is this chocolate?' 'We're looking for a disused sweet factory.'  'Get out!'  'Aaaargh!'  Problem?  TV BLARES '..this stunning evening wear set from us at London Taxi Shopping.  Can you turn this off, please? 'The set comprises of a beautiful '  Can you turn this off?!  'Accompanied by four spangly diamond bracelets '  Hello.  Are you ready for the story?  This is the story of Sir Boast-a-lot.  A footprint, it's all he had.  A footprint.  Yeah, well, you know what he's like. CSI Baker Street.  Well, our boys couldn't have done it.  Well, that's why we need him, he's better. That's one explanation.  And what's the other?  Sir Boast-a-lot was the bravest and cleverest knight at the round table.  But soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories  about how brave he was and how many dragons he'd slain.  And soon they began to wonder, \"Are Sir Boast-a-lot's stories even true?\"  Only he could have found that evidence.  Oh, no.  The girl screams her head off when she sees  him a man she has never seen before,  unless she had seen him before. What's your point?  You know what it is, you just don't want to think about it.  So, all of the knights went to King Arthur and said,  \"I don't believe Sir Boast-a-lot's stories.  \"He's just a big old liar who makes things up to make himself look good.\"  SHE MOUTHS  You're not seriously suggesting he's involved, are you?  We have to entertain the possibility.  And then, even the King began to wonder.  But that wasn't the end of Sir Boast-a-lot's problem.  No.  That wasn't the final problem.  The end.  Stop the cab.  Stop the cab!  What was that?!  What was that?  No charge.  Watch out!  TYRES SQUEAL  Thank you.  GUNFIRE  Sherlock!  That is him. It's him.  Sulejmani or something, Mycroft showed me his file.  He's a big Albanian gangster, lives two doors down from us.  He died because I shook his hand. What?  He saved my life, but he couldn't touch me. Why?  Four assassins living right on our doorstep.  They haven't come here to kill me.  They have to keep me alive.  I've got something that all of them want.  But if one of them approaches me  The others kill them before they can get it.  All of the attention is focused on me.  There's a surveillance web closing in on us right now.  So what have you got that's so important?  I need to ask about the dusting.  Precise details, in the last week, what's been cleaned?  Tuesday, I did your lino. No, this room, this is where we'll find it.  Any break in the dust line.  You can put back anything but dust. Dust is eloquent.  (What's he on about?)  Cameras, we're being watched.  What?! Cameras? Here?  DOORBELL RINGS I'm in my nightie!  FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS  No, Inspector. Why?  The answer's no. You've not heard the question!  You want to take me to the station. Saving you the trouble of asking.  Sherlock.  The scream? Yeah.  Who was it? Donovan? I bet it was Donovan.  \"Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping?\"  Ha ha, Moriarty is smart.  He planted that doubt in her head. That little nagging sensation.  You're going to have to be strong to resist.  You can't kill an idea, can you?  Not once it's made a home there.  Will you come? One photograph, that's his next move.  Moriarty's game.  First the scream, then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning.  He wants to destroy me inch by inch.  It is a game, Lestrade, and not one I'm willing to play.  Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.  COMPUTER BLEEPS  They'll be deciding. Deciding?  Whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me. You think?  Standard procedure. You should have gone with him. People'll think  I don't care what people think.  You'd care if they thought you were stupid or wrong.  No, that would just make them stupid or wrong.  Sherlock, I don't want the world believing you're  That I am what?  A fraud.  You're worried they're right. What?  That they're right about me. No. That's why you're upset.  You can't entertain the possibility they may be right.  You're afraid you've been taken in. I'm not.  Moriarty is playing with your mind, too. Can't you SEE what's going on?!  No, I know you for real. 100 percent?  Well, nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time.  Sherlock Holmes? Yes, sir.  That bloke that's been in the press?  Mm-hm.  I thought he was some sort of private eye.  He is. We've been consulting with him, that's what you're telling me?  Not used him on any proper cases though, have we?  Well, one or two.  Or 20 or 30.  What?!  I'm not the only senior officer who did this. Gregson Shut up!  An amateur detective given access to all sorts of classified information.  And now he's a suspect in a case.  With all due respect You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade!  Now go and fetch him in, right now.  Do it!  Proud of yourselves? Well, what if it's not just this case?  What if he's done this to us every single time?  PHONE BLEEPS  So, still got some friends on the force. It's Lestrade.  Says they're all coming over here now.  Queuing up to slap on the handcuffs.  Every officer you've ever made feel like a tit,  which is a lot of people.  Yoo-hoo.  Oh, sorry, am I interrupting?  Some chap delivered a parcel, I forgot, marked perishable.  I had to sign for it.  Funny name, German, like the fairy tales.  SIRENS BLARE  Burnt to a crisp.  What does it mean? DOORBELL RINGS  KNOCKING AT DOOR 'Police!' I'll go.  'Sherlock.  'Excuse me, Mrs Hudson. We need to talk to you.  'You can't just barge in like that!'  JOHN: 'Have you got a warrant? Have you?'  LESTRADE: 'Leave it, John.  'Eh? Manners!'  Sherlock Holmes, I'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping.  It's OK, John. He's not resisting.  No, it's not all right, this is ridiculous.  Get him downstairs now.  You don't have to do this.  Don't try to interfere or I shall arrest you too.  You done?  I said it. Hmm?  First time we met. Don't bother.  Solving crimes won't be enough. One day he'll cross the line.  Now ask yourself, what sort of man would kidnap those kids  just so he can impress us all by finding them?  Donovan? Sir? Got our man? Er, yes, sir.  Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me.  Often are, these vigilante types.  What are you looking at?  Are you all right, sir?  Joining me? Yeah.  Well, apparently it's against the law to chin the Chief Superintendent.  Hmm. Bit awkward this.  There's no-one to bail us.  I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape.  'All units to 27.' What?  'All units to 2 '  ALARM SOUNDS Aah!  Ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees?  GUNFIRE NOW would be good! Do as he says!  Just so you're aware, the gun is his idea, I'm just a you know.  My hostage. Hostage, yes, that works. That works.  So what now?  Doing what Moriarty wants, becoming a fugitive. Run!  Get after him, Lestrade!  Take my hand.  SIRENS BLARE  Now people will definitely talk. The gun! Leave it!  Sherlock, wait!  We're going to need to coordinate.  Go to your right. Huh? Go to your right.  SIREN BLARES  Everybody wants to believe it, that's what makes it so clever.  A lie that's preferable to the truth.  My deductions were a sham.  No-one feels inadequate, Sherlock's an ordinary man.  Mycroft, he could help us.  Big family reconciliation, now's not really the moment.  Sherlock we're being followed. I knew we couldn't outrun the police.  That's not the police, it's one of my new neighbours from Baker Street.  Let's see if he can give us some answers.  (Where are we going?)  We're going to jump in front of that bus.  BOTH: Oof!  BUS BLASTS HORN  Oh  Tell me what you want from me.  Tell me!  He left it at your flat.  Who? Moriarty.  What?  The computer key code. Of course.  He's selling it. The programme he used to break into the Tower.  He planted it when he came around.  GUNFIRE  SIREN BLARES  THEY PAN  It's a game-changer.  It's a key, it can break into any system  and it's sitting in our flat right now.  That's why he left that message, telling everyone where to come, \"Get Sherlock!\"  We need to get back into the flat and search. CID will be camped out.  Why plant it on you?  It's another subtle way of smearing my name,  now I'm best pals with all those criminals.  Yeah, well, have you seen this?  A kiss-and-tell.  Some bloke called Rich Brook.  Who is he?  ALARM BLEEPS  Too late to go on the record?  Congratulations, \"The Truth About Sherlock Holmes.\"  The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it. Bravo!  I gave you your opportunity.  I wanted to be on your side, remember?  You turned me down, so  Then lo and behold, someone spills all the beans.  How utterly convenient. Who is Brook?  Oh, come on, Kitty, no-one trusts the voice at the end of a phone.  All those little meetings in cafes,  those sessions in the hotel room when he gabbled into your Dictaphone.  How do you know that you can trust him?  A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets.  What were his credentials?  Darling, they didn't have any ground coffee, so I just got normal.  You said that they wouldn't find me here, you said that I'd be safe here.  You are safe.  Richard, I'm a witness, they wouldn't harm you in front of witnesses.  So that's your source? Moriarty is Richard Brook?  Of course he's Richard Brook, there is no Moriarty.  There never has been. What are you talking about? Look him up.  Rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes hired to be Moriarty.  Dr Watson, I know you're a good man,  don't, don't, don't hurt me.  No, you are Moriarty! He's Moriarty!  We've met, remember? You were going to blow me up!  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  He paid me, I needed the work. I'm an actor, I was out of work.  Sherlock, you'd better explain, because I am not getting this.  I'll be doing the explaining, in print.  It's all here, conclusive proof.  You invented James Moriarty, your nemesis.  Invented him?! Mm-hm.  He invented all the crimes, actually.  And to cap it all, he made up a master villain.  Don't be ridiculous! Ask him. He's right here. Just ask him.  Tell him, Richard. For God's sake, this man was on trial!  Yes, and you paid him to take the rap. Promised you'd rig the jury.  Not exactly a West End role, but I'll bet the money was good.  But not so good he didn't want to sell his story.  I am sorry. I am. I am sorry.  So this is the story you're going to publish?  The big conclusion of it all, Moriarty's an actor? He knows I am.  I have proof. Show them Kitty, show them something.  Yeah, show me something.  I'm on TV. I'm on kids' TV. I'm the story-teller.  I'm the story-teller. It's on DVD.  Just tell him. It's all coming out. It's all over.  Just tell them. Just tell them. Tell them! It's all over now!  No! Don't you touch me! Don't you lay a finger on me!  Stop it now!  Don't hurt me! Don't let him get away!  Leave him alone!  No, no, no. He'll have back-up.  Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes?  I look at you know and I can read you and you repel me.  Can he do that?  Completely change his identity, make you the criminal?  He's got my whole life story.  That's what you do when you sell a big lie,  you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable.  It'll be your word against his.  He's been sowing doubt into people's minds for 24 hours.  There's only one thing he needs to do to complete his game and that  Sherlock?  There's something I need to do. What? Can I help? No, on my own.  You're wrong, you know?  You do count.  You've always counted and I've always trusted you.  But you were right.  I'm not OK.  Tell me what's wrong.  Molly, I think I'm going to die.  What do you need? If I wasn't everything that you think I am,  everything that I think I am  would you still want to help me?  What do you need?  You.  She has really done her homework, Miss Riley,  and it's things that only someone close to Sherlock could know.  Ah. Have you seen your brother's address book lately?  Two names yours and mine  and Moriarty didn't get this stuff from me.  John So how does it work, your relationship?  Do you go out for a coffee now and then, you and Jim?  Your own brother  and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac.  I never intend I never dreamt  This this is what you were trying to tell me, isn't it?  \"Watch his back because I've made a mistake.\"  How did you meet him?  People like him, we know about them, we watch them.  But James Moriarty  the most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen,  and, in his pocket, the ultimate weapon.  The key code.  A few lines of computer code that can unlock any door.  And you abducted him to try and find the key code?  Interrogated him for weeks.  And? He wouldn't play along.  He just sat there  staring into the darkness.  The only thing that made him open up  I could get him to talk, just a little.  But  In return you had to offer him Sherlock's life story.  So, one big lie  Sherlock's a fraud,  and people will swallow it because the rest of it's true.  Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed, right,  and you have given him the perfect ammunition.  John.  I'm sorry.  Oh, please!  Tell him, would you?  I got your message.  The computer code is the key to this. We find it, we can use it.  Use it? He used it to create a false identity  so we can break into the records and destroy Richard Brook.  Bring back Jim Moriarty again.  Somewhere in 221b,  somewhere on the day of the verdict he left it hidden.  Uh-huh.  What did he touch? An apple, nothing else.  Did he write anything down? No.  MOBILE RINGS  Oh.  Yeah, speaking.  What?  What happened? Is she OK?  Oh, my God! Right, yes, I'm coming.  What is it? Paramedics. Mrs Hudson's been shot.  How? Probably one of the killers you managed to attract. Jesus!  She's dying, Sherlock. Let's go. You go. I'm busy.  Busy?! Thinking. I need to think.  You need to? Doesn't she mean anything to you?  You once half-killed a man because he laid a finger on her.  She's my landlady. She's dying you machine!  Sod this. Sod this! You stay here if you want, on your own.  Alone is what I have. Alone protects me.  No, friends protect people.  TEXT ALER  I've been kicked around since I was born  But now it's all right, it's OK  You can look the other way  We can try to understand  The New York Times' effect on man  Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother  You're stayin' alive   Well here we are at last.  You and me, Sherlock.  And our problem the final problem.  Staying alive!  It's so boring, isn't it?  It's just staying.  All my life I've been searching for distractions  and you were the best distraction and now I don't even have you  because I've beaten you.  And you know what? In the end, it was easy.  It was easy.  Now I've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people,  and it turns out you're ordinary, just like all of them.  Ah, well.  Did you almost start to wonder if I was real?  Did I nearly get you?  Richard Brook.  Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do.  Of course. Attaboy.  Richard Brook in German is Reichenbach.  The case that made my name. Just trying to have some fun.  Good. You got that too.  Beats like digits.  Every beat is a one, every rest is a zero.  Binary code.  That's why all those assassins tried to save my life.  It was hidden on me, hidden inside my head.  A few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system.  Told all my clients, last one to Sherlock is a sissy.  But now that it's up here, I can use it to alter all the records.  I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty.  No, no, no, no, no. This is too easy.  This is too easy.  There is no key, doofus!  Those digits are meaningless. They're utterly meaningless.  You don't really think a couple of lines of computer code  are going to crash the world around our ears?  I'm disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock.  But the rhythm Partita no 1! Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.  But then how did you ? How did I break  into the bank, to the Tower, to the prison?  Daylight robbery! All it takes is some willing participants.  I knew you'd fall for it. That's your weakness.  You always want everything to be clever.  Shall we finish the game? One final act.  Glad you chose a tall building. Nice way to do it.  Do it? Do what?  Yes, of course.  My suicide.  Genius detective proved to be a fraud.  I read it in the paper so it must be true.  I love newspapers.  Fairy tales.  And pretty grim ones too.  Oh, God, John, you made me jump. Is everything OK with the police?  Has Sherlock sorted it all out?  Oh, my God.  Taxi!  Taxi! No, no, no. Police sort of!  Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot!  I can prove that you created an entirely false identity.  Oh, just kill yourself. It's a lot less effort.  Go on.  For me.  Please!  You're insane.  You're just getting that now? Wo-wo-wo!  OK.  Let me give you a little extra incentive.  Your friends will die if you don't.  John?  Not just John. Everyone.  Mrs Hudson? Everyone.  Lestrade? Three bullets, three gunmen, three victims.  There's no stopping them now  unless my people see you jump.  You can have me arrested, you can torture me,  you can do anything you like with me,  but nothing's going to prevent them from pulling the trigger.  Your only three friends in the world will die unless  Unless I kill myself and complete your story.  You've got to admit, that's sexier.  And I die in disgrace. Of course. That's the point of this.  Oh. You've got an audience now.  Off you pop.  Go on.  I told you how this ends.  Your death is the only thing that's going to call off the killers.  I'm certainly not going to do it.  Would you give me one moment, please?  One moment of privacy.  Please.  Of course.  HE LAUGHS  What?!  What is it?  What did I miss?  You're not going to do it.  So the killers can be called off,  then there's a recall code or a word or a number.  I don't have to die  if I've got you.  Oh!  You think you can make me stop the order?  You think you can make me do that? Yes.  So do you. Sherlock, your big brother and all the King's horses  couldn't make me do a thing I didn't want to.  Yes, but I'm not my brother, remember?  I am you.  Prepared to do anything.  Prepared to burn.  Prepared to do what ordinary people won't do.  You want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you.  Nah.  You talk big.  Nah.  You're ordinary.  You're ordinary. You're on the side of the angels.  Oh, I may be on the side of the angels,  but don't think for one second that I am one of them.  No  you're not.  I see.  You're not ordinary.  No.  You're me.  You're me.  Thank you  Sherlock Holmes.  Thank you.  Bless you.  As long as I'm alive, you can save your friends, you've got a way out.  Well, good luck with that.  No.  Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye.  MOBILE DIAL TONE  MOBILE RINGS Hello?  John. Hey, Sherlock. Are you OK?  Turn around and walk back the way you came. I'm coming in.  Just do as I ask!  Please.  Where?  Stop there.  Sherlock? OK, look up. I'm on the rooftop.  Oh, God.  I I can't come down, so we'll just have to do it like this.  What's going on?  An apology.  It's all true.  What?  Everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty.  Why are you saying this?  I'm a fake.  Sherlock The newspapers were right all along.  I want you to tell Lestrade,  I want you to tell Mrs Hudson and Molly.  In fact, tell anyone who will listen to you  that I created Moriarty for my own purposes.  OK, shut up Sherlock. Shut up.  The first time we met the first time we met,  you knew all about my sister, right? Nobody could be that clever.  You could.  I researched you.  Before we met, I discovered everything that I could  to impress you.  It's a trick. Just a magic trick.  No. All right, stop it now.  No. Stay exactly where you are.  Don't move. All right.  Keep your eyes fixed on me.  Please, will you do this for me? Do what?  This phone call, it's  it's my note.  It's what people do, don't they?  Leave a note?  Leave a note when?  Goodbye, John. No. Don't  Sherlock!  Sherlock.  Sherlock Sherlock.  I'm a doctor, let me come through. Let me come through, please.  He's my friend. He's my friend Please.  Please, let me just  Oh, Jesus!  No.  God, no.  There's stuff that you wanted to say  but didn't say it. Yeah.  Say it now.  Sorry, I can't.  There's all the stuff. All the science equipment.  I left it all in boxes. I don't know what needs doing.  I thought I'd take it to a school.  Would you? I can't go back to the flat again, not at the moment.  I'm angry.  It's OK, John. There's nothing unusual in that.  That's the way he made everyone feel.  All the marks on my table and the noise,  firing guns at half past one in the morning Yeah.  Bloody specimens in my fridge.  Imagine, keeping bodies where there's food. Yes.  And the fighting! Drove me up the wall with all his carryings-on.  Listen, I'm not actually that angry, OK?  OK. I'll leave you alone to, you know  Erm  Hmm.  You you told me once  that you weren't a hero.  Erm, there were times I didn't even think you were human,  but let me tell you this, you were  the best man  the most human human being that I've ever known  and no-one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, so  there.  I was so alone  and I owe you so much.  But, please, there's just one more thing, one more thing,  one more miracle, Sherlock, for me, don't be  dead.  Would you do that just for me?  Just stop it. Stop this.",
