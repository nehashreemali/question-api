  "transcript": "1 Oh, hello.  Are you all right? What is it, dear? Are you lost?  - Well, that was tedious! - You went on the Tube like that?  None of the cabs would take me.  Nothing?  - Military coup in Uganda - Hmm.  Hmm. Another photo of you with the  Oh, um, Cabinet re-shuffle  Nothing of importance! Oh, God!  John, I need some. Get me some!  - No. - Get me some!  No! Cold turkey. We agreed. No matter what.  Anyway, you've paid everyone off, remember?  No one within a two-mile radius will sell you any.  Stupid idea! Whose idea was that?  Mrs Hudson!  Look, Sherlock, you're doing really well.  Don't give up now!  Tell me where they are. Please. Tell me.  - Please. - Can't help, sorry.  I'll let you know next week's lottery numbers.  Oh, it was worth a try.  - Yoo-hoo! - My secret supply.  What have you done with my secret supply?  - Hey? - Cigarettes!  What have you done with them? Where are they?  You know you never let me touch your things.  Oh! Chance would be a fine thing.  - I thought you weren't my housekeeper? - I'm not.  How about a nice cuppa? And perhaps you could put away your harpoon.  I need something stronger than tea. Perhaps 7% stronger.  You've been to see Mr Chatterjee again.  - Pardon? - Sandwich shop. That's a new dress,  but there's flour on the sleeve. You wouldn't dress like that for baking.  - Sherlock. - Thumbnail, tiny traces of foil.  Been at the scratch-cards again. We all know where that leads, don't we?  Mmm, Casbah Nights.  Pretty racy for first thing on a Monday morning, wouldn't you agree?  I've written a little blog on the identification of perfumes.  It's on the website. You should look it up!  - Please! - I wouldn't pin your hopes  on that cruise with Mr Chatterjee. He's got a wife in Doncaster  - that nobody knows about. - Sherlock!  Well, nobody except me.  I don't know what you're talking about, I really don't!  What the bloody hell was all that about?  You don't understand.  Go after her and apologise.  - Apologise? - Mmm-hmm.  Oh, John, I envy you so much.  - You envy me? - Your mind.  It's so placid, straightforward, barely used.  Mine's like an engine, racing out of control.  A rocket tearing itself to pieces, trapped on the launch pad.  - I need a case! - You've just solved one!  By harpooning a dead pig, apparently.  Ah! That was this morning! When's the next one?  Nothing on the website?  \"Dear Mr Sherlock Holmes, I can't find Bluebell anywhere.  \"Please, please, please, can you help?\"  - Bluebell? - A rabbit, John!  - Oh. - Ah, but there's more.  Before Bluebell disappeared, it turned luminous.  \"Like a fairy!\" according to little Kirsty.  Then the next morning, Bluebell was gone!  Hutch still locked, no sign of a forced entry.  What am I saying? This is brilliant. Phone Lestrade,  - tell him there's an escaped rabbit. - You're serious?  - It's this or Cluedo. - No.  - We are never playing that again. - Why not?  Because it's not actually possible for the victim to have done it,  - Sherlock, that's why. - It was the only possible solution.  - It's not in the rules. - Well, then the rules are wrong!  - Single ring. - Maximum pressure,  just under the half-second.  Client!  It's always been a place of myth and legend.  But is there something else lurking out here?  Something very real?  Because Dartmoor is also home  to one of the government's most secretive operation.;  The Chemical and Biological Weapons Research Centre,  which is said to be even more sensitive than Porton Down.  Since the end of the Second World War,  there have been persistent stories about the Baskerville experiments.  Genetic mutations. Animals grown for the battlefield.  There are many who believe that within this compound  in the heart of this ancient wilderness there are horrors beyond imagining.  But the real question is are all of them still inside?  I was just a kid.  It was on the moor, it was dark, but I know what I saw.  I know what killed my father:  - What did you see? - Oh, I I was just about to say.  Yes, in a TV interview. I prefer to do my own editing.  Yes.  Sorry, yes, of course.  Excuse me.  - In your own time. - But quite quickly.  - Do you know Dartmoor, Mr Holmes? - No.  It's an amazing place. It's like nowhere else,  it's sort of bleak but beautiful.  Hmm. Not interested, moving on.  We used to go for walks after my Mum died, my Dad and me.  Every evening we'd go out onto the moor.  Yes, good, skipping to the night that your dad was violently killed.  Where did that happen?  There's a place, it's a sort of local landmark called Dewer's Hollow.  That's an ancient name for the Devil.  So?  Did you see the Devil that night?  Yes.  It was huge.  Coal black fur with red eyes.  It got him. Tore at him, tore him apart.  I can't remember anything else,  they found me the next morning just wandering on the moor.  My Dad's body was never found.  Hmm.  Red eyes, coal black fur.  Enormous. Some sort of dog, wolf?  Or a genetic experiment?  - Are you laughing at me, Mr Holmes? - Why, are you joking?  My Dad was always going on about the things they were doing at Baskerville.  About the type of monsters they were breeding there.  People used to laugh at him.  At least the TV people took me seriously.  - I assume did wonders for Devon tourism. - Yeah  Henry, whatever did happen to your father,  it was 20 years ago. Why come to us now?  I'm not sure you can help me, Mr Holmes, since you find it all so funny!  - Because of what happened last night. - Why? What happened last night?  - How How did you know? - I didn't know, I noticed.  Came up from Devon on the first available train this morning.  You had a disappointing breakfast and a cup of black coffee.  The girl in the seat across the aisle fancied you.  Although you were initially keen, you've now changed your mind.  You are, however, extremely anxious to have your first cigarette of the day.  Sit down, Mr Knight. And do please smoke, I'd be delighted.  - How on earth did you notice all that? - It's not important  Punched-out holes where your ticket's been checked.  - Not now, Sherlock. - Oh, please?  - I've been cooped up in here for ages. - You're just showing off.  Of course. I am a show-off. That's what we do.  Train napkin you used to mop up the spilled coffee,  strength of the stain shows that you didn't take milk.  There are traces of ketchup on it and round your lips and on your sleeve.  Cooked breakfast. Or the nearest thing those trains can manage,  - probably a sandwich. - How did you know it was disappointing?  Is there any other type of breakfast on a train?  The girl, female handwriting's quite distinctive,  wrote her phone number down on the napkin.  I can tell from the angle she wrote at that she was sat across from you  on the other side of the aisle. Later, after she'd got off, I imagine,  you used the napkin to mop up your spilled coffee,  accidentally smudging the numbers.  You've been over the last four digits yourself with another pen  so you wanted to keep the number. Just now, though, you used the napkin  to blow your nose. Maybe you're not that into her after all.  Then there's the nicotine stains on your fingers,  your shaking fingers. I know the signs.  No chance to smoke one on the train, no time to roll one  before you got a cab here. It's just after 9:15, you're desperate.  The first train from Exeter to London leaves at 5:46 a.m.  You got the first one possible, so something important  must have happened last night. Am I wrong?  No. You're right.  You're You're completely, exactly right.  - Bloody hell, I heard you were quick. - It's my job. Now shut up and smoke!  Henry, your parents both died  and you were, what, seven years old?  I know, but  That must be quite a trauma.  Have you ever thought that maybe you invented this story, this  to account for it?  - That's what Dr Mortimer says. - Who?  - His therapist. - My therapist.  Obviously.  Louise Mortimer.  She's the reason I came back to Dartmoor.  She thinks I have to face my demons.  And what happened when you went back to Dewer's Hollow last night, Henry?  You went there on the advice of your therapist  and now you're consulting a detective.  What did you see that changed everything?  It's a strange place, the Hollow.  Makes you feel so cold inside, so afraid.  Yes, if I wanted poetry,  I'd read john's emails to his girlfriends, much funnier.  What did you see?  Footprints.  On the exact spot where I saw my father torn apart.  - A man's or a woman's? - Neither.  - They were - Is that it? Nothing else?  - Footprints. Is that all? - Yes, but they were  No, sorry, Dr Mortimer wins, childhood trauma masked by an invented memory.  Boring! Goodbye, Mr Knight. Thank you for smoking.  But what about the footprints?  Oh, well, they're probably pawprints, could be anything, therefore nothing.  Off to Devon with you. Have a cream tea on me.  Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!  - Say that again? - I found footprints, they were  No, no, no, your exact words.  Repeat your exact words from a moment ago,  exactly as you said them.  Mr Holmes,  they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.  - I'll take the case. - Sorry, what?  Thank you for bringing this to my attention, it's very promising.  No, no, no. Sorry, what?  A minute ago footprints were boring, now they've very promising?  It's got nothing to do with footprints. As ever, John, you weren't listening.  - Baskerville, ever heard of it? - Vaguely. It's very hush-hush.  - Sounds like a good place to start. - Ah, you'll come down, then?  No, I can't leave London at the moment, far too busy.  But don't worry, I'm putting my best man onto it.  Always rely on John to send me all the relevant data,  as he never understands a word of it himself.  What are you talking about, you're busy? You don't have a case.  - A minute ago you were complaining - Bluebell, John! I've got Bluebell.  The case of the vanishing glow-in-the-dark rabbit.  - NATO's in uproar. - Oh, sorry. You're not coming, then?  Oh! Okay.  Okay.  I don't need those any more, I'm going to Dartmoor.  You go on ahead, Henry, we'll follow later.  Sorry, so you are coming?  Twenty-year-old disappearance? A monstrous hound?  I wouldn't miss this for the world!  Oh! Looks like Mrs Hudson finally got to the wife in Doncaster.  Hmm. Wait till she finds out about the one in Islamabad.  Paddington Station, please.  There's Baskerville.  Uh, that's Grimpen village.  So that must be  Yes, Dewer's Hollow.  - What's that? - Hmm?  A minefield?  Technically, Baskerville's an army base, so I guess they've always been keen  - to keep people out. - Clearly.  All right. Three tours a day. Tell your friends. Tell anyone!  Don't be strangers and remember, stay away from the moor at night,  if you value your lives! Take care.  It's cold.  That part doesn't change.  What does?  Oh, there's something else. It's a word.  Liberty.  - Liberty? - There's another word.  In. I-N.  \"Liberty In.\" What do you think it means?  Eh, sorry we couldn't do a double room for you boys.  That's fine. We're not  - There you go. - Oh, ta. I'll just get your change.  Ta.  Well, there you go.  I couldn't help noticing, on the map of the moor, a skull and crossbones?  Oh, that.  - Pirates? - Eh, no, no.  The Great Grimpen Minefield, they call it.  - Oh, right. - It's not what you think.  It's the Baskerville testing site.  It's been going for 80-odd years.  I'm not sure anyone really knows what's there any more.  - Explosives? - Oh, not just explosives.  Break into that place and if you're lucky  you just get blown up, so they say.  In case you're planning a nice wee stroll.  Ta, I'll remember.  Aye. No, it buggers up tourism a bit, so thank God for the demon hound!  - Did you see that show? The documentary? - Quite recently, yeah.  God bless Henry Knight and his monster from hell.  - You ever seen it? The Hound? - Me? No, no.  Eh, Fletcher has. He runs the walks, the monster walks,  for the tourists, you know? He's seen it.  That's handy. For trade.  I'm just saying we've been rushed off our feet, Billy.  Yeah, lots of monster hunters. Doesn't take much these days.  One mention on Twitter and woomph!  - We're out of WKD. - All right.  What with the monster and the ruddy prisoner,  I don't know how we sleep nights, do you, Gary?  - Like a baby. - That's not true. He's a snorer.  - Hey! Shh. - Is yours a snorer?  Got any crisps?  Yeah. No. All right? All right. Take care.  Mind if I join you?  It's not true, is it? You haven't actually seen this Hound thing?  - You from the papers? - No. Nothing like that. Just curious.  - Have you seen it? - Maybe.  - Got any proof? - Why would I tell you if I did?  - Excuse me. - I called Henry  - Bet's off, John. Sorry. - What?  - Bet? - My plan needs darkness.  We've got another half an hour of light  Wait, wait. What bet?  Oh, I bet John here 50 quid that you couldn't prove you'd seen the Hound.  Yeah, the guys in the pub said you could.  Well, you're going to lose your money, mate.  - Yea h? - Yeah.  I seen it. Only about a month ago.  Up at the Hollow. It was foggy, mind. Couldn't make much out.  - I see. No witnesses, I suppose? - No, but  - Never are. - No, wait.  There.  Is that it? It's not exactly proof, is it?  - Sorry, John. I win. - Wait, wait! That's not all.  People don't like going up there, you know. To the Hollow.  - Gives them a bad sort of feeling. - Ooh, is it haunted?  - Is that supposed to convince me? - Nah, don't be stupid!  Nothing like that. But I reckon there is something out there.  Something from Baskerville. Escaped.  - A cone? Super-dog? - Maybe.  God knows what they've been spraying on us all these years.  Or putting in the water. I wouldn't trust them as far as I could spit.  Is that the best you've got?  I had a mate once who worked for the MOD.  One weekend we were meant to go fishing, but he never showed up.  Well, not till late. When he did,  he was white as a sheet. I can see him now.  \"I've seen things today, Fletch,\" he said, \"I ain't never want to see again.  \"Terrible things.\"  He'd been sent to some secret army place. Porton Down, maybe?  Maybe Baskerville? Or somewhere else.  In the labs there, the really secret labs,  he said he'd seen terrible things.  Rats as big as dogs, he said.  And dogs, dogs the size of horses.  Uh, we did say 50?  Mmm. Ta.  Pass, please?  Thank you.  We got ID for Baskerville? How?  It's not specific to this place. It's my brother's.  Access all areas. I, um acquired it ages ago, just in case.  - Brilliant. - What's the matter?  - We'll get caught. - No, we won't. Well, not just yet.  Caught in five minutes. \"Oh, hi! We just thought  \"we'd come and have a wander round your top-secret weapons base.\"  \"Really? Great! Come in, kettle's just boiled.\"  That's if we don't get shot.  - Here you are. - Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Straight through, sir.  Mycroft's name literally opens doors.  I've told you. He practically is the British Government.  I reckon we've got about 20 minutes before they realise something's wrong.  - What is it? Are we in trouble? - \"Are we in trouble, sir?\"  - Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. - You were expecting us?  Your ID showed up straight away, Mr Holmes.  Corporal Lyons. Security.  - Is there something wrong, sir? - Well, I hope not, Corporal. I hope not.  It's just we don't get inspected here, you see, sir. It just doesn't happen.  Never heard of a spot check?  Captain John Watson. Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.  Sir! Major Barrymore won't be pleased, sir.  He'll want to see you both.  I'm afraid we won't have time for that. We'll need the full tour.  Right away. Carry on.  - That's an order, Corporal. - Yes, sir.  - Nice touch. - Haven't pulled rank in ages.  - Enjoy it? - Oh, yeah.  How many animals do you keep down here?  Lots, sir.  Any ever escape?  They'd have to know how to use that lift, sir.  We're not breeding them that clever.  Unless they have help.  Ah. And you are?  I'm sorry, Dr Frankland, I'm just showing these gentlemen around.  Ah, new faces! How nice.  Careful you don't get stuck here, though. I only came to fix a tap.  How far down does that lift go?  - Quite a way, sir. - Mmm-hmm.  And what's down there?  Well, we have to keep the bins somewhere, sir.  This way, please, gentlemen.  So what exactly is it that you do here?  I thought you'd know, sir. This being an inspection.  Well, I'm not an expert, am I?  Everything from stem cell research to trying to cure the common cold, sir.  - But mostly weaponry? - Of one sort or another, yes.  - Biological, chemical - One war ends, another begins, sir.  New enemies to fight. We have to be prepared.  Okay, Michael. Let's try Halo 5 next time.  - Dr Stapleton. - Stapleton.  Yes.  Who's this?  Priority ultra, ma'am. Orders from on high.  - An inspection. - Really?  We're to be accorded every courtesy, Dr Stapleton.  What's your role at Baskerville?  Accorded every courtesy, isn't that the idea?  I'm not free to say. Official Secrets.  Oh, you most certainly are free. And I suggest you remain that way.  I have a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.  I like to mix things up.  Genes, mostly. Now and again, actual fingers.  - Stapleton, I knew I knew your name. - I doubt it.  People say there's no such thing as coincidence.  What dull lives they must lead.  Have you been talking to my daughter?  Why did Bluebell have to die, Dr Stapleton?  - The rabbit? - Disappeared from inside a locked hutch,  - which was always suggestive. - The rabbit?  Clearly an inside job.  - Oh, you reckon? - Why?  Because it glowed in the dark?  I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.  Who are you?  Well, I think we've seen enough for now, Corporal. Thank you so much.  - That's it? - That's it. It's this way, isn't it?  Just a minute!  Did we break into a military base to investigate a rabbit?  Huh. 23 minutes. Mycroft's getting slow.  Hello. Again.  - Uh, Major, this is - Bloody outrageous!  Why wasn't I told?  Major Barrymore, is it?  Yes. Well. Good.  Very good. We're very impressed.  - Aren't we, Mr Holmes? - Deeply. Hugely.  The whole point of Baskerville was to eliminate  - this kind of bureaucratic nonsense! - I'm so sorry, Major.  - Inspections - New policy.  You can't remain unmonitored forever. Goodness knows what you'd get up to.  - Keep walking. - Sir!  - ID unauthorised, sir! - What?  - I've just had the call. - Is that right? Who are you?  Look, there's obviously been some kind of mistake.  Clearly not Mycroft Holmes.  Computer error, Major. It'll all have to go in the report.  - What the hell's going on? - It's all right, Major.  - I know exactly who these gentlemen are. - You do?  Yeah. I'm getting a little slow on faces,  but Mr Holmes here isn't someone I expected to show up in this place.  - Ah, well - Good to see you again, Mycroft.  I had the honour of meeting Mr Holmes at the WHO conference in  Brussels, was it?  - Vienna. - Vienna. That's it.  This is Mr Mycroft Holmes, Major. There's obviously been a mistake.  On your head be it, Dr Frankland.  - I'll show them out, Corporal. - Very well, sir.  - Thank you. - This is about Henry Knight, isn't it?  I thought so. I knew he wanted help but  I didn't realise he was going to contact Sherlock Holmes.  Don't worry, I know who you really are.  I'm never off your website.  Thought you'd be wearing the hat, though.  That wasn't my hat.  - I hardly recognise him without the hat. - It wasn't my hat.  - I love the blog, too, Dr Watson. - Oh, cheers.  The Pink thing! And that one about the Aluminium Crutch!  You know Henry Knight?  Well, I knew his dad better.  He had all sorts of mad theories about this place.  Still, he was a good friend.  Listen, I can't really talk now.  Here's my cell number.  If I can help, with Henry, give me a call.  I never did ask, Dr Frankland. What exactly is it that you do here?  Mr Holmes, I would love to tell you,  but then of course I'd have to kill you.  That would be tremendously ambitious of you.  Tell me about Dr Stapleton.  I never speak ill of a colleague.  But you'd speak well of one, which you're clearly omitting to do.  I do seem to be, don't I?  - I'll be in touch. - Any time.  - So? - So?  What was all that about the rabbit?  Oh, please. Can we not do this this time?  - Do what? - You being all mysterious with your  cheekbones, and turning your coat collar up so you look cool.  - I don't do that. - Yeah, you do.  So, the email from Kirsty,  the missing luminous rabbit  Kirsty Stapleton, whose mother specialises in genetic manipulation.  She made her daughter's rabbit glow in the dark?  Probably a fluorescent gene.  Removed and spliced into the specimen, simple enough these days.  So  So we know that Dr Stapleton performs secret genetic experiments on animals.  The question is has she been working on something deadlier than a rabbit?  To be fair, that is quite a wide field.  - Hi. Come in. Come in. - Hi.  This is, uh  Are you, um rich?  - Yeah. - Right.  It's a couple of words. That's what I keep seeing.  - \" Liberty.\" - Liberty?  \"Liberty\" and  \"In.\"  It's just that.  - Are you finished? - Mmm.  Mean anything to you?  \"Liberty in death\", isn't that the expression?  - Mmm. - The only true freedom?  - What now, then? - Sherlock's got a plan.  - Yes. - Right.  We take you back out onto the moor.  - Okay. - And see if anything attacks you.  - What? - That should bring things to a head.  At night?  - You want me to go out there at night? - That's your plan?  - Brilliant. - Do you have any better ideas?  - That's not a plan. - If there is a monster out there, John,  there's only one thing to do, find out where it lives.  Sher.  U-M-Q-R-A. UMQRA?  Sherlock.  Sherlock.  Sherlock!  Met a friend of yours.  - What? - Dr Frankland.  Oh, right. Bob, yeah.  He seems pretty concerned about you.  He's a worrier. Bless him.  He's been very kind to me since I came back.  - He knew your father? - Yeah.  But he works at Baskerville. Didn't your dad have a problem with that?  Well, mates are mates, aren't they? I mean, look at you and John.  What about us?  Well, I mean, he's a pretty straightforward bloke  and you  They agreed never to talk about work, Uncle Bob and my dad.  Dewer's Hollow.  Sherlock?  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God  Did you see it?  - Did you hear that? - We saw it! We saw it.  No. I didn't see anything.  What? What are you talking about?  I didn't see anything!  Look, he must have seen it! I saw it. He must have.  He must have. I  Why? Why? Why would he say that?  It-it-it was there. It was.  Henry? Henry, I need you to sit down.  - Try and relax, please. - I'm okay. I'm okay.  I'm going to give you something to help you sleep.  - All right? - This is good news, John.  It's it's it's good.  I'm not crazy.  There is a Hound. There is  And Sherlock, he saw it too. No matter what he says. He saw it.  Well, he is in a pretty bad way. He's manic.  Totally convinced there's some mutant super-dog roaming the moors.  And there isn't, though, is there?  'Cause if people knew how to make a mutant super-dog, we'd know.  They'd be for sale. I mean, that's how it works.  Listen, on the moor, I saw someone signalling.  Morse. I guess it's Morse.  Doesn't seem to make much sense.  U-M-Q-R-A. Does that mean anything?  So, okay. What have we got?  We know there's footprints, 'cause Henry found them.  So did the tour guide. But we all heard something.  Maybe we should just look for whoever's got a big dog.  - Henry's right. - What?  I saw it, too.  - What? - I saw it, too, John.  - Just just a minute. You saw what? - A hound.  Out there in the Hollow.  A gigantic hound!  Um  Look, Sherlock. We have to be rational about this. Okay?  Now, you, of all people, can't just  Let's just stick to what we know, yes? Stick to the facts.  Once you've ruled out the impossible,  whatever remains, however improbable, must be true.  What does that mean?  Huh.  Look at me, I'm afraid, John.  Afraid.  Sherlock  I've always been able to keep myself distant.  Divorce myself from feelings.  But, look, you see? My body's betraying me.  Interesting, yes? Emotions.  The grit on the lens, the fly in the ointment!  Yeah, all right, Spock.  Just take it easy.  You've been pretty wired lately. You know you have.  I think you've just gone out there and got yourself a bit worked up.  Worked up?  - It was dark and scary - Me?  There's nothing wrong with me.  Sherlock?  - Sherlock? - There is nothing wrong with me!  Do you understand?  You want me to prove it, yes?  We're looking for a dog, yes? A great big dog.  That's your brilliant theory. Cherchez le chien!  Good. Excellent. Yes! Where shall we start?  How about them?  The sentimental widow and her son, the unemployed fisherman?  - The answer's yes. - Yes?  She's got a West Highland terrier called Whisky.  - Not exactly what we're looking for. - Sherlock, for God's sake.  Look at the jumper he's wearing, hardly worn.  Clearly he's uncomfortable in it.  Maybe it's because of the material, more likely the hideous pattern.  Suggests it's a present. Probably Christmas.  So, he wants into his Mother's good books. Why? Almost certainly money.  He's treating her to a meal, but his own portion is small.  That means he wants to impress her,  but he's trying to economise on his own food.  - Well, maybe he's just not hungry. - No. Small plate. A starter.  He's practically licked it clean. She's nearly finished her pavlova.  If she'd treated him, he'd have had as much as he wanted.  He's hungry, all right. And not well off.  You can tell that from the state of his cuffs and shoes.  \"How do you know she's his mother?\"  Who else would give him a Christmas present like that?  Well, it could be an aunt or an older sister, but mother's more likely.  Now, he was a fisherman.  The scarring pattern on his hands is very distinctive, fish-hooks.  They're all quite old now,  which suggests he's been unemployed for some time.  Not much industry in this part of the world,  so he's turned to his widowed mother for help.  \"Widowed?\" Yes! Obviously.  She's got a man's wedding ring on a chain around her neck,  clearly her late husband's and too big for her finger.  She's well-dressed but her jewellery's cheap.  She could afford better, but she's kept it. Sentimental.  Now, the dog. Tiny little hairs all over the leg  from where it gets a little bit too friendly.  But no hairs above the knee, suggesting it's a small dog,  probably a terrier. In fact, it is a West Highland terrier called Whisky.  \"How the hell do you know that, Sherlock?\"  Because she was on the same train as us and I heard her calling its name.  And that's not cheating, that's listening.  I use my senses, John, unlike some people.  So, you see, I am fine. In fact, I've never been better.  So just leave me alone.  Yeah, okay.  Okay.  Why would you listen to me? I'm just your friend.  - I don't have friends. - No.  I wonder why?  Oh, Mr Selden! You've done it again!  Oh. I keep catching it with me belt.  Oh, God. Oh  Sh  So?  Oh, you're a bad man.  Morning!  - No, I mean - What is it?  Um, more wine, Doctor?  - You trying to get me drunk, Doctor? - The thought never occurred.  Because a while ago, I thought you were chatting me up.  Oh! Where did I go wrong?  When you started asking me about my patients.  No, you see, I am one of Henry's oldest friends.  Yeah, and he's one of my patients, so I can't talk about him.  Though he has told me about all his oldest friends.  Which one are you?  A new one?  Okay, what about his father? He wasn't one of your patients.  Wasn't he some sort of conspiracy nutter, theorist?  - You're only a nutter if you're wrong. - Hmm.  - Was he wrong? - I should think so.  But he got fixated on Baskerville, didn't he?  With what they were doing in there. Couldn't Henry have gone the same way?  Started imagining a hound?  Why do you think I'm going to talk about this?  Because I think you're worried about him.  And because I am a doctor, too,  and because I have another friend who  might be having the same problem.  - Dr Watson! - Hi.  Hello.  How's the investigation going?  - Hello. - What investigation?  Didn't you know? Don't you read the blog?  - Sherlock Holmes! - Sherlock who?  Private detective.  - This is his PA. - PA?  - Well, live-in PA. - Perfect.  - Live-in. - Uh, this is Dr Mortimer.  Henry's therapist.  Oh, hello. Bob Frankland.  Listen, tell Sherlock I've been keeping an eye on Stapleton.  Any time he wants a little chat  All right?  - Oh. - Ah.  Why don't you buy him a drink?  I think he likes you.  Morning! Oh, how are you feeling?  I'm I didn't sleep very well.  That's a shame. Shall I make you some coffee?  Oh, look. You've got damp.  Listen.  Last night  Why did you say you hadn't seen anything?  I mean, I only saw the Hound for a minute but  - Hound. - What?  Why do you call it a hound? Why a hound?  - Why? What do you mean? - It's odd, isn't it?  Strange choice of words, archaic. That's why I took the case.  \"Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.\"  Why say \"hound\"?  - I don't know, I've never - Actually, let's skip the coffee.  You, uh, getting anywhere with that Morse Code?  - No. - U-M-Q-R-A, wasn't it?  - UMQRA. - Nothing.  - UMQ - Look, forget it.  I thought I was onto something, I wasn't.  - Sure? - Yeah.  How about Louise Mortimer? Did you get anywhere with her?  - No. - Too bad.  Did you get any information?  Hmm. You're being funny now?  Thought it might break the ice a bit.  Funny doesn't suit you. I'd stick to ice.  John - It's fine.  No, wait. What happened last night, something happened to me,  something I've not really experienced before.  Yes, you said. Fear. \"Sherlock Holmes got scared,\" you said.  No, no, no. It was more than that, John. It was doubt. I felt doubt.  Always been able to trust my senses,  the evidence of my own eyes, until last night.  You can't actually believe that you saw some kind of monster?  No, I can't believe that.  But I did see it. So the question is how? How?  Yes.  Yeah, right, good. So, you got something to go on, then?  Good luck with that.  Listen, what I said before, John, I meant it.  I don't have friends.  I've just got one.  Right.  John?  John!  - You are amazing! You are fantastic! - Yes, all right.  You don't have to overdo it.  You've never been the most luminous of people  but as a conductor of light, you are unbeatable.  - Cheers. - What?  Some people who aren't geniuses  have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others.  Hang on, you were saying sorry a minute ago, don't spoil it.  Go on. What have I done that's so bloody stimulating?  Yeah?  What if it's not a word? What if it is individual letters?  - You think it's an acronym? - Absolutely no idea.  What the hell are you doing here?  Oh, nice to see you, too. I'm on holiday, would you believe?  No. I wouldn't.  - Hello, John. - Greg.  I heard you were in the area. What are you up to?  You after this Hound of Hell, like on the telly?  I'm waiting for an explanation, Inspector. Why are you here?  I've told you, I'm on holiday.  You're brown as a nut. You're clearly just back from your holidays.  Maybe I fancied another one.  - Oh, this is Mycroft, isn't it? - Now, look  Of course it is. One mention of Baskerville  and he sends down my handler to spy on me, incognito.  Is that why you're calling yourself Greg?  - That's his name. - Is it?  Yes, if you'd ever bothered to find out.  Look, I'm not your handler.  And I don't just do what your brother tells me.  Actually, you could be just the man we want.  - Why? - I've not been idle, Sherlock.  I think I might have found something. Here.  Didn't know if it was relevant, it's starting to look like it might be.  That is an awful lot of meat for a vegetarian restaurant.  - Excellent. - A nice, scary inspector  from Scotland Yard who can put in a few calls  might come in very handy.  Shop!  - What's this? - Coffee. I made coffee.  - You never make coffee. - I just did. Don't you want it?  You don't have to keep apologising.  Thanks.  Mmm, I don't take sugar.  These records go back nearly two months.  That's nice. It's good.  Was that when you had the idea? After the TV show went out?  It's me. It was me.  I'm sorry, Gary, I couldn't help it.  I had a bacon sandwich at Cal's wedding and one thing just led to another.  Nice try.  Look, we were just trying to give things a bit of a boost, you know?  A great big dog run wild up on the moor, it was heaven sent.  It was like us having our own Loch Ness Monster.  - Where do you keep it? - There's an old mine shaft.  It's not too far. He was all right there.  Was?  We couldn't control the bloody thing!  It was vicious.  And then a month ago, Billy took him to the vet  - and, you know - It's dead?  - Put down. - Yeah.  No choice. So it's over.  - It was just a joke, you know? - Yeah. Hilarious.  You've nearly driven a man out of his mind.  You know he's actually pleased you're here? Secretly pleased.  Is he? That's nice.  I suppose he likes having all the same faces back together.  - Appeals to his his - Asperger's?  So, you believe them about having the dog destroyed?  - No reason not to. - Well, hopefully there's no harm done.  Not quite sure what I'd charge them with anyway.  I'll have a word with the local force.  Right, that's that, then. Catch you later. I'm enjoying this!  It's nice to get London out of your lungs.  So that was their dog that people saw out on the moor?  - Looks like it. - But that wasn't what you saw.  - That wasn't just an ordinary dog. - No.  It was immense, had burning red eyes and it was glowing, John,  its whole body was glowing.  I've got a theory, but I need to get back into Baskerville to test it.  How? You can't pull off the ID trick again.  Might not have to.  Hello, brother dear. How are you?  Afternoon, sir, if you could turn the engine off. Thank you.  I need to see Major Barrymore as soon as we get inside.  - Right. - Which means you'll have to start  - the search for the Hound. - Okay.  In the labs. Stapleton's first. Could be dangerous.  Oh, you know I'd love to. I'd love to give you unlimited access to this place.  - Why not? - It's a simple enough request, Major.  I've never heard of anything so bizarre.  You're to give me 24 hours. It's what I've negotiated.  Not a second more.  I may have to comply with this order but I don't have to like it.  I don't know what the hell you expect to find here, anyway.  - Perhaps the truth. - About what?  Oh, I see! The big coat should have told me.  You're one of the conspiracy lot, aren't you? Well, then, go ahead.  Seek them out. The monsters, the death rays, the aliens.  Have you got any of those? Oh, just wondering.  A couple. Crash-landed here in the '60s.  We call them Abbott and Costello.  Good luck, Mr Holmes.  Oh, God!  Oh!  Ow!  Come on.  What the  Hello?  No, come on. Come on.  No, you've  Don't be ridiculous. Pick up. Damn it!  Right.  Okay.  It's here. It's in here with me!  - Where are you? - Get me out, Sherlock.  You've got to get me out. The big lab. The first lab that we saw.  Oh!  - John? John? - Now, Sherlock. Please.  - All right. I'll find you. Keep talking. - I daren't, it'll hear me.  Keep talking. What are you seeing?  John? - Yes, I'm here.  What can you see?  I don't know. I don't know, but I can hear it, though.  Did you hear that?  Stay calm. Stay calm. Can you see it?  - Can you see it? - No. I  I can see it.  It's here.  It's here!  - Are you all right? John? - Jesus Christ! It was the Hound!  Sherlock. It was here. I swear it, Sherlock. It must  It must  Did you see it? You must have!  - It's all right. It's okay now. - No, it's not!  It's not okay! I saw it, I was wrong.  - Hmm. Let's not jump to conclusions. - What?  - What did you see? - I told you, I saw the Hound.  - Huge? Red eyes? - Yes!  - Glowing? - Yeah.  - No. - What?  I made up the bit about glowing.  You saw what you expected to see because I told you.  You have been drugged. We have all been drugged.  - Drugged? - Can you walk?  Of course I can walk.  Come on, then. It's time to lay this ghost.  Oh, back again?  - What's on your mind this time? - Murder, Dr Stapleton.  Refined, cold-blooded murder.  Will you tell little Kirsty what happened to Bluebell or shall I?  - Okay, what do you want? - Can I borrow your microscope?  Are you sure you're okay? You look very peaky.  No, I'm all right.  It was the GFP gene from a jellyfish, in case you're interested.  - What? - In the rabbits.  Hmm. Great news.  Aequorea victoria, if you really want to know.  - Why? - Why not?  We don't ask questions like that here. It isn't done.  It was a mix-up, anyway.  My daughter ended up with one of the lab specimens,  so poor Bluebell had to go.  - Your compassion's overwhelming. - I know. I hate myself sometimes.  So, come on, then, you can trust me, I'm a doctor, what else have you got  hidden away up here?  Listen, if you can imagine it, someone is probably doing it somewhere.  Of course they are.  - Cloning? - Yes, of course!  Dolly the sheep, remember?  - Human cloning? - Why not?  And what about animals? Not sheep.  - Big animals. - Size isn't a problem. Not at all.  The only limits are ethics and the law. And both those things can be  very flexible. But not here, not at Baskerville.  - It's not there! - Jesus!  Nothing there! It doesn't make any sense.  - What were you expecting to find? - A drug, of course! It has to be a drug.  A hallucinogenic or a deliriant of some kind.  There's no trace of anything in the sugar.  - Sugar? - The sugar, yes.  It's a simple process of elimination.  I saw the Hound, saw it as my imagination expected me to see it.  A genetically engineered monster.  But I knew I couldn't believe the evidence of my own eyes,  so there were seven possible reasons for it,  the most possible being narcotics.  Henry Knight, he saw it, too. But you didn't, John. You didn't see it.  Now, we have eaten and drunk exactly the same things since we got to Grimpen,  apart from one thing! You don't take sugar in your coffee.  I see. So  I took it from Henry's kitchen. His sugar.  - But it's perfectly all right. - But maybe it's not a drug.  No, it has to be a drug.  How did it get into our systems? How?  There must be something. Something  Something  Something buried deep. Get out.  - What? - Get out.  - I need to go to my mind palace. - Your what?  He's not going to be doing much talking for a while, we may as well go.  - His what? - Oh, his mind palace.  It's a memory technique. A sort of mental map.  You plot a map with a location. It doesn't have to be a real place.  And then you deposit memories there.  Theoretically, you can never forget anything.  All you have to do is find your way back to it.  So this imaginary location could be anything, a house or a street?  - Yeah. - But he said palace.  - He said it was a palace. - Yeah, well, he would, wouldn't he?  You ain't nothing   H. O. U.N.D.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I am so  I am so sorry. I am so sorry.  John? - Yeah, I'm on it.  Project H.O.U.N.D. I must have read about it.  Stored it away.  Experiment in the CIA facility in Liberty, Indiana.  H-O-U-N-D.  That's as far as my access goes, I'm afraid.  There must be an override. A password.  I imagine so, but that'd be Major Barrymore's.  Password. Password. Password.  He'd have sat here when he thought it up.  - Describe him to me. - You've seen him.  - But describe him. - He's a bloody martinet. A throwback.  The sort they'd have sent into Suez.  Good. Excellent. Old-fashioned. A traditionalist.  Not the sort of man that uses children's names as a password.  He loves his job. Proud of it. And this is work-related.  So, what's at eye level?  Books. Jane's Defence Weekly Bound copies. Hannibal,  Wellington. Rommel. Churchill's History of the English-Speaking People,  all four volumes.  Churchill. He's fond of Churchill.  Copy of The Downing Street Year.;  One, two, three, four, five separate biographies of Thatcher.  Mid-19805, at a guess. Father and son. Barrymore senior? Medals.  - Distinguished service order? - That date, I'd say Falklands veteran.  Right, so Thatcher's looking more likely a bet than Churchill.  So that's the password?  No! With a man like Major Barrymore, only first-name terms would do.  \"H.O.U.N.D.\"  Jesus!  Project H.O.U.N.D. A new deliriant drug  which rendered its users incredibly suggestible.  They wanted to use it as an anti-personnel weapon  to totally disorientate the enemy using fear and stimulus.  But they shut it down and hid it away in 1986.  Because of what it did to the subjects they tested it on?  And what they did to others. Prolonged exposure drove them insane.  Made them almost uncontrollably aggressive.  So, someone's been doing it again? Carrying on the experiments?  Attempting to refine it, perhaps. For the last 20 years.  - Who? - Those names mean anything to you?  No. Not a thing.  Five principal scientists,  20 years ago.  Maybe our friend's somewhere in the back of the picture.  Somebody who was old enough to be there at the time of the experiments in 1986.  Maybe somebody who says \"cell phone\" because of time spent in America.  - You remember, John? - Mmm-hmm.  Here's my cell number.  Gave us his number in case we needed him.  Oh, my God. Bob Frankland.  But Bob doesn't even work on it. I mean, he's a virologist.  - This was chemical warfare. - That's where he started, though.  And he's never lost the certainty, the obsession  that that drug really could work.  Nice of him to give us his number. Let's arrange a little meeting.  Hello?  - Who's this? - You've got to find Henry.  It's Louise Mortimer. Louise, what's wrong?  Henry was remembering, then  He tried He's got a gun, he went for the gun and tried to  What?  He's gone! You've got to stop him. I don't know what he might do.  - Where are you? - His house, I'm okay. I'm okay.  Right. Stay there, we'll get someone to you. Okay?  - Henry? - He's attacked her.  Gone? There's only one place he'll go to, back to where it all started.  Lestrade, get to the Hollow. Dewer's Hollow, now! And bring a gun.  I'm sorry.  So sorry, Dad.  - Oh, Henry, no! No! - Get back, Dad! Get away from me!  - Easy, Henry. Easy. just relax. - I know what I am.  - I know what I tried to do! - Just put the gun down. It's okay.  - No! No! I know what I am! - Yes. I'm sure you do, Henry.  It's all been explained to you, hasn't it?  - Explained very carefully. - What?  Someone needed to keep you quiet. Needed to keep you as a child,  to reassert the dream that you'd both clung on to  because you had started to remember.  Remember now, Henry. You've got to remember what happened here  when you were a little boy.  I thought it had got my dad. The Hound.  I thought Oh, Jesus! I don't know any more!  - I don't! - No, Henry! Henry!  Henry, remember, \"Liberty, In.\" Two words.  Two words a frightened little boy saw here 20 years ago.  You'd started to piece things together,  remember what really happened here that night.  It wasn't an animal, was it, Henry? Not a monster.  A man.  You couldn't cope. You were just a child.  So you rationalised it into something very different.  And then you started to remember, so you had to be stopped.  Driven out of your mind so that no one would believe a word that you said.  Sherlock!  Okay. It's okay, mate.  But we saw it! The Hound. Last night. We did!  There was a dog, Henry. Leaving footprints, scaring witnesses.  But it was nothing more than an ordinary dog.  We both saw it. Saw it as our drugged minds wanted us to see it.  Fear and stimulus. That's how it works.  But there never was any monster.  Sherlock?  - No! No, no, no, no, no! - Henry  Sherlock!  - No, no, no, no, no, no! - Henry?  Sherlock?  Are you seeing this? He is not drugged, Sherlock. So what's that?  - What is it? - All right! It's still there!  But it's just a dog, Henry. It's nothing more than an ordinary dog!  My God!  Oh, Christ!  No! No!  It's not you.  It's not you!  - The fog. - What?  It's the fog! The drug, it's in the fog!  Aerosol dispersant, that's what it said in those records.  Project H.O.U.N.D. It's the fog. A chemical minefield.  For God's sake, kill it! Kill it!  Look at it, Henry.  - No, no, no. - Come on, look at it!  It's just You bastard.  You bastard!  Twenty years! Twenty years of my life making no sense.  Why didn't you just kill me?  Because dead men get listened to. He needed to do more than kill you.  He had to discredit every word you ever said about your father.  And he had the means right at his feet.  A chemical minefield! Pressure pads in the ground,  dosing you up every time that you came back here.  Murder weapon, scene of the crime, all at once.  Oh, this case, Henry!  - Thank you, it's been brilliant. - Sherlock.  What?  Timing.  - Not good? - No, no, it's okay.  It's fine, because this means  This means that my dad was right.  He'd found something out, hadn't he?  And that's why you killed him, because he was right!  And he'd found you  right in the middle of an experiment.  Frankland!  - Frankland! - Keep running.  Keep back!  It's no use, Frankland!  Come on!  Hmm.  Thanks, Billy.  So they didn't have it put down, then? The dog.  Obviously. Suppose they just couldn't bring themselves to do it.  I see.  No, you don't.  - No, I don't. Sentiment? - Sentiment.  Mmm, listen, what happened to me in the lab?  - Do you want some sauce with that? - I hadn't been to the Hollows.  How come I heard those things in there? Fear and stimulus, you said.  You must've been dosed with it elsewhere.  When you went to the lab, maybe.  You saw those pipes. Pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve.  And they were carrying the gas, so  - Um, ketchup, was it, or brown? - Hang on.  You thought it was in the sugar. You were convinced it was in the sugar.  Better get going, actually.  There's a train that leaves in half an hour, so if you want  Oh, God. It was you.  You locked me in that bloody lab!  I had to. It was an experiment.  - An experiment? - Shh.  I was terrified, Sherlock. I was scared to death!  I thought the drug was in the sugar so I put the sugar in your coffee.  Then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore.  It was all totally scientific, laboratory conditions. Well, literally.  It's in here with me.  All right. Keep talking. I'll find you.  - Keep talking. - I daren't, it'll hear me.  Tell me what you're seeing.  I don't know, but I can hear it, though.  I knew what effect it had had on a superior mind,  so I needed to try it on an average one.  You know what I mean.  But it wasn't in the sugar.  No, well, I wasn't to know you'd already been exposed to the gas.  - So you got it wrong. - No.  You were wrong. It wasn't in the sugar. You got it wrong.  A bit.  Won't happen again.  Any long-term effects?  None at all. You'll be fine once you've excreted it. We all will.  Think I might have taken care of that already.  - Where are you going? - Won't be a minute.  Got to see a man about a dog.  All right. Let him go.",
