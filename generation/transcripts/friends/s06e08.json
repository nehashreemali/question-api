Is that your tiny little\nbox, that’s too small to put anything in?\nJoey: No.\nChandler: No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place.

I don’t think my boss likes me either.\nMonica: I don’t think mine likes me either.\nRoss: Maybe it’s a universal thing?\nJoey: Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a\nWednesday.

Well it\ndidn’t happen.\nKim: You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?\nRachel: Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made\nout with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.\nKim: That’s not true?\nRachel: No.\nKim: Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to\naccess the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.\nRachel: Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.\nKim: Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You\nare sadly mistaken.\nRachel: I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I\ndid not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I\ndon’t even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)\nKim: Hi Ralph.\nRalph Lauren:: Hi Kim. (Dead silence until Ralph gets off the elevator.)\nKim: Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.\n[Scene: Hillary’s apartmen,. Hillary and Ross are having dinner. He is avoiding\nopening his mouth.]\nHillary: And after that, what could I do except become a chef.\nRoss: Mmm-Hmm.\nHillary: And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.\nRoss: Mmm.\nHillary: You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with,\nthey just talk and talk.\nRoss: Mm-Hmm.\nHillary: After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?\nRoss: (Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm.\nHillary: I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you\na little bit?\nRoss: Mmm-Unmm.\nHillary: Come on. I want to know.\nRoss: Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I, uh, am from\nLong Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my\nspare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.\n[Scene: Joey and Janine’s apartment, Joey and Monica are arranging flowers.\nChandler walks in.]\nJoey: So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a\nfrying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.\nMonica: Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.\nChandler: Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with\nthe flowers.\nMonica: Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to\nmake a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.\nJoey: Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)\nChandler: What is the matter with you ?!?\nJoey: What?\nChandler: You’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You\ngot dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is\nnot Joey!!\nJoey: Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know,\nthey’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a\nfamous baby.\nChandler: You’re turning into a women.\nJoey: No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.\nChandler: Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?\nJoey: It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God,\nI’m a women!!!\n[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there.]\nRachel: Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.\nPhoebe: But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.\nRachel: I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse\nKenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.\nPhoebe: Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You\nknow. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she\never think of that?\nRachel: You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?\nPhoebe: Just for a second.\nRachel: Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?\nPhoebe: Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.\nRachel: I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I\nwouldn’t.\nPhoebe: Ohh, sleep with Kenny.\nRachel: That wouldn’t help me.\nPhoebe: Ohh, yes it would.\n[Scene: Hillary’s apartment, Hillary and Ross are finishing up their date.]\nHillary: I’ve had a really good time tonight.\nRoss: Mmm.\nHillary: You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.\nRoss: (Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.)\nMe, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know. (Putting the bread down.)\nHillary: Are you going to eat that bread?\nRoss: (Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffing\nit.) Mmmm.\nHillary: (Laughing) You make me laugh.\nRoss: Hmm-Hmm.\nHillary: Would you like to move over to the couch?\nRoss: Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)\nHillary: Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little.\nRoss: (Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way.\nHillary: Okay. (She goes to turn the lights off and Ross sits on the couch. She has\nsome black light posters on the wall.)\nRoss: (Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster?\n(They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So,\nahh, where were we?\nHillary: Are those your teeth??\nRoss: Ohh, you can see them, huh?\nHillary: Yes. They’re insanely white.\nRoss: I-I, did that for you.\nHillary: What’s a matter with you?\nRoss: What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!\n[Scene: Elevator at the Ralph Lauren Offices, Rachel gets in . Kim is there.]\nRachel: Kim, hi.\nKim: Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph\nLauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.\nRachel: Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were\nright. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.\nKim: Oh, really?\nRachel: (Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, \"Rachel, I can’t do\nthis. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this.\nI’m married and I’m sorry.\" And then I don’t know why but he said,\n\"and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in\nthe Ralph Lauren machine.\"\nKim: You expect me to believe..(Doors open, Ralph steps in.) Hi Ralph.\nRalph Lauren:: Hi Kim. (Dead silence again until he gets off.)\nKim: Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s like\nhe hates you. Then it is true.\nRachel: Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.\nKim: Ohh honey come here. (Hugging Rachel.) Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all been\nthere.\nRachel: You and Ralph?\nKim: Kenny the copyboy.\nEnding Credits\n[Scene: Joey and Janine’s apartment, Joey paces the floor waiting for Janine. She\nwalks in.]\nJanine: Hey.\nJoey: Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.\nJanine: What’s the matter? Are you upset?\nJoey: I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in\nhere. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?\nThat’s just the way it has to be.\nJanine: Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room.\nJoey: Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I\ndidn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all the\ngirlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if\nyou want to.\nJanine: Okay.\nJoey: And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.\nJanine: Sure.\nJoey: And a couple of these little tiny boxes.\nJanine: Joey?
