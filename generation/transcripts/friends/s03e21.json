(Joey starts to call a place to buy a little\nbaby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.\nJoey: (on phone) Yeah, hi.

(She removes her fake breasts) But\nPete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.\nRachel: And you’re still not attracted to him at all?\nMonica: Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I\ncan’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.\nRachel: Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different.
