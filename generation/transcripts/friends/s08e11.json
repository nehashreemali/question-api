  "transcript": "The One With Ross’ Big Step Forward\nWritten by: Robert Carlock\nTranscribed by: Eric Aasen\n[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is looking around the shop as Phoebe returns from getting\nsome more coffee.]\nRachel: Phoebe?\nPhoebe: Yeah?\nRachel: Look at that guy by the window, wow!\nPhoebe: He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to\nbe completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.\nRachel: Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I\nsee—I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean\nnormally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the\nway I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.\nPhoebe: Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?\nRachel: Yeah.\nPhoebe: This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start\ngoing crazy.\nRachel: Really?! So this has happened to you?\nPhoebe: Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so\nin, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.\nRachel: Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store\nsitting on Santa’s lap.\nPhoebe: Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander\nHolyfield from a Foot Locker.\nRachel: Ah.\nPhoebe: Yeah.\nRachel: Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I’ll ask her\nabout this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.\nPhoebe: Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are there as Mona enters.]\nMona: Hey! (To Joey) Hey!\nRoss: Hi!\nMona: Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.\nRoss: Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona\nice skating?\nJoey: Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.\n(Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesn’t move from his\nchair.)\nRoss: Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us\ntogether?\nMona: Oh yeah, probably at the end. (Flips to the end.) Oh my God! He only took\npictures of my breasts!\nJoey: I’m missin’ picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at\nhim and he retreats.)\nPhoebe: (sitting down next to Ross) Y’know she has a face Ross!\nMona: Okay. Okay, here’s a good one of us.\nRoss: Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card\ny’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.\nMona: Y’know, every year I say I’m gonna send out holiday cards and I\nnever do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?\nRoss: (pause) Together? Like-like to people?\nMona: Yeah, y’know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It’ll be cute,\nokay?\nRoss: Okay. (Not happy about it.)\nMona: Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?\nRoss: Uh sure, sure.\nMona: Bye guys.\nPhoebe: Bye.\n(Mona exits.)\nJoey: (To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!\nRoss: I know. Can you believe that?\nPhoebe: Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday\ncard?\nRoss: Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have\nbeen dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!\n[Scene: Chandler’s Office, his boss Doug is entering, Monica is there as well.]\nDoug: Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!\nChandler: Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?\nMonica: Yes, hi.\nDoug: Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.\nChandler: I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m\nsorry.\nDoug: Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations\nto you guys though!\nMonica: No leg-chewing for us sir.\nDoug: Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lot\nto celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?\nMonica: I can’t think of anything we’re doing. (Quietly) Why\ncan’t I think of anything we’re doing?\nDoug: Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep\nthrowing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!\nMonica: Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know,\nwe’re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another\nevening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?\nChandler: No.\nMonica: That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved\nat our engagement party.\nChandler: Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture\ndoesn’t it?\n[Scene: Ross's Apartment, there’s a knock on the door and he opens it to Mona.]\nMona: Hi!\nRoss: Hey!\nMona: Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card.\nWhat do you think?\nRoss: Huh. Wow, this is great.\nMona: Now, do you think it should say, \"Love Ross and Mona?\"\nRoss: Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay\nto say it to other people.\nMona: How many did you want? I’m getting a hundred.\nRoss: A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m\nnot sure about the whole uh, card thing.\nMona: Really? Why not?\nRoss: Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if\nwe’re really quite there yet.\nMona: Oh y’know, I didn’t think of it that way. You’re right.\nYou’re right. So, can I ask you a question?\nRoss: Yeah.\nMona: Where are we?\nRoss: Huh.\nMona: Y’know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?\nRoss: Hmm…\nMona: I mean I love spending time with you, y’know I just—I hope\nwe’re moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don’t you\nthink?\n(Pause.)\nRoss: Let’s do the card!\nMona: What?\nRoss: The card! I think we’re there!\nMona: Okay. I—But I think we should still have this conversation.\nRoss: Really?! I mean, even with the card?\n[Scene: Rachel’s Doctor’s Office, she is waiting for her doctor as a nurse\nenters.]\nNurse: Hi!\nRachel: Hi!\nNurse: Just so you know, Dr. Long can’t be here today, she was called to\nthe hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.\nRachel: Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy\nwho took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, bald\nhaircut, hairy fingers… (Stops when she realizes it was her.)\nDr. Schiff: (entering) Hi Rachel? I’m Dr. Schiff. (By the way, he’s an\nattractive man.)\nRachel: Yes, you are.\nDr. Schiff: So, how’s it going?\nRachel: Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are\nyou from? What do you do?\nDr. Schiff: I’m a doctor.\nRachel: Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you\nski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?\nDr. Schiff: Uh, I don’t have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.\nRachel: Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!\nDr. Schiff: So, are you experiencing any discomfort?\nRachel: No. I’m very comfortable.\nDr. Schiff: Any painful gas?\nRachel: No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!\nDr. Schiff: Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?\nRachel: Well would you like me to lie down on the table?\nDr. Schiff: I’m sorry, is there something going on here?\nRachel: Do you feel it too?\n[Scene: Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe are there as Rachel enters.]\nRachel: Hi.\nPhoebe: Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?\nRachel: Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the\nmiddle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.\nPhoebe: Oh my God.\nMonica: Why did you do that?\nPhoebe: Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my\nfourth month of\npregnancy?\nMonica: Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you\npractically came on to me.\nPhoebe: You wish.\nMonica: Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you.\nPhoebe: Oh yeah? Come and get it.\nRachel: Okay, even this is turning me on!\nRoss: (entering) Hey!\nRachel: Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and\nMona? Are you guys still together?\nRoss: Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!\nMonica: You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?\nRoss: Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to\nhave the conversation about where the relationship is going.\nPhoebe: Ugh! Women!\nRoss: I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I\nmean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, \"So, where is this going?\"\nRachel: Uh Ross? You asked me that.\nRoss: Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I\nhate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a\ngesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk\nabout it.\nMonica: Like asking her to move in with you?\nRoss: Smaller than that.\nMonica: Making her a mixed tape?\nRoss: Uh, bigger than that.\nPhoebe: Give her a key to your apartment.\nRoss: Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.\nMonica: All right. Have you said, \"I love you?\" You could say, I love\nyou.\nRoss: Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I\ncould say I looove spending time with you.\nPhoebe: No, we hate that.\nMonica: That is a slap in the face.\nRoss: Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the\nconversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.\nWhat do you think Rach?\nRachel: I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples\nthrough that sweater.\n[Scene: Chandler’s Office, Doug is entering.]\nDoug: Bing! We’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock.\nChandler: Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.\nDoug: Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother\nwork. Fine. Tomorrow night then.\nChandler: Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.\nDoug: Oh? Why not?\nChandler: It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.\nDoug: What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or\nsomething?\nChandler: Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.\nDoug: So why can’t the three of us go out together?\nChandler: Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold\nme.\nDoug: Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised,\nI saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at\nme, pure lust.\nChandler: Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is\nchoking something. Can I choke ya?\nDoug: Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this. Now here’s the plan,\ngrab your coat, we’re going to a strip club.\nChandler: Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with\nthat bitch.\n[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is getting Mona some coffee.]\nRoss: Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation\nabout-about where things are with us.\nMona: Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.\nRoss: Aw, we-we are so…(Motions that they’re connected.) So umm, well\nI-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m\nhaving a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there\nisn’t.)\nMona: Okay.\nRoss: I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if\nit’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So\nwhere-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and\nthe answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re\nthinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re\nnot getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are\ngetting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the\nsecond—What’s your secret?\nMona: I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?\nRoss: Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.\nMona: Okay…\nRoss: But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my\napartment. (Hands her his key.)\nMona: Really?!\nRoss: Really.\nMona: You don’t think this is too fast.\n(Ross groans no.)\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Ross is telling Rachel and Monica about yet another mistake\nhe’s made with a woman.]\nRachel: You gave her a key to your apartment?!\nRoss: Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a\nvery serious relationship.\nPhoebe: (entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?\nRoss: Oh great, I live on the street.\nPhoebe: Where?! (Ross exits.)\nRachel: Hey!\nPhoebe: Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.\nRoger: Hey everybody.\nMonica: Hi Roger.\nPhoebe: So umm, I’m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me\nout?\nRachel: Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)\nPhoebe: Umm, he’s here to have sex with you.\nRachel: What?\nPhoebe: You’re welcome.\nRachel: Phoebe no!\nPhoebe: It’s okay, he’s a virgin.\nMonica: Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have\nsex with you.\nPhoebe: Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.\nRachel: No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do\nit with some random guy!\nPhoebe: Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!\n(Phoebe exits.)\n[Scene: A Strip Club, Doug and Chandler are there.]\nDoug: Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap\ndance with those girls. Huh?\nChandler: Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.\nDoug: Bing—What’s this?! (Grabs his hand.)\nChandler: It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke\nholder.\nDoug: No, it’s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We’re gonna go\nto the East River right now and throw it in there!\nChandler: Oh no-no-no!\nDoug: Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y’know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better\nand if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.\n[Scene: Ross's Apartment, a locksmith has finished changing the locks on Ross’s\ndoor.]\nRoss: Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give\nthem away for no reason at all.\nMona: (entering) Hey Ross, what’s going on? You changing the lock?\nRoss: No. That guy is.\nMona: I don’t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then\nyou change the lock.\nLocksmith: Good luck buddy. (Exits.)\nMona: Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you’re-you’re\nsending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?\nRoss: I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.\nMona: What?\nRoss: I love you!\nMona: Ohh! (Hugs him.) And I love spending time with you. (Ross isn’t\nhappy.)\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is eating dinner as Chandler enters.]\nChandler: Hi honey I’m home.\nMonica: From the tequila factory?\nChandler: It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that\nyou and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then\nwhen I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!\nMonica: Come here. I can breath through my mouth.\nChandler: Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would\nbe like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please\npromise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each\nother for the rest of our lives.\nMonica: I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday\ncard this year?\nChandler: Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is on the phone.]\nRachel: Yes. Hi, I’d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question?\nIs-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey\nenters.) I’ll call you back.\nJoey: Who was that?\nRachel: It’s just the pizza place.\nJoey: You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.\nRachel: I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day.\nJoey: Oh, what’s wrong?\nRachel: Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.\nJoey: Then why did I ask?\nRachel: Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but\nlately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this\numm, erotically charged.\nJoey: Is that college talk for horny?\nRachel: Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know\nwhat to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine\nbecause I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.\nJust sex, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel\ncomfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is\nthat really so…hard…to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?\nJoey: Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.\nRachel: Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.\nJoey: Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.\nRachel: Okay, good night!\nJoey: Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)\n(Pause.)\nJoey: (entering) I can’t do it!\nRachel: (entering) I didn’t ask you to do it!\nJoey: You’re Rachel!\nRachel: You’re Joey!\nJoey: You’re my friend!\nRachel: Right back at ya!\nJoey: But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.\nRachel: And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about\nbecause I didn’t ask you to do anything!\nJoey: I know!\n(Pause.)\nJoey: Do you wanna do it?\nRachel: No!\nJoey: All right, me neither! I was just testing you!\nRachel: That’s the end of this conversation!\nJoey: This conversation never happened!\nRachel: Never happened! Good night!\nJoey: Good night!\n(They both go into their rooms and after a little while Rachel pokes her head into the\nliving room.)\nJoey: Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Phoebe enters.]\nPhoebe: Hi. Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really\nwasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something\nthat I think you’ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the\nEvander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I’m gonna, I’m gonna\nwant him back. So… (Looks at him longingly) I’m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause)\n(Entering) I’m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can’t! (She grabs the cutout\nand exits for good.)\nEnd",
