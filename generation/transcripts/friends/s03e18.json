It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake\nlaugh.\nMonica: Oh. (she laughs)\nJoey: What-what’s so funny?\n(Chandler enters with a cigarette.)\nGunther: (to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there’s none of that in here.\nChandler: Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.\nGunther: Okay, but only if you give me a drag.\nChandler: Okay.\n(Chandler hands him the cigarette, and he takes a long drag.)\nGunther: Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler\nback the cigarette.)\nChandler: No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.\n(He goes and sits down next to Rachel and puts a cigarette in his mouth, which Rachel\ntakes away from him. He puts another cigarette in his mouth, and Rachel takes it away\nagain.)\nChandler: Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.\nRachel: Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that\nis going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)\nChandler: Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking\npatch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake\nlaughs.)\nRachel: Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two\nweeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.\nRoss: Pffhah.\nRachel: (to Ross) What’s your problem?\nRoss: Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.\nRachel: Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.\nRoss: Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.\nRachel: Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of\nthree and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.\nPhoebe: All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have\nto dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.\nChandler: Or what my Father called Thursday night.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier, Ross is handing Rachel a cup of coffee.]\nRoss: Here you go.\nRachel: Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this.\nRoss: Sorry.

Right?\nAlice: Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there’s an age difference\nbetween us.\nPhoebe: Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.\nAlice: Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?\n(They both growl and hiss at each other and then kiss passionately again.)\n[Scene: Chandler’s bedroom, Chandler is listening to the hypnosis tape.]\nHypnosis Tape: You are falling fast asleep.

And the two times\nwe went out were just plain awkward. (to Rachel) Come on, you think she should go out with\nme, don’t you?\nRachel: (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?

(exits)\nJoey: So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,\n“Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember?

His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him.\nChandler: (reading the check) Pete Becker.

Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and\nsalt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to…\nPhoebe: Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.\nAlice: Oh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cut\naround the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.\nPhoebe: Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.\n[Scene: Pete’s office, he is participating in a conference call with three other\nemployees, each of whom are on a different TV screen that he controls with a remote.]\nPete: Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller?

She turns on the lights, and sits down on\nthe couch.]\nFrank: (hiding under a pile of clothes) Hi. (She jumps up screaming.) Wait, no!\nJust put the mail down. It’s-it’s me!\nPhoebe: Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?\nFrank: Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought\nI’d curl up in it. Is that all right?\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?\nFrank: Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive.\nPhoebe: What umm, what happened?\nFrank: Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.\nPhoebe: Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?\nFrank: Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t\nsee how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when\nwe first got together.\nPhoebe: Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe\nit’s just all for the best?\nFrank: Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!\nPhoebe: Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)\nFrank: Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life!\nAfter my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and\nthen, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take\ndeep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now\nit’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why!\nPhoebe: Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But,\ny'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?\nFrank: What?\nPhoebe: Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made\nher see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to,\none day, you really, really will.\nFrank: Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?\nPhoebe: Okay.\nFrank: Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the\nworst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.\nPhoebe: Okay, but.\nFrank: Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you’d\nunderstand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or\na place to go…\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Monica ready for her date. The guys are\nalso there. The door buzzes.]\nRachel: Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!\nChandler: (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)\nMonica: Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?\nChandler: Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him\nanything.\nMonica: I know!!\nChandler: Okay, then get the lobster!\nMonica: (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!\nPete: Hi.\nRachel: Hi!!\nJoey: Hey!\nRoss: Hi!\n(They’re all staring at him, with big, huge smiles on their faces.)\nJoey: Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?\nMonica: And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. (starts\nto leave) Bye.\nAll: Oh-no-no-no-no….\nRachel: Just one drink?!\nMonica: (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?\nPete: Hey, you like pizza?\nMonica: Oh, that’s sounds great.\nPete: I know a great little place.\n[Cut to a shot of the coliseum in Rome, Italy.]\n[Scene: A restaurant in Rome, Monica is paying for the pizza.]\nPete: You’re, hey, you’re not paying for the pizza!\nMonica: Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is\nthat enough lire?\nPete: Ahh, I’d throw another thousand on that.\nMonica: Why, how much is that?\nPete: That’s about 60 cents.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, it’s the middle of the night. Joey is walking into\nthe living room, and runs into the entertainment centre.]\nJoey: Every night!!\n(He starts to walk to the bathroom and hears the hypnosis tape from Chandler’s\nbedroom.)\nHypnosis Tape: You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You\nare a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who\ndoes not need to smoke. (Joey walks out smiling to himself.)\n[Scene: Phoebe’s, Frank is watching TV, and he’s very depressed as Phoebe\nenters.]\nPhoebe: Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally\nevil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better\nthan I can.\nAlice: Hi Frank.\nFrank: Hi, Mrs. Knight.\nAlice: Phoebe’s right Frank. I know it’s hard to hear, but it\nwould’ve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we,\nwe want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is that\nwhat it is?\nPhoebe: Yeah, but not just that.\nAlice: Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we\ndo, none the less…\nPhoebe: None the less.\nAlice: None the less. Umm, you’re too young to, to really know what you\nwant. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)\nPhoebe: That’s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it’s a good bye\nkiss, that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They\nboth lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that\nyou see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore\nher) Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my\npurse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Chandler’s bedroom, he’s listening to the hypnosis tape again.]\nHypnosis Tape: Cigarette’s don’t control you. You are a strong,\nconfident woman, who does not need to smoke.\nJoey: (He’s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey’s your best friEnd.\nYou want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him\nhundreds of dollars worth of pants.\n(Chandler wakes up and stares at the tape.)\nEnd",
