Joey\nwalks from his room. He looks like he just woke up.]\nJoey: What are you doing?\nRoss: I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy.\n(There’s nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. (There’s\none lone tomato.) And top shelf: expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)\nJoey: Why are you doing this?\nRoss: Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the\nbank, post office, and the dry cleaners.\nJoey: Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to\nspread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?\nRoss: Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!\nJoey: Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a little\nconfused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why\ndo you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here…sit down. (Ross sits\ndown.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh,\nyeah!! Huh?!\nRoss: So what, we just sit?\nJoey: Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit. (Joey sits down and\nhits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)\nChandler: (Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.\nJoey: (In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.\nChandler: (Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and\nJoey laugh silently.) It’s been six months! It’s not funny!\nJoey: But, I love you.\nChandler: Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!\n(Joey hangs up.)\nJoey: And that’s Wednesday. (He reclines in his chair.) Ohh.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, Joey, Monica, and Rachel are there. Phoebe walks\nin ringing a bell.]\nPhoebe: Hey you guys, guess what?\nChandler: The British are coming?\nPhoebe: Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.)\nSince it’s Christmastime. I’m going to be one of those people collection\ndonations.\nAll: Ohh.\nPhoebe: (Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my\nbucket.\nChandler: Ohh.\nPhoebe: Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the\npeople. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year,\nI’m going to do the whole city.\nMonica: You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very\npopular. (Chandler laughs.)\nJoey: So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?\nPhoebe: Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they\nhardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I’m the only one who can sing\n\"Merry Christmas\" in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.\nRachel: Oh my god. Ok you guys, there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this.\n(He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he’s not interested.\nOhh, he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten\nwho he is.\nDanny: Hey guys.\nAll: Hey Danny.\nMonica: Danny? You know Rachel? She’s nice. She’s not bad to look\nat, right?\nRachel: Thanks, Mon.\nDanny: Well, of course.\nMonica: Do you want to go out on a date with her?\nRachel: Monica!!!\nDanny: (Looking at Monica) Absolutely! Is Friday okay?\nMonica: Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait.\nDanny: (To Monica) On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? (To\nRachel) See ya Friday. (He walks out.)\nRachel: (Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what?\nDon’t answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.\n[Scene: Estelle's (Joey's Agent) Office, Joey is there.]\nJoey: How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian\nactor from Queens.\nEstelle: Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.\nJoey: She’s a woman!\nEstelle: What can I say? She nailed it.\nJoey: (Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?\nEstelle: Well, you’re just going to say no again but...gay porn.\n[Scene: In front of Macys, Phoebe is collecting donations and ringing her bell.]\nPhoebe: Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man put\nsome change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.

Phoebe!\nPhoebe: Hey!\nMonica: I just wanted to see how it's going.\nPhoebe: Well, it's going okay.\nMonica: (Taking out her wallet.) Well good, here let me help you out.\nPhoebe: Oh, thanks!\nMonica: Yeah!\nPhoebe: Wow!\n(Monica puts some change in Phoebe's bucket.)\nPhoebe: Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.\nMonica: Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)\nPhoebe: Just get your nails done?\nMonica: Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her\nchange purse into the bucket.)\nPhoebe: Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and\nspreads her joy.)\n(A man walks up and puts a dollar bill in.)\nPhoebe: Thank you! And Happy Holidays.\n(The man starts to take some change out.)\nPhoebe: Wait, you can't take the money out.\nThe Man: I'm making change. I need change for the bus.\nPhoebe: But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.\nThe Man: I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!\nPhoebe: Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…\nThe Man: Bite me, blondie! (The man storms off.)\nPhoebe: Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just… (She\nscowls at him.)\n[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is telling Ross how he didn't get the part.]\nJoey: That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!\nRoss: I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something\nhappen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what\nabout those Good Will Hunting guys?\nJoey: Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the\nchances I could get those guys to star in it?\n(Ross just stares at him until he figures it out.)\nJoey: Wait a second, I could star in it!\nRoss: Or that.\nJoey: I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline\nthat takes, y'know? I can't do it.\nRoss: I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to\nit. And plus, it'll give me something to do.\nJoey: Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!\nRoss: Yeah!\nJoey: Thanks!\nRoss: (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The\nonly thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.\nJoey: Done!\nRoss: And it can't be Joey.\nJoey: It's not.\nRoss: Or Joseph.\nJoey: (disappointed) Oh.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is returning. Monica enters from her room wearing\nnothing but a robe.]\nMonica: Hey, what's up?\nRachel: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm\naround her.\nMonica: Oh, honey, I'm sorry.\nRachel: Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our\nrelationship!!\nMonica: You had no relationship!!\nRachel: No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the\nplan!\nMonica: Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl?\nWho cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with\nDanny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway\ngirl.\nRachel: She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the\ndate. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.\n(Rachel goes into her room and closes the door. Which allows Monica to let Chandler out\nof her room.)\nMonica: Come on, hurry!\n(Chandler runs out the door and closes it behind him. After a short pause the door\nopens and Chandler comes rushing back through, grabs Monica, kisses her good-bye, and\nheads back out.)\n[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is trying to write his movie, Chandler is\nplaying a game on the counter by trying to flip a ping pong ball with a spoon into a\nnearby bowl.]\nJoey: Hey, how do you spell suspicious?\nChandler: Why?\nJoey: Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.\n(Chandler makes it into the bowl.)\nChandler: Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.\nJoey: You're driving me crazy with that!\nChandler: Okay, I'll stop.\nJoey: Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!\n(Chandler slides the bowl to the far end of the counter. He tries again, but he hits\nthe spoon to hard and the ball goes flying away.)\nJoey: Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.\nChandler: You wanna play?\nJoey: Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have\nto write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.\nChandler: Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets\nhome.\nJoey: (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a\nnotch?\nChandler: I'm intrigued.\nJoey: All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.\nChandler: Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit\nback.\nJoey: Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.\nChandler: Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?\nJoey: Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the\ndoor.)\n[Scene: In front of Macys, Phoebe is still ringing her bell. A guy puts some\nchange into the bucket.]\nPhoebe: Thank you, Happy Holidays.\n(Another woman walks up and throws something into the bucket.)\nPhoebe: Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't… (The lady ignores her and\nwalks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!\n(Another guy walks by and throws his light cigarette butt in the bucket.)\nPhoebe: Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet\nanother guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that.\n(She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is\nthat?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!\n[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is reading what Joey wrote.]\nRoss: All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops\nreading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey,\nyou're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident!\n(Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The\nofficial rulebook of Fireball.\nJoey: Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.\nChandler: (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven\nmitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter\nfluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)\nRoss: This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not\nthe creator of crazy lawsuit game!\nJoey: You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.\nRoss: (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to\nwork. (To Joey) Now come on!\nJoey: Hey!\n(He tries to fire a burnt tennis ball into the bowl Chandler is standing by, but Ross\ngrabs the ball away from him.)\nRoss: No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!\n(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the\nburn spots on his oven mitts.)\n[Scene: Outside Danny's apartment, Danny and Rachel are returning from their date.]\nDanny: I had a really nice time tonight.\nRachel: So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.\n(He kisses her.)\nDanny: I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's\nasleep on the couch.\nRachel: You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods,\n\"Yes.\") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on\nthe couch!\nDanny's Sister: (opening the door) Oh, I thought I heard you.\nDanny: Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this\nis Rachel.\nRachel: Hi!\nKrista: Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix\nmyself up!\nDanny: Like it would help.\nKrista: You are so bad! (Hits him softly.)\nDanny: You are! (Hits her back.)\nKrista: You are! (Hits him softly.)\nDanny: You are! (Hits her back.)\nKrista: You are! (Hits him softly.)\nDanny: You are! (Hits her back.)\nKrista: You are! (Hits him harder this time.)\nDanny: You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.\n(He starts chasing her around Rachel a couple of times before she runs into the living\nroom and he tackles her on the couch where he starts tickling her.)\nRachel: (not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue\nto ignore her.)\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is complaining to Ross and Monica about the\nbucket.]\nPhoebe: Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put\nin here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?\nMonica: No.\nPhoebe: Does it look like an ashtray?\nMonica: No.\nPhoebe: Does it look like a urinal?\nMonica: Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)\nRoss: So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?\nPhoebe: Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice\nBucket!\nMonica: Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.\nPhoebe: Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know\nwhat? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you\nguys. Sorry. (Leaves.)\nRachel: (entering from her room) Hey!\nMonica: Hey!\nRachel: Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?\nMonica and Ross: Sure.\nRachel: Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys\nwrestle?\nRoss: Oh-oh, yeah.\nMonica: All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.\nRoss: Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.\nMonica: Still, I was quick as a cat.\nRachel: Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl\non the subway.\nMonica: Oh, you're kidding.\nRachel: Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?\nMonica: (laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.\nRoss: Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.\nMonica: Too strong for me?\nRoss: Yeah.\nMonica: You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna\ngo?\nRoss: Oh fine.\nMonica: Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start\nwrestling.)\nRachel: Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.\n(She leaves them to wrestle.)\n[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is cleaning the foosball table, Joey is\nworking on his script.]\nChandler: (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in\n20 minutes! Come on, Joe!\nRoss: Joey's not going.\nJoey: (To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.\nChandler: Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?\nRoss: Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.\nJoey: Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.\nChandler: (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he\nrelaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.\nRoss: I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.\nJoey: Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never\nplayed.\nChandler: The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.\nOkay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.\nRoss: I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!\nJoey: Come on look guys, don't fight.\nRoss: And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if\nyou were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.\nChandler: Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?\nRoss: If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.\nJoey: Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of\nFireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!\nRoss: How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now,\nno one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!\nChandler: I paid for those tickets!\nRoss: No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!\nChandler: Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)\n[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Joey, and Chandler are listening to a story being\ntold by Danny and his sister.]\nDanny: …so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here (His\nsister) forgets the camera!\nJoey: Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.\nChandler: When did that happen to you?!\nJoey: Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really\npretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!\nChandler: Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.\nKrista: Oh, this is so good (A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (She\ntakes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does it\nagain. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of it\nand some filling falls into his lap.)\nDanny: Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.\nKrista: Here, I'll get it. (She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. The\nthing that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to his\ncrotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)\nKrista: We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.\nDanny: Yep. (To Rachel) I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.\nRachel: Oh, great!\nChandler: Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!\nMonica: That was unbelievable!\nRachel: Okay, see? I told you!\nJoey: Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.\nChandler: I don't believe they're brother and sister.\nJoey: They're brother and sister!!!\n[Scene: In front of Macys, Phoebe has adorned her bucket with numerous signs.\nLike \"We are not a urinal!\" and \"I have no Macys info.\"\nAnd other stuff like that. She also has a scowl on her face as she is ringing her bell. A\nlittle old lady walks up to make a donation but Phoebe stops her.]\nPhoebe: Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.\n(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the\nlint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)\n(Another man walks up with a drink in his hand, Phoebe stops him too.)\nPhoebe: Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and\nthen you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his\nface.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker\nwalk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought\nI told you to get outta here!\nBob: Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a\nless high-profile spot.\nPhoebe: What?!\nBob: Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.\nPhoebe: That chick can't handle my corner.\nBob: Look, either you leave, or we remove you.\nPhoebe: Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.)\n(The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for\nthat bitch. (The old lady.)\n[Scene: Danny's apartment, there's a knock on the door and he answers it.]\nDanny: Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?\nRachel: Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.\nDanny: What?! Why?!\nRachel: Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond,\nand…\nDanny: Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a\nproblem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?\nRachel: Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on\nhere but let's…\nDanny: Do-do you, do you have brothers?\nRachel: No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.\nDanny: Are you close with them?\nRachel: No-no, they're not very nice people.\nDanny: Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So\nwhat if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?\nRachel: Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it\ndoes sort of…\nKrista: (calling from the bathroom) Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!\nDanny: (seeing Rachel's shocked look) What?\nRachel: Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)\n[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is there as Chandler enters.]\nChandler: Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down\nthere and give them a project, ruin their day?\nRoss: Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach\nthem a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.\nJoey: (entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already\nfinished my five pages for today!\nRoss: Yay!\nChandler: Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!\nJoey: No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!\nRoss: I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to\nfocus. Huh?\nChandler: Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL\nTHE LIVE LONG DAY!!\nJoey: Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it.\nAnd uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So\nwould you guys read it for me?\nChandler: All right. (Takes a copy.)\nRoss: All right. (Takes another copy.)\nJoey: Okay. (Reading.) \"It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys\nare hanging out.\" Ross (Points to him.)\n(Ross and Chandler start to read Joey's script aloud.)\nRoss: Hey man.\nChandler: What is up?\nRoss: About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.\nChandler: No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.\nRoss: Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest…\n(Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.\nChandler: Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)\nRoss: I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right\nJoey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.\nChandler: (To Ross) I'm sorry too.\nJoey: Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.\nRoss: (reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.\nChandler: I am sorry, Ross.\nJoey: A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's\nit going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to\nboth of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well\nyou co-created Fireball. The end.\nChandler: This took you all day?!\nJoey: No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up\nwith new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!\nEnding Credits\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are about to read another one of Joey's\nefforts.]\nJoey: (Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment.\nTwo girls are just hanging out.\n(Monica and Rachel begin to read from the script.)\nMonica: Hi, how are you doing Kelly?\nRachel: I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!\nMonica: It's my new perfume.
