Joey and Phoebe are getting\ncoffee.]\nMonica: What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.\nChandler: You mean the spitter?\nMonica: Come on! It wasn’t that bad!\nChandler: Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.\nMonica: All right, what about the third guy?\nChandler: You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?\nMonica: Can you blame him?\nChandler: Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say, \"I\ndo,\" he’s thinking, \"Yeah, I’d do her too!\"\nMonica: Well then we still have a problem.\nChandler: Yeah!\nPhoebe: (returning with Joey) With what?\nMonica: Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and\nthey’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the\nladies.

It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on\nthe Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!\nMonica: Are you serious?\nPhoebe: Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!\nJoey: I call it!!\nPhoebe: What?! No! It was my idea!\nChandler: Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.\nJoey: Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!\nChandler: We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say\nlegitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Ben are sitting on the couch bored out of their\nminds.]\nRachel: Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang\nout all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend.\nBen: But you’re not anymore!\nRachel: No, I’m not.\nBen: ‘Cause you guys were on a break.\nRachel: Hey!

One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire\nstory over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?\nBen: When’s my daddy coming back?\nRachel: (checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and\nsisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff.\nBen: Sharing is good.\nRachel: Oh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two\nsisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.\nBen: Really? Like how?\nRachel: Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh,\nwe’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so\nthey’d put salt on their cereal.\nBen: (laughs) That’s a good one.\nRachel: Yeah? You like that one?\nBen: Yeah, you’re funny.\nRachel: I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these!\nUmm, oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a\nquarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say\nto person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without\nit leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil\nline right down the center of their face.\nBen: Can I do it to you?\nRachel: Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay?\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are eating lunch as Joey enters.]\nJoey: So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?\nChandler: No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were\nstill together.\nMonica: We’re never gonna find anybody.\nJoey: Well then let me do it!\nChandler: Joe…\nJoey: No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right?\nSo I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.\nMonica: Joey look it’s really sweet…\nJoey: No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at\nMonica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!\nMonica: That is true.\nJoey: Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like,\nstranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a\nreally good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to\nme.\nChandler: (To Monica) Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else.\nMonica: It might be kinda cool.\nJoey: So I can do it?\nChandler: Yeah you can do it.\nJoey: All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my\nspeech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?\nChandler: Yeah.\nJoey: Okay.\n(Phoebe enters slowly.)\nMonica: Hey Pheebs, how’s it going?\nPhoebe: Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!\nMonica: Oh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something?\nPhoebe: Oh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering!\nMonica: Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)\nPhoebe: What is it?\nMonica: It’s Hexadrin.\nPhoebe: Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply\npressure to these points right here. (She’s pinching the bit of skin between her\nright thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you\nstill have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)\nMonica: Okay, while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in, I’m\ngonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some\nnice soft pillows under your head, I’m gonna turn the TV on and you can watch\nwhatever you want. And I’m—Sit down—(She sits down on the couch)—gonna\nmake you some tea. And then, I’m gonna rub your feet.\nPhoebe: Oh.\nJoey: Oh! My head! Oh! (He’s sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his\nfeet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is reading and there is knock on the door which she\nanswers.]\nRachel: Coming.\n(She opens the door to reveal Ross with a pencil mark from his forehead to his chin.)\nRoss: I have a bone to pick with you.\nRachel: Uh-oh.\nRoss: Yes! Ben learned a little trick.\nRachel: Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… (She is waving her hand up and down\nher face. She’s thinking about the pencil mark.)\nRoss: That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat\nso the pee goes everywhere!\nRachel: Oh that.\nRoss: Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and\nthey’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!\nRachel: Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think\nthat’s just a little funny?!\nRoss: I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught\nhim right?\nRachel: (looking at his mark) Yes.\n[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica are there.]\nPhoebe: It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills\ncalled?\nMonica: Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)\nPhoebe: Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a\nstory! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)\nMonica: No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.\nPhoebe: Say what?\nMonica: Y’know, the possible side affects.\nPhoebe: Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness,\nfacial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage!\nNow okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death\ncapsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules!\nMonica: Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there\nfor legal reasons!\nPhoebe: Why?\nMonica: In case it happens.\nJoey: (entering) Hey!\nChandler: Hey!\nJoey: Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing\nthe proof of his ordination.)\nChandler: Hey!\nMonica: You did it! You got ordained?!\nJoey: Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!\nChandler: Our minister…\nPhoebe: I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)\nMonica: Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her\ntorso.)\nPhoebe: Okay, then I must be disoriented.\nJoey: Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony,\ndo you wanna hear it?\nChandler: Okay.\nMonica: Yeah!\nJoey: Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… (Starts to read the\npiece of paper he brought.) \"We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to\ncelebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.\" (Monica and Chandler like\nit so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) \"It is a love based on giving and receiving.\nAs well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and\nreceived. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving.\" (Phoebe nods\nher approval.) \"We too can share and love and have and receive.\"\nChandler: (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: Carol and Susan’s, there is a knock on the door and Carol opens it to\nreveal Rachel.]\nCarol: Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the\nquarter trick with her as well.)\nRachel: Hi!\nCarol: What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?\nRachel: Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your\nbuilding and I thought to myself, \"What’s up with Carol and sweet, little\nBen?\"\nCarol: Can I ask what—Come on in.\nRachel: Okay.\nCarol: Umm uh, I’ll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.\nRachel: I’d love that. I would loooove… (Carol goes to make the coffee\nand she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...\nBen: (jumping up from behind her chair) Gotcha!! (Rachel jumps up startled.)\nRachel: I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the\ncoffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you\nokay?\nCarol: (from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?\nRachel: Yes oh—(To Ben)—Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.)\nNo, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that\nstuff I taught you yesterday?\nBen: (mimicking her) Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?\nRachel: Don’t do that.\nBen: Don’t do that.\nRachel: Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.\nBen: Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.\nRachel: Oh damnit!\nBen: Oh damnit!\nRachel: No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that!\nBen: Damnit!\nRachel: No don’t! Go back to repeating!\nBen: Damnit!\nRachel: Oh crap!\nBen: Oh crap!\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Monica are returning from\nCentral Perk.]\nPhoebe: I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?\nMonica: Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to\nhappen to you! Stop being such a baby!\nPhoebe: Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!\n(Holds up the warning label.)\nJoey: Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?\nChandler: Yeah. O-okay.\nJoey: (reading) \"When I think of the love that these two givers and\nreceivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and\ngiving and…\" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. (He\npoints to the stop on the paper where he left off.)\nMonica: How about receiving?\nJoey: Yes!\nChandler: See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things\nabout having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!\nY’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!\nJoey: Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so\nhard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?\nChandler: No, not us… (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)\nMonica: I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole\nanything?\nPhoebe: Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the\neyes?\nMonica: It doesn’t say that!\nPhoebe: Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!\nChandler: See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic\nstories. Nice stories.\nJoey: Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know\nwhen you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, \"Began\ntheir beautiful journey…\"\nMonica: There you go!\nJoey: \"…by doin’ it.\"\nChandler: Joe?\nJoey: Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet\nacross the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together\nand she’s feeding you strawberries?\nChandler: Isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?\nJoey: Yeah!! I call that London style.\nMonica: No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad\nthat night because this guy that I was Ross’s mom.\nJoey: Oh.\nMonica: And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we\ndrank too much…\nJoey: Yeah baby!\nChandler: And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and\nsaid goodnight.\nJoey: Oh.\nChandler: But then later that night…\nJoey: Yeah baby!\n[Cut to London, Chandler’s hotel room. He is getting ready for bed by doing\npush-ups. One push-up. Just as he gets under the covers, there’s a knock on the\ndoor.]\nChandler: (answering the door) Hey!\nMonica: (standing outside) Cute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it up\nhere in London huh?\nChandler: Well I was… I was exactly expecting company after…(He looks\nat his watch.) 9:15.\nMonica: (entering) Is Joey here?\nChandler: Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the\nbride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about\nwhat that guy told ya are ya?\nMonica: Wouldn’t you be?\nChandler: Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and\nyou’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I\nmean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!\nMonica: Really?\nChandler: You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms…\n(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going\non? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?\nMonica: Well, not anymore.\nChandler: But we don’t do that.\nMonica: I know, I just thought it would be fun.\nChandler: How drunk are you?\nMonica: Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you\nshould feel guilty about taking advantage.\nChandler: (thinks) That’s the perfect amount!\nMonica: Okay!\n(They run to the bed, sit down, and start making out again.)\nMonica: (breaking the kiss) Y’know what’s weird?\nChandler: What?\nMonica: This doesn’t feel weird!\nChandler: I know.\nMonica: You’re a really good kisser.\nChandler: Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna\nget under the covers?\nMonica: Hm-hmm!\nChandler: Okay!\n(They do so and they take off their clothes.)\nMonica: Wow! You are really fast!\nChandler: It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.\nMonica: We’re gonna see each other naked.\nChandler: Yep!\nMonica: Do you wanna do it at the same time?\nChandler: Count of three?\nMonica: One!\nChandler: Two!\nMonica: Two!\nMonica and Chandler: Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other\nout, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)\nChandler: Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively\nruined.\nMonica: Eh, we weren’t that close anyway!\nChandler: Eh!\n(They start making out again, and it takes Joey trying to enter to stop them.)\nChandler: Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers\nas Joey enters. Remember?)\nJoey: Hey!\nChandler: Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… (Notices that the TV is\nturned off.)\nJoey: Oh, dude I’m so sorry!\nChandler: No! No! No!\nJoey: Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a\nsecond, I’m still with my bride’s maid, I just—Where are those condoms you\nbrought?\nChandler: They’re in my bag over there. (Points.)\nJoey: Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler’s bag by getting as far away from\nChandler’s bed as possible.)\nChandler: Uh, could you leave me one?\nJoey: (pause) For just you?\nChandler: Yeah.\nJoey: Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some\nreally nice girls down there.\nChandler: No I-I-I’m fine.\nJoey: All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)\n[Cut back to Monica and Chandler telling Phoebe and Joey the story.]\nJoey: That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you\nwere on to something, but it did nothing for me.\nMonica: Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing\nnothing for me.\nJoey: Oh… (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last\none? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent\nthat hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!\nPhoebe: Yeah, it’s totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you\noriginally wanted to hook up with that night.\nMonica: What?!\nChandler: What?\nPhoebe: (To Joey) What?!\nChandler: Who did you originally want to hook up with?\nMonica: Okay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really\ndepressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just\nwanted…just sex. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually\nlooking…for Joey. (Joey smiles.)\nJoey: Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, scene continued from earlier.]\nChandler: (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever\nin-intend on telling me about this?\nMonica: No because it-it didn’t seem important.\nChandler: Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it\nwasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!\nMonica: Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It\nis you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!\nJoey: And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—(Shuts\nup on Monica’s glare.)\nChandler: I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and\nI’m runner up.\nMonica: Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was\nnot there that night?!\nJoey: Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now I’m a man of the cloth, but\nI still have feelings!\nChandler: (To Joey) Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now.\nOkay?\nJoey: What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my\nbride’s maid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! (To Monica) I\nmean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of\nthis, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!\nChandler: Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing\ntheir saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I\ndon’t know what I need. I need a walk.\nMonica: Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!\nChandler: It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you\nhad to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)\nJoey: This is crazy.\nPhoebe: I know! Robin is so gay!\n[Scene: Carol and Susan’s, Rachel is talking with Ben.]\nRachel: So now what have we agreed?\nBen: No more pranks.\nRachel: And-and what else?\nBen: That you and daddy were not on a break.\nRachel: Very good.\n(There’s a knock on the door and Ross enters.)\nRoss: Rachel! What are you doing here?\nRachel: I’m just visiting my good friend Carol.\nRoss: Your good friend?\nRachel: Yeah!\nRoss: What’s her last name?\nRachel: Carol…Lesbian?\nRoss: Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?\nRachel: What line?\nRoss: Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class\nof the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy voice) \"Dude, don’t you ever was\nyour face?\"\nRachel: All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you\nwere so mad already!\nRoss: Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s\nnot funny!\nCarol: (entering from the kitchen) Hey Ross!\nRoss: Hi.\nCarol: What’s not funny?\nRoss: Practical jokes.\nCarol: Oh I…I think they’re funny.\nRoss: You have a line down your face.\nCarol: What? (Goes and checks.)\nRachel: Okay, maybe they are not funny to you…\nCarol: (yelling from the bathroom) Oh my God!\nRachel: Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!\nRoss: Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid\nwho has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office\nwearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!\nRachel: That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really\njust shake your fist in the air and shout, \"I will be revenged?!\"\nRoss: I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff\nanymore. Okay?\nRachel: Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that\nstuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go\nback to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!\nRoss: No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding\nbut I…\nRachel: Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna\nhave to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal\n6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!\nBen: (yelling from off camera) Crap!!\nRachel: I gotta go! (Runs out.)\n[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is sulking on the couch as Joey enters to talk with\nhim.]\nJoey: Hey.\nChandler: Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but\nit would probably rather sleep with you!\nJoey: Chandler, come on nothing even happened!\nChandler: Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…\nJoey: No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I except that. I don’t\ncare about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset.\nChandler: How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this\nfantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!\nJoey: Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the\nrest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there!\nAlthough you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys\nare perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it\njust…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.\nChandler: That’s what you should say.\nJoey: What?\nChandler: When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.\nJoey: Really? I can do it?\nChandler: I’d love it if you would do it.\nJoey: Hey! (They hug.)\nChandler: But those are the words! Those exact words!\nJoey: Well I don’t know remember exactly but, it’s-it’s pretty\nmuch about having and giving and sharing and receiving.\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is in the kitchen as Ross and Ben are entering.]\nRoss: Hey!\nRachel: Hey!\nRoss: Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you\ncan look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he\nasked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…\nRachel: Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben?\n(He nods yes.)\nRoss: Okay, I’ll see you later pal.\n(Ross turns to leave.)\nRachel: Ohh, okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads ‘Poop.’)\nWh—Ah-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it.\nRoss: What?\nRachel: I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting. (To Ross)\nYou’ve got something here on your back.\nRoss: What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) That’s great.\nThat is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just\nfinish talking about Ben?!\nRachel: Oh I…\nBen: What did we just finish talking about Ben?!\nRoss: All right, that’s it! (He runs over to Ben, but he runs past him and\nout the door.) Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!\nRachel: No! Wait! Come on!\n[Cut to the hallway, Ben runs upstairs with Ross in pursuit.]\nRoss: Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!\nRachel: No you guys… (She walks out into the hallway.)\nRoss: I-I-am—(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the\nstairs landing just in front of Rachel.)\nRachel: EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to\nhim and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)\n[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are entering.
