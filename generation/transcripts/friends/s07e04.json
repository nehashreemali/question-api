(Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel,\nChandler, and Monica aren’t amused.)\nC.H.E.E.S.E: You can say that again Mac.\nMac: Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.\nC.H.E.E.S.E: Oh yeah? Well then how come I can’t get my VCR to stop\nblinking 12:00?\n(They both break into a huge laugh and do that stop motion thing they had at the end of\nChiPs.)\nJoey: (laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?\n(They all make happy faces as they are unable to express their feelings verbally.\nFinally, the phone rings and the race to answer it is won by Monica.)\nMonica: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, it’s your mom.\n(Hands him the phone.)\nChandler: It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.\nRoss: Ohhhh…\nRachel: That’s nice.\nJoey: (on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a\nchance to figure out what they’re gonna say.)\nRachel: Well that was umm…Okay.\nRoss: It wasn’t the best.\nChandler: That was one of the worse things ever.

So what-what did\nyou guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It\nwasn’t that good.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Monica are reading on the couch.]\nMonica: Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?\nPhoebe: What?

Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?\nHilda: What?\nRachel: I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had\nanyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this\nis-this isn’t the same thing.\nHilda: No dear. It’s not.\nRachel: No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming\nin it was nice to meet you.\nHilda: Thank you! Good meeting you.\nRachel: All right. (Hilda exits) I’m a total pro!\n(There’s a knock on the door and a handsome man enters.)\nMan: Hello?\nRachel: (seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I’m sorry the models are\nactually down the hall.\nMan: Actually, I’m here about the assistant job.\nRachel: Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a\nseat there. Umm, so what’s—what is—what’s your name?\nMan: Tag Jones.\nRachel: Uh-huh, go on.\nTag: That’s it. That’s my whole name.\nRachel: That’s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well\nlet’s-let’s just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)\nTag: I know I haven’t worked in an office before, and I really don’t\nhave a lot of experience, but uh…\nRachel: Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years\npainting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on!\nTag: It’s lame, I know. But I’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to\nlearn…\nRachel: Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and\ntakes his picture.) I’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it.\nCould you just stand up please?\n[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in\nand sits in their easy chair.]\nChandler: No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to\neach other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)\nPhoebe: (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.\nMonica: (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.\nChandler: Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?\nMonica: I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.\nChandler: Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between\none another. We have too much love and respect for one another.\nMonica: Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.\nChandler: No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do\nnot have any secrets from you.\nMonica: Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior\nyear at Disneyland?\nChandler: Oh no-no, I can’t do that.\nMonica: If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.\nChandler: Okay.\nMonica: Okay.\nChandler: So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this\nrestaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of\nhis car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and\nRoss starts to feel a little iffy.\nMonica: Oh my God. He threw up?\nChandler: No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs\nhysterically.) So what was Phoebe’s secret?\nMonica: Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting\nfired.\nChandler: That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?\nMonica: That’s right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]\nRachel: Chandler, you have an assistant right?\nChandler: (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell\nher I am sick!\nRachel: No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean\nI’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot\nof experience and then there’s this guy…\nChandler: What about him?\nRachel: I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to\ndo. Tell me what to do.\nPhoebe: Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire\nan assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.\nRachel: Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot\nof sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!\nPhoebe: Let’s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh… But no! No!\nYou can’t-you can’t hire him, because that—it’s not professional. Umm,\nthis is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)\nRachel: Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect\nfor the job Hilda!\nChandler: Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow!\nDon’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!\n[Scene: The Days of Our Lives producer’s office, Joey is entering to find\nTerry there.]\nTerry: Hey-hey-hey Joey!\nJoey: Hey Terry!\nTerry: Good to see you again!\nJoey: It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller\nthen they used to.\nTerry: It’s a different building.\nJoey: So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?\nTerry: Why don’t we start right now!\nJoey: Okay.\nTerry: Here are the audition scenes. (Holds out the script.)\nJoey: (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna\noffer me the part.\nTerry: Why would you think that?\nJoey: Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who\nlooks more me than me right?\nTerry: Everybody has to audition.\nJoey: Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my\nown cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.\nTerry: I’m sorry Joey that’s…that’s the way it is.\nJoey: Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up\nhere in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh?\nWell y’know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who’s hoop…\nThis is a star that the hoop—this hoop—I was Dr. Drake Remoray!\n[Scene: Rachel’s office, she’s there as Tag knocks on the door and enters\ncarrying a plant.]\nRachel: Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?\nTag: I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face\nyesterday. And I noticed there aren’t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring\nyou your first… (Notices her plant) There is a plant in your office.\nRachel: Kinda.\nTag: Right. So I guess I shouldn’t put good at noticing stuff on my resume.\n(Sets the plant down on her desk.)\nRachel: Oh-ohh, thank you.\nTag: Anyway, I’m guessing you hired somebody.\nRachel: Well…\nTag: Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. (Starts to leave.)\nRachel: But I hired you!\nTag: What?\nRachel: Yeah! You-you got the job!

(Kisses him.)\nChandler: Hey.\nMonica: I made you a surprise.\nChandler: Oh yeah?\nMonica: Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a\ncraving for them.\nChandler: Did you not understand the story?\nRoss: (entering) Hey!\nChandler: Hey! What’s up?\nMonica: Ross!\nRoss: Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do\nfor dinner.\nChandler: Huh.\nRoss: (notices the table) Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner\nstuff?

(Monica slaps him on the\nshoulder.)\nRoss: (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I\nchoose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said, \"Umm, what would\nmake this ride more fun?!\"\nMonica: You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be\nlaughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler\nlaughing.)\nRoss: (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!\nChandler: I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples\ncan’t keep secrets from one another!\nRoss: Oh really?
