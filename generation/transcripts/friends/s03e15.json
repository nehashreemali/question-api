Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?\nJoey: Dude, I don’t know.\nChandler: She was kidding.\nJoey: Yeah.\nChandler: She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up\nwith a set of ground rules.\nJoey: Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your\neyes. Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see\nsomething you don’t want to be seeing.\nChandler: Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it!

(storms out)\nRoss: Yeah, but wait...\nRachel: Good bye!\n(Ross starts to pack up the picnic in anger, and throws a three hole punch in the\nbasket.)\nSophie: Actually, that’s our three hole punch.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is eating the picnic as Rachel comes home from work.]\nRoss: Hey.\nRachel: Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...\nRoss: No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.\nRachel: (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to\nme.\nRoss: For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?\nRachel: You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring\na picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!\nRoss: Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our\nanniversary, boy what an ass am I.\nRachel: But I told you, I didn’t have the time!\nRoss: Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even\nhave a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.\nRachel: Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my\njob so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?\nRoss: No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!\nRachel: Just a job!\nRoss: Yes.\nRachel: Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing\nsomething I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing\nsomething that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...\nRoss: No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya,\nbut I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I\ndon’t know what to do anymore.\nRachel: Well neither do I!\nRoss: Is this about Mark?\nRachel: (shocked) Oh my God.\nRoss: Okay, it’s not, it’s not.\nRachel: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again,\nRoss, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.\nRoss: Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to\ndo.\nRachel: I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take\na break.\nRoss: Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a\nbreak, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or\nsomething.. (opens the door)\nRachel: No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.\n(Ross looks at her, then leaves slamming the door behind him.)\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: The Philly, Chandler and Joey are talking to Chloe.]\nChloe: And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got\nin an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.\n(Chandler agrees in an absolutely bored way.)\nChloe: (seeing Ross enter) Hey, it’s the dinosaur guy. (runs over to Ross)\nHi, Ross.\nRoss: Oh, hi Chloe.\nChloe: I want you to met some friends of mine. (Introduces him to Chandler and\nJoey) This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said\nwe don’t do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime\nanybody wants 400, we just say ‘let’s Ross it!’\nChandler: And that’s the only colour that comes in.\nIssac: Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?\nChloe: Oh! (storms off)\nChandler: So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big\nanniversary dinner.\nRoss: Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.\n(Chandler and Joey stare at each other in shock.)\n[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Phoebe are on their dates with Sergei and Mischa.]\nMonica: Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi\nce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?\nMischa: Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.\nMonica: Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.\nPhoebe: (laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock,\nknock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros\nBoutros Gali said in the New York Times.\n(Mischa does so.)\nPhoebe: You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.\nMischa: (to Sergei) Boutros Boutros Gali.\n(Sergei responds.)\nMischa: He says he was too.\nPhoebe: Interesting.\nMischa: (to Monica) So I was wondering....\nPhoebe: Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please\ntell Sergei that I really like his suit.\n(Mischa does so, and Sergei complements Phoebe, and says it slowly)\nMischa: (to Phoebe, very quickly) Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks\nyou look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. (to Monica) So you're a\nchef?\nMonica: I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.\nMischa: Oh, really.\nPhoebe: Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What\nare you doing?\nMonica: Well, I was having a conversation.\nPhoebe: Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t\nbeen able to say two words to each other.\nMonica: What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a\nconversation?\nPhoebe: That would be great. Thank you.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is lying in front of the bay window, and the phone\nrings.]\nRachel: (jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!\nMark: Oh, hi. It’s Mark.\nRachel: (disappointed) Oh.\nMark: What? Is it my breath?\nRachel: No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!\nMark: Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn’t tonight your,\nyour big anniversary dinner?\nRachel: Yeah. Well, umm.....\nMark: Rach, are you okay?\nRachel: (on the verge of tears) Yeah, I’m fine.\nMark: You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?\nRachel: No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.\nMark: All right, all right, I’m coming over, and I’m bringing Chinese\nfood.\nRachel: Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry.\nMark: It’s for me.\nRachel: Oh. Okay, bye.\n[Scene: The Philly.]\nJoey: So what are you gonna do?\nRoss: What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.\nChandler: Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.\nRoss: Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to\nwait a while?\nChandler: Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!\n(Ross goes to call her.)\nChandler: Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.\nJoey: Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.\nChandler: Why? What happened to him?\nJoey: Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Mark is there, opening Chinese food boxes.]\nRachel: Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful.\nI told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted\nto take a break, I don’t want to take a break.\nMark: Wow. I’m sorry. Eggroll?\nRachel: No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.\nMark: Well, then he’s, he’s probably just, out.\nRachel: Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.\n(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)\nRachel: Hello.\nRoss: Hi! It’s me.\nRachel: Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.\nRoss: Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t,\ndon’t you think we can work on this?\nMark: Hey, what do you want to drink?\nRoss: Who’s that?\nRachel: Nobody.\nMark: Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?\n(Rachel mouths ‘Shoot!’ or something similar.)\nRoss: Is that Mark?\nRachel: Umm, honey, look he just came over to....\n[Cut to The Philly.]\nRoss: Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)\nChloe: Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.\nRoss: Ah, that’s okay, thanks.\nChloe: Hey, you don’t have to smile. You just have to dance.\nRoss: Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?\nChloe: Oh, okay. (to the bartender) Hey, two beers. (sits down next to him)\n[Scene: The Restaurant, after dinner.]\nMischa: (to Monica) And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away,\nwhile my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.\nMonica: Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck\nit up through your nose and choke on it.\n(Sergei says something to Mischa.)\nMischa: (to Phoebe) Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.\nPhoebe: Well, tell him, apology accepted.\n(Mischa does so.)\nMischa: (to Monica) Oh, he’s unbelievable. I mean for the first time in\nthree years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let\nme enjoy that, no!! (to Sergei) You silly diplomat, why don’t you learn some English,\nSergei?\nPhoebe: Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?\nMonica: Hey, the man’s dog just died.\n(Sergei insults Mischa, and they get into a huge fight, in Russian.)\nMischa: (to Monica) I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me\nto the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.\nMonica: It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your\nguy can’t even say coupons. (they leave)\nSergei: Uh, (picks up a plate) plate?\nPhoebe: Plate! Yes, plate.\nSergei: Plate. Plate. Plate.\nPhoebe: See, we don’t need them.\nSergei: (picking up a cup) Plate?\nPhoebe: Yeah.\n[Scene: The Philly, With or Without You is playing. (Which is the same song Ross\nplayed for Rachel in TOW the List.)]\nRoss: (to Chloe) I like this song.\nChloe: Well, you’re practically dancing already. Why don’t you just do\nit over here?\nRoss: Oh, no, no.\nChloe: What? Are you married? ‘Cause that’s okay.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is next to the bay window again, Mark has left.]\nRachel: (picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be\nhome, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you’re not home.\n[Scene: The Philly, Ross is dancing with Chloe.]\nChloe: Still no smile?\n(She kisses him. Ross leans back for a second, and then they both kiss, more\npassionately this time as U2's With or Without You plays in the background.)\nTo Be Continued......\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Central Perk, Sergei is teaching Phoebe how to sing American Pie, by Don\nMaclean.]\n(Both Phoebe and him are singing along and they get to the chorus.)\nSergei: (singing) Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie.
