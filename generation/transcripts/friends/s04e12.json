Everyone’s asleep, and all through the apartments not a creature was\nstirring, not even a mouse. That is except for the chick, who turns out to be a rooster\nand is crowing in the sun. Needless to say, this awakens Monica and Rachel who rush into\ntheir living room, searching for the cause of the sound.]\nRachel: What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is\nthat you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.)\nOhhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.)\nMonica: Boy, you are really not a morning person.\nRachel: (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get\nup! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!\n(Chandler opens the door, finally.)\nRachel: What is that noise?\nChandler: You!\nJoey: It’s the chick! She’s…going through some changes.\nMonica: What kind of changes?\nChandler: Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster.\n(The rooster crows.) We’re getting a second opinion.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, it’s later that morning, everybody has gotten up and\nRoss and Phoebe has joined them for breakfast. Rachel is returning from shopping.]\nPhoebe: Hey!\nRoss: Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?\nRachel: Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s\ndumb-ass rooster.\nPhoebe: You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t\nbe living in an apartment.\nRachel: Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…\nPhoebe: All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if\nI’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.\nRoss: Now, how will they know if you’re ready?\nPhoebe: Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is\nthick.\nChandler: Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.\nPhoebe: Okay everyone, think thick.\nAll: Good-bye! Good luck! (She opens the door to reveal Monica and Joey.)\nPhoebe: Hi! Wish me luck!\nMonica: Oh, good luck.\nJoey: Good luck. (to Monica) And I’m still right!\nMonica: That is sooo not true!\nRachel: What?\nJoey: She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means\nshe’s wearing her old lady underpants.\nChandler: I can check that for ya.\nMonica: I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler\nknow me and Rachel better than we know you.\nChandler: Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even\nnumbers.\nJoey: Yeah, what’s that about?\nChandler: (to Rachel) And you… Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel’s\nbag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.\nRoss: (He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) You’re good.\n(Tries a cookie.) These are not.\nRachel: I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.\nMonica: Yeah.\nJoey: Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?\nRoss: Five.\nChandler: Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.\nRachel: How many guesses do you get?\nJoey: Six.\nRoss: Challenge extended.\nMonica: Deal!\nRoss: Challenge excepted.\nJoey: All right, we’ll start with…apples.\nRoss: We’ll be starting with apples.\nChandler: (to Ross) Stop that now!\n(Ross reveals a bag of apples.)\nChandler: Yes!\nJoey: Okay.

(Whispers something in Joey’s ear.)\nJoey: No-no, not for like another two weeks.\nChandler: I got it! Scotch… tape.

And the winner gets a hundred bucks.\nJoey: Serious?\nMonica: Are you scared?\nJoey: No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?\nMonica: Ross will do it.\nRoss: Oh sure, \"Ross will do it!\" It’s not like he has a job, or\na child, or a life of his own.\nRachel: Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.\nRoss: No-no-no, I-I wanna play.\n[Scene: The Doctor’s office, Dr. Zane is examining Phoebe as Frank and Alice\nwatch.]\nDr. Zane: It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.\nPhoebe: Oh!

As in, \"More than one?\"\nDr. Zane: Um-hmm, five actually.\nPhoebe: Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the\nstairs?\nDr. Zane: We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will\nattach.\nPhoebe: That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75\npercent chance of no baby at all!\nFrank: Hey, y’know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you\nstuff like 200 of them in there?\nAlice: Sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine.\nPhoebe: Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause\nI’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.\nFrank: Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot\nto make it right.\nAlice: Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we’re kinda\nusing all the money we have to do it just this one time.\nPhoebe: Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my\nuterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that I\ncan do y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?\nDr. Zane: No, I’m sorry.\nPhoebe: Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!\nFrank: I know! Why don’t you get drunk!

You are ruining moving\nday for us!\nRachel: Will you stop calling it your apartment!\nJoey: But it is our apartment!\nRachel: No it’s not!\n(They all decay into massive bickering as Phoebe returns from the bathroom.)\nPhoebe: You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna\nhave a baby!\nFrank: MY SISTER’S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!\n(They all go over and hug Phoebe.)\nPhoebe: Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.\nAll: Oh!

But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll\ndie.\nMonica: I can’t believe we’re living here!\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, they’re both unpacked. The\nbig ceramic dog has found a new home in front of the window. Joey screams and runs into\nthe living room.]\nChandler: What?! What-what is it?!\nJoey: Did you see the size of the closets?!\nChandler: I can’t believe we live here!\n(They both sit down on the chairs and put up the foot rest.)\nChandler and Joey: Awwwww!!
