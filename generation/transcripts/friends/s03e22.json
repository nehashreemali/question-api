Joey\nTribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this\nproduction.\nJoey: Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!\nThe Director: Kate Miller’s awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable.\n(Kate walks away depressed.) Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by\nMarshal Talmant is… (stops, reads it again, and throws down the paper in disgust)\nThank you, boys and girls, you’ve ruined my life.
