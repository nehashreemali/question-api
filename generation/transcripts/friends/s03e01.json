I got a call at two in the morning, but all I\ncould hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a\nopossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the\nphone call.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is coming in from the bedroom]\nChandler: Morning.\nJoey: Morning, hey, you made pancakes?\nChandler: Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.\nJanice: (entering and singing) Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man\nto cheer up.

Why don't you stay home from\nwork today and just hang out with me.\nJanice: Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go\nsee my lawyer.\nChandler: I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting\ndivorced.

(holds it close to Ross) What do I do with\nthis?\nRoss: Getting it away from me would be job one.\nMonica: It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this\nis like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)\nPhoebe: Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your\ncereal.

I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of\nwondering why hasn't he called.

Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you\nnuts before too, remember?\nChandler: Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.\nCapital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.\nJoey: Look, what do you want me to say?\nChandler: I want you to say that you like her!\nJoey: I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts\nlaughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have\nsomething to throw at her.\nChandler: Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by\nthe way there is no Count Rushmore!\nJoey: Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?\n(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Ross are entering]\nRoss: How could you have told her?\nRachel: Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.\nRoss: Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.\nRachel: Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?\nRoss: Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.\nRachel: Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other\neverything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that\nlocker room stuff.\nRoss: That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who\ndid it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.\nRachel: Were both of those Joey?\nRoss: Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your\ngirlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.\nRachel: Not even with your best friend.\nRoss: Noo!\nRachel: That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding\nand the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same\nthing you are.\nRoss: Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?\nRachel: Pretty much.\nRoss: Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the\nnight of five times?\nRachel: Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.\nRoss: I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.\n[Scene: Monica's bedroom, Phoebe is trying to relax her.]\nPhoebe: ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the\nplinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me\nyour happy place.\nMonica: Richard's living room, drinking wine.\nPhoebe: All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And\nget out!\nMonica: I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.\nPhoebe: Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to\nask that you don't move anything.\nMonica: All right, I'll try not to.\nPhoebe: Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....\nMonica: Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?\nPhoebe: All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the\nwarm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....\nMonica: I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.\nPhoebe: All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not\npermitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and\nthe, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....\nMonica: Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's]\nJanice: So, I hear, you hate me!\nJoey: I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.\nJanice: A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off\nand throw it at me.\nJoey: And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...\nJanice: All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about\nour little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time\ntogether.\nJoey: But what does that gonna do...\nJanice: For Chandler!\nJoey: Okay. I'm in.\nJanice: Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY\nOF FUN!'\nJoey: Does it have to be a whole day?\nJanice: Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.\nJoey: Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.\n[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are entering]\nMonica: (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was\nthose videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.\nPhoebe: Monica, do you want us to take you home?\nMonica: Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,\nand Phoebe leave)\nRoss: Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?\nChandler: Umm, yeah.\nRoss: No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,\nstamina, girth....\nChandler: Girth?

Okay, you-you go.\nChandler: Okay.\nRoss: Okay.\nChandler: Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.\nRoss: Hmph.\nChandler: And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these\nlike, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the\nXerox place....\nRoss: With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!\nChandler: I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And\nyour like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't\npossibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's\nkinda like, you're, you know.

You don't know!\nRoss: Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the\nmatter with you?\nChandler: You said...\nRoss: I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there!

It was bat day at Shea\nStadium.\nChandler: Well, I guess that's something.\nJoey: No man, that's huge!
