What are we gonna do?\nJoey: Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes\nright off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in\nhis tight pants.)\nMonica: That’s a little more than I wanted to see.\nJoey: (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of\nthis stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should\njust leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)\nMonica: I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.\n(Joey places the toliet brush and holder over the hole, which is in the middle of the\nfloor.)\nJoey: Eh!
