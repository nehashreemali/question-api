(Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under\nseven minutes! We did it!!\nRachel: (deadpan) Yes, the hard part is truly over.\nRoss: No, but come on, we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew\nI’d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!\n(Phoebe and Monica walk in from getting some coffee.)\nPhoebe: Oh you made it!\nRachel: Hi! (Ross is stunned.)\nMonica: How are you doing?\nRoss: Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?\nMonica: We took a cab. Did you guys walk?\nRoss: N… No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!\n(Chandler and Joey enter from the vending machines carrying sodas.)\nChandler: Hi!\nJoey: Hey! You made it!\nRoss: Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!\nRachel: Ross, you stay here and talk, I’m gonna go have a baby.\nRoss: Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi, this is Rachel Green.\nI’m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.\nNurse: Right! We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you. So in just a\nminute…\nRachel: (interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry, semi-private? We\n(Laughs), we asked for a private room.\nNurse: Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we can’t guarantee a private\nroom and currently they’re all unavailable.\nChandler: Man, if only you’d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at\nhim.)\nNurse: I’m sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.\nRachel: Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)\nRoss: Yeah?\nRachel: Give her some money.\nRoss: I really think they’re out of rooms.\nRachel: They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important\npeople!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!\nRoss: Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble, you don’t know where any\ncountries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by\nRachel.) Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm,\nprivate rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?\nNurse: This is a hospital.\nRachel: (standing up) Okay. Y’know what? I’d have to say I really\ndon’t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have\nno problem to—Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!\nRoss: What-what?\nRachel: Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing\nheavily.)\nNurse: Would you like to see a semi-private room?\nRachel: Yeah, it couldn’t hurt to look.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: The Semi-Private Labor Room, Rachel is in bed, Ross is fooling around, and Dr.\nLong is checking on Rachel.]\nDr. Long: Well you’re only two centimeters dilated and we need to get to\nten. It’ll be a while.\nRachel: Oh, okay.\nDr. Long: I’ll be back in an hour to check you again.\nRoss: Thank you.\nRachel: Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill.\nRoss: Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He’s looking at the stirrups\non the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his\nlegs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.\nRachel: Yeah well it looks great!\n(A nurse shows another couple into the room.)\nMan: Thank you very much.\nWoman: Thanks.\n(They stop when they see Ross who has to struggle to get out of the bed.)\nRoss: Hi! Hi, I’m uh Ross. I’m here to ruin this magical day for you.\nMan: Oh no-no, not at all.\nWoman: Don’t worry about it.\nMan: Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.\nRoss: Hi Julie.\nJulie: Hi.\nRoss: This is Rachel. (Points at her.)\nRachel: Hi!\nMarc: Oh hi Rachel.\nRachel: How are you?\nJulie: Hi. Is this your first?\nRachel: Yeah it is.\nJulie: Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you\nneed anything at all, just holler.\nRachel: That’s so sweet.\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Oh.\nRoss: Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you\nguys some privacy.\nMarc: No nonsense! We’re all in this together.\nJulie: Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think\nwe’re gonna have some fun.\nMarc: Yeah.\nRoss: Oh, okay.\nMarc: Hey! Smile! (Points his camera at Ross and Rachel.)\nRachel: Oh no, I really don’t want any—(He takes the picture)—Oh!\nThank you. Oh. Oh Ross…\nRoss: What?\nRachel: Here comes another contraction.\nRoss: Oh. Okay, just breathe.\nJulie: Oh honey, I think I’m having one too!\n(During the mutual contraction Julie takes a moment to point out they’re having a\ncontraction at the same time.)\nMarc: Look at this! (Takes another picture) There we go!\n[Scene: The Waiting Room, the rest of the gang is lounging around.]\nPhoebe: (looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the\nmiracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.\nMonica: Hey, you wanna see something?\nPhoebe: Sure! What?\nMonica: Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?\nChandler: Yeah?\nMonica: Listen uh, I-I’ve been doing some thinking, and I don’t know\nwhether it’s because we’re here or Rachel’s giving birth but umm, I think\nwe should try to have a baby.\nChandler: Okay.\nMonica: (freaking out) What-what-what’s that now?!\nChandler: Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we’re\nready.\nMonica: What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we’re ready to have a\nbaby now?!\nPhoebe: Oh, this is fun.\nJoey: You’re ready to have a baby? My boy’s all grown up!\nChandler: But you said you were ready too.\nMonica: Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high\nand weird like mine is now!\nChandler: Yes, but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?\nMonica: Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) ‘Cause I am ready\nto have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.\nJoey: (voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!\nMonica: That’s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!\n[Scene: The Semi-Private Labor Room, time lapse, Ross is massaging out a cramp on\nRachel’s hip as Marc opens up the privacy screen.]\nMarc: I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.\nRachel: Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay.\nMarc: Julie’s cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that’s about four\nfingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.\nJulie: Have you felt Rachel’s cervix Ross?\nRachel: (simultaneously as Ross) No, I don’t think we’ll be doing\nthat.\nRoss: (simultaneously as Rachel) We’re not gonna do that.\nJulie: Well, if you like you can feel Rachel’s and then feel mine to\ncompare.\nMrs. Geller: (entering) Am I interrupting?\nRoss: Uh yes! Thank you.\nRachel: Oh. Oh wait no.\nRoss: Later.\nRachel: No-no-don’t! Don’t leave me here with these people.\nRoss: Oh uh, I’m sorry. (Runs out.)\nRachel: No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!\n[Scene: The Hallway, Ross comes out and hugs Mrs. Geller.]\nRoss: Hi! I’m so glad you’re here, but it’s gonna be a while. I-I\nwished you’d called first.\nMrs. Geller: Oh that’s all right, I’m coming back later with your\nfather.\nRoss: Oh good.\nMrs. Geller: I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.\nRoss: Okay, what’s up?\nMrs. Geller: I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course\nthat you want it. (She holds up an engagement ring.)\nRoss: Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?\nMrs. Geller: This is your grandmother’s engagement ring, I want you to give\nit to Rachel.\nRoss: Mom no, come on! Thank you.\nMrs. Geller: Just hear me out!\nRoss: N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married\njust because she’s pregnant, okay?\nMrs. Geller: Honestly! Ross, this isn’t just some girl you picked up in a\nbar and humped. A child should have a family.\nRoss: Mom, y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m\nsorry…\nMrs. Geller: Just…think about it. If you don’t, I’ll talk more\nabout humping.\nRoss: Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters\nthe hallway.)\nRachel: Hi!\nMrs. Geller: Oh hi dear!\nRachel: Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!\n(Mrs. Geller leaves as Ross re-enters the room.)\n[Scene: The Waiting Room, Ross is explaining to the gang what happened with his\nmother.]\nRoss: …she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m\nnot with Rachel.\nPhoebe: Yeah. (Pause) Why aren’t you with Rachel?\nRoss: Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because\nwe’re having a baby. Okay?\nPhoebe: But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.\nRoss: Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a\nbaby.\nPhoebe: Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)\nJoey: God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?\nPhoebe: I know!\nJoey: I mean seriously, she’s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she\nturned me down, but if she hadn’t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my\narms and… (Realizes everyone is staring.) I haven’t bummed you guys out like\nthis in a while have I?\n[Scene: The Semi-Private Labor Room, Ross is returning to find another couple has taken\nthe place of Marc and Julie.]\nRoss: (To Rachel) Hey. Who’s that?\nRachel: New people.\nRoss: What happened to the Disgustingtons?\nRachel: They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here\nfirst! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave\nme a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.\nRoss: Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?\nRachel: Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm,\nevil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!\nRoss: Yeah? Okay.\nRachel: Ooh! Ow!!\nEvil Bitch: Are you looking at her?!\nSick Bastard: No!\nEvil Bitch: Don’t you look at her you sick bastard!\nSick Bastard: Honey I swear! I wasn’t looking at her!\nEvil Bitch: She’s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!\nRoss: Umm. Umm, I’m-I’m just gonna—(Closes the privacy screen.)\nEvil Bitch: See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!\nRoss: No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some\nprivacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)\nEvil Bitch: You miss your girlfriend?\nRoss: Just ignore them.\n(Sick Bastard sits down in a chair that enables him to look around the screen and stare\nat Rachel.)\nRachel: Ross.\nRoss: What? What?\nRachel: He’s looking at me.\nRoss: (to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!\nEvil Bitch: Don’t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!\n(Ross shrugs his shoulders to Rachel and Sick Bastard closes the screen all the way.)\n[Scene: Outside the Nursery, Chandler is looking at the babies as Monica walks up.]\nMonica: Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!\n(The nurse attending to the babies hears this, turns and stares at Chandler. Chandler\nmoves Monica to the side and away from the nurse.)\nMonica: What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?\nChandler: I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m\nnot saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it.\nWe’re good. We’re really good.\nMonica: We are pretty good.\nChandler: But nothing has to happen until your ready.\nMonica: Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, but\nmaybe it’s right.\nChandler: What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!\nMonica: What?!!\nChandler: I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.\nMonica: So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?\nChandler: We’re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler\nstops it.) Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies.\nSo, when do you want to start trying?\nMonica: Okay, hold on a sec.\nChandler: Period math?\nMonica: Yeah.\nChandler: Yeah.\nMonica: Well, we could start trying. Now.\nChandler: Right here?\nMonica: No, not here. Maybe here.\nChandler: Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and\nwe’re in a building that’s full of beds!\nMonica: And it’s so clean!!\n(They run off in search of a bed.)\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: The Vending Machines, Phoebe is buying a soda and Joey is shaking the candy\nmachine.]\nJoey: Come on you stupid machine! Come on!\nPhoebe: Oh, it ate your money?\nJoey: (looking at her) No.\nPhoebe: All right, I’ll see you downstairs then.\nJoey: All right.\nPhoebe: All right.\nJoey: Hey I got one! I got one!\n[Cut to the elevator lobby, Phoebe walks up and sees a man in a wheelchair with his\nbroken leg extended.]\nMan: Hi!\nPhoebe: Hi.\nMan: Oh uh, up or down?\nPhoebe: Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but can’t.) I-I\nhate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)\nMan: Could you press up too please?\nPhoebe: Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.\nMan: Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?\nPhoebe: Well, it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s\njust say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How about\nyou?\nMan: Car accident.\nPhoebe: Oh.\nMan: Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?\nMan: Yeah. Me. (The elevator door opens.) Oh hey, that’s me. (Rolls onto\nthe elevator.) Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.\nPhoebe: Uh-huh, yeah.\nMan: Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to\nvisit someone else…\nPhoebe: Oh yeah! I-I would like that.\nMan: I’m in the middle… (The elevator door closes, cutting him off.)\nPhoebe: Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!\nJoey: (standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)\n[Scene: The Semi-Private Labor Room, Evil Bitch and Sick Bastard are gone and Ross has\njust finished talking to a nurse as Rachel stands and stretches.]\nRoss: The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.\nRachel: Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still\nhave the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some\nsupport.)\nRoss: That’s it. That’s it.\n(The next couple enters.)\nWoman: Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.\nRachel: Yeah it was.\nWoman: Mine haven’t been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. (Hums then squeals\na little bit.) Oh, that was a big one!\n(Rachel motions for Ross to close the privacy screen, which he does.)\n[Scene: Another Waiting Room, Phoebe and Joey are trying to find out where the guy with\nthe broken leg is.]\nPhoebe: (to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient\nI’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he’s like\nearly to mid-thirties, very attractive.\nNurse: I think I know who you’re talking about.\nPhoebe: Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?\nNurse: I’m sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff…\nJoey: (walks up) Uh, she’s with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray.\nNurse: Dr. Drake who?\nJoey: Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m a\ndoctor.\nNurse: A doctor at this hospital?\nJoey: Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this\nman’s blood on your head?\nPhoebe: Hands.\nJoey: Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my\nassistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treating\nhim for years!\nNurse: He’s in room 816.\nJoey: 816, thank you!\nPhoebe: Thank you. (Starts to exit.)\n(Joey starts to leave, but stops.)\nJoey: And what is his name?\nPhoebe: (coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)\n[Scene: An Empty Hospital Room, Chandler and Monica enter.]\nMonica: I think we found a place.\nChandler: Okay. (They start kissing.)\nMonica: Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?\nChandler: Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the\nlight switch and finds it’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or\nturn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an\naerosol air freshener above her.)\nMonica: Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.\n(He hops onto the bed and they start making out.)\nMonica: Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at\nher.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)\nChandler: Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.\n[Scene: Outside Room 816, Phoebe and Joey are approaching.]\nPhoebe: Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, that’s him! That’s\nhim!\nJoey: Great! Go get him.\nPhoebe: Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.\nJoey: (looks in the window) He’s not really my type.\nPhoebe: No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see\nwhat’s he like. People tell doctors everything.\nJoey: But you said he was this great guy!\nPhoebe: But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn\nout to be the biggest jerks.\nJoey: You do attract some stinkers.\n[Scene: The Semi-Private Labor Room, Dr. Long is checking on Rachel again.]\nRachel: Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have\ncome and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am\nI dilated? Eight? Nine?\nDr. Long: Three.\nRoss: Just three?! I’m dilated three!\nDr. Long: We are moving along, just slowly. (Rachel lies back and sighs.)\nDon’t worry, you’re doing great. I’ll be back soon. (Exits.)\nRachel: Hey, y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this\nbaby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta\nbe like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)\nRoss: Actually it’s more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch\napart.)\nRachel: Oh stupid metric system!\n(Another woman with a nurse and doctor enter, the woman is screaming.)\nDoctor: Oh my. We’re gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.\nRachel: Oh for the love of God!\nWoman Giving Birth: (yelling from the hallway) It’s coming! It’s\ncoming!\nDoctor: And here it is! (The baby cries.)\nRachel: Oh come on!!\n[Scene: Room 816, Dr. Drake Remoray is entering.]\nJoey: Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need\nto ask you.\nMan: Really? I’ve been dealing with Dr. Wells.\nJoey: I know, but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr.\nWells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.\nMan: Dr. Wells is a woman.\nJoey: That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.\nMan: Clifford Burnett.\nJoey: Date of birth?\nCliff: November 16th, 1968.\nJoey: Age?\nCliff: Can’t you figure that out based on my date of birth?\nJoey: I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.\nCliff: I’m 33.\nJoey: Okay. And uh, are you married.\nCliff: No.\nJoey: Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment\nissues?\nCliff: Are all the questions this personal?\nJoey: (checking the list) Yes.\nCliff: Well uh if you must know I’m a widower.\nJoey: Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.\nCliff: Yeah.\nJoey: Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?\nCliff: No.\nJoey: Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff\ny’know, sexually?\nCliff: No!\nJoey: Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)\n[Scene: The Semi-Private Labor Room, they’re brining in yet another woman.]\nNurse: (calling to the woman) This room’s available.\nRachel: Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been\nwaiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am\ndilated, have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s\nonly fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to\nsue you! Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross)\nhe’s a lawyer!\nRoss: Uh Rach…\nRachel: Go get back on that case honey!\nNurse: I don’t think the next patient is very far along.\nRachel: Okay, well then bring her in.\n(Another nurse wheels the next pregnant woman in.)\nWoman: OH….MY….GAWD!!! (Uh-huh, it’s Janice.)\n(Ross and Rachel are, needless to say, stunned at the arrival of Janice.)\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: The Semi-Private Labor Room, continued from earlier.]\nJanice: I….can’t….believe this!\nRoss: And yet somehow it’s true!\nJanice: I mean this is so great! We’re gonna be baby buddies! (Does the\nlaugh.)\nRoss: (To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!\nMan: (entering, carrying a pillow) Hi sweetie!\nJanice: Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don’t think\nyou’ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the\ndermatologist’s office. Thank God for adult acne huh? (Does the laugh.)\nSid: I still can’t believe it! I’m the luckiest guy in the world!\nRoss: (softly) Really?\nSid: (To Janice) What’d he say?\nJanice: Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’re\ntalking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf.\nRachel: Oh!\nRoss: Oh there you go!\nRachel: I get it!\nJanice: So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married.\nRachel: Oh we-we didn’t.\nRoss: No-no. We…\nJanice: What?!\nRoss: Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh\nthat’s all.\nJanice: Why?!!\nRoss: Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But\nwe’re very excited about this.\nJanice: Oh. Well then shut me up. (Does the laugh.)\nRachel: Just tell me how.\nJanice: Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. (She makes a sound like a goose during\nthe contraction.)\nRoss: Sid you lucky deaf bastard.\n[Scene: Outside Room 816, Joey is briefing Phoebe on Cliff.]\nPhoebe: What else? What else?\nJoey: Uh, well he’s 33.\nPhoebe: Oh. Ah-uh.\nJoey: A widower.\nPhoebe: Oh.\nJoey: He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he’s not into anything weird\nsexually.\nPhoebe: Enter Pheebs.\n[Scene: Another Hospital Room, Chandler and Monica enter and start making out.]\nChandler: Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next\ndoor to hers?\nMonica: We could, or we can have sex in it.\nChandler: Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!\n(They start making out again.)\nMonica: (lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!\n(Suddenly they hear Janice laughing, and it ruins the moment.)\nMonica: Does that sound like Janice?\nChandler: If it’s not, then there’s two of them. And that would mean\nit’s the end of the world!\n[Scene: The Semi-Private Labor Room, Chandler and Monica are entering to see if they in\nfact did hear Janice.]\nMonica: Hey!\nRoss: Hey!\nChandler: Hi.\nRachel: Oh hi.\nMonica: I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?\nRachel: Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a\nSaint Bernard out your ass?\nChandler: Weirdest thing. Did I hear—(A nurse opens the privacy screen and\nChandler sees Janice)—Mother of God it’s true!\nJanice: Chandler Bing!\nChandler: Jan-Janice!\nRoss: Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.\nJanice: Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember\nChandler.\nChandler: Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the\nunwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?\nJanice: It’s you. This is yours.\nChandler: What?!\nJanice: (laughs) Look how nervous he gets! We haven’t slept together in\nyears! (Laughs again.)\nChandler: That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?\n[Scene: Room 816, Phoebe is making her move on Cliff.]\nPhoebe: Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you\nrather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?\nCliff: I’d have to say…the talking gorilla, because at least I can\nexplain to him that you’re making me eat him.\nPhoebe: Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it?\nI’m sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)\nCliff: No, I’m sorry. It’s just my foot itches like crazy.\nPhoebe: Oh, I’ll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)\nCliff: Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon\nme.\nPhoebe: Relax, it’s not like we’re forking.\n[Scene: The Semi-Private Labor Room, Janice is being moved to the delivery room and is\nscreaming in pain.]\nRachel: Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have\nhad no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?\nRoss: Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home\nfor her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.\nRachel: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another\ncontraction as Dr. Long enters.)\nDr. Long: Twenty-one hours, you’re a hero.\nRachel: Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you\ngotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.\nDr. Long: Actually, I think you’re ready to go to the delivery room.\nRachel: What?\nDr. Long: Ten centimeters, you’re about to become a mom.\nRachel: My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!\n[Scene: Room 816, Phoebe and Cliff are eating some pudding with spoons.]\nCliff: Is this the same spoon that was in my cast? (Smells it.)\nPhoebe: Y’know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as\nCliff sees something on TV.)\nCliff: Oh my God! That’s the doctor who was in my room before!\nPhoebe: Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.\nCliff: I’m telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking\nme all these weird questions!\nPhoebe: Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in\nyour room?\nJoey: (entering) Rachel’s having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks at\nhim.) Which is of no interest to me, I’m a neurologist.\nCliff: That-that’s him! You know him?\nPhoebe: Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in\nhere to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot\nbetter than I’m coming off right now.\nCliff: I don’t believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake\ndoctor?\nJoey: Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)\nCliff: And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.\nPhoebe: You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.\nIt’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?\nCliff: I don’t think so.\nJoey: Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff\nabout you, right?

Her-her twin sister used to do porn!\nPhoebe: Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy.\nJoey: Right!\nPhoebe: Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it\nwould be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between\nus.

(Hands her back to Rachel.)\nChandler: So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?\nPhoebe: Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was\nso original!\nRoss: Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.\nRachel: Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you just\npick one and that’ll be it.\nRoss: Wow! Umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella. (Rachel starts\ncrying.) What?\nRachel: That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel\nlike an Isabella.\nChandler: So then I guess Ferdinad is out.\nJoey: What was the other one Ross?\nRoss: Umm, Delilah.\nRachel: Oh great!

Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his\nfuture bride.\nRachel: Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your\nbreath away doesn’t he?\nJanice: He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?\nRachel: Oh, I’m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)\nJanice: Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her\nall alone.\nRachel: Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.\nJanice: Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets\nmarried?\nRachel: Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!\nJanice: I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re\ngonna be there until they start their real family.\nRachel: Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.\nJanice: Oh well that’s what I thought about my first husband, now I’m\nlucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New\nBoobs.\nRachel: Really?\nJanice: I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two (Her and Emma) are on\nyour own.\nRachel: Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve\nbeen alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what?\nI-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been\nhappening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this\nkiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.\nRoss: (entering) Hey Janice!\nJanice: Oh hi!\nRoss: Who’s this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)\nJanice: Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.\nRoss: No-no. No.\nJanice: I’m gonna leave the three of you alone.\nRoss: Okay.\nJanice: Bye. (Exits.)\nRoss: Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?\nRachel: Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Y’know\nwhat I was, I was thinking about?\nRoss: Huh?\nRachel: Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something\nhuh?\nRoss: Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we\ncan’t let that happen again, y’know?\nRachel: (pause) Right.\nRoss: I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?\nRachel: No! No, of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up. (Pause) They\ndidn’t have any sodas?\nRoss: Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.\nRachel: That’s all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.\n[Scene: Outside the Nursery, Ross is looking at Emma as Phoebe walks up.]\nPhoebe: Is she in there?\nRoss: Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her.

She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.\n(Pause)\nPhoebe: I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together\nagain? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place.\nWhich would be fine, except you totally are.\nRoss: It’s…it’s complicated okay?\nPhoebe: Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a\nchild together. There is no right answer.\nRoss: Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together,\nand then apart, and now we have a baby. (Pause) It’s just if-if we got together again\nand it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking\neverything—(Starts to cry.) Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in\nthe water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing\nreally well right now.\nPhoebe: I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might\nwreck it.\nRoss: Yeah, exactly.\nPhoebe: Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you\nwere fifteen.\n[Scene: The Delivery Room, Rachel is in bed as Joey enters.]\nJoey: Hey.
