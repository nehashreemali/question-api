  "transcript": "The One Where Rachel Quits\nWritten by: Michael Curtis and Gregory S. Malins\nTranscribed by: Eric Aasen\n[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]\nChandler: (reading the comics) Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.\nRachel: What?\nChandler: Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still\nbe allowed to fly this thing?\nGunther: Rachel?\nRachel: Yeah.\nGunther: Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks\ngetting trained by another waitress?\nRachel: Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?\nGunther: (laughs) Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training\nagain, whenever.\nRachel: (to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?\nChandler: (thinks about it) Yeah?\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: The hallway of Ross’s building, there is a Brown Bird girl selling\ncookies, as Ross and Chandler come up the stairs.]\nSarah: So that’s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown\nBirds of America, I salute you. (Does the Brown Bird salute, she blows on a bird call,\nthen holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a bird\nflapping it’s wings.)\nRoss: Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.\nChandler: Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.\nRoss: Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.\nChandler: I was shrieking... like a Marine.\n(they both start up the stairs.)\nRoss: All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship\nplay. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a\nbackswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both\nwatch in horror.)\n[Scene: Central Perk, the gang’s all there discussing the incident.]\nMonica: You broke a little girl’s leg?!!\nRoss: I know. I feel horrible. Okay.\nChandler: (reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame\nStreet last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?\nRoss: Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do\nyou think she’ll like?\nMonica: Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...\n(Rachel starts to laugh, and Ross notices her.)\nRachel: I’m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)\nRoss: All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)\nChandler: Look out kids, he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his\nhead down in shame.)\nJoey: And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.\nPhoebe: Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that\nnow.\nJoey: What? Me having a job?\nPhoebe: No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and\ntheir, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,\nhow do you sleep at night?\nJoey: Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,\nPhoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their\nfulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.\nPhoebe: Really?\n(Phoebe turns and looks at Monica, while Joey frantically motions to Chandler to help\nhim out.)\nChandler: Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of\nthem, it’s the only chance to see New York.\n[cut to Gunther retraining Rachel.]\nGunther: ...and after you’ve delivered the drinks, you take the empty\ntray....\nRachel: Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half\nyears, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)\nGunther: What if you put them here. (sets the empty tray on another stack of\nempty trays on the back counter.)\nRachel: Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that\nway they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses\ndo that too.\nGunther: They already do. That’s why they call it the ‘tray\nspot.’\nRachel: Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it\nwas a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)\nGunther: It’s all right. Sweetheart.\n[Scene: Sarah’s bedroom, her room is decorated with a space motif.]\nRoss: So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that\nyou get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those\ncookies anymore.\nSarah: Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most\nwins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.\nRoss: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?\nSarah: Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments,\nas I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the Taj\nMahal.\nRoss: I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the\nway to India.\nSarah: No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’s\ngonna double the college money my Grandma left me.\nRoss: Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to\nsell in order to win?\nSarah: The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.\nRoss: Yeah.\nSarah: So far, I’ve sold seventy-five.\nRoss: Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his\nwallet) How much are the boxes?\nSarah: Five dollars a box.\nRoss: (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?\nSarah: A ten speed bike. But, I’d rather have something my Dad\ncouldn’t sell.\nRoss: Well, that makes sense.\nSarah: Could you do me one favor, if it’s not too much trouble?\nRoss: Yeah, Sarah, anything.\nSarah: Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space\nshuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don’t have a TV, the lady across the\nalley said she’d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.\n[Scene: A hallway, Ross is selling Brown Bird cookies for Sarah, he stops and knocks on\na door.]\nWoman: (looking through her peephole, we see Ross standing in the hallway.)\nYesss?\nRoss: Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.\nWoman: You’re no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.\nRoss: No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird\nsalute.)\nWoman: What does that mean?\nRoss: Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to\nsleep-overs.\nWoman: I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!\nRoss: No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go\nto Spacecamp more than anything in the world.\nWoman: I’m pressing, a policeman is on his way.\nRoss: Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock\non another door.)\nWoman: I can still see you!\nRoss: All right!!\n[Scene: Joey’s work, selling Christmas trees.]\nPhoebe: (walking up to Joey) Hey.\nJoey: Hey. What, what are you doing here?\nPhoebe: Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,\nall right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...\nJoey: Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....\nPhoebe: Destiny.\nJoey: Sure.\nPhoebe: Yes.\nJoey: All right.\nPhoebe: Okay. (One of Joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!\nThat one doesn’t look very fulfilled.\nJoey: Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just\ntaking it to the back.\nPhoebe: You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.\nJoey: Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.\nPhoebe: So, what happens to the old guys?\nJoey: Well, they go into the chipper.\nPhoebe: Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey\npoints out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play\nin the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against\nJoey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)\nJoey: (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the ‘cut\nit’ motion with his hands)\n[Scene: Central Perk, all except Phoebe are there, Ross is telling the gang, minus\nRachel who’s still being retrained, about the different cookie options.]\nRoss: ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters,\nSanta, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.\nJoey: All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.\nRoss: Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to\nSpacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?\nChandler: Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?\nRoss: No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you\nwhat, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.\n(Chandler mouths ‘Okay.’)\nRoss: Mon?\nMonica: All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and\nthat’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross)\nRemember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?\nRoss: Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because\nyou ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why\ndon’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the\nRudolph’s.\nMonica: No.\nRoss: Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.\nMonica: Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.\nRoss: I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.\nMonica: (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)\nRoss: Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! (chases after her.)\n[cut to Gunther retraining Rachel.]\nGunther: And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t\njust trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.\nRachel: (sitting down next to Chandler) I’m training to be better at a job\nthat I hate, my life officially sucks.\nJoey: Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you\nwanted to do fashion stuff?\nRachel: Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that.\nChandler: How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out\nresumes like what, two years ago?\nRachel: Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.\nJoey: If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing\npushing you to get another one. You need the fear.\nRachel: The fear?\nChandler: He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go\nafter a job you really want.\nRachel: Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why\ndon’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?\n(Chandler and Joey both laugh)\nChandler: Because, I’m too afraid.\nRachel: I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,\ny'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.\nChandler: Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still\nworking here.\nGunther: Rachel?\nRachel: Yeah.\nGunther: Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.\nRachel: Can’t I just look at the handles on them?\nGunther: You would think.\nRachel: Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know\nwhy I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I\ndon’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the\ntray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think\nI should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.\nGunther: What?!\nRachel: Gunther, I quit.\nChandler: (to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for\ncoffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is entering numbers on a calculator as Ross reads\noff how much he’s sold.]\nRoss: ....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?\nChandler: I spelled out boobies.\nMonica: (comes up and starts looking through Ross’s cookie supply) Ross,\nbut me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint\ntreasures?\nRoss: Ah, we’re out. I sold them all.\nMonica: What?\nRoss: Monica, I’m cutting you off.\nMonica: No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big\ndeal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!\nRoss: Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.\nMonica: (covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)\nChandler: So, how many have you sold so far?\nRoss: Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!\nChandler: Oh my God, how did you do that?\nRoss: Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser\nFloyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!\nThat’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I\nah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They\ncall me: 'Cookie Dude!'\nRachel: (entering) Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers,\nI need stamp lickers.....\nRoss: Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?\nChandler: Me! On my computer.\nRoss: Well you sure used a large font.\nChandler: Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad\nco-captain only took up so much room.\nRachel: Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy!\nYou wanna know what else is really funny?!\nChandler: Something else I might have said?\nRachel: I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told\nme to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!\nRoss: Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.\nRachel: No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I\ndon’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call\nGunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting.\nChandler: You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.\nRachel: You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and\nyour fear....\nJoey: (entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!\nChandler: Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)\nJoey: What?

(points to the almost dead\ntree she has)\nGuy: It’s-it’s-it’s almost dead!\nPhoebe: Okay but that’s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it’s\nChristmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey\nJoey: Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny are\nthrown in the chipper.\nGuy: I-I think I’m gonna look around a little bit more.\nJoey: Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.\nMonica: (entering) Hey, guys.

Presenting Sarah\nTuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump\nup, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in\ntinfoil.)\nSarah: Really Mr. Geller, you don’t have to do this.\nRoss: Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by\nfor mission countdown!\nJoey: (simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine....,\neight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!\n(They start shaking the chair likes it’s flying into outer space. Ross picks up a\nsoccer ball and starts spinning it in his hand and runs around the chair beeping like a\nsatellite. Chandler also starts running around the chair and saying...)\nChandler: I’m an alien. I’m an alien.\nRoss: Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey’s\nhead.)\n(The camera zooms in on Sarah and she has a big smile on her face.)\nEnd",
