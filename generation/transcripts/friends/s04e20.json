What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to\nhandle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua.\nY’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!\nChandler: What?\nRachel: Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I\nmean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year?

I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re\ndancing at there’s.\nChandler: Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings.\nRachel: Why not?\nChandler: Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I\nlook like this… (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly.

Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place\nthat her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so… I mean, I-I\nknow it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t\nknow, this just feels right. Y’know?\nJoey: (still looking in date book) Hey! That’s the day after I stop\nmenstruating! (They all look at him.) This isn’t mine.\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is waiting impatiently for Joshua.]\nJoshua: (entering) Hey, Rachel.\nRachel: Hi!\nJoshua: What’s up?

(Gunther is listening in.)\nRachel: Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like,\n\"Whoa! Can we do this?\" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right!\nDon’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?\nJoshua: Wow!

(Finally realises) Oh\nmy God. We’re really sad, aren’t we?\nPhoebe: Yeah, I think we are.\nMonica: This isn’t even my dress.\nPhoebe: Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called,\n\"It’s Not Too Late.\"\nMonica: I’m changing out of this.\nPhoebe: Me too.\nMonica: In like a half-hour?\nPhoebe: Me too.\nMonica: Okay, throw it straight this time.\nPhoebe: Okay.\n(She throws it straight, and Monica makes a big deal about catching it.)\nMonica: I’m getting married next!!\nPhoebe: Yay!\n[Scene: Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe, back to reality, are sitting in normal\nclothes.]\nPhoebe: I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I\nknow that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.\nMonica: Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start\nfeeling silly?\nPhoebe: I guess.\n(Monica crosses her legs and is still wearing the garter belt.)\nPhoebe: Oh my God!\nMonica: Oh God.\nPhoebe: Oh, you’re such a cheater!\nChandler: (entering) Hello! Little ones.\nMonica: Hey!\nPhoebe: Hey!\nMonica: So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?\nChandler: Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They’re\nstunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.\nPhoebe: Oh, how’d that happen?\nChandler: Because I’m cooler.\nMonica: No, seriously.\nChandler: Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.\n(Joey enters, wearing a mouth guard like boxers wear.)\nJoey: (muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What’s happening?\nMonica: Oh my God!\nPhoebe: What is that?\nJoey: (muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna\nhelp me not to snore.\nMonica: Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you\nhave to wear it unless you are!\nJoey: (takes out the mouth guard) I know I don’t have too! It tastes good.\n(Puts it back in.)\nChandler: Plus, you look cool.\n(Joey totally agrees with this statement and kicks his feet up.)\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is putting away the wedding dress, finally.]\nRachel: (entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua…\nPhoebe: Oh, how did it go?\nRachel: Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl\nwho is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.\nPhoebe: What did he say?\nRachel: Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I\nfeel blue.\nMonica: Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that\nhe’s gonna call you again.\nRachel: Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think\nhe’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally\nokay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling\nit all that well.\nPhoebe: Yeah, maybe.\nRachel: And I-I am just trying to figure out why.\nPhoebe: Any luck?\nRachel: Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on\nagain, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on\nagain.\nMonica: Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.\nRoss: (entering) Hey!\nMonica: Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily’s wedding dress into\nRachel’s room.)\nRoss: So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,\nErnie’s at 9 o’clock?\nRachel: Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.\nRoss: Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.\nRachel: Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.\nRoss: What happened?\nRachel: Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.\nRoss: Noo. Why?\nRachel: Well, apparently he scares easy.\nRoss: Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry.\nRachel: It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d\nthought they would.\nRoss: Come here.\n(They hug.)\nRachel: (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Yeah.\nRoss: You okay?\nRachel: Yeah! I got my girls.\n(He leaves.)\nRachel: Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.)\nPhoebe: (looks at Monica) Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?\nRachel: What?\n[Time lapse, all three girls are now wearing wedding dresses, eating popcorn, drinking\nbeer, and watching TV.]\nRachel: Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.\nMonica: Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)\nMaybe someday, there will be.\n(There’s a knock on the door.)\nMonica: Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big\ndate!\nRachel: Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)\nMonica: No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!\nPhoebe: No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!\nRachel: I’m not gonna marry Chandler!\nPhoebe: Not after this!\nRachel: Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she\ndoes, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the\ndoor.)\nJoshua: I gotta go.\nRachel: Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that\noughta do it.\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Chandler’s bedroom, he is sleeping with Marjorie. All of the sudden,\nMarjorie starts talking in her sleep, awakening Chandler. After a little bit, she quiets\nback down, and Chandler tries to get back to sleep. There’s a short pause until she\nstarts screaming, causing Chandler to scream with her. She quickly calms down. This all\nwakes up Joey, who comes over wearing the mouth guard, opens the top half of\nChandler’s door, and starts to complain about the noise.]\nJoey: (muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to\nsay, \"What’s up with that?\")\nEnd",
