I'm comin' in!\n(Monica quickly dives under the water as Joey enters. He looks a little shocked at what\nChandler's doing.)\nChandler: I've had a very long, hard day.\nJoey: Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?\nChandler: Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.\nJoey: Okay.\n(Joey turns to leave but stops at the door.)\nJoey: You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?\nChandler: For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!\nJoey: All right!\n(Joey leaves and Monica comes up for air.)\nChandler: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about\nchicken.\nMonica: Chicken? I could eat some chicken.\nChandler: Hey Joe!\n(Monica goes back underwater as Joey re-enters.)\nChandler: Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a\nCoke-(Yelps in\npain as Monica grabs him underwater)-Diet Coke.\n(Joey gives him a thumbs up and heads for the chicken.)\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are eating breakfast.]\nPhoebe: (entering) Hey!\nChandler: Hey, Pheebs!\nJoey: Mornin' Pheebs!\nPhoebe: I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this\ndriver…\nJoey: (interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)\nPhoebe: What?\nJoey: Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.\nPhoebe: Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway…\nMonica: Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?\nChandler: Uh, The Wheatsheaf.\nJoey: Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh…\nMonica: Bodington's!\nAll: Bodington's! Woohoo! (And they all high-five each other.)\nChandler: Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.\nPhoebe: Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—I don't want to talk about it.\nRoss: (entering) Hey!\nAll: Hey!\nJoey: Hey, Ross, Bodington's!\nRoss: Yeah! (They high-five.)\nJoey: That was good beer.\nRoss: Ohh…\nJoey: Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad\nboys.\nRoss: Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.\nJoey: Later! (Exits.)\nRoss: Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?\nMonica: Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch)\nshe should be here by now.\nRoss: Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?\nMonica: No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.\nRoss: Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the\nairport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife!\nRachel is my wife! Y'know—Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?\nPhoebe: So you still hadn't heard from Emily?\nRoss: No, not since I lost her at the airport.\nChandler: I can't believe she can out run you man!\nRoss: HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's\noutburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat\nme? Let's go! Outside!!\nRachel: (entering) Hi!\nAll: Hey! (They all go hug her, except for Ross.)\nRoss: Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.\nRachel: Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.\nRoss: That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.\nRachel: Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met\nthe nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)\nRoss: So, what? That's it?\nRachel: Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.\nRoss: Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)\nRachel: Oh no, you're the best.\nRoss: (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the\ndoor.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem,\nred roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That\noughta get her talking to me again.\nChandler: Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.\n(Ross bangs his fists together to tell Chandler off, like what was learned last season.\nRead about it here.)\nMonica: Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!\nRachel: What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I\ncouldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up\nto me all the time going, \"Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?\" I mean, it was\nsooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why,\nbecause I make very bad decisions.\nChandler: Oh that's not true.\nRachel: Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.\nPhoebe: London is stupid! Stupid!\nRachel: Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now\non you make all of my decisions for me.\nPhoebe: Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having\nthat kind of power and control over someone's life.\nMonica: I'll do it!\nRachel: That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.\nChandler: Okay, I gotta go to work.\n(He gets up and gives Monica a rather passionate kiss as Rachel and Phoebe look on in\namazement. After the kiss ends, Chandler suddenly realizes what he just did, so he decides\nto do something rather rash.)\nChandler: And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.\n(He goes over and gives Rachel the same treatment he gave Monica, only Rachel is\nshocked.)\nChandler: Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always\na pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)\n[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Chandler and Joey are there looking at pictures\nfrom the trip to London.]\nMonica: Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you\nat the reception.\nRachel: Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't—I still can't believe\nit. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)\nMonica: Honey, sweetie, by the edges.\nRachel: I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of\nthe pictures)…\nMonica: Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)\nRachel: …I mean it's my fault.\nMonica: Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!\nRachel: Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)\nMonica: Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I\nknow that wasn't about me.\nJoey: (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.\nMonica: If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice\nthat there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to\nlisten in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.\nRachel: Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…\nMonica: (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at\nanother guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at\nthe counter that time.\nRachel: Oh, I don't know. I don't know.\nMonica: You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your\ndecisions and I say you're going to talk to him.\nRachel: All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.\nJoey: Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)\nPhoebe: (entering) Hey!\nRachel: Hey!\nJoey: Hey, Pheebs!\nMonica: We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us\nat the Tower of London.\nPhoebe: (Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and\nJoey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't\nwatch.)\nChandler: All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much\nhaven't we?\nPhoebe: No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever\nget to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.\nAll: Sorry.\n(Rachel returns.)\nMonica: What happened?\nRachel: Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date\ntomorrow night.\nMonica: See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!\nRachel: Well…\n(Gunther goes up to the guy and holds a sign that reads, \"We reserve the right to\nrefuse service to anyone.\")\nGunther: (To the guy) Get out!\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters to find Monica waiting patiently for him.\nHe closes the door and they start kissing.]\nMonica: What took you so long?\nChandler: I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.\nMonica: Oh, good.\n(They start kissing and turn around so that Chandler is facing the door. And Chandler\nsees Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey walk in and quickly ends the kiss with Monica.)\nChandler: So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses\nher.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her\nand kisses her.)\nJoey: (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!\nMonica: Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.\nRachel: That's not European!\nPhoebe: Well, it felt French.\n(Joey is intrigued.)\n[Scene: The hallway between the apartments, Rachel is returning from her date with\nDave.]\nRachel: Oh God, I really had a good time!\nDave: Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it.\nRachel: Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?\nDave: Yeah!\nRachel: Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this.\nUmm, okay, just hold on a second.\nDave: Okay, yeah!\n(She enters the apartment, leaving Dave in the hallway, to find Ross sitting on the\ncouch with a big box.)\nRachel: Umm, hi!\nRoss: Hi.\nRachel: Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.\nRoss: She's doing her laundry.\nRachel: What's that? (Points to the box.)\nRoss: It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for\neach day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!\nRachel: Oh, honey that's awful.\nRoss: Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go\nwander out in the rain for a while.\nRachel: But, it's not raining.\nRoss: I can't catch a break!\nRachel: Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right\nhere. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All\nright? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!\nDave: Yeah?\nRachel: Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just\nreally sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know\nthings seem so bad right now.\nMonica: (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped\nsome socks.\nRachel: Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the\ndropped socks.)\nMonica: What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you\nwant to fall into the trap?!\nRachel: Ohh! You did not drop any socks!\nMonica: I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you\nlisten to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What\nthe hell were you trying to do?\nRachel: Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know,\nthat I'm still in love with him.\nMonica: (Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!\nRachel: Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!\nMonica: I make the decisions, and I say no.\nRachel: Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what,\nyou're fired.\nMonica: You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say,\n\"I'm not fired!\" Ha!\nRachel: Well… (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and\nthrows it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the\ndoor. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)\nMonica: Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!\nJoey: (Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?\nMonica: Rachel locked the door.\nJoey: I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.\nCommercial Break\n[Scene: The hallway, continued from earlier. Monica is still locked out.]\nMonica: Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!\n[Cut to inside the apartment, Ross decides to let Monica in and goes over and opens the\ndoor in mid-pound.]\nMonica: Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?\nRachel: No.\nMonica: I really need to talk to you.\nRachel: Well, then talk!\nMonica: Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted\nto do?\nRachel: Yes!\nRoss: What thing?\nMonica: Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a\nreally stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows\nwho she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.\nRoss: Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I\ngotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My\nGod, think of the massacre.\nRachel: I'm gonna do it.\nMonica: All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you\ntell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.\nBecause I bet you, you can't.\nRachel: But I…\nMonica: Please!\nRachel: All right, fine.\n(There's a loud bang on the door.)\nMonica: Joey, I'm in!\nJoey: (In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.\n[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there as Phoebe enters.]\nAll: Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!\nJoey: Uh, okay, Pheebs?\nPhoebe: Yeah?\nJoey: Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to\ngo to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?\nPhoebe: Yeah?\nJoey: All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all\ntake a little trip together!\nPhoebe: Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!\nMonica: Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central\nPark!\nPhoebe: (excited) Central…(not so excited) Park!\nJoey: Yeah, all of us! All day!\nPhoebe: That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we\ngonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? \"Well, it's right by my house, all\nright!\"\nChandler: Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park\nidea. (Gets up to leave.)\nRachel: (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr.\nKissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European\nthing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable\nand I just—y'know—stop it!\nChandler: I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.\nPhoebe: That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.\nMonica: Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)\n[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, and Joey are there as Ross enters with\nPhoebe.]\nRoss: Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!\nJoey: Phoebe!\nChandler: Hey, Pheebs!\nRachel: Phoebe, woo!\nPhoebe: Okay, woo! Hi.\nChandler: Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, it\ndidn't have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we\nwould all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!\nPhoebe: Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?\nJoey: Mine!\nRoss: Wait! It was my plan.\nJoey: Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.\nRoss: And, I came up with Atlantic City.\nJoey: Which, is the new plan!\nMonica: Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?\nPhoebe: Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!\n(They all go pack except for Ross.)\nMonica: Come on Rach, let's go.\nRachel: Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.\nMonica: No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.\nRachel: Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.\nMonica: Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone\nthat you love them and not have them say it back?\nRachel: Yeah, I-I don't care.\nMonica: Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)\nRachel: What 'cha readin'?\nRoss: The paper.\nRachel: Yeah, what's it about?\nRoss: Events from around the globe.\nRachel: Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to\ntalk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're\nwrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.\nRoss: Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…\nRachel: Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Go ahead.\nRachel: Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say\nit. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross.\n(Ross is stunned.)\nRoss: Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.\n(Rachel starts laughing hysterically.)\nRoss: What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.\nRachel: (Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.\nRoss: Why are you laughing?\nRachel: Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's\nridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and\nit's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know?\nAnd, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like,\n\"You are such an idiot!\"\nRoss: Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife\nsince the wedding.\nRachel: (laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny.\nRoss: Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where\nmy wife is. (Laughs) \"Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?\" Don't know!\nRachel: Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you\njust forget that I told you this?\nRoss: Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…\nRachel: The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.\nRoss: That is what the thing is.\nRachel: Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that\njust the stupidest thing, me telling you that?\nRoss: No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always\ngreat when someone tells you they love you.\nRachel: That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)\nRoss: No thank you for… Thank you.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is about ready to leave for Atlantic City.]\nRoss: Okay, let's go!\nChandler: Atlantic City!\nPhoebe: Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for\nrolling bones!\n(They high-five and howl, but Phoebe suddenly stops and the guys gasp and retreat in\nshock.)\nJoey: Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?\nMonica: Oh my God! You're water broke!\nThe Guys: Ohh!\nPhoebe: All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)\nAll: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!\nChandler: Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!\nRoss: Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.\nRachel: High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)\nPhoebe: Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)\nEnding Credits\n[Scene: The hallway between the apartments, they are taking Phoebe to the hospital but\nChandler and Monica hold back.]\nMonica: I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!\nChandler: I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.\n(They both kiss.)\nChandler: Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel\nevery time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.\nMonica: Do you know anything about women?\nChandler: No.\nMonica: That's all right.\nChandler: Okay.
