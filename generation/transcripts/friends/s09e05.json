Chandler is chairing a group of\neight people.]\nChandler: Good morning everyone, it�s nice to see our team together\nfor the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions?\n(colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?\nKen: That�s right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa\nis that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you\nwere saying yes to?\nChandler: (laughs) Well, don�t believe everything you hear, Ken. (both\nturning away to files) But yeah, that�s true. Alright, let�s get started, by\ntake a look at last quarter�s figures.

Not right?\nClaudia: Yes, in Oklahoma it�s legal to smoke in offices with fifteen\npeople or less. (passing the pack) Would you like one?\nChandler: Alright, lo�look. I don�t smoke anymore. But if the rest of\nyou want to light up, go ahead, it�s fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke\nthen? That�s almost rude, that I�m not.\nKen: That�s not true. If you don�t wanna smoke �\nChandler: (loud) Ken, please! No, I can�t, I can�t smoke. If I smoke,\nmy wife would kill me.\nKen: I�m sorry, but isn�t your wife back in New York?\nChandler: I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cigarette)\n[Scene: The Bings�.

(being sat down)\nOoh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn�t it? How d�you get a bigger table?\nYou-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo,\nI suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.\nChandler: I suppose that Monica will have the � manipulative\nshrew.\nWaiter: I�ll give you another minute.\nJoey: Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after\nthe waiter)\nRoss: Rach, c�mon, Emma is fine. You�re turning into an obsessive\nmother.

(everybody scared) I�m sorry, was that rude?\nDi-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this\nevening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was\nhave dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you\ndidn�t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well, it�s too late\nnow.\nRoss: Well, ??? think that�s us?\nPhoebe: well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone)\nHello?\nJoey: (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you\ntwo?\nMonica: Uch, you see, I�m ovulating.\nChandler: Oh yeah, that�s what she says. But maybe you�re not\novulating at all, maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.\nMonica: Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can�t get enough.\nChandler: (to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked\nme into having sex with her.\nJoey: So? Did have sex, right?\nChandler: What�s the matter with me? Why I�m such a girl?\nPhoebe: (returns) Okay, that was Mike.\nRachel: Phoebe, hi, we�re so sorry. You�re totally right.

Do you want to give it\nanother try?\nChandler: So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?\nJoey: Do, do you gonna do it now?\nMonica: We don�t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct\n�\nJoey: No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)\nMaitre D�: I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.\nJoey: Nah, just me. All alone. (all the food is served) Dinner for six\nfor one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: continues, Joey finished everything.]\nWaiter: How was everything, sir?\nJoey: Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.\nWaiter: Well, I hope, you got some room left.\nWaiters: (with birthday cake, singing) Happy birthday to you, happy\nbirthday to you, happy birthday dear �\nJoey: Joey!
