  "transcript": "At a hospital, the treatment is to lie in a bed. Whatever's wrong with a human being, lie down. Doctor never says, \"Well, your condition isn't as bad as we thought. We want you to kind of lean against a doorjamb for seven to 1 0 days. See how that feels.\" Always a bed. Unless you go to the emergency room then it's a chair. You've been shot, stabbed, run over: \"Have a seat.\" There's always an interesting cultural, ethnic mix to the hospital staff. It's like a local news team in there. The doctor's the anchorman. He's got white hair, he's in charge. The nurse is the feature reporter, you know. You listen to her, but it's always, \"And now, back to your doctor.\" The orderlies come in with food and bedpans. That's like your sports and weather. Then the baby's head comes out, and I'm screaming. My brother, who's videotaping, turns green. His eyes roll up in his head, and he blacks out. He drops the camera, the camera breaks. And then the placenta comes flying out. -And then a doctor says-- -Hey, thanks. That's enough. Will you look at that kid. Sucking away like there's no tomorrow. Suck, suck, suck. Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Look at that, Jerry, look at that. -Yeah, I looked. I saw it. -Does this make you uncomfortable? -No, no. Uncomfortable? Not at all. My friend's wife's breasts are out. Why would I be uncomfortable? Look at him. -So how long do they do this? -Year or two. No break? -After that comes the weaning. -After sucking comes weaning? -First sucking, then weaning. -You gotta wean. -Gotta wean. -Must wean. -What about that spot I got, huh? -Yeah. I saw the spot. You open the door to the car you walk right into the hospital. You can't beat that spot. I am on a roll. Yeah. I'm just willing these great parking spots. George. Maybe the baby would like to see the spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with, huh? You can still get a great spot in this city if you apply yourself. Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here? -Did you give him the room number? -Yeah, 1 39 7. Excuse me. Do you know where the elevator is? Yeah, it's right around the corner there. 1 93 7. Oh, God! It's a pig-man. A pig-man! So anyway, Jerry, Elaine, we have something we wanna ask you. You gotta look. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant -from the car in front and behind. -Would you shut up, George? I'm taking a cab home. I can't take this anymore. You were saying, Stan. I'm sorry about this. Myra and I would like you and Elaine to be the godparents of Steven. -Me? A godfather? -Yes. Never go against the family, Elaine. What? Hey, I just saw a pig-man. A pig-man. He was sleeping, and then he woke up and he looked at me and he made this horrible sound, this: Kramer, what are you talking about? I'm talking about a pig-man. I walked in the wrong room, and there he was. -A pig-man? -A pig-man. Half pig, half man. That's great, Kramer. Anyway, tell us what's involved in being a godparent. Elaine, never ask me about my business. Godfather? The most important thing is you help with the bris. -The bris? -A bris? -You mean, circumcision? -Yeah. I would advise against that. Kramer, it's a tradition. So was sacrificing virgins to appease the gods -but we don't do that anymore. -Well, maybe we should. Hey why are all those people milling around my car? -I don't know. -Maybe they're admiring your spot. -They're looking up. -Hey, there's a guy up on the roof. That's the guy I told where the elevator was. Oh, God, I hope he doesn't jump-- Oh, my God! My car! My car! A mohel? What the hell is a mohel? A mohel is the person that performs a circumcision. Well, where am I gonna find a mohel? Motels, models. How do you find a mohel? Finding a mohel's easy. Any idiot can find a mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that? Hey, Jerry, you ever seen one? -Oh, you mean, that wasn't? -Yeah. -No, you? -Yeah. What'd you think? It had no face, no personality. It was like a Martian. -But, hey, you know, that's me. -Hey. Well, I got the estimate. It'll cost more to repair the roof than the car is worth. I'm going over and seeing that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this, and it's not gonna be me! -Oh, you're screwed. -I know. Swan dives from 20 floors up, lands right on top. What, do I got a bull's-eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet, huh? Land on the sidewalk, it's city property. Well, I have to interview a mohel. How about our little Elaine, huh? Attended the finest schools on the eastern seaboard equestrian competitions, debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing mohels. Yeah! -What's the matter? -You all right? Don't ever question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. -Look at that. Look, look. -What now? \"Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research. Government funds genetic research at area hospital.\" Yeah, so? Pig-man, baby, pig-man. If I have to hear about this pig-man one more time-- Hey, I'm telling you, the pig-man is alive. The government's been experimenting with pig-men since the '50s. Just because the hospital's conducting DNA research doesn't mean they're creating mutant pig-men. Jerry, will you wake up to reality? It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors. I'll tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. Get a few pig-men walking around, suddenly I'm looking a lot better. If someone wanted to fix me up, they could say, \"At least he's no pig-man.\" Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity, there's always some group attracted to it. \"That little tail really turns me on.\" That's just about enough. -This doesn't interest you? -Oh, no, it's fascinating but could you do me a favor? Could you tape the rest of the \"pig-men and the women who love them\" discussion? And I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I gotta go find a mohel. You know, you should call that off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual. Perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free, it will be stopped, Kramer. Until then, off with their heads. -Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene? -It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable. Yeah. So how does that help me? -George, you ever see one? -Yeah, my roommate in college. Yeah, what'd you think? I got used to it. All right, I wanna see the pig-man. Show me the pig-man. Don't worry, I'll show you. And you'll never be the same. Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this: A lot of people have a nose like this. They're not necessarily pig-men. Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished oink of pig-man cries out for help. Yeah, well, if I hear an anguished oink, I'm out of here. I don't see any pig-men. I see human, human, human. -Wait a second. -What? Oh, it's George. The administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you at the car. Wait, George. You got room in the car for the pig-man, huh? The pig-man can take the bus. George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride. How do you know? What if the pig-man had a two-seater? Be realistic, George. I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. -I'll see you later. -Yeah. -Mr. Costanza, come in, come in. -Thank you. It's been a very trying couple of days around the hospital. Doctors, patients, everyone just grief-stricken over this unfortunate occurrence. Well, I join them in their grief. Horrible thing. Flew right past the children's wing. All the sick children in the playroom, looking out the window just traumatized by the incident. Apparently they thought he was flying. You know how children are. \"Oh, look, a man is flying. A man is flying!\" And then splat. That's where I come in. On \"splat.\" You see, Mrs. Sweedler-- Or is it Hospital Administrator Sweedler? -Mrs. Sweedler is fine. -Mrs. Sweedler. Thank you very much. You see, this tragedy has affected me in a very. A very personal way. -How is that? -Yes, well, you see the deceased landed on my car. The splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now, of course, I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible, this whole tragedy might have been averted. But I've never really been the kind of guy to buy a convertible what with the baldness and everything. Well, I have known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat. Yes, but then everything's all pulled down, and it's-- Anyway. The damage, unfortunately has marred an otherwise fine automobile rendering it virtually undrivable. Yes, well, that is a shame. Yes. A shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now, Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity and taking in the whole scope of the situation I just can't help but think that the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other still-living victim of this horrendous, horrendous tragedy. -Mr. Costanza. -Yes. A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise -Yes. -and you greedily, callously want to profit from it? Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. It might be a little high, but. Get out. Get out now. Get out of my office! -Should I just leave--? -Get out! This is it. Wait, excuse me. What happened to the guy that was in there before? -I don't know what you're talking-- -No, you know. He had this: -He was. -No. -He was. -No. This doesn't look familiar to you? This doesn't look familiar to you? -Sir-- -Look, I know what's going on. -Sir-- -Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink. The oink, oink. Yes, if you'll excuse me, I have some patients-- Yes, if you'll excuse me, I have some patients-- Listen, you little quack. Listen, you little quack. There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now, where is he? There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now, where is he? -Where is he?! -Half what? -Where is he?! -Half what? You know what I mean! Pork. Sausage. You know what I mean! Pork. Sausage. \"That's all, folks.\" \"That's all, folks.\" I think he's been released. I think he's been released. Good. Good. -He's lying! -All right, enough of this. -He's lying! -All right, enough of this. -I gotta go find George. -All right, you go ahead. -I gotta go find George. -All right, you go ahead. Kramer. Kramer. -Where's the mohel? -He'll be here. -Where's the mohel? -He'll be here. -He's late already. -Relax. -He's late already. -Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked. You'd think you were getting whacked. I don't know why he asked me to be godfather. I don't know why he asked me to be godfather. We're not close. Because we're on the softball team We're not close. Because we're on the softball team I'm pitcher, he's catcher, he thinks we have a special relationship? I'm pitcher, he's catcher, he thinks we have a special relationship? I thought pitchers and catchers had a special rapport. I thought pitchers and catchers had a special rapport. Maybe in hardball, with all the signals, but I'm just lobbing it in. Maybe in hardball, with all the signals, but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have conferences. We don't have conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.

Compose yourself. This is a bris! We're performing a bris here, not a burlesque show. This is not a school play. This is not a baggy-pants farce. This is a bris! A sacred, ancient ceremony symbolizing the covenant between God and Abraham. Or something. No, don't touch anything. Don't touch a thing. I could have been a kosher butcher like my brother. The money's good. It's got a union with benefits. And cows don't have families. You make a mistake with a cow, you move on with your life. Anyway. -Hurry up, George. Step on it! -All right, all right. That damn mohel! He circumcised my finger. -The mohel circumcised my finger. -You flinched. Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch? Oh, how would he know? He blacked out. He fainted. It was very traumatic. Last thing I remember was you flinching. Then everything went black. Who's got tissues? I need more tissues. Look at this thing. It's my phone finger! -Careful. You're getting blood all over. -What about the baby? The baby's fine. They took him to the hospital as a precaution. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt! Will you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches. A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. Goes against my personality. It's not me. Hey, look at that. Boy, are you lucky! Another great spot in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you, huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that, huh? Come on, give it to me. Give it to me. -I've never seen a mohel like that. -That was a one-in-a-million mohel. -I said I'm sorry. -Look at this. -You'll be okay. I'll see you later, huh? -Where is he going? I'm gonna look for a bathroom. Well, if it isn't Shaky the Mohel. Nice circumcision, but it's not supposed to be a finger. Circumcision was perfect. That was your fault. You flinched! Oh, who made you a mohel? You get your degree from a matchbook? You see? He flinched again. Nice. You picked a hell of a mohel! One more peep, and I'll slice you like a smoked sturgeon. -Oh, don't threaten me, butcher boy. -Butcher boy? Yeah, what was this? What was this? What was this, huh? Careful, Jerry, the mohel's got a knife! Hey, what's going on out here? You should be ashamed of yourself, both of you. -Blood. -Oh, how's the baby? -There's nothing wrong with the baby. -The circumcision went fine. Thank God the flincher didn't harm the baby. I'll get you for this. This is my business, my life! No one ruins it for me, no one! Here's my card. Get out of my way! I can't do it. Look what they did to my boy. They massacred my boy. You really do the worst Godfather I've ever heard. You're not even close. Oh, that's the flicks. It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well, he's about 5 feet tall hairless pink complexion. Looks like a pig. Yeah, all right, thank you. Thank you. Yeah. So any word from the pig-man? -No. -No. And he's not a pig-man, is he? No, he's not. He's just a fat little mental patient. Myra. Stan. -Don't touch him. -What's the matter? You're out, Jerry. Out as godfather. You too, Elaine. You're both out. -But I didn't do any-- -No buts. We've made up our minds. We want Kramer. He showed us how much he cares about Steven. Don't ever go against the family, Jerry. Godfather. -Godfather. -Yes. To me, what's really amazing, that for every job that there is in the world there's someone willing to do it. Someone goes, \"I will stand in the tunnel breathing exhaust watching the cars go by, making sure everything's okay.\" Someone goes, \"I will work behind the elephant with the big shovel.\" Doctors go, \"Yes, I will confine myself to one particularly objectionable part of the human body all day, every day. I will do it.\" I think people that are unemployed are not really unable to find work they're just easily disgusted. \"Yes, I'm starving, and my family has no clothing or shelter but I'm not cleaning that up.\"",
