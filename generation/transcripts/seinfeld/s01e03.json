  "transcript": "So, I move into the center lane. Now, I get ahead of this woman who felt, for some reason, I guess, that she thought that I'd cut her off. So she pulls up alongside of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger, and you show it to the person. It's a finger. What does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers, Someone shows me one of their fingers, and I'm supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it's supposed to work? I mean you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn't you? I would feel worse if I got the toe than if I got the finger, because it's not easy to give someone the toe. You got to get the shoe off, the sock off, and drive, get it up in the Look at that toe, buddy. I mean, that's really insulting, to get the toe, isn't it? That it? I've got the Q-Tips, I've got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. That's it. Done! That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen. I am the master packer. Yeah, right. You're the master packer. What you must understand, Elaine What you must understand, Elaine packing's no different than leading men into battle. You've got to know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon from a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks. Excuse me, master packer? Yes? Just give me your keys. All right, sir. George? Yeah. Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place? Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah. The hot water takes a little while to come on, so the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, and come back, and take a shower. Okay. This is quite a place. There's more. The refrigerator. Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. No meat, no leftovers, no butter, and I cannot overstate this no soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear? I'll eat out. I'll eat out. And one more thing, Benes. Regarding sexual activity strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favor do it in the tub. You ready? Yeah. One second. Hey, Elaine. Hi. You coming to the airport with us? No, I'm staying here for the weekend. I'm getting a break from my roommate. Oh, the actress/waitress. No. The waitress/actress. She just got some part She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now, all day long, she's walking around the apartment singing,  God, I hope I get it   I hope I get it  She's going to get it, right in the Why don't you just kick her out? She's on the lease. George, you have got to find another place for me. Well, a little rough finding something good in your price range Hey, but you, my friend, may be in luck. I'm not looking. No, no, no. This one's different. No, no, no. This one's different. This one's a beauty. What's it like? I haven't seen it yet, but it's a two-bedroom. It's on, uh, the West 83rd, about a half-block from the park. How much? Twice what you're paying here, but it's a great building. It's two bedrooms. Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I've got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. I saw that. You ought to at least take a look at it. Really? Why? Because then I could move in here. Ah Ah. I know what you're saying now. It's time you got out of here anyway. Yeah, tell him, but quickly. I'm double-parked here. Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you can't have soft cheese. And let's not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for 10 years. No human can turn this off. Jerry, come on. You're doing okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldn't have to live like this. Like this? You just said you wanted to live here. Well, for me, it's a step up. Well, for me, it's a step up. It's like moving from Iceland to Finland. Jerry, what do you? Do you want to see the place or not? I can't think about it now. Come on, I'm going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend. Elaine? Elaine? Jerry? Jer Oh, hi. Welcome back.

Yeah, well, I was going to bring the spatula right back. Yeah, and? Well, I got caught up watching a soap opera. Bold and the Beautiful. So the door was wide open. Wide open! Excuse me. And where were you? I was at Bloomingdale's, waiting for the shower to heat up. waiting for the shower to heat up. Look, Jerry, I'm sorry. I'm You have insurance, right, buddy? No. How can you not have insurance? Because I spent my money on the Clapco D-29. It's the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door must be closed! Jerry, I'm going to find your stuff. I'm going to solve it. I'm on the case, buddy. I'm on the case. Yeah, don't investigate. Don't pay me back. It was an accident. I made a mistake. These things happen. I'm human. In your way. Let's see, that's one TV, stereo, one leather jacket, a VCR, and a computer. Is that about it? The answering machine. Answering machine. Boy, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls. What do you mean? What do you mean? It's a joke. I see. Well, Mr. Seinfeld, uh, we'll look into it, and we'll let you know, if we, you know, if we find anything. Do you ever find anything? No. Well, thanks anyway. You bet. I didn't get that joke either. The crook has the machine. The messages aren't for him, he's the crook. Why would he answer? Why would he answer? How did you get in here? I walked in. Your lobby door is broken again. Again? I don't know how you put up with this. Yeah. Tell him, George. You would still want to move in here? Yes. You don't understand. I'm living with Ethel Merman without the talent. Is that, uh other apartment still available? I got ripped off for about the Now, the first couple of times you go through it, it's very upsetting, and your first reaction, or one of your friends will say, \"Call the police. You really should call the police.\" So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, \"Yeah, I'm calling the police \"Stakeouts, manhunts I'm going to see some real action.\" Right? You think that. So, the police come over to your house, So, the police come over to your house, they fill out the report. They give you your copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I don't really think we're going to crack this case, do you? It's not like Batman, where there's three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. \"Did you lose a Sony? \"It could be the Penguin. \"I think we can round him up. \"He's dressed like a penguin. We can find him. He's a penguin.\" Oh Oh.

Now, I'm gonna go over there. I'm gonna borrow some tea. You know, if I don't get back in five minutes, maybe you better call the police. Okay. Starting now! Yeah! Yeah! One of the problems in life is that when you're a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements and those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them'll say, \"I got the front seat.\" \"I wanted the front seat.\" \"I called it.\" And the other kid knows he's got nothing to say. \"He called it. What can I do?\" If there was a kid court of law, it holds up. \"Your Honor, my client did ask for the front seat.\" \"Your Honor, my client did ask for the front seat.\" And the judge would go, \"Did he call it?\" \"Well, no, he didn't call it\" Bang. \"He has to call it. Case closed. Objection overruled.\" I love the mirror in that bathroom. I don't know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. I don't know if it's the tile or the lighting. I feel like Robert Wagner in there. It's a good mirror. So, what are you getting? I don't know. What can you eat? You can't have anything anymore. Look at this. Look at this. Eggs, out. Coffee, out. French fries, out. B.L.T., out. I go to visit my grandparents. They're eating big brisket sandwiches. I'm sitting there with a carrot. They're closing in on 100. I'm saying to them, \"How can you eat that stuff?\" I'm so sick about losing that choose. I'm so sick about losing that choose. You don't know. I All right. Forget it. Forget it. I'm not taking the place. What? How can I live there? Why not? Look at you. You're still thinking about it. I'll never feel comfortable. Oh, please. Get outta here. How can I ever have you over? You'll sit there moping. I won't mope. You're already moping. Would you take the place? No. Impossible. It's your apartment. You found the place. You won the choose. All right. Forget it. It's over. I'm not moving. Well, me neither. Definitely? Definitely. All right. Then just get rid of it. You won't have any problem. No, it's not a problem. I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon. What apartment? Oh, it's a great place. It's a two-bedroom, West 83rd, about a half block from the park. What's the rent? I hate housewarmings. I hate housewarmings. I don't know what we're doing here. This is ridiculous. She wanted to thank us for the apartment. I can't believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul, and I threw out my couch. If only the coin hadn't hit the table. The table is interference. You know it. It is not. It is too. My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carousel. Hi. Hi. Oh, hi, Carol. I just wanted to introduce you to my husband. This is Larry. This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment. You don't know how grateful I am.

This is my new next-door neighbor, Diane. Hi. These are the guys who turned this place down. Can you believe it? Diane gave me the greatest back rub today. She's a masseuse. How could you guys have turned this place down? It's such a great location, and it's so close to the park. and it's so close to the park. Yeah, we're aware of the proximity to the park. It's Well, it was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. How late are the stores open? I'm thinking of maybe buying a new TV and smashing it over my head.
