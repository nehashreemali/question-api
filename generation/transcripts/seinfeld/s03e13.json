  "transcript": "As a kid, my favourite ride was the bumper car. Remember? Going around in a circle. There was always one kid that could not do it. Do you remember this kid? As soon as the ride gets started he'd be, like, stuck in a pack of empty cars. Just-- \"Excuse me. Excuse me. It won't go! Come on! It's almost over!\" He always ends up with the attendant hanging off that big pole helping him steer it. \"Stop crying.\" Then there's always that other-- One other really bad car-- The helpless father-and-son team. This is another car just not going anywhere. They're never organized. Who's on the wheel? Who's pressing on the gas? Just: \"Son, turn the wheel.\" All right, Coney lsland? Okay, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway and Lafayette. Or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue then switch to the lRT, But don't get on the G. That's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th Street. Then you gotta get on the R. Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney lsland? Well, yeah. Okay. What time is your job interview, George? Don't whistle on the elevator. -Why not? -That's what Willy Loman told Biff before his interview in Death of a Salesman. You're comparing me to Biff Loman? Very encouraging. The biggest loser in the history of American literature. -I gotta get going. -What time's the lesbian wedding? -9:30. -Lesbian wedding. How do they work the bride and groom on that? Do they flip a coin? Yeah, they flip a coin. What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question. I'm so tired. I'm gonna fall asleep on that train. I feel when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking: \"That's why I'm not a heterosexual.\" All right, Jerry, come on. Pick up the check so we can go. -I'm paying for breakfast? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Why do I always pay? What am l, made of money? You bunch of deadbeats. How many tickets you paying today? Let's see. Speeding, running a red light, no licence, no registration no plates, no brake lights, no rear-view mirror. Look at that one. -\"No doors\"? -Yeah, I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over 600 bucks. I can't carry change in these pants. It falls out. -Here you go. -There you go. Thank you. That guy's not blind. So can I convince anybody to come down to Coney lsland? Gotta pick up my car at the pound. George? I can't believe they found your stolen car. Not only did they find it it was simonized, and the front end was aligned. -That's amazing. -So, what do you say? Ride on the Cyclone. Hot dog at Nathan's on me. Who are you, Satan? I'm close to a job here. -It's my second interview. -All right, Biff. Elaine? Merry-go-round? I can't. I'm the best man. Kramer. Bumper cars. I gotta go to court. I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you? It could be years till I get back to Coney lsland. I can't go on the rides alone. and the double R  the 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, the C, K and F train. Well. See you. Hey! Yeah! -You looking for a job? -Me? Why? Well, you're reading the classifieds. Oh, no. No, no. I was just looking for the stock page. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check the quotes. Love a good quote. IBM up a quarter. What do you know? You didn't look like someone who needed a job. Me? No, I don't. Doing very well. Very well, yeah. So you're in the market? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm in the market. Which market? Which market? The. The big one. The big market with the big board. Bull market, bear market. You name the market, I'm there. So do you work for one of the big brokerage houses? They wish. I hate the big brokerage houses. Hate them with a passion. Big brokerage houses killed my father. -Really? -Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I don't like to talk about it but I swore I would never work for a big brokerage house. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money. I'm about people. So I've always gone my own way and I've never looked back. I started riding these trains in the '40s. Those days, a man would give up his seat for a woman. Now we're liberated. We have to stand. It's ironic. What's ironic? This. That we've come all this way, we made all this progress but, you know, we lost the little things, the niceties. No, I mean, what does \"ironic\" mean? Where you off to with such a nice present? -Birthday party? -A wedding. -A wedding? -Yeah. I didn't think people still get married. It's hard today with the men and women. You're telling me. -So they're a nice couple? -Oh, very nice. What does he do, if you don't mind my asking? -She. -She? She. She works, he doesn't. He sounds like my son. There is no \"he.\" There's no he? So who's getting married? Two women. It's a lesbian wedding. Lesbian wedding? Yep. Yep, I'm the best man. Great. My luck. I don't talk to a soul on the subway for 35 years I get the best man at a lesbian wedding. No, no. You don't understand. I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian. I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody. Maybe not. Oh, man. We're stopping? Well, this is where I get off. -You do? -Yeah. Hey, why don't you? Oh, nothing. No, no. What? Well, I was gonna say, \"Why don't you get off with me.\" But you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something. Yeah. Well. See, I knew it was a bad idea. Hey, what's another million, give or take? I get off when and where I wanna get off. I'm stuck. Could you just pull it a little--? This'll just be a second. Don't-- Don't start the train! Don't start the train! Here it is. Here it is, the four horse in the first race. -Pappernick. -How do you know he's gonna win? My UPS guy. Lance. The guys who own the horse are his regular customers. Every horse he's ever given me has won. -Yeah? -Yeah. They've been sandbagging Iooking for a good spot. He's been getting in light because they're using a bug boy. The workouts have been unpublished. They're ready to run with him. Gonna break his maiden. He's gonna go for a great price, maybe 30-1. -I'm telling you, it's a lock. -But it rained last night. Exactly. This horse loves the slop. It's in his bloodlines. His father was a mudder. -His mother was a mudder. -His mother was a mudder? What did I say? Let's go to the office. I'm gonna call my bookie. Hey, don't tell anybody. Oh, man. Okay. You realize, of course, you're naked. Naked, dressed, I don't see any difference. You ought to sit here. There's a difference. You got something against the naked body? I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe some squat-thrusts? Who's got time for squat-thrusts? All right, how about skipping breakfast? I'm guessing you're not a \"half-grapefruit and black coffee\" man. I like a good breakfast. I understand. I like a good breakfast Iong as you don't wind up trapped in a room in overalls and pigtails being counselled by Dick Gregory. I'm not ashamed of my body. Exactly. That's your problem. You should be. Don't get up. Please, allow me. Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Okay, take it easy. I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track. They're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How could there be so many people? This guy really smells. Doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard? You take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. These disgusting animals. These people should be in a cage. We are in a cage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without a ring. Oh, God-- I can't breathe. I feel faint. Okay, take it easy. It'll start moving soon. Think about people in concentration camps, what they went through. And the hostages! What would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare. Help me! Move it! Come on! Move this f****** thing! Why isn't it moving?! What could go wrong with a train? It's on tracks. There's no traffic. How could a train get stuck? Step on the gas! What could it be? You'd think the conductor would explain it to us. \"I'm sorry, there's a delay. We'll be moving in five minutes. \" I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?! Nice. Your company sends you on the road often, huh? Nice. Oh, hey, nice ice bucket there. Make yourself comfortable. Make myself comfortable? What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take mine off and she still has hers on? I'd look like an idiot. She'd get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on. But what if she takes hers off? She'll feel humiliated. \"Make yourself comfortable\"? This woman's unbelievable. This \"comfortable\" thing could ruin me. I got it. I'll take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There. That's comfortable. She can't accuse me of being uncomfortable. I gotta tell you, I'm pretty comfortable. Oh, yeah, it's all set. -They've got the bug boy on it. -The bug boy? Yeah, the little fellow's been riding his heart out. -They're gonna break his maiden. -Really? -Yeah. -It's a little slow out. -Rained last night. -This baby loves the slop. Loves it. Eats it up. Eats the slop. Born to slop. His father was a mudder. -His father was a mudder. -His mother was a mudder. His mother was a mudder? What did I just say? Hey. All right. Six hundred, Pappernick to win. They still have no pitching. Gooden's a question mark. You don't recover from those rotator cuffs so fast. I'm not worried about the Mets' pitching. -They got no hitting. -No, they got hitting. Bonilla, Murray. -They got no defence. -Defence, please. -They need speed. -Speed? They've got Coleman. -They need a bullpen. -Franco's no good? -They got no team leaders. -They got Franco. What they need is a front office. -But you gotta like their chances. -I love them. If they win it this year, I'll sit naked with you at the World Series. It's a deal. Why couldn't I take a cab? For $6, my whole life could have changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in five seconds. One banana, two banana  three banana, four banana  five banana. No. I'm still here. Still here. When will they start moving? Move! Move! Move! It's moving. It's moving! Yes! Yes. Mother******! Gee, I hope you have the key for these things. Oh, don't worry, I do. My mother used to walk around our apartment in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you. She was really disgusting, really bad body. You know, if you can imagine an uglier, fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth in Hazel? Really embarrassing, because I had the only mother in the neighbourhood who was worse than Hazel. -You can imagine the taunts I'd hear. -Like what? Like: \"Hey, your mother's uglier than Hazel.\" \"Hazel really puts your mother to shame.\" You know. What's going on? It was a pleasure doing business with you, but I have to get going. Get going? But we haven't really, you know. Eight dollars? -Eight dollars? -What are you doing, robbing me? I wasted my whole morning on you for $8? Wait a second. What are you doing? -I'm taking your clothes. -No, no, that's my only suit! It cost me $350! I got it at Moe Ginsburg! -Bye, George. -You can't just leave me here. Will I see you again? It's Hoy's Boy followed by Jamet Little Baggit, Kiss Harmony and then a long way to Flagrant. -Come on! -Into the stretch with an 1/8th of a mile to go, Stepagain, Passionel battling it out. Clear from Jamet, Pappernick's starting to make some ground -but Stepagain is the leader. -Come on. -Come on! Yes! -Look at Pappernick, sprouting wings. -Yes! Yes! -Stepagain, just falling back. -Yes! -Pappernick flashing home. Stepagain, Pappernick, Pappernick and Stepagain to the line. -Yes! Yes! Yes! -The winner is Pappernick. Yes, yes! I won. Hey! Yeah. I haven't had a hot dog at Nathan's in 20 years. First, we ride the Cyclone. Chilly out. French fries. Hey, hey! Give me the money. Freeze! Police! No, I never got the car. We had such a good time by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed. Too bad. You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won. You want him? Get that out of my face. So you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris. Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna! How'd you like a Hare Krishna fist down your throat, you little punk? George. Biff. What, did you whistle on the elevator? I have my spare key in your apartment, right? Yeah, in the kitchen drawer. -Give me your key. -What happened? Never mind what happened, just give me the key. -Come on, I'll go with you. -Here. Pay. Wait, wait. Give me that. All right. So I take the subway down to Coney lsland to go on the Cyclone. I'm riding on the subway. I'm sitting on the D train for an hour and 15 minutes to go on a scary ride. Okay, how dumb is that? You know that first sharp drop on the Cyclone? Fell asleep.
