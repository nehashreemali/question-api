  "transcript": "At the health club, people are working out and they're training, getting in shape but strangely, nobody's really getting in shape for anything. The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout. So we're working out so that we'll be in shape for when we have to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jockstraps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes? I'll give my car to any guy in front of a restaurant because he's got a short red jacket. \"He must be the valet guy.\" But my stinking, putrefied gym clothes I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe. Wide open! I was wide-open underneath. I had three inches on that guy. See, you two were hogging the ball. Me? It wasn't me. I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble. I have to dribble. If I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker. -Oh, I'm a chucker. -That's right. Every time you get the ball, you shoot. I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker! I do not chuck. Never chuck! Never have chucked! Never will chuck! No chuck! You chuck. -Kramer, am I a chucker? -Oh, you're a chucker. My God, I'm a chucker. -All these years, you never told me? -It's not an easy thing to bring up. Hey, you know, this is the first time we ever saw each other naked? Believe me, I didn't see anything. Oh, you didn't sneak a peek? -No. Did you? -Yeah, I snuck a peek. -Why? -Why not? What about you, George? Yeah, l snuck a peek. But it was so fast, I didn't see anything. It was just a blur. I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't wanna have. Okay. I gotta go meet Newman. -I'll see you later. Have a good one. -All right. Yeah. Look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here? -You know who that is? -Who? That's Keith Hernandez. Keith Hernandez, the baseball player? Yeah, that's him. -Are you sure? -Positive. Wow! Keith Hernandez! -He's such a great player. -Yeah. He's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff. Wow, I'd love to be a Civil War buff. What do you have to do to become a buff? So Biff wants to be a buff? Well, sleeping less than 1 8 hours a day would be a start. I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I gotta prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension. Hey, should we say something to him? Oh, I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room. Well, he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind. He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld. -So? -What, you're comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez? The guy's a baseball player, Jerry, baseball! I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him. What, you're making some wisecracks in a nightclub? The guy was in game six, two runs down, two outs, facing elimination! Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you. I'm Keith Hernandez. And I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy. -Really? -I've always wanted to do what you do. Do what I do?! You're one of my favorite ballplayers of all time! Mine too. -I love that bit about Jimmy Olsen. -Really? Thank you. You know, Keith, what I've always wondered is with all these ball clubs flying around all season wouldn't you think there'd be a plane crash? Are you performing in New York now? At this club on the East Side. You should come in. But think about it: You'd think eventually, an entire team would just get wiped out. I live on the East Side. I'll give you my number and just tell me whenever you want to go. -Or maybe just get together for coffee. -Oh, that'd be great. Well, it's only a matter of time. Who's this chucker? It's been three days, and he hasn't called. Well, maybe you should call him. I can't. I can't. -Why not? -I just feel like he should call me. What's the difference? You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me, he has my number. He should call. God, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes. I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them, and then they don't call. Why do they do that? I'm sorry, honey. I mean, I really thought he liked me. We were getting along. He came over to me. I didn't go over to him. -I know. -Why did he come over to me? I mean, here I meet this great guy, this ballplayer -best guy I ever met. -Yeah. I know. Well, that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again. I've given my number out to guys, and it takes them a month to call. Good. Good. Well, if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer. You know, maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town. Oh, what, they don't have phones out of town? I love how people say they're too busy. \"Too busy.\" Pick up a phone! Takes two minutes. How can you be too busy? -Why don't you just go and call him? -I can't call here. It's a coffee shop. -I mean, what am I gonna say to him? -Just ask if he wants to get together. For what, dinner? Dinner's good. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? Isn't that, like, a turnoff? Jerry, he's a guy. I know, but this is all very confusing. When you're in your 30s, it's very hard to make a new friend. Whatever the group is you've got now, that's who you're going with. You're not interviewing, not looking at any new people. You're not interested in seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't know the foods. They don't know the activities. If I meet a guy at a club or a gym: \"Hey, look, I'm sure you're very nice. You seem to have a lot of potential. We're just not hiring right now.\" When you're a kid you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you're a little kid what are the qualifications? \"lf someone's in front of my house that's my friend. They're my friend. That's it. Are you a grownup? No? Great. Come on in! Let's jump up and down on my bed!\" And if you have anything in common: \"You like cherry soda? I like cherry soda! We'll be best friends!\" You only have two more weeks before your benefits run out. Yes, and I was hoping, perhaps, to get a 13-week extension, if that's possible. So where have you been looking for work? You know what I've discovered, Mrs. Sokol? It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. As I'm looking and listening-- I'm also looking. You cannot discount looking. It's a combination. It's looking. And listening. Listening. And looking. But you must look. Can you be specific about any of these companies? Specific. Let's see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings. They all blend in together. Just give me one name. One name. Absolutely. Let's see, there's. Vandalay lndustries. I just saw them. I got very close there. Very close. What type of company is that? Latex. Latex manufacturing, Mrs. Sokol. -And you interviewed there? -Yes, for a sales position. Latex salesman. The selling of latex and latex-related products. They just wouldn't give me a chance. Damn it! Now I'm going to need an address and a phone number for this Vandalay company. You like gum? Because I have a friend in the gum business. I got a gum guy! I make one phone call, have boxes of gum delivered right to your door. The address? The address is. Jose Jimenez. Do you recognize that? -No. -Jose Jimenez. Very funny. Really, he's very funny. The address. Vandalay is 129 West 81st Street. It's a very small industry, Vandalay. It's why I wanted to work for them. A phone number. That'sKL5 8383. Are you planning on calling them soon? Because they have very strange hours. As soon as I'm done with you. Sure. Well. You know, I'll check in with you next week. I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon. -Okay. -All right. Really good to. He'll call you back! It's a par five. So, you know, I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. -I mean, you know my hook, right? -Elaine? How about this shirt? Is this okay? Jerry, he's a guy. Well, it's a dogleg left, so I play the hook. Wait, hold on. There's another call. -Jerry! Jerry! -George? -Kramer, put Jerry on! -I'm in the middle of something. -Call back. -Kramer, no--! So the ball takes off, and I'm waiting for it to turn. Would you--! All right. Well, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah. Hey, that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we'll go see the baby. -See the baby. Again with the baby. -Who are they? A guy who used to live in the building keeps calling us to see the baby. \"You gotta see the baby. When are you gonna see the baby?\" Can't they just send us a tape? Maybe if you wait a few months, it won't be a baby anymore. -Then you won't have to see it. -Because he'll be all grown-up. Yeah. Hey, Kramer, what do you think of this shirt? It's too busy. You're trying too hard to make an impression on him. -You're not being yourself. -What guy? I know he's just a guy, but I really like him. Who are you talking about? KeithHernandez. Keith Hernandez? Keith Hernandez! Do me a favor, would you? Would you change lanes? You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double-parked. Get out, I'm begging you. Please. Please! You know what? Bad mistake. My mistake. Go back. Your lane was better. Forget this lane. This lane stinks. Go back to your lane. Go ahead. Bad mistake. Go! Go! Go! Make this light! Make this light! Oh, man! That's it! Get out! -What do you mean, get out? -Get out of the cab! What? I'm not getting out of this cab. No! No! You cannot throw me out! No! Get. Hello, Newman. I hate Keith Hernandez. -Hate him! -I despise him. -Why? -Why? I'll tell you why. -Let me tell her. -No, you can't-- -You always tell. -All right, tell it. -Just tell it. -All right. June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right-field stands when a crucial Hernandez error opens the door to a five-run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game! Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people waiting by the players' parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp. Newman was in front of me. Hernandez was coming toward us. As he passes us, Newman turns and says, \"Nice game, pretty boy.\" Hernandez continued past us up the ramp. Then, a second later, something happened that changed us in a very deep and profound way from that day forward. -What was it? -He spit on us! And I screamed out, \"I'm hit!\" Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted off him, and it hit me. What a story. Unfortunately, the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this, if I may, for Ms. Benes as I've heard this story a number of times. Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Hernandez passes you and starts walking up the ramp. Then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple, striking Newman between the third and the fourth rib. The spit then came off the rib made a right turn, hitting Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, pauses in midair, mind you makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic loogie. Well, that's the way it happened. What happened to your head when you got hit? Well, my head went back, to the left. -Say that again. -Back and to the left. Back and to the left. Back and to the left. So, what are you saying? I'm saying that the spit could not have come from behind. That there had to have been a second spitter. Behind the bushes, on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you, as you claim that would've caused your head to pitch forward. So the spit could've only come from the front and to the right. But that's not what they would have you believe. I'm leaving. Jerry's a nut. Wait, wait, wait. The sad thing is, we may never know the real truth. Did anybody call asking for Vandalay lndustries? -No, what happened to you? -All right, listen closely: I was at the unemployment office. I told them I was very close to getting a job with Vandalay lndustries and I gave them your phone number. So when the phone rings you have to answer, \"Vandalay lndustries.\" -I'm Vandalay lndustries? -Right. -What is that? -You're in latex. -Latex? -Right. -What do I do with latex? -I don't know! You manufacture it! -Right here in this little apartment? -And what do I say about you? You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman. -I'll hire you as my latex salesman? -Right. I don't think so. Why would I do that? Because I asked you to. If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit pushing papers around, you can forget it. I've got enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff. -Yeah? -It's Keith. All right, we're coming down. Keith Hernandez? -Yeah. Come on, Elaine, let's go. -Where are you going? They're giving me a ride downtown. You know, there had to have been a second spitter. Who was it? Who had the motive? That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years. What the hell are you two talking about? -That was really fun. Thanks. -Yeah, it really was. Should I shake his hand? Well. You want to catch a movie this weekend? Have you seen JFK? No, I haven't. This weekend. Wow! Sure. That would be great. Damn. I was too overanxious. He must have noticed that. I mean, if you want to. -Well, how about this Friday? -Yeah, Friday's okay. Go ahead, shake his hand. I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I've been on The Tonight Show. Well, good night. Good night. Oh, Jer, by the way the woman we gave a ride to earlier. -Elaine. -Yeah. -What's her story? -I don't know. We used to go out. Would you mind if I gave her a call? -For a date? -Yeah. Oh, no. Go ahead. You got a pen? You sure you don't mind? So then we went to dinner. -Who paid? -We split it. Split it. Pretty good. -Did you talk about game six? -No. I gotta wait until it's the right time. -Yeah? -It's Elaine. Come on up. So then what? Nothing. Then he took me home. Shake his hand? Yeah. What kind of a shake does he have? Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard. Didn't have to prove anything, but firm enough to know he was there. So you're gonna see him again? He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night. The weekend! So then, as I was getting out of the car-- -Hi! -Oh, hi, Elaine. Hi, Elaine. So how was your date? What date? It's a guy. So you know. He called me. -Already? -Keith called you? This guy really gets around. -Do you mind? -No, I don't mind. Why should I mind? What did he say? He asked me out for Saturday night. -You going? -No. -I told him I was busy. -Oh, really? So we're going out Friday. -Friday? -Yeah. He's going out with you on Friday? -Yeah? -He's supposed to see me on Friday. -I didn't know. -We made plans! -Well-- I'll cancel it. -No, don't cancel it. Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it? Well, frankly, it is. I've never seen you jealous before. Well, you're not even a fan. I was at game six. You didn't even watch it. Wait a second. Wait a minute. Are you jealous of him or are you jealous of me? Any Hennigan's around here? Vandalay lndustries. Kell Varnsen speaking. May we help you? Oh, hi, Keith. No, I was just joking around. No, no, I don't mind at all. -No, no, no. I can cancel. -Sure. We'll do something next week. No, it's no problem at all. Okay. Take it easy. That was Keith. We're gonna do something next week. Hey, what are you doing Friday night? Friday night? Nothing. Now. Want to come to see the baby? Oh, fasten your seat belts. We're going to see the baby. If you don't see the baby now, you're never gonna see her. -All right, I'll go. -All right. All right. I'll get it. Hello. What-delay lndustries? -No! -Vandalay! Say Vandalay! No, you're way, way, way off! Yeah, that's the right number, but this is an apartment. -No, say-- -Vandalay! Say-- Vandalay lndustries! Yeah, no problem, no problem. How did you know who they wanted?! And you want to be my latex salesman. Just sign here, please. I know who it was too. It was the guy that interviewed me. He was very threatened by me. Why else wouldn't he hire me? -I could sell latex like that. -Just sign that. -Who is this? -It's my daughter. This is your daughter? My God! My God! I hope you don't mind my saying, she is breathtaking. You think so? Would you take this picture away from me? Just take it away. Get it out of here. Take it away, and put it away. Let me just sign this and go. You know she doesn't even have a boyfriend. Okay. Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? You trying to make a joke, Mrs. Sokol? It's not funny. I can tell you that. I'm serious. She doesn't. You know, it's one thing to not give me the extension. But to tease and to torture me like this there's no call for that. Would you like her phone number? Mrs. Sokol, I don't know what to say. -Where should I sign this thing? -No, no, no, no. Don't worry about it. Unemployment, it's a tough thing. Even if you get a job after you've been unemployed they take unemployment out of your check every week and show it to you in that little box. How good can it be for your confidence that every paycheck has the word \"unemployment\" on it? Can't get it out of your mind! You just got the job! They're already getting ready for you to be laid off. I have a friend who's unemployed. He's collecting unemployment insurance. This guy has never worked this hard in his life to keep this thing going. He's down there every week waiting on the lines and getting interviewed and making up all these lies about looking for jobs. If they had any idea the effort and energy that he is expending to avoid work, I'm sure they'd give him a raise. I'm sure of it. The guy is doing a tremendous job not working. So tell me more about this game six. Well, there was two outs, bottom of the tenth. We're one out away from losing the series. Hello. How are you? So, what do you think? Do you love her? Yes, I do love her. You have a very nice place here. So who do you think she looks like? Lyndon Johnson. What? Lyndon Johnson? He's joking. No, I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson. Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to see the baby. I kept saying to Michael, \"When is Jerry going to see the baby?\" I was saying the same thing. Take a picture. Michael, get the camera. -You don't have to take a picture. -I don't know where it is. It's in the bottom drawer of our dresser. Hurry up! He's such an idiot. Jerry, you want to pick her up? -I better not. -I'll pick her up. No! Thank you for a wonderful time, George. Glad you enjoyed it. I haven't had a Big Mac in a long time. Billions and billions. Would you like to come up? Would I like to come up? I would love to come up. I'mI'm fighting not to. Fighting. Unfortunately, l have to get an early start tomorrow. Gotta get up and hit that pavement. But it's Saturday. All the offices are closed. I got me an appointment with a hardware store. I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life but hardware fascinates me. Wouldn't you love to make a key? Will you call me as soon as you get home? -Tonight? -Yes. Will I call you when I get home? What do you think? You kill me. You really kill me. Well, good night. It was an accident. Right, Jerry? It was an accident. Oh, she's gonna be all right. Here, baby. Here. Here, baby. Baby, baby, baby. Who's the baby? I have a friend who's got a baby. \"Gotta see the baby. You've got to come over and see the baby.\" Nobody ever wants you to come over and see their grandfather, do they? \"You've got to see my grandfather. You've got to see him. He's so cute. I love them when they're this age. He's 1000 months. You know, the mid-80s is such a good time for the grand-people. The mid-80s, you gotta see them. He went to the bathroom by himself today.\" You know what's tough about seeing people when they have a baby is that you have to match their level of enthusiasm. You know what I mean? They're always so excited. \"What do you think of him?\" I'd like to meet a couple that goes: \"You know, we're not that happy with him, frankly. I think we really made a big mistake. We should have got an aquarium. You want him? We don't even want him. You want him?\" Thanks for a nice evening. This was really fun. Yeah, it was. Gosh, should I kiss her good night? Is he going to try and kiss me? -I love Cajun cooking. -Really? You know, my mom's one-quarter Cajun. Oh, my father's half-drunk. Maybe they should get together. Go ahead. Kiss her. I'm a baseball player, damn it. What's he waiting for? I thought he was a cool guy. Come on. I won the MVP in '79. I can do whatever I want to. Well, this is getting awkward. Well, good night. Good night. Who does this guy think he is? I'm Keith Hernandez. Who else? Mookie. Mookie was there. You know him? Well, I don't know him. I know who he is. He's such a great guy. You should meet him. -He's the one who got that hit-- -I know. He got the hit in game six! So then what happened? Nothing. Then he took me home. So did you two have? What? You know. Milk? -No. -Cookies? Did he kiss you good night? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? All right. He kissed me, okay? Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make-out thing? Between a peck and a make-out. So you like him. I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him? I'm jealous of everybody. Hello. Oh, hi. What's happening? What? Sure. Yeah, okay. Then. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Bye. -Who was that? -That was Keith. -What's going on? -He wants me to help him move. Help him move? Move what? You know, furniture. So, what did you say? I said, yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean, I hardly know the guy. That's a big step in a male relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way. And you feel you're not really ready for-- Well, we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? Hey. What's going on? Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move. What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve! You see? Wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Oh, you're not gonna do it, are you? -I said, yes. -You said yes?! Don't you have any pride or self-respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? Are you gonna start driving him to the airport? I'm not driving him to the airport. Oh, boy. I don't know. -Kramer, do me a favor, would you? -What? Don't mention it to anybody. I wish you never mentioned it to me. I had a great time tonight, Carrie. And I will call you as soon as I get home. Don't bother. Bother? What kind of bother? I would prefer it if you didn't. -Why? Is anything wrong? -It's over, buddy. Done. Finished. So long. Goodbye. Adios. Sayonara. -Why? -I've been thinking about it. You got no job. You got no prospects. You're like Biff Loman. I went to the hardware store interview. You think I'm going to spend my life with somebody because he can get me a deal on a box of nails? I thought we were a team. If I ever need a drill bit, I'll call you. Carrie, could you do me a favor? Could you not mention this to your mother? You know, I hate to brag but I did win 1 1 straight Gold Gloves. I wouldn't have brought it up, but since you mentioned it. I didn't mention it. Well, I won them anyway. Well, so what? I mean you played first base. I mean, they always put the worst player at first base. That's where they put me, and I stunk. Elaine, you don't know the first thing about first base. Well, I know something about getting to first base and I know you'll never be there. The way I figure it, I've already been there. And I plan on rounding second tonight at around 1 1 :00. Well, I'd watch the third-base coach if I were you because I don't think he's waving you in. You know, I hate to say this but I really think that we're hitting it off. -Get it? Get it? -Clever. -What are you doing? -What's that? -You smoke? -Yeah. I didn't know you smoked. Is that a problem? She likes him. I mean, she really likes him. -How do you know? -Who wouldn't like him? I like him, and I'm a guy. I suppose he's an attractive man. Forget that. He's a ballplayer. MVP, 1979. I'm making wisecracks in some nightclub. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They go together. Like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike. I hate those couples. I could never be one of those couples. There are no bald women around, you know. I know this sounds a little arrogant, but I never thought she'd find someone she liked better than me. But, you know I guess I had my chance. And that's that. You know what I'd like to do? I'd really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall, like a giant. Like 6'5\". Really? What was the tallest woman you ever slept with? I don't know, 6'3\". Wow! God! See, this is all I think about: sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition. So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these type of people. Magellan? You like Magellan? Oh, yeah. My favorite explorer. Around the world. Come on. -Who do you like? -I like de Soto. -De Soto? What did he do? -Discovered the Mississippi. Oh, like they wouldn't have found that anyway. All right. I gotta go down to the unemployment office. -You want to take a walk? -No, I got some stuff to do. I gotta meet Keith at my apartment at 3. I'm helping him move. What? The guy asked you to help him move? Wow! -I know. Isn't that something? -Why doesn't he just pay a mover? He's got some valuable antiques. He's worried they'll break something. Soon he'll have you driving him to the airport. I'm not driving him to the airport! I gave. I gave everything I could, Mrs. Sokol. -Nothing was good enough for her. -Sign here, please. I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you, she's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. Is she looking for some big hotshot businessman? Well, I've got my pride too. I'm not gonna beg her. All right. Just sign it. People are waiting. You like baseball? That was autographed by the '86 Mets. I saw every inning that year. It's funny, because I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez. You know Keith Hernandez. Know him? Would youIike to meet him? Oh, come on. Come on. I can produce Keith Hernandez, right here within the hour. All right. You got one hour. All right, Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back. Or not. You better bring your gloves. It's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really, Jerry, there's not that much. First, we got the bedroom. We got two dressers and the bed. -ls there a box spring? -What's that? -A box spring? -Yeah, there's a box spring. But it's attached to the headboard, and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch. -ls that a sectional? -Yeah, 12 pieces. -A marble coffee table. -ls that a thick marble? Three inches thick. Got it in ltaly. But the big problem is gonna be the convertible sofa. When you move it, it tends to open up so it's going to be difficult getting it downstairs. Stairs? -There's no elevator? -No, it's a brownstone. Three floors. -I'm sorry, I can't do this. -What? I can't do it! I can't! It's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move, I'm sorry. I can't! I just can't. -Hello. -Hello. Oh, you don't remember me. -No. Should l? -Yeah, yeah, you should because I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory. June 14th, 1987. Mets-Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp. You said, \"Nice game, pretty boy.\" -You remember. -And then you spit on us. -Hey, I didn't spit at you. -Yeah, right. -No, no. Then who was it? -Look, the way I remember it I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me \"pretty boy. \" Hey, that ticked me off. I was turning to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravelly road. Anyway, he was talking to someone, and they were pointing at you. I tried to scream out, but it was too late. It was already on its way. I told you. -It was McDowell. -But why? Why McDowell? Maybe because we were sitting in the right-field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game. He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head. -lt was McDowell. -Oh, boy. -Look, Keith, we're sorry. -Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. Guys, don't worry about it. -Well, I guess I better get going. -What are you doing? -I gotta move. -You want any help? -I'd love some. You sure? -I'd love to help you. Yeah, me too! Okay, guys. We got to be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff is very fragile We'll have to handle it like a baby. Hey, no sweat. Hello. Oh, hi, Elaine. What's going on? No, he just left. You broke up with him? Me too! What happened? Oh, smoking. You know, you're like going out with C. Everett Koop. Me? No. I couldn't go through with it. I just didn't feel ready. So, what are you doing now? Oh, great idea. Okay. I'll meet you there in, like, Okay, bye. Keith! Keith! -What happened? Where's Keith? -You just missed him. He just left. What do you need him for? Keith! Keith! Up here! Look, could you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me! I-- I'm Jerry's friend! The guy from the locker room! I'm the chucker! It'll take five minutes! Wait! Wait! Well, Biff what's next? I don't know. Excuse me. I was walking behind you, and you dropped your wallet. When you're moving, your whole world becomes boxes. That's all you think about, is boxes. Where are there boxes? You just wander down the street, going in and out of stores. \"Are there boxes here? Have you seen any boxes?\" I mean, you can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate. \"Shut up! I'm looking for boxes!\" So after a while, you become really into it. You can smell them. You walk into a store: \"There's boxes here. Don't tell me you don't have boxes. Damn it! I can smell them!\" You become, like, obsessed. \"l love the smell of cardboard in the morning.\" At a funeral, everyone's crying around. You're looking at the casket: \"That's a nice box. Does anybody know where that guy got that box? When he's done with it, you think I could get that? It's got some nice handles on it.\" And that's what death is, really. It's the last big move of your life. The hearse is like the van. The pallbearers are close friends. The only ones you could really ask to help you with a big move like that. And the casket is that great, perfect box you've been looking for your whole life. The only problem is once you find it, you're in it. SDl Media Group",
