  "transcript": "Hang on, let me just pick up a paper. Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute? - Yeah, no problem. - Let's go. - Well, I gotta watch this guy's bag. - For how long? - I'm sure he'll be back in a second. - Nice stuff. - Come on. Excuse me, sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a second? Why? So I can stand here like an idiot not knowing if you'll ever come back? - Where are you going? - I'm gonna be this guy's friend. - New clothes? - Yeah, I did some shopping. Some new-clothes shopping. Can I borrow your menu? Strange, for new pants there's noticeable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait, those are the clothes from the bag. The guy never came back. He asked you to watch them, not wear them. I'm still watching them. - You look like a tourist. - All right. Let me ask you something. When do you start to worry about ear hair? When you hear, like, a soft rustling. Puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty. You gotta be vigilant. All right. Let me ask you this: You know where Walker Street is downtown? - I got a league meeting there. - Oh, right, the new job. - Yeah. - How is it? I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm. So who's the new you? They got an intern from Francis Lewis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school. - Hi, Alex. - I'm sorry I'm late. - Have you ordered yet? - No. I'll be right back. Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the Port Authority? - Right here, George. In here. Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world. Thanks. Thanks a lot. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - Where's Jerry? Well, he's in the shower. - You want me to get him? - No, no, no. Actually, I kind of need to speak to you. Oh, well, let's sit down. Kramer, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book, and then he gave them back to you? Vaguely. Well, I was kind of short on material and I put them in the book anyway. You put my life stories in his autobiography? Kramer, listen, it is such a stupid book. - It doesn't matter. - No, no. Sure it matters. I've broken through, huh? I'm part of popular culture now. Listen, I'd like to thank Mr. Peterman. He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon. Waldenbooks. That's a major chain, huh? Hey, Jerry, I'm going to Waldenbooks. Oh, get out! Get out! I don't wanna live like this! All right, let's go. - Mr. Lippman, how are you? - How are you? - Well, I'm not bad. Not bad. - What are you doing here? I work for Pendant Publishing. This is our book. If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now? Hey, buddy. Remember me? You're that gangly fellow we bought the stories from. Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name, darling? - Who are you? - Oh, I'm Let me use your pen, will you? - I'm the real Peterman. All right, playtime's over. Relax, man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggly. I can't believe somebody pulled the top off this muffin. That was me. I'm sorry, l I don't like the stumps. - So you just eat the tops? - Oh, yeah, it's the best part. It's crunchy. It's explosive. It's It's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does its own thing. I'll tell you, that's a million-dollar idea right there. Just sell the tops. Okay. Let's go, slim. That's enough. - I have a right to be here. - Come on. These are my fans. Hey, you're hurting my elbow. Try looking up, hayseed. You wanna sightsee, get on a bus. Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude. - Well, no, actually I'm - I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitors Center. Where are you visiting from? Little Rock, Arkansas. That looks new. So get this: Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing. Like I'm some sort of maniac. - Yeah, that's too bad. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. - No, no, no, don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it? What happened? - I did something stupid. - What did you do? - Well, I was shaving - Yeah. and I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair. And I was trying to even it out. And the next thing I knew: Gone. Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there? - Well, women do it. - \"Well, women do it.\" Well, I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just sashay your pretty little self around the town square. - Well, what am I gonna tell Alex? - Now, you listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me? - Hey. - Hey. - Jerry shaved his chest. - Hey! I forgot. Wait, never mind. You couldn't pay me enough to ride a horse in this city. I mean, it's hard enough to cross the street in a pair of sneakers let alone six feet in the air on a jittery, glassy-eyed dinosaur. How about the beach this weekend? Well, you couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. - I mean, it's hard enough to park - All right, all right. Is that a Mexican Hairless? I love those. Oh, hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much smoother and cleaner. Really? Excuse me. Are you eating a muffin top? Yeah, a muffin-top store just opened up down the street. - A muffin-top store? - What did I just say? Top of the muffin to you. Elaine. Mr. Lippman? So you're pretending to be a tourist? It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here, so it's okay if I'm stupid. And she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakups. - How do you explain your apartment? - I got a hotel room. You moved into a hotel? Well, I don't know anyone here, Jerry. Where else am I gonna stay? So get this: We're in the park today. Alex goes wild for this hairless dog. - So? - So I figured since she likes one hairless animal, why not another? - Oh, really? - Yes. - You tell her you shaved it? - Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest. Hey, Jerry! I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Reality tour? The last thing this guy is qualified to give a tour of is reality. This was my idea. You stole my idea. Elaine, these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air. Oh, well, then, if that air is coming out of this face then it is my air and my idea. - You want a muffin or not? - Peach. So I've noticed you don't have much of an accent. Yeah, my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation. So I was thinking maybe tonight we could go back to my hotel. I got SpectraVision. First five minutes free. Look, George l'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is gonna work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog, Willy. And I'm still gonna be here. Well, what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here? George, no offense, but this city would eat you alive. You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now. Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in this town. - What is it she thinks you can't do? - Find a job, get an apartment. How did you do those things? Never mind, they're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know, if you take everything I've accomplished in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent. Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday? Here you go. Here you go. Check it out. \"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour.\" - I'm confused. - That Peterman book is big business. People wanna know the stories behind the stories. Nobody wants to go on a three-hour bus tour of a totally unknown persors life. I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and dessert. - What's dessert? - Bite-size 3 Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats. - He eats those? - No, I eat those. I'm the real Peterman. - I don't - Wait a minute. I think I understand this. J. Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you, Kramer, are real. - Talk to me. - But your life is Petermars. Now, the bus tour, which is real takes you to places that, while they are real they are not real in the sense that they did not really happen to the real Peterman, which is you. - Understand? - Yeah, it's 37.50 for a 3 Musketeers. Elaine, I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops. So? What do you want me to do about it? You're the muffin-top expert. Tell me what I'm doing wrong. Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendant Publishing I believed in you, you know, as a man of integrity. But when I saw you in that paper hat and that apron What if I cut you in for 30 percent of the profits? Deal. Here's your problem: You're making just the muffin tops. - What do you mean? - You gotta make the whole muffin. Then you pop the top, toss the stump. Taste. - So, what do we do with the bottoms? - Give them to a soup kitchen. - It's a good idea. - And one more thing. Do you really think we need the exclamation point? Because it's not, \"Top of the muffin to you!\" No, no, it is. Hey, Jerry. What's this? Lady Gillette? Oh, what's going on? - Hey. - What? - Jeez. - Can't I get a moment's peace? - What are you doing to yourself? - I can't stop. - Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless. - What? You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's gonna happen? Every time you shave it, it's gonna come in thicker and fuller and darker. - Oh, that's an old wives' tale. - Is it? Look at this. - What is? What is that? - Look at it! Look at it! It's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard. Oh, come on. That's genetic. That's not gonna happen to me. Wort it? Or has it already started to happen? Look at this, we're cleaning up. Oh, Reuben, get me another tray of low-fat cranberry, please. Excuse me. I'm Rebecca DeMornay, from the homeless shelter. - Oh, hi. - Are you the ones leaving those muffin pieces behind our shelter? - You've been enjoying them? - They're just stumps. - Well, they're perfectly edible. - Oh, so you just assume the homeless will eat them? They'll eat anything? - No, we just thought - I know what you thought: \"They don't have homes. Don't have jobs. What do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps.\" If the homeless don't like them, the homeless don't have to eat them. The homeless don't like them. We've never had so many complaints. Every two minutes: \"Where's the top of this muffin? - Who ate the rest?\" - We were just trying to help. Why don't you drop off chicken skins and lobster shells? I think I might. I can't believe you found something so quickly. - How much are you paying? - Twenty-three hundred. - Ouch, a month? - Yeah. Well, I guess that's all right for now. But if you stay here more than a few months, you're a real sucker. Yeah, well, I I got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed. Yeah, we should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something. Coming up on the right if you glance up, you'll just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire. Hey, if you're the real Peterman how come you're wearing those ratty clothes? - What? - Well, they're not very romantic. Well, that's your opinion. Can I have another 3 Musketeers? They're rather small. Forget it. Okay, Newmars postal route is around here somewhere. - Who's Newman? - Who cares? Hey, fake Peterman, let me off. I'm nauseous. Can I have his candy bar? Everyone just settle down. Okay, we got three hours left on this thing and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay, Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here. - Why do I have to go on the tour? - Jerry, you're a minor celebrity. You know, if you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. You can bring that little girlfriend of yours and I'll only charge you 60 bucks. - Hey. - Hey. - How's business? - Oh, I got stump trouble. The sanitation department won't get rid of them all. I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps. All right. I gotta hose the puke off the floor of the bus. Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Bus? You got a bus? - Yeah. Yeah. - You got any room on that thing? Yeah, there are a few seats still available. Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it won'th your while. Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back. No, they don't. Are they war veterans? This is your office? Oh, hello. Sorry, George didn't know you had a girl in here. Leave a signal on the doorknob like a necktie or a sock or something. Come on, help me out. Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here. - Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken? Yes, very nice for her to have met you, sir. Wait a minute, George. Be right with you. Look, Mr. Steinbrenner Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive, George. Days with the New York Yankees, nights in Arkansas with a topflight bird outfit. And a hen supervisor, to boot. I am blown. Blown away. Blown, George. Blown! You know, when you make a pizza bagel you really shouldn't use cinnamon raisin. You also shouldn't use a doughnut. All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour. Turn music off. - Kramer, can we just go? - And go we will. What is this? Pizza pound cake? Well, we have a bonus ultra-reality stop today. We're gonna be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository. - We're going to a garbage dump? - And we're off. You know, I never thought he'd be able to re-create the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close. Don Tyler? George Steinbrenner here. I wanna talk about George Costanza. I understand he's been dividing his time between us and you. - I cannot have that. - Well, I don't know who he is but if you want him that bad, I'm not giving up that easy. Oh, is that so? Playing a little hardball, huh, Donny boy? How about this: You give me Costanza. I convert your concessions to all chicken, no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. - Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken. - How do you make that alcoholic chicken? - They ferment, just like anything else. That stuff sounds great. All right, I'll have Costanza on the next bus. Hey, hey, hey. Where do you think you're going? - Well, I was gonna dump this. - It doesn't look like garbage. - Well, it's muffin stumps. - Where are the muffin tops? This is a garbage dump. - Just let me dump it. - Can't do it. - Is this a joke? - That's what I like to know about it. You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you? - What's that? - Well, look. - It's almost time for you to shave again. - Oh, yeah. Well, maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs! Well, ladies and gentlemen, you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge. - Where are we going? - I don't know. No more questions. So the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler Chicken? Dogs, twists, and a fermented chicken drink. Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes? - What clothes? - These clothes. The ones you're wearing. - Kramer, how much longer? - What? My chest hair's growing back, and it's itching me like crazy. - I can't let her see me scratch it. - Well, don't worry. - I got a good feeling about this dump. - I tell you, man, I'm losing it. I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog. I don't know where the tops are. Jerry, what's the matter? That feels good. - Oh, hey, you looking for George? - Yes. He's been in the bathroom a while. You might wanna check on him. Jerry, you gotta bring me some clothes here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in a mers room on 43rd Street in my underpants. I told you this city would eat you alive. And I think my relationship's in trouble. - What is this guy again? - They call him a cleaner. He makes problems go away. - Hello, Elaine. - Where did you get the car? It's a rental. - Where are they? - In the back. All right. I'm gonna need a clean eight-ounce glass. What is going on here? If I'm curt, then I apologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here. And time is of the essence.",
