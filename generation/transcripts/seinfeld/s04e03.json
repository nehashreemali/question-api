  "transcript": "Parents like to drag kids to historical sights. I remember going to Colonial Williamsburg and you see the supposedly authentic blacksmith there. He's got the three-cornered hat, knickers and the Def Leppard shirt. My parents took me to the Amish country, which to a kid to see a bunch of people that have no cars, no TV, no phone they go, \"So what? Neither do I.\" So it's the whole community that's been grounded. That's the way they should punish the kids. \"All right, get up to your room. I've had it. You are Amish, young man. For the rest of this weekend. Did you hear me? Amish. Don't come down till you make some noodles and raise a barn.\" They have a guide. He takes you shows you the battlefield, gives you a bit of the history. How far is Gettysburg? I'd like to go. - About three hours. - Tommy, you're on. - Gotta go. - Have a good set. What did they do for toilet paper in the Civil War? Wonder what toilet paper was like in the 1860s. Did they? Did they carry it in rolls in their duffel bags? Everything with you comes down to toilet paper. - What? - That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus? - Then what did they do? - I don't know. Maybe they gave out big loose clumps to all the soldiers. It would be nice if there was some sort of historical record of it. They should have a toilet-paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet-paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper during the Crusades. The development of the perforation. The first six-pack. Excuse me, Jerry. I'm Stu Schirmack. I'm from NBC. - Could we speak for a few moments? - Sure. - Hi. Jay Crespi. - Hello. - C-R-E-S-P-I. - That's right. I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. - Give give me a last name. - I'm not George. All right. All right. First of all that was a terrific show. - Thank you very much. - And And I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings, and we'd be very interested in doing something. - Really? - So if you had an idea for, like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it. I'd be very interested in that. Well, here. Why don't you give us a call, and maybe we can develop a series. Okay. Great. Thanks. - It was very nice meeting you. - Thank you. - Nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you. - What was that all about? - They said they were interested in me. - For what? - You know, TV show. - Your own show? - Yeah, I guess so. They want you to do a TV show? They want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas. Come on. How hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach a gymnastics team in high school, and you're married. Your son is not interested in gymnastics, and you're pushing him. Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics? - You're the teacher. It's only natural. - But gymnastics is not for everybody. - I know, but he's your son. - So what? All right, forget that idea. It's not for you. Okay, okay. I got it. You run an antique store. - Yeah. And? - And people come into the store and you get involved in their lives. What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives? - Why not? - So someone comes in to buy an old lamp, and suddenly I'm getting them out of a jam. I could see if I was a pharmacist. Because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody. Antiques are very popular right now. - No, they're not. They used to be. - Oh, sure. - Like you know. - Oh, like you do. And you're the manager of the circus. - The circus? - Oh, come on. This is a great idea. Look at the characters. You got all these freaks in the show. A woman with a mustache. Who wouldn't tune in to see a woman with a mustache? You got the tallest man in the world. A guy who's just a head. - I don't think so. - Look the show isn't about the circus. It's about watching freaks. I don't think the network would go for it. - Why not? - I'm not pitching a show about freaks. Oh, come on, Jerry. You're wrong. People, they wanna watch freaks. This is a \"can't miss.\" - Kramer. - Hello, Newman. I got the helmet. Go get the radar detector. Okay. I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? - Yeah. Sure. - Of course. - What's this about? - We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet. He's giving me his radar detector. - I didn't know you have a motorcycle. - Well, my girlfriend had one. You have a girlfriend? I had a girlfriend. And she was pretty wild. - I don't remember you with a girl. - Nevertheless. This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. A radar detector's worth much more than that helmet. You're cheating him. - Don't say anything. - All right. Hey, you know you're getting gypped over here. Really. Hey. We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? - That's a renege. - Stop saying \"reneging.\" - Well, you're reneging. - Okay, okay. I'm not reneging. All right. Give it to me. - All right, let go. - Come on. - Let go on three. - Give me that. Just give me that! - Three. - Here. Idiots. Thanks, buddy. So long. - Does that thing work? - No. I got a postcard from Elaine. - Really? - Yeah. They're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks. I can't believe she got involved with her shrink. What about the TV show? Got anything? No. Nothing. Why don't they have salsa on the table? What do you need salsa for? Salsa is now the number-one condiment in America. Do you know why? Because people like to say \"salsa.\" Do you have any salsa? We need more salsa. Where is the salsa? No salsa? You know, it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. I wanted seltzer, not salsa. Don't you know the difference between them? You have the seltzer after the salsa. This should be the show. This is the show. - What? - This. Just talking. Yeah. Right. No, I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea. Just talking? Well, what's the show about? It's about nothing. - No story? - No, forget the story. - You gotta have a story. - Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for that table in that Chinese restaurant? That could be a TV show. And who's on the show? Who are the characters? I could be a character. - You? - Yeah. You base a character on me. So on the show there's a character named George Costanza? Yeah. What? There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, \"You know, you're quite a character.\" And who else is on the show? Elaine could be a character. Kramer. Now, he's a character. So everybody I know is a character on the show. Right. - And it's about nothing. - Absolutely nothing. So you're saying I go into NBC and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing. We go into NBC. We? Since when are you a writer? What writer? We're talking about a sitcom. You wanna go with me to NBC? Yeah, we really got something here. - What do we got? - An idea. - What idea? - An idea for the show. - I still don't know what the idea is. - It's about nothing. - Right. - Everybody's doing something. We'll do nothing. We go into NBC, tell them we got an idea for a show about nothing. - Exactly. - \"What's your show about?\" - I say, \"Nothing.\" - There you go. I think you may have something here. So the show would be about my real life and one of the characters would be based on you. No, I don't think so. What do you mean, you don't you think so? - I don't like it. - I don't understand. - What don't you like? - I don't like the idea of a character based on me. - Why not? I don't know. It just doesn't sit well. You're my neighbor. There's gotta be a character. - That's your problem, buddy. - I don't understand what the deal is. Okay. You can do it on one condition. - Whatever you want. - I get to play Kramer. - You can't play Kramer. - I am Kramer. But you can't act. - Okay, fine, we'll use Newman. - Newman? - Use me for what? - Nothing. What do you want? Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was driving home on the Palisades Parkway when I look in the rearview mirror, and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on, but I didn't hear a thing. - Isn't that strange? - Yeah, that's strange. Because the radar detector, as I understand it, detects radar! With a series of beeps and flashing lights. But for some reason, I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren. Well, that's queer, huh? I want my helmet back! You give me back my helmet, and pay for that ticket! Oh, yeah, yeah. You better think again, MoJumbo. You gave me a defective detector. - Jerry? - Buyer beware. Are you gonna give me back my helmet? No, we had a deal. There's no guarantees in life. No, but there's karma, Kramer. Karma Kramer? And one more thing: I'm not coming to your party! Salsa, seltzer. Do you have any salsa? No, not seltzer, salsa. - What's the matter? - Nothing. You sure? - You look a little pale. - No, I'm fine. I'm good. Fine. Very good. - What, are you nervous? - No, I'm not nervous. I'm very good. - I can't do this. I can't do this. - What? I can't. I've tried. I'm here. It's impossible. - This was your idea. - What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were gonna listen to me! Don't worry about it. They're just TV executives. They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married. They have secretaries! - I told you not to come. - I need some water. I gotta get some water. - They'll give us water in there. - Really? That's pretty good. - Oh, God, it's Joe Davola. - Who? This guy's a writer. He's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine. Oh, God, he saw me. - Hello, Jerry. - Hey, Joe! How you doing? You're under no obligation to shake my hand. Oh, no. Just a custom. That's my friend, George. You look good. Why shouldn't I look good? No. No reason. You do the karate, right? Yeah, you wanna hit me? - What are you doing here? - I dropped a script off. Good for you. Well. - You don't have to say anything. - No - Hey, I guess I'll see you Sunday night. - Why? Kramer's party. - Kramer's having a party? - No. No, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know. It's nothing. He's not doing anything. I thought Kramer and I were very close friends. No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you're very close friends. Very close. Give my best to Hinckley. - What was that? - I can't believe what I did. I didn't know Kramer didn't invite him. I gotta call Kramer. They're ready for you. Okay. Okay. Look. - You You do all the talking. Okay? - Oh, relax! - Who are they? - Yeah. - They're not better than me. - Of course not. - Who are they? - They're nobody. - What about me? - What about you? - Why them? Why not me? - Why not you? - I'm just as good as them. - Better. - You really think so? - No. The bit The bit I really liked was where the parakeet flew into the mirror. That was funny. The parakeet in the mirror. That is a good one, Stu. Yeah. One of my favorites. What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know? Well, possibly. I I wrote an off-Broadway show. La Cocina. Actually, it was off-off Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef. It was It was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef. What was his name? - Pepe. - Oh, Pepe. Yes, Pepe. And he was making tamales. Oh, he actually cooked on the stage? No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it. So, what have you two come up with? We thought about this in a variety of ways but the basic idea is I play myself - May I? Go ahead. I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: Nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing. What does that mean? The show is about nothing. - It's not about nothing. - No, it's about nothing. Well, maybe in philosophy. But even nothing is something. Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone. - I'll call back. - D-A-L-R-l-M-P-E-L. Not even close. - Is that with a Y? - No. - What's the premise? - As I was saying, I would play myself as a comedian living in New York and I have a friend and a neighbor and an ex-girlfriend. - Which is all true. - But nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read, you eat you read, you go shopping. - You read? You read on the show? Well, I don't know about the reading. We didn't discuss the reading. All right, tell me about the stories. - What kind of stories? - Oh, no. No stories. No stories? - So, what is it? - What did you do today? - I got up and came to work. - There's a show. That's a show. How is that a show? Well, maybe something happens to you on the way to work. No. No! No! Nothing happens! Well, something happens. - Well, why am I watching it? - Because it's on TV. Not yet. Okay, look. If you wanna just keep doing the same old thing then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else: This is the show, and we're not gonna change it. Right? How about this? I manage a circus. I don't even wanna talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity. Well, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic, and you have no integrity. You really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to, like, Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the university level. Like where Freud studied, and have people looking and checking up on you. That's the kind you need. Not the once-a-week for 80 bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists, working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences. Observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about. That's the only way you're gonna get better. I thought the woman was kind of cute. Hold it. I really wanna be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about? Yeah. I thought I might give her a call. I don't meet that many women. I meet, like, three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name. - It's completely inappropriate. - Why? Maybe she liked me. I mean, she She was looking right at me. I think she was impressed. We had good eye contact through the whole meeting. - Oh, I forgot to call Kramer. - Wait a minute, let me call Susan. - No, this is more important. - She might leave work any minute. No, I gotta warn him that I told Joe Davola about his party. No! What is it? I was just thinking about this patient of mine. What? Just wondering if he's taking his medication. Come on. We're on vacation. Well, we were standing in the waiting area there and you know how Davola is. He's all - Yeah? - It's George. And so I felt very uncomfortable with him and, you know, I just blurted out something about your party. - Back up a second. - I didn't know that you didn't invite him. Why would I invite him? - Well, I just assumed that - Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication. - Well, hello. Oh, hello. - Hello. You remember Susan from NBC. - Of course. How are you? - Fine. Good to see you. - This is Kramer. - Hello. All right, go ahead, Susan. Tell him. - Tell me what? - Well, l I'm sorry. Excuse me one second. - Hello? - Hi would you be interested in switching to TMI long distance? Oh, l I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number, and I'll call you later? I'm sorry. We're not allowed to do that. I guess you don't want people calling you at home. - No. - Well, now you know how I feel. - So go ahead. Tell him. - Well Kramer, are you drinking that milk? - Yeah. - What's the expiration date on that? September third. - The third? - The third? Never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. I should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming. I think she saw it coming. You know, she was behind the idea. She was gonna champion the show. I was bringing her up to tell you, and she liked me. Look, just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead. What are you, crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on. Vomiting is not a deal-breaker. If Hitler had vomited on Chamberlain he still would have given him Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain. You could hold his head in the toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe. What happened to you? Davola came after me. What? Davola? See, this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened? Can I get coffee? You know, I was walking home I had to pick up my helmet from the shop. I had to get a new strap. So I had it on, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. And suddenly, I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down. I look up, and it's Crazy Joe Davola. And he says, \"That's what I think of your party.\" Boy, that is some kick. Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that. Wow, Newman's helmet. I got bad news for you, buddy. Davola says you're next. Me? Why? He doesn't like you. What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See, this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me. Pass the cream. Wait a second. All right. When you vomit on somebody it is a social faux pas from which there is really no recovery. At that point, there's really very little you can say to the person. There's no Hallmark cards that cover this occasion. There's no vomit sympathy-card section of the store, you know. \"You wear it well.\" You know, there's no words that really capture, you know \"Next time, lunch is on me.\" There's no, really, way to phrase the sentiment. Where the hell did I put it? - Where did I put it? - What are you looking for? The remote. The remote. I can't find the remote. Did l? I lost it. Did you take it? - Did you put it someplace? - No, no, no. All right, what is this? - What is what? - All right, very funny. I get it. - You're in a weird mood. - Come on. Go to your apartment and fix it. - Fix what? - Your pants! What is this? Why do I got one pant leg on for? Don't you know? Look at your face. You only shaved the right side of your face. - What is this, a joke? - No joke. What? A joke? You think this is funny? Well, look at your face in the mirror. - Yeah? - It's George. Come on up. - I don't believe this. - You didn't know you were doing this? No, I swear. I'll bet this is from that kick from that Crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some x-rays. Just the man I'm looking for. - Me? - Yeah. Here you go. - What's this? - A dry-cleaning bill. - From that woman at NBC? - Yeah. Dry cleaning bill for what? For vomiting on her vest. Oh, come on, George. I didn't do that on purpose. - I shouldn't have to pay. - Neither should I. Jerry left the milk in the refrigerator. - Yeah, it's your milk. - He drank it. - I didn't know. - All right. Well, we should all chip in, I guess. - Yeah. - How much was it to clean the vest? Eighteen dollars. Can you get vomit out of suede? - I don't know. - Yo-Yo Ma! What? Yo-Yo Ma? What about him? - You just said, \"Yo-Yo Ma.\" - What's Yo-Yo Ma? He's a cellist. You should see a doctor today. All right. Let's go. Six dollars. I can't believe she sent a cleaning bill. I know. And it doesn't really bode well for the show, does it? Forget about the show. We should take the idea to a different network. Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this. How did you get me to go with that? A show about nothing. It was a good idea. Susan liked it. And if he hadn't vomited all over her, we'd be writing it right now. What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What are you doing? Give me that. Go to your apartment and lie down. I'll make an appointment for a doctor. Hello? Oh, hi, I'm sorry. No, that's my neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding. Today? Yeah, sure. We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we could do that. Okay. Great. Thanks a million. Okay. Bye. - What? - NBC. They wanna have another meeting. They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it! They wanna buy it! What did I tell you? We'll be rich! What are we gonna get? - Fifty, 60 thousand. - I don't know about 60. Oh, it's gotta be 50. You know how much Ted Danson makes? Ted Danson. Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson? - I didn't say we're Ted Danson. - You did. You said we're Ted Danson. - You know, I think he wears a piece. - Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it. - What time do you have? - Five till. See, I'm 10 minutes slow again. That's it for this piece of junk. I've had it. - The one your parents gave you? - It never works. We're supposed to be there. We should take a cab. We'll be a little late. I'm not taking a cab. - I'll pay for it. - It's not the money. What is it you object to? The comfort? The speed? The convenience? Jerry! - Uncle Leo! - Hello! Hello there. How you doing? - How are you? How's Mom and Dad? - Good. Fine. What, are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore. Oh, no, I've been kind of busy, that's all. You know where I just came from? - Danny Barber. - Oh, sure. Danny. He used to be in the pajama business. Remember, I got my pajamas for free. I used to come over and give you pajamas. Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember. Funny thing is, I can't wear them. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a T-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just take the T-shirt off. Anyway, Danny says to me: - \"You need any pajamas?\" - I'm sorry, Uncle Leo. I really gotta get going. Well, you gotta get going, so go. We got a big meeting with the president of NBC. - Nobody got a gun to your head. - Yeah. I'm really sorry. Go. Really, I understand. You got an appointment. Go to your appointment. - I'm sorry. Really. - You know I know plenty of people in Hollywood too. Sorry. Really. - Yeah? - Come on, are you ready? Let's go. - For what? - What's with you? I just talked to you 15 minutes ago. - About what? - The courthouse. You gotta go with me to court. I'm contesting the ticket. - I can't. I'm going to the doctor's later. - You gotta go. You're my alibi. You have to take the stand. - Well, I can't. - Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't even be here today if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life. You would be dead! You would cease to exist. You'd be gone for the rest of eternity. Can you even begin to comprehend what that means? Shut up! I'll get my coat. Don't step on anything. There are many things that I think you can point to as proof that the humans are not smart. But my personal favorite would have to be that we had to invent the helmet. What happened was we were involved in a lot of activities that were cracking our heads. We chose not to avoid doing these activities, but instead to come up with some sort of device to help us continue enjoying our head-cracking lifestyles: The helmet. Not enough people were wearing them so we had to come up with the helmet law which is even stupider. The idea behind the helmet law is to preserve a brain whose judgment is so poor it does not even try to stop the cracking of the head it's in. Did you see the look on his face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? What are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives. I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself. You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives, \"Sorry, Uncle Leo there's a building full of people burning down. I do have to be running.\" He'll go, \"Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.\" - Look at this. - Why didn't you shave this morning? Because I shaved yesterday in the afternoon. - Why? - Because of the day before. It's a long story. I can't get back on schedule. Is that Joe Davola? It's not him! I can't live like this. I'm being stalked. Mr. Seinfeld. They're ready for you. Mr. Seinfeld. What about Mr. Costanza? I'm not here? All right. You promised. You're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea. - Just a little. - All right. A little. Okay. You all set? You got your story? - No. - When he stopped me I told him I was rushing because my friend was about to commit suicide. Now, you're that friend. All we need is a reason why you were gonna commit suicide. I never had an air conditioner. No. That's no reason to kill yourself. Why? It gets hot at night. You can't sleep. You ever try to sleep in a hot room? I sleep in a really hot room. I don't wanna kill myself. I've slept in really hot rooms, and I wanted to kill myself. No, no, that's not gonna work. Something else. I was never able to become a banker. Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You You You can't live without being a banker. Yeah, yeah. If I can't be a banker, I don't wanna live. - You must be a banker! - Must be a banker! Okay, we'll go with the banker story. Story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story. Otherwise, it's just masturbation. And people really have to care about the characters. Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love them. Otherwise why tune in? - Wouldn't tune in. - Would they tune in? - No tune. We like to look at a show as if it were an EKG. You have your highs and your lows. And it goes up and down. This show will be like a heart attack. Just a huge, massive coronary. So, what you said last week about no story you're a little flexible on that now. Is that what I said, \"no story\"? Because Jerry had to tell me later. He couldn't believe it. I said I said, \"Get out of here. No story? Is that what I said?\" Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and that's when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide. And then what happened? He became very loud and hysterical. He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and he begged me to let him go. And when I refused that's when he began to scream, \"My friend's going to die. My friend's going to die.\" I don't know how you guys feel, but we would like to be in business with you. - We would like to be in business. - Love to be in business. - We'll do business. - Business. - Let's have business. - This is business. Would it be possible to get a copy of La Cocina? Your off-Broadway play. Gee, you know It's It's the damndest thing. l I moved recently, and my files disappeared. Now l I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some foul play, but let me tell you: I am not through with that moving company. That's my vow to you. Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that I place great confidence in this lady's judgment. - Good judgment. - Good judgment. - That's a pile of judgment. - Yes. Yes, judgment with earrings on. So let's make a pilot. I had gone up to Westchester. I go every Tuesday. I do charity work with the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker. I don't understand. You see, it had been his lifelong dream to be a banker, and he Just the day before, he was turned down by a bank. I believe it was the Manufacturers Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank in two weeks to turn him down so I was I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible but l I distinctly recall him saying Hey, Yo-Yo Ma. So I sped home to save my friend's life, and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love to be loved and to be a banker. So then he didn't kill himself? No, sir, he did not. But only by the grace of God. He is in the courtroom today, sitting right over there! And he can corroborate my entire testimony. See! Told you! I told you! - Now all we gotta do is write it. - Yes! How are we gonna do that? - Hey! Congratulations. - Thanks. - Thank you. Thanks. - Thank you. You know, I thought you were mad at me. Mr. Seinfeld, you have a telephone call. Phone call? Who knows I'm here? Hello? Mom? How did you know I was here? Oh, I was not rude to him. That is baloney! I couldn't talk. I had a meeting. I don't know. He He went off on some thing about pajamas. When you sent me the bill, I thought the show didn't have a chance. Oh, it was only vomit. Anyway, I would like to pay for the dry cleaning. - Oh, no, no. It's okay. - Oh, no, no, no. We all chipped in. We have the money. Well, it was $ 18. - Okay, $ 18. There it is. There you go. - All right. So maybe we could get together this weekend. - Yeah. Call me. - All right. Great. - Bye. - Bye. Thanks. Bye. I can't believe she took the money. Why? I offered to pay.

Gotta get 50. We'll go. You call your manager. Maybe they made an offer. - Okay. - All right, let's go, let's go. Thirteen thousand? Thirteen thousand. - Apiece? - No, for both. That's insulting. Ted Danson makes $800,000 an episode. - Would you stop with the Ted Danson? - Well, he does. - You're nuts. - I'm sorry. I can't live knowing that Ted Danson makes that much more than me. - Who's he? - He's somebody. - What about me? - You're nobody. - Why him? Why not me? - He's good. You're not. - I'm better than him. - You're worse. Much, much worse. - There's Davola. - What? Where? - Where? - Outside. I just saw him outside. What is it? Oh, it's this patient. Again? I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication. Well, so he can live without his Valium for a couple of days. No, you don't understand. He could be dangerous. Go outside and see if he's there. I can't go. He knows we're friends. Well, what am I supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor. - Tell the cop. - Good idea. Excuse me, officer. There's a guy outside, and he's a nutjob, and he's waiting to beat me up. If you could just walk me outside and wait till I get into a cab. Yeah, all right. Just Just let me get a muffin. Thanks. He's gonna get a muffin. Then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life, isn't it? Hey, he's looking at the menu now. What's he looking at the menu for? I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin. What are you doing? - What? - What, you're ordering food now? Yeah. Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich. What happened to the muffin? I got a little hungry. All of a sudden you get hungry? Yeah. You got a problem with that? No. Enjoy your lunch. You know, a muffin can be very filling. - He's getting a sandwich now. - I thought he was gonna have a muffin. All of a sudden, he gets hungry. - You know, a muffin can be very filling. - I know. Mr. Kramer you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court, in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th? What do you mean, \"in my own words\"? Whose words are they gonna be? You know what I mean. - I was very upset that day. - And why was that? - Would you let me say? Let me talk. - All right. Go ahead. - All right. - Okay. I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker. And this failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating, eating, eating at you inside. Yeah. It was your family that pushed you into banking. It was their dream for you. - Mr. Newman? - I'm trying to establish Mr. Kramer's fragile emotional state. My entire case depends on it. Continue. - As you were saying, Mr. Kramer? - What was the question? You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking. Well, my father, when I was a kid he took me to the bank and he lifted me up, and he pointed to the teller, and he said: \"Sonny boy, take a good look at him. That's gonna be you someday.\" But you never became a banker, did you, Mr. Kramer? Why? Why did you fail? I don't know. Because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him! Isn't that true? - Could you get to the speeding? - Yes, I intend to, Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th you received a phone call, did you not? Phone call? Yes, a phone call. From who? - From me. - From you? Yes, from me! From me! I called you, remember? - You called me? - Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to - You were going to Remember? - What? You were gonna You were gonna You were gonna do something to yourself. You were gonna do something. Remember the banking! The banking! It wasn't working out. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call - Yes, a banker! - What banker? You're a banker! - Your Honor - That's enough, Mr Mr. Kramer is obviously very distraught. - I'm distraught? - You shut up! I demand a recess so that I can take him outside and help him regain his composure. That'll be $ 75. What's the matter with you, you jerk? We had it all worked out! Is he out there? Do you see him? I'm not sure. Well, either you see him or you don't. All right, I don't. What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee. What's with this guy? Did you just order coffee? - Yeah. - This is really too much. - What is your problem? - I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish for 20 minutes. Now you're drinking coffee. That's another 10 minutes. Well, you're just gonna have to wait. You never said anything about the banking. - You're off your rocker! - Hey, you guys. - Hey. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Is Davola outside? - Davola? - Yeah. - No, I didn't see him. - Crazy Joe Davola? - Jerry, yours is $ 11. - Eleven dollars? For what? Muffin, sandwich and coffee. Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot. The circus freak show? - No. - A pilot? What do you make for something like that? Fifty, 60 thousand? What's the difference? The money's not important. - Hey, Newman, is that your red car? - Yeah. - I think you're getting a ticket. - Run. - Go! Go! Go! - Hey, what are you doing? It's after 6:00! You can't give me a ticket! You're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. - I've got witnesses. - I saw the whole thing. This would be a good idea for the pilot. Get out of here. The vomiting is funnier. Oh, like you know. No. You do. Many states now have traffic school when you have an infraction. I went to traffic school. I didn't mind it. I felt bad for the instructor. This guy goes to traffic school every day, no matter how he drives. What is his incentive to not speed? He's going to traffic school, anyway. Why not get a racecar, do 200 miles an hour down the street? Cop stops you. \"Where you going?\" \"Traffic school.\" \"Go ahead. And you better hurry. You really need it.\" The punishment should be, instead of traffic school or traffic court, just traffic. They sentence you to 100 hours of traffic. Five people drive all around you at five miles an hour wherever you go. You're on your way to Vegas. There isn't a car in sight. Come on, move it.",
