  "transcript": "J.D.: After six weeks home with her baby, Carla was facing the decision that all new moms have to face, whether she should go back to work. Okay, so if we take my salary and subtract the cost of a full-time nanny, plus her health insurance, we would still end up with losing $5 a month? This is completely your decision. I don't care one way or the other. Maybe I'll try staying home with Izzy for a year. Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! As for me, ever since my pregnant girlfriend left, I've been a little clingy with my roommate. J.D., I'm gonna get a drink from the water fountain. You wanna come? Please, Elliot, I'm not that desperate. Although I am a little parched. Plus I could hold back her hair. Are you okay, ma'am? Ow many fingers do you see? Call 911 Emergency Why are you singing? Wait, why am I singing? Is there someone here with you?

Then why don't you just tell Turk that you want to go back to work? Well, what the hell am I gonna do? I could tell a bunch of lies I could buy him his own place I could bring the baby here with me Or tell him there's no space - Those are some lame-ass ideas. - We are so screwed. I'm sure you must be scared Not knowing what this test will bring It could prove that you are crazy Do you still hear people sing? It's best to know the truth Of that I have no doubt But you'll have to face the future When the truth comes out We are running a test That's a waste of our time But at least she'll accept That she's medically fine She'll admit that she's nuts Or I'll have to say snore Just give her the CA T scan And show her the door While we process your results We'll take you back to wait We've got drugs to calm you down So you don't stress about your fate BOT: It's best to know the truth Of that we have no doubt - But you'll have to face the future - You'll have to face the future When the truth comes out You're going to miss it, Carla You're going to miss it 'round here Gonna hurt him badly But you can't stay away For one whole year I know that I'm not crazy Everything comes down to poo I hope that I'm not crazy When we move I'm going to have My own private loo How am I supposed to tell him That he's not moving, too?

Let's face the facts about me and you A love unspecified Though I'm proud to call you Chocolate Bear The crowd will always talk and stare I feel exactly those feelings, too And that's why I keep them inside 'Cause this bear Can't bear the world's disdain And sometimes it's easier to hide BOT: Than explain our guy love That's all it is - Guy love, he's mine, I'm his - Guy love, he's mine, I'm his There's nothing gay about it In our eyes You ask me 'bout this thing we share And he tenderly replies It's guy love - Between two guys - Between two guys We're closer than The average man and wife That's why our matching bracelets Say \"Turk and J.D.\" You know I'll stick by you For the rest of my life You're the only man Who's ever been inside of me Whoa, whoa, I just took out his appendix. - There's no need to clarify - Oh, no?

Turk, I want to come back to work. It's who I am. Well, I always thought family was the most important thing to Puerto Ricans. I've had it up to here So let me make it very clear Because I swear I'll never clue you in again Every time that you profess I come from Puerto Rico Yes? For the last time, Turk, I'm Dominican! Don't make a big to-do I was simply testing you Then why'd you tell J.D. Our baby's Blaxican? Babe, you know I know the truth Well, I need a little proof So list all you know about me Or no sex again - Let's see, your name is Carla - Oh, yes - You are Latina - Impressive You're a nurse, your mother's dead And Wait, I've got it - Three sisters - Turk! Two sisters? Well, I'm sure you have A brother who's a huge jerk-off Tell me, what's my middle name?

Ow long before we met Was I in medicine? Was our wedding song The Beatles or Led Zeppelin? Am I freakin' Puerto Rican Or Dominican? The thing is guys remember facts Like what Derek Jeter hit last year Which was.303 And that is why our brains are maxed And there's no room for things like Birthdays or ethnicities Well, thank you for that glimpse Into the workings of the inner man Let's talk about your job And not the fact that you're Dominican! You're not staying home from work? Will that make you happy, Turk? I'll support you if you choose To earn the Benjamins Then I'll return to work today Now, you're sure that that's okay? I say, \"Sí\" Which is \"yes\" in Dominican - And Puerto Rican - Turk! But you're Dominican! Look, J.D., I don't want to let you down when your life is so crappy. - Move in with me. - No, Elliot, it's okay. I was just feeling sorry for myself. Plus, it's about time you lived on your own.

J.D.: In musicals, there's always a happy ending. But in life, sometimes when you get what you want, you end up missing what you left behind. Whether it's your roommate I'll see you in a little while, okay.  or time spent with your child. Or even the music you used to hear in your head. (HUMMING)",
