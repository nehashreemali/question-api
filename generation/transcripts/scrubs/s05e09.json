  "transcript": "What's going on? Ted and I are putting together an air band for that contest. Someone's gotta win those water park tickets. Might as well be us. Lloyd, slammin' solo, but I have to ask, how's things with the drug problem? Three days sober. Excellence. OK. We'll be in touch. Well, Mrs. Nickels, it was an honor being your doctor. Oh, you're such a nice young man. I'd love to set you up with my grandniece. Oh, thank you. I'm not big on blind dates. I know, I haven't hit it in a while, but there's good reason for that. Two good reasons: his face and personality. Sticks and stones may break my bones But words will hurt forever. Anyway, for me to be set up with your niece, I'd need to know a lot more about her. She's single. My blind date should be here any second. I gotta thank Mrs. Nickels for setting this up. Oh, Mrs. Nickels, you blue-haired bitch. Wait. She's veering off. Phew! OK, Mrs. Nickels. Your new hip is on the house because this girl is amazing. And yet there's something so accessible about her. I wonder what it is. Oh! Ooh, I'm gonna have the carrot cake. So she was a bit of a klutz. Did you see that? Please say no. No. From that moment on, it was the greatest date ever. We had so much in common. I ride a scooter, I love Harry Potter so much I sometimes wish I was a wizard and I've hated sports since I was a kid. Me too! Do you ever, like, drift off and have weird fantasies? Sometimes. So do you want me to see if they'll give us some more coffee or do you want to just call it a night? And then she gave the world's best answer. Neither. J.D., you home? My roommate. Back in one second. So I guess your date sucked, huh? Why don't you ask her if our date sucked? She's in my room. Twenty bucks says you blow it in five minutes. Unlikely, 'cause what's waiting for me in my room is what's known in football terms as a slam dunk. One Mississippi. Two Mississippi It's late. I gotta get going. I have a dog and a fish. I have to feed them and walk them and stuff. I'm Julie. Hi. I was Elliot. Twenty bucks, please. OK, double or nothing. I'll bet you I can jump from this couch to the counter. Check it. Eagle! Ugh! Ah! Oh! Pay me in the morning. # I can't do this all on my own # No, I know I'm no Superman # I'm no Superman # Why would Julie just take off like that? I'll bet you my body intimidated her. That's it. I am selling that Bowflex on Craigslist. I'm sure you said something that sucked all the romance out of the moment. You used to do that all the time when we were dating. Like when? Are you getting thicker? You feel a little thicker. What? Fine, I may have told her that she smells like my mom. Which, by the way, I maintain is a compliment. - What are you talking about? - Well, J.D. has this Already bored. Oh! Look! Will you say goodbye to Jack? I have to drop him off at preschool. Oh Bye, little man. Uh, Perry, this is your son, not a rescued pit bull. Give him a kiss. Jordan, he's starting to look like a guy and I'm just not real big on kissing guys. When my father showed me affection, he would miss when he threw bottles at my head. You are gonna be a much better dad than your dad was. Now give him a proper goodbye. Son, always a pleasure. - No more kissing! - Wh? You're crazy! That's right. He is. I don't understand. Why wouldn't you kiss him? Stay out of it, Carla. - Stay out of what? - Dr. Cox won't kiss his son. What is wrong with you? Ladies, hate to disappoint, but my quota for women who bug the bejesus out of me has been met for the next billion years. Now, Mrs. Wilk, you have developed an allergy to melphalan. I've come up with a new regimen that will enable us to continue treatment. OK. Oh, I think he described all the extra effort he put in so you would tell him what an amazing doctor he is. Now you've told me, it won't sound sincere. He won't care. Dr. Cox, you're amazing. It's just my job. Well, uh, thanks for coming to the audition in costume. What costume? Somethin' funny? Dude, I just came up with the perfect name for your band: Mercy Flush. Do you think this is easy? I don't know what it is, but he's got it. - He's going to be trouble. - I know. But he's so damn talented. I convinced Julie to meet me by explaining that my comment was a simple miscommunication. I wasn't saying you smelled like my mom. I was saying you smelled like Mu-Mum. It's an exotic flower that's indigenous to the hills of Costa Rica. God, I feel so stupid. Hugsies. Oh, Mommy. - See you later. - Yes. OK. Oh, gosh. - Oh, my God! - Oh, gosh! Oh, here. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! I am so, so sorry. - Oh, no, it happens. - It does. It happens. Bye. Isn't she great? So you got the second date. Just don't repeat the mistakes you made with me. Don't speed down the road and pretend your brakes are out. I don't care if it got you laid once in high school. It is not funny and I still have not forgiven you for killing that pony. But most importantly, if you ever find yourself in a romantic situation again, ignore whatever pops into your head. Just look into her eyes and say these exact words: \"I'm so glad I found you. \" Telling me what to say. Next you'll tell me how to kiss. Where does it end? You are such a good kisser, J.D. Hmm. Right back at you. And I love that you're calling me J.D. Stay away from my girlfriend, Elliot. And stay away from my J.D. wigs! Dr. Cox, could you help me with a central line? Fine, Lonnie, but hand to God, if you so much as look at me for the next month, I will mummify your head in surgical tape. Thank you, Dr. Cox. Is he gone? No. Hello? Mrs. London, this is Dr. Cox. He's going to be your doctor. Good news. Your intestinal bleeding can be fixed with a very simple surgery. Surgery? I'm a Jehovah's Witness. I can't get a transfusion. We believe that blood should not be passed from person to person. I'm a doctor. And we believe that without surgery, a patient in your condition can suffer from a major case of deadness. Don't worry, he'll figure out another way to treat you. No, he won't. I'm having so much fun hanging out with you. Can you believe we've been talking two hours? - Seriously? - Nah, while you were in the bathroom, I set the clock two hours ahead so you'd think time was flying by. Really? While I was in the bathroom, I wrote my name in the mirror with my finger so next time you took a shower and it fogged, you'd think ghosts were telling you to be with me. Looking at her, I knew what the future held for Julie and me. Smile. Oh, God, this mask is hot. Thanks for doing that. I wanted a picture of us old, you know? That way if one of us dies in a tragic skiing accident, we'll always have that memory of us together. That's so sweet. So, what do you want to do now? OK, romance is in the air. You gotta say something. Tell her about the hit-and-run. No, she loves ponies. Ask if she's been tested. Why are these thoughts popping into my head? My God, look at the size of her feet. Tell her. Stop it! OK, the silence has gone on too long. Say that thing Elliot told you, even though it's stupid. I'm really glad I found you. Yes! That was very tight. Well, it seems I've stumbled into the \"time well spent\" ward. Back in your cage, Ted. Oh, God. What have I done? Turkelton, I need you to volunteer to speak at a critical care conference. Yeah, I don't see that happening, Bobby. Excuse me? It's not like you're the king around here. 'Morning, Elliot. By the way, Julie's here. I'm not gonna kiss and tell. Oh, really? 'Cause I just got your text that said \"bone city. \" Oh, really? That came through? When you care about something, the last thing you want is it to be taken away. Whether it's a newfound hobby Why'd you want to see me? Quick announcement, people. From this moment on, there will be no air-banding allowed in the hospital. The king has spoken. Thank you very much. or the image of someone you looked up to. So, come on, tell me. What are you going to do with our Jehovah's Witness? I'm not gonna do anything. So, what's going to happen? I would say she's probably going to die. As for me, all I lost was my pride. Hey, Elliot. Oh, J.D.? I'm glad I found you too. Well, that sounds familiar. I think there's a tchotchke in my bum. So I had to use Elliot's advice with Julie. Luckily, she's not great at gloating. Ha-ha, you had sex with a beautiful girl you really like. Sometimes she needs a little help. You probably meant to say if it weren't for you, I'd still be dating my laptop. Right! In your face! Thank you. I like Julie, so don't do that thing you always do. If you're referring to the game Find the Saltine, relax. I don't even play that with Turk. No, I am talking about how you go a million miles an hour the minute you fall for someone. Don't go quickly or like I said, you'll end up with a beautiful girl. - Dating my laptop. - Dating your laptop. Thank you. I knew he'd be trouble. Hey, come on now. We're still a band, huh? Let's bring it in. Cool cats on three. - One, two, three: - Cool cats! Let's roll. When Mrs. Wilk was allergic to melphalan, you found a way around it. Why aren't you doing the same? Because Mrs. Wilk didn't choose to have her allergy, so Wait, there's a young man behind you with a quick medical question. Will you kiss me? Leaving. You know, you're eventually gonna have to kiss your boy. And you will have to treat that Jehovah's Witness. God, elevator. He's got my back, even if I don't technically believe in him. Behind your ear. My friend, you have found the Saltine. Don't tell Elliot we're still playing. Why do I care what Elliot thinks? She's not right about everything. I'm not gonna go too fast with Julie. Ooh, land for sale. Dr. Kelso, I'll go to that conference. Turkelton, I have many more pressing issues, starting with a gigantic paralyzed wife, ending with a gay son who's written a scathing musical about me called Dr. Dad, which, despite mixed reviews, has been held over in Buffalo. Why don't you just do whatever the hell you want to do. It was never about you saying no to the conference. It's the way you said it. You see that man there? His biggest pet peeve, except for storing deer meat in his mini-fridge, is people being disrespectful to him. Do you play? - Lonnie, what are you doing? - Since Dr. Cox won't treat Mrs. London, we have to transfer her to another facility. All right, listen up and listen good. I will kill anyone who tells Carla. That includes you, Mrs. London. I will save your life. Then I will take it away. Let's get to work. Lonnie are you looking at me again? No. Are we crazy to be thinking about buying this? No, it's a sound investment. And a great addition to my portfolio. Which consists of shares of Eastern Airlines stock and an unopened pack of Les Mis trading cards. J.D., this is a mistake. You're not Broker of the Year Whit Prowdy. Don't do this. You're going too fast. - Why should I believe you? - Because honesty is my business. I hate you, Whit Prowdy. Sir, can I talk to you for a second? Just you? Or all the Turkeltones? We don't just rock together. We roll together. Cool cats. Sir, I want to apologize for how I spoke to you. It was extremely disrespectful, and I can promise you it will never happen again. You bet your ass it won't. OK. So what's the deal, cranky pants? I am just sick and tired of having to live up to everyone's expectations. Lonnie needs a central line, you want me to help Mrs. London and every patient in this dump looks at me for some miracle cure. I mean, honestly, Carla, with Jehovah as my witness, sometimes it is just too much. Yeah, yeah. I'm not buying it. You've been putting up with that around here for 20 years. It's not just here. It's home. Jordan expects me to be this amazing, sensitive father. So that's what this is about? You shouldn't sweat this \"sensitive dad\" stuff. You'll get there. You don't know anything. Oh, really? How is it going with your Jehovah's Witness patient? Better. How'd you know I'd move too fast with Julie? How do you know that I can be that kind of dad? How'd you know Kelso just wanted respect? - Because I know you. - Because I know you. 'Cause I know him. This is so cool. What's happening? Dr. Cox didn't make eye holes! It's important we listen to people who know us best, because if you do, you might get to rock. You might get the confidence to be the father you want to be. Gimme this little boy. I love ya. I love you so much, I'm going to make a sandwich out of you. - Where you going? - \"Dad's gonna devour me. See you. \" Sometimes, it's fun to not listen and do whatever you want. So we bought it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go kiss my lady on my new half-acre. She is not graceful.",
