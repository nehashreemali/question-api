  "transcript": "J.D.: Previously on Scrubs - How'd you sleep? - Really well, actually. I knew it. You want to know why? This is my bed. I had it brought here because it's so comfortable. So we live together. Kind of, I guess. You are sneak-moving-in! Your ears are playing tricks. And, J.D., people should make a big deal about you leaving Sacred Heart. But don't be disappointed if it doesn't live up to the expectations you have in your head, okay? It's also the penny that you put in the door eight years ago. For the last time, I did not put a penny in the door. Admit it! Huntington's is caused by a faulty gene. And since your mother has it, you have a 50-50 chance of having it, too. Newbie, I know that you want this to be a very special day for the both of us. I get that. I truly do. You want feelings to be shared and you want hugs to flow. But that is not now, nor has it ever been who I am, and you know that. How could Dan not want to know if he has Huntington's disease? Maybe he's in denial. I mean, if it were me, I'd be going crazy. I'm going to go talk to him. I implore you, please do the one thing that I am beyond confident that you know how to do. Nothing. Do nothing. It is the patient's decision. Has Perry told you how he feels about you yet? No, and he says he's not going to. Well, just wait him out. You'll beat him in the end. Un Let it arrive. Acceptable. Unacceptable. - You love torturing him, don't you? - I do. How come you never tortured me, you know, like, when I first started? You were Bambi. Somebody had to teach you how to walk. Thank you for that. For being my teacher. No problem. Is there anything I can do to repay the favor? Tell me my husband loves me more than he loves you. It's about the same. I'll take it. I'm going to miss you, Bambi. I'm going to miss you, too. - Why are you stopping? - Why are you stopping? - I don't want to say. - Just say. Let's face it. We said goodbye too early. I don't think I've got another hug in me. Honest to God, I never thought I'd hear you say that. How could I ever not want to hug you? Has the world gone mad? This is crazy. We can do this. You're absolutely right, buddy. Come here. - Nope. Not feeling it. - You smell like regret. Let it go. Young lady, are you responsible for jamming those elevator doors? - No, good sir, I am not. - Tell the truth. Okay, I did it, but it was an accident. That's okay, because you came clean. And here's $ 10 to buy some ice cream. This is stupid. He blackmailed me into doing this. No improv-ing. Give me the money back. No. My script says to rip it up and walk away dramatically. She was supposed to be my long-Iost sister. - Were you getting that? - Look, it's been a very long day. Well, long days are like pancakes Admit it! Fine! I put a penny in the door! It was eight years ago. - What do you know? It finally worked. - It was an accident. It fell out of my pocket and rolled into the door. It was my first day. I didn't want you to be mad. - Do you believe me? - Yeah. I saw it happen. If you saw it happen, then why did you ask me back then - if I put a penny in the door? - It was a test of character. You failed, and you lost out on a wonderful friendship. We could still be friends. I can't do this all on my own No, I know I'm no Superman I'm no Superman So you're actually going to stop working around here? That's right, Ted. So you're actually going to stop working around - Thanks. - No worries. Did you know it's Dr. Dorian's last day? You should give him a hug and share your feelings about him. - Do you think you're funny? - Funny-Iooking! Pow! Hey, you. I'm trying to develop a sentimental side, you know, for my stupid kids, and you and I did it once, so - Take care. - Thanks, Jordan. So you're actually going to stop working around here? Ted, come here. I need to be horrible to someone. Well, that's weird, that you came. Ah, you seem like you need it. I'm super-sensitive about my skin today. Focus on that. - It looks really blotchy. - Yeah, and check this thing out. - Did you pick that? - No, it did it by itself! I want to touch it, but I don't! Did you just page me to ask me how much ibuprofen to give Mrs. Lenzner here? Well, I was worried it would exacerbate the patient's It's ibuprofen! Here's what you do. When she wakes up, get her to open her mouth nice and wide, then get some of those ibuprofen pills in your hands and throw them at her. Whatever sticks in there, that's the correct dosage. - And the cycle repeats, huh? - Beg your pardon? You yelled at me for the very same thing when I was an intern. I'm going to go ahead and jot that down as one of the most fascinating tidbits of the day. J.D.: So maybe that's who Perry Ulysses Cox is. A gruff, insensitive teacher. And after everything we went through, if I'm still just another student to him, it doesn't mean I should be any less grateful. Thank you for everything, Dr. Cox. Keep moving. J.D.: I expected that. I didn't expect this. - We're sorry. - We're sorry. About what? - I blew my goodbye. - The whole moving-in thing. - I did it too early, and now I can't hug - I totally blew it, because Guys, can you not talk simultaneously? - I can, but I'm not sure she can. - I can, but I'm not sure he can. - That was awesome! - That was awesome! Turk, your goodbye was great. And Elliot, I told you to move stuff in because I want you to be there all the time. I subletted my house. - That's aggressive. - I can't help it, I lost my mind. Still, guys, I want you to know, we're all good, okay? - Thanks. - Okay. J.D.: I understood their neediness, because I'm feeling it myself. And I know what's causing it. The future. I wanted to know what was next. Whether we would make it as a couple. Whether I would stay tight with my friend. Whether he'll even miss me when I'm gone. Hey. Hey. Where's your mom? They wheeled her out in her bed to get some kind of scan. - I should probably go check on her. - Before you go, I gotta ask, why aren't you gonna get that test? I don't know. I still might, you know, in the next few years or days. But right now, if I found out that I was eventually going to die from something Once you learn that information, you can't unlearn it. And this way, my future's still mine. It can be whatever I want it to be. - Does that make sense? - Yeah. Thanks. You're welcome. J.D.: My last chart. So your shift is officially over, and that'll do it. Nice knowing you, John Dorian. It was nice knowing you, too - What is your name? - Glen Matthews. - Well, that was easy. - Yeah, it's easy now. When I was a kid, I had a horrible impediment. I'd say \"Gen Maffewf.\" I'm glad I wasn't there during those times. Yeah, I would've torn you to \"pieffeff.\" - Why would you tell me now? - It's the first time you've asked. - No, it's not. - Pretty sure it is. I've been here for eight years, and I don't know your name. I call you \"The Janitor.\" I'm sure I have asked you what your name is. - I don't think so. - Really? People don't want to know a janitor's name. You've probably forgotten my name already. - Glen. - Glen. Maffewf. Well, then, so long, Glen Matthews. So long. - Hey, Tommy. - What's up? - Adiós. - See you. J.D.: Things rarely go exactly the way you want them to, so sometimes you make do with whatever you can get. - Good night. - Good night. Ah, he's finally gone. Talk about making a big deal over nothing, you know? I mean, Dr. Dorian was fine, but he was no better than any other doctor. For the record, he was the best that ever came through this dump. John Dorian was the first and only doctor I ever met who cared as much as I do, and you can forget about him being just an exceptional physician. Because the fact of the matter is, he was He's a damn exceptional person. That's why people gravitated to him. It's why I did. He was my friend. Thank you, God. That was beautiful. Oh, God, no. It's okay, Perry. You just said how you feel. Honestly, I am so full of your love right now, I literally could not take another drop. Brace yourself. I'm coming in. You smell like a father figure. Oh! Please stop. J.D.: Mmm. Great job, Sunny. You said your line perfectly. Ah, thanks. I worked on it. I knew it would set you off. Good night, best friend. He thinks I'm an exceptional person! You realize that even though he gets to leave, you have to stay? - I didn't think that out. - No. You didn't. J.D.: Endings are never easy. I always build them up so much in my head, they can't possibly live up to my expectations, and I just end up disappointed. I'm not even sure why it matters to me so much how things end here. I guess it's because we all want to believe that what we do is very important, that people hang on to our every word, that they care what we think. The truth is, you should consider yourself lucky if you even occasionally get to make someone, anyone, feel a little better. After that, it's all about the people that you let into your life, and as my mind drifted to faces I've seen here before, I was taken to memories of family Hey, little brother. Of coworkers Goodbye five from the Big Dog. Of lost loves You never called. I miss you. Even of those who've left us. There you are! Hi, tiger. And as I rounded that corner, they all came at me in a wave of shared experience. Keep it holy, Q-tip. Boing, fwap I broke my penis again, but this time it was fun. Take care, bra. Take real good care. I didn't kill her. Way to leave a cherry gig, bra. I got me some white meat. Key party later. There will be prostitutes. Did you ever go on that picnic? Make sure you do. I hate you so much, J.D. It's like a baguette. Hooch is crazy. J.D.: And even though it felt warm and safe, I knew it had to end. It's never good to live in the past too long. As for the future, thanks to Dan, it didn't seem so scary anymore. It could be whatever I want it to be. The book of love is long and boring No one can lift the damn thing It's full of charts and facts and figures and instructions for dancing But I I love it when you read to me And you You can read me anything The book of love has music in it In fact that's where music comes from Some of it is just transcendental Some of it is just really dumb But I I love it when you sing to me And you You can sing me anything The book of love is long and boring And written very long ago It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes And things we're all too young to know But I I love it when you give me things And you You ought to give me wedding rings And I I love it when you give me things And you You ought to give me wedding rings You ought to give me wedding rings J.D.: And who's to say this isn't what happens? Who can tell me that my fantasies won't come true, just this once? Good night. Good night. Out the door just in time - Hey! Say \"Action.\" - Action. Gotta meet the new boss by 8 a.m. The phone rings in the car The wife is workin' hard She's running late tonight again Well, I know what I've been told Whoa! I want to touch it, but I don't! Eighteen hos, take one. Mark. I'm no Superman You've got your love online Oh, that's funny, because we were bowling the other night, and he says, \"Man, no one ever says my name right,\" and I says to him, I says, \"Muh, you got two bigger problems than that. \"One of them is that seven-ten split that you left for yourself, \"and another one is, how about trying to write a movie \"without a big twist ending?\" He says, \"What's with the accent?\" I said, \"What d'you mean? This is just how I grew up.\" He says, \"I'm going to put you in a movie.\" I said, \"Okay.\" Then we're on a hayride later, and he makes a monkey face. I said, \"What in the world is this?\" He says, \"Hey, man, welcome to the big time,\" and he slaps me across the face. Why, I didn't know whether to . Or write a screenplay. Zach, just hit him. Zach, hit him. Hit him. Good God. Just hit him. Come on. Come on. Hit him. You got me, you got me! J.D. AND ELLIOT: Gabby only listen on Fridays She doesn't really Oh, my God, you're listening.
