  "transcript": "I don't know why, but I feel like Turk and Carla are upset with me. Still, I can't be sure so it's always good to test. May I have a pancake, please? OK, they're mad. I'm pretty sure it's because of my new girlfriend. She's amazing. Don't get me wrong, she's not the warmest person. - Neena, the funniest thing happened - I'm eating. Sorry. I'm starving. Wish I hadn't left my wallet at home. bread. Also the sex could be a little impersonal. So that's a no on cuddling? Turk and Carla's main problem with Neena is she's a malpractice attorney who's suing Turk. I was doing everything I could not to rub the relationship in Turk's face. I could probably do more. Good morning. I'll see you at the deposition. I'll try not to spank your lawyer as hard as I spanked him last night. Bye. FYI, there was no spanking last night, OK? Really? - Yeah. - Then this won't hurt. Nope. Hit him again, baby. Why? After spreading half a tube of what I thought was burn ointment on my butt, it was off to work. - What smells like Vagisil? - Nothing. How can I help you? Remember how I thought Mr Peterson's back pain was sacrolitis and you said it wasn't? Well, I was right. Yeah, you should never use scalding-hot coffee for a victory sip. It's a beginner's mistake. What are you so negative about? Elliot's come into her own as a doctor. Now that her mentor Molly is gone, she wants to prove it wasn't a fluke. Attention, staff. One of our hospital's board members is coming in as a patient. The first doctor to my office gets to treat him. Around here everyone's looking to prove themselves. Go! So, Craig, how's your grandmother doing? She's much better now. Thanks. It turns out it was just Thanks. J.D., how could you do this to Turk? You two are so close I have nightmares of you running away together. Where do we go? One time we went to Aspen. Oh, I hope it was summer. I'm not that big a skier. - Girls! I want an explanation. - Tell her our code. If you haven't had sex in six months you're not accountable for who you sleep with. Please. When you were single, you were never that desperate, were you? Oh, that was amazing. Yes, it was. We're all God's children in the dark. Christopher Duncan Turk, you tell him how you really feel just like you told me last night, or I will do it for you. \"Baby why does he hurt me so ba-a-ad?\" - I want you to stop seeing her. - Fine. But I'm only ending it because friends come first. - Plus, you already had sex with her. - Four and a half times. Later. Jordan, you're on the board. What is the story on my patient Mr Summers? Stick, I'm gonna warn you the same way I warn Perry when I have more than three scotches. Prepare to have your ass grabbed. That's disturbing in, like, eight different ways. Barbie, he's a sexist pig. He's gonna eat you alive. Look, I'm not the same doctor I was four years ago. - I am smarter, more confident and - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just skip the rest of your \"I'll show you\" speech and just walk away in a huff. I'm very busy. Thank you. So should we start this deposition or do you just want to hand us a big bag of money? \"Big bag of money. \" You aren't gonna freeze up around her again, are you, Ted? No chance. I'm drugged up. Plus, if I concentrate I think I can control the excessive flop sweat I get the second she speaks. Ted? You ready to get started? Whenever you're ready, Neena. First off, I'd just like to say that these charges We should take a short recess. - Believe me, you're better off. - I agree. Mr Korman contends the shoulder surgery he received ruined his tennis serve. I'd like to ask Dr Turk if his diabetes could have affected his performance in surgery? - You're diabetic? - Yes. I told you that. - Thought you were joking. - How is that funny? Well, it's a very serious disease, and I don't like you. How do we even know he plays tennis? Look at him. He's awful. You are awful. Wait for the serve. We're settling. I want you to know I still think you're a great doctor and I've been talking to my rabbi lately about me finally getting circumcised. It's not a religious thing. It's more for the ladies. What? Hey, Neena. God help me, I'm gonna miss that smile. I think because of the Turk situation we should probably stop seeing each other. No. You can't say no. No is the answer to a question and I clearly wasn't asking a question, Neena. I was making a dramatic statement, and I'm sorry but that statement was \"good-bye. \" You know, one of us is gonna tire eventually. So, how are we feeling, Mr Summers? I feel like my ex-wife is standing on my chest and not the pretty one. The fat one that had all my kids. Fantastic. I'd like to start by Listen, Goldilocks unless the next three words out of your mouth are some combination of sponge, bath, and my big white ass I'm not interested. Now, how about you be a nice little nurse and go find my doctor. - Actually, sir - His name is Elliot Reid. So, what's the word? Is this guy any good? Oh, he rocks. If my malpractice insurance goes through the roof you'll have to take a step down lifestyle-wise. I live in a tiny apartment with my husband, his best friend and their dead stuffed dog. What's the step down? Hey, come on. One of the most amazing things about you is that you never let anything beat you. I am pretty impressive. You are, and don't you let anything else get into that beautiful head of yours. OK? What could get into this man's head, baby? Huh? Tough day, huh? Want to talk about it? - Yeah. - Come on. Neena, it's over. No, it's not. In fact, I find myself oddly turned on by your \"baby horse standing up for the first time\" style of love-making. First of all, thank you. Secondly, I tried to be reasonable. If you want to see my dark side, you're gonna see my dark side. Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle. Tickle, tickle. - Yet another strong moment for you? - Why don't you tell me how this ends? You won't break up with me. Betray your friend. Is this some lawyer mind trick? It's not gonna happen. - Sit down. - I won't. I'm leaving. - You're gonna have sex with me. - I'll do nothing of the sort. And as the ultimate act of betrayal, you will do it on the very same sweat-and-tear-soaked table where I crushed your friend. Oh I hate a dirty table. I love a dirty table. God help me, I do. I do love a dirty table. OK, Mr Summers, your EKGs came back and Dr Reid liked what he saw. When the hell am I getting out? Dr Reid thought you might ask that and had an answer. Shut your cakehole! He also said for you to stop paying off orderlies to sneak you cheeseburgers. Wow. He's old school. - Like me. - Hey! That belongs to Dr Reid. So you and Reid Yes, we're lovers. Red-hot lovers. I'm guessing he's married? She doesn't understand him like I do. I love this guy. Not like I do. Turk's kind of in a dark place right now, so stay away from him, OK? Nothing personal. You're just an awful human being. Of course. But we kind of crossed paths already. Life is pointless, Gandhi and I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. The only thing more pointless than life itself is being a doctor. I mean, bottom line, you spend eight years and 200 Gs to get through med school, and what do you have to show for it? I'll tell you. A diploma on your wall and a bull's-eye on your back. And you reminded him that people are basically good? People suck. They suck. And make no mistake about it even sweet little old ladies are looking to bend you over a chair in court. Come on. We covered people. And I know you would never do anything to ruin his innocence. You see, there is a compartment in the hat so the stinkin' rabbit is actually in there the whole time. Right? People pretty much hear what they want to hear, OK? What did you do? Excuse me. My son is interested in becoming a doctor and maybe you could tell him what it's like. I'd love to. I would love to. Do you have a dog, bowl cut? Well I want you to find a pile of its best work and roll all around in it. That's how it feels to be a doctor because here's the dirty little secret people don't want your help. They want your dignity, your pride. But mostly, they want your money. Good luck in med school. Oh. The next time you see a magic show the bunny was in the hat the whole time. Peace out. You are so dead. You can only keep the truth hidden for so long. Enough is enough. I want to meet this Dr Reid. No problem. Frick. Turk, wait! Let's sit down and talk about this. And when the truth comes out it doesn't set you free as much as you'd hoped. Hey, buddy. Especially if it involves betraying your best friend. Did we win? Hold on, Turk. Haven't you ever heard of keeping your enemies closer? I was keeping her close, Turk. Hey, Gandhi. I think we should talk. What do you think? Sure, Dr Cox and I were feeling guilty but if Turk didn't want to talk about it, we were in the clear. May I have a word with you two? Hey, who wants to be me? Craig, you're probably still mad at me. Anyone else? Dr Reid at your service. OK, that's a no for Todd. Isn't there anyone here that I can trust to be me? Hello. I'm Dr Reid. Dr Elliot Reid. I'm a doctor. What is the matter with you two? J.D., you said you were gonna break up with Neena. Believe me, the whole time we were having sex I was thinking about Turk. - That came out wrong. - And you why do you want everybody here to be as miserable as you? How could you not get this? What does misery love? All right, look Company! Misery loves company! Misery loves company. Oh, God. OK, sure. Maybe we did screw up, just a poquito but come on, we're definitely not the ones that you want to be mad at. Oh, yeah? Then who? Hiya, fellas. Summers - I think we can save your foot. - It's his heart. I know that. We're concerned about your ticker. Yes. Yes, yes. Well, your paper strip looks good. But, we're going to have to listen to that heart of yours. I'm afraid I was wrong. We're going to have to take that foot. My talk with Carla gave me the courage to take a stand. After all, misery loves camaraderie. Look, Neena Talk about ending our relationship, I'll punish you. Punish me? How? You know what? Now, this is cra I am not gonna get your name tattooed on my ankle, OK? Enough is enough, all right? A man has to have his limits. Let's get out of here. Come on. And that's when I realised I would never be strong enough to break Neena's hold over me. I needed help. I needed someone even scarier than she was. I needed a real witch. It's a witch! Somebody must have left this here from Halloween. God, Dr Cox is gonna go off on me worse than when my brother Barry caught me reading his Playgirl. - Don't you mean Playboy? - No. Your brother's Has he actually told your family - No. - Everyone's positive - Do you think he and another guy - No more questions. Elliot, if you can handle that sexist dirtbag in there - You can certainly handle Perry. - Why are you being nice to me? Perry occasionally talks to me at home and he told me that you don't need him as much anymore and it annoys the hell out of him which, of course, gives me endless enjoyment. Don't go backwards. Own what you did with Mr Summers. You are so much stronger than all the other idiot residents around here. Really? Jordan, I need you to break up with somebody for me. Really. Hey, there's no pie here. Oh, my God! You two are gonna kill me. Nobody's gonna kill you. Hi. I'm Dr Nobody. I see. This is your Hippocratic Oath? Schoolyard threats? Seriously, is there no pie? Look, Turk I know you feel like you did right by him but you have to acknowledge that Mr Korman feels like you let him down. Hey, you know what? I don't feel that way. I know you did the best job you could. But there's something that you should know about me. People hate me. But in tennis they're forced to interact. So for three hours two Sundays a month I have friends. You know what I mean? So, what you're saying is that even though you think my husband did a great job you've decided to crush his spirit by putting a permanent black mark on his medical record over a tennis game? I fear I've said too much. OK, this woman is horrifying, so don't panic. - I'll be fine. - I was talking to myself. There you are. Get in the backseat and lie on the floor. - OK. - Back. Neena. Word? Oh, it's so on. You got something to say, say it. The thing about strong women if you call them out, they're gonna give you a piece of their mind. I should've known, Barbie. You have been impersonating a doctor since the first day you got here. I did what I had to do to treat this guy. As far as me being scared about you telling him that I'm full of crap Hey, jerkwad! I'm Dr Reid! - What? - And by the way I had a chat with your wife. I know I'm in your head. It took me three years to move in and I'm not moving out. Here's what's gonna happen. You'll drop this lawsuit because it's wrong and you know it but also because if you don't, I'll pound the plaid right off that shirt and make it so the only way you'll be able to eat pie is through a straw. You come in here and walk around like you're the queen bee? Guess what, missy. This is my house. You and Mr Chestless here are over. So move on. Cos if you don't I'm gonna turn your little lame liaison into a threesome starring yours truly. And I don't kiss nice. And just like that, we all knew who had won. Ouch. Yeah! OK. Fine. It's over. I'm free? Hey, you. Go get in the back of my car. Awesome. Wow. Thanks, Jordan. I'll see you around. Not so fast. You're my bitch now. Jordan's making me stretch out her new jeans. Cry me a river. You know what Gandhi's wife made me do this afternoon - Cos I supposedly crushed his spirit? - What? Ever since the surgery, I've been serving lefty. A little unpredictable, but I'm getting some good heat. Can't wait to see it. Hit you on the fly! Fifteen-love! Turk, I'm sorry about Neena. It's OK, man. She's a woman. I understand. And the truth was he did understand. No matter how much we like to pretend otherwise strong, confident women will always have the power over us. Whether they're fighting for respect or fighting for their man or even just fighting for the hell of it. Strong women make all guys feel the same way. Jordan looks mad. I should go. I have to pick up Carla's dry cleaning. Well, what do we have here? Oh, no. I heard from a reliable source that you want to live in a dumpster. I can arrange that. Yep, I know just the right neighbourhood.",
