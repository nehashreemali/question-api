  "content": "The Westview Anomaly, also known as the Hex, was a phenomenon that occurred when a grieving Wanda Maximoff unleashed a surge of chaos magic that dispersed a massive energy field surrounding the town of Westview, New Jersey. This energy field isolated the town's inhabitants and left it forgotten by anyone related to it outside of its reach. With all the townsfolk under Maximoff's thrall, she inherently manipulated them into performing a broadcasted periodical sitcom dubbed WandaVision.\n\nThe authorities soon became aware, with the investigation initially starting as a missing-persons-case sanctioned by FBI agent Jimmy Woo. S.W.O.R.D. later became the primary organization spearheading the investigation, observing the mystery surrounding the energy field. Over the period of time in which the Hex was active, Agatha Harkness began manipulating events from inside the Hex to trick Maximoff as a ruse for Harkness to steal her magic. When S.W.O.R.D. launched an offensive to break into the Hex, Maximoff defeated Harkness in a duel, and took down the Hex, ending the Anomaly. In the aftermath, the incident was covered up as a botched Avengers training exercise to maintain Maximoff's public image outside Westview. Maximoff herself went into hiding to study the Darkhold, and the residents of Westview vowed never to speak of her again.\n\nFollowing Vision's death at the hands of Thanos, his body was retrieved by S.W.O.R.D. and disassembled. After the Blip, Wanda Maximoff visited the S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters in an attempt to recover Vision's body and give him a proper funeral. She met Director Tyler Hayward, who led her to the operating room containing the remains of the synthezoid. Hayward explained to her that due to the legalities of the Sokovia Accords, as well as the valuation of the vibranium in Vision's body, Wanda could not claim the body.\n\nAngered, Maximoff shattered the glass separating her and the corpse. S.W.O.R.D. gunmen draw firearms at Maximoff, but Hayward ordered them to stand down. Examining the corpse, she attempted to read Vision's feelings, but was heartbroken to find nothing inside. She then proceeded to leave the base without further incident.[3]\n\nAfter her confrontation with S.W.O.R.D., Wanda Maximoff drove into the town of Westview and arrived at 2800 Sherwood Drive, where she and Vision had planned to build a home together. Out of her overwhelming grief, she released a colossal surge of chaos magic that constructed a house out of thin air, turned the town of Westview into a sitcom-themed false reality, and created another version of Vision, whom she planned to live her ideal life with there.[3]\n\nApproximately three weeks after the events of the Blip and the Battle of Earth, a man placed in witness protection in Westview ceased to keep in contact with the FBI. Upon further investigation, FBI agent Jimmy Woo discovered that not only could he not contact the man, but his friends and family had no recollection that the man had even existed. Going to Westview, Woo was further confused to find that no one at all had any memory of the town or its inhabitants. With the abnormality of the situation clearly outside the FBI's abilities, S.W.O.R.D. was called in to assess the situation and help out.[1]\n\nMonica Rambeau was assigned to the case at the urging of Tyler Hayward, traveling to New Jersey as soon as the case was given to her. Upon arriving outside Westview, Rambeau was briefed by Jimmy Woo on the situation as well as a demonstration of the bizarre case of amnesia surrounding Westview by two police officers. Rambeau decided to fly a S.W.O.R.D. drone into Westview to get a better grasp of things, but the drone disappeared as soon as it entered the town. Rambeau approached the town's borders and found some sort of energy barrier, which allowed passage through it when she placed her hand on the barrier. Despite Woo warning her not to, Rambeau probed the barrier further and was sucked in.[1]\n\nWith the uncertain fate of one of their leading agents, S.W.O.R.D. established a base just outside and called in experts from every scientific field imaginable, including Darcy Lewis, and Jimmy Woo remained active in the investigation along side the S.W.O.R.D. personnel. Lewis set her equipment up in the command center of the base and immediately found background cosmic radiation, which at that moment, was at a safe level. But her next discovery came in the form of a television transmission sent out by the energy barrier. Using an old television set, Lewis was able to monitor the fictional WandaVision program, which revealed the fact that Avengers Wanda Maximoff and Vision were inhabitants of the so called \"Westview Anomaly\", a startling revelation as Vision was reportedly dead. Now knowing the identities of at least two people inside the anomaly, headway was made in identifying the other people on the program as having real world counterparts such as \"Mrs. Hart\" actually being Sharon Davis. WandaVision was monitored for several episodes in the hopes of finding Monica and discovering anything else about this sitcom reality.[1]\n\nActing director Hayward decides to order a manned expedition into Westview, selecting Agent Franklin to go through the sewer system and emerge in the town. Meanwhile, after spotting Monica in the role of \"Geraldine\", Darcy and Jimmy attempt to contact Wanda through a radio transmission into Westview while she is talking with Dottie Jones. The transmission unexpectedly skips ahead to the end of Wanda's meeting, forcing Darcy and Jimmy to conclude that their attempt failed. Franklin emerges on the other side of sewers inside Westview, in the outfit of a beekeeper and in full view of Wanda, only for her to say \"no\" and rewind time to before Franklin emerges from the sewer, with the added effect of the transmission going to color and transition to a 70's aesthetic. Darcy and Jimmy continue to watch the broadcast, up till the point where Wanda births her twins and Monica references Pietro Maximoff's death at the hands of Ultron.\n\nThe transmission then skips ahead to the credits, causing Darcy to conclude that someone is censoring the broadcast. Just then, alarms start blaring and something is being detected as emerging from Westview. Rambeau promptly flies out of barrier, still in 70's clothes, and lands just outside the base. While S.W.O.R.D. personnel surround her, she started muttering that anomaly was Maximoff's doing.[1]\n\nNot long after Monica Rambeau was ejected out of the Westview by Wanda Maximoff, she got back to work. She tried to find a way to reach Maximoff inside the Hex alongside Darcy Lewis and Jimmy Woo. Together they figured out that if they sent something that required no change into the hex they could reach Maximoff. Rambeau alongside Tyler Hayward put this theory to the test when they sent a 1980s Stark Industries S.W.O.R.D. Drone into Westview. Rambeau attempted to communicate with Maximoff but was unsuccessful. Hayward used the opportunity and tried to take out Maximoff with a missile, which also failed. The drones feed went down and then the alarms went off as the barrier of the Hex had been breached by Maximoff. Maximoff was in her Avengers suit and had the destroyed drone with her. She threw it at Hayward and asked if it was his. All the S.W.O.R.D soldiers had their guns focused on Maximoff. Maximoff told them to leave her alone and she said that if they do not bother her, she would not bother them.\n\nRambeau stepped in and tried to reason with Maximoff, arguing that she was an ally and could help her and give her what she wants. Maximoff replies that she has what she wants and that no one will take it from her. Maximoff used her powers to mind control the soldiers and made them aim their guns at Hayward. Maximoff walked off and fortified the Hex, turning it red, and returned to Westview.[4]\n\nWhen Vision broke out of the Hex, he slowly began to crumble, with pieces of him being pulled back into the Hex. Darcy Lewis tried to assist him but was reprimanded and handcuffed to a Humvee by Monti. Billy Maximoff alerted his mother about Vision's location. In response, Maximoff froze the citizens of Westview and used her powers to expand the barrier to save him. The Hex saved Vision's life but it continued to expand, engulfing the S.W.O.R.D Response Base and turning it into a traveling circus. The S.W.O.R.D agents engulfed became clowns and members of the circus, including Darcy Lewis, who became an escape artist. It then continued to expand, consuming the Westview sign and a local car dealership.[5]\n\nAfter barely escaping the expanded barrier, Monica Rambeau and Jimmy Woo traveled to the base of Major Aly Goodner, who provided Rambeau with the presumed means of re-entering the Hex, via a S.W.O.R.D. Space Rover. However, this proved to be wrong when the rover could not enter. Rambeau, determined to enter, pushed herself through the barrier, rewriting her already rewritten cells, giving her enhanced abilities.[6]\n\nMeanwhile, Hayward used Chaos Magic found on the dismantled S.W.O.R.D. Drone Maximoff returned, to reactivate the original body of Vision.[3]\n\nThe witch Agatha Harkness confronted Wanda Maximoff at the Westview town centre in an effort to obtain her chaos magic powers. Aiming to manipulate Wanda emotionally, Harkness freed the Westview residents from Wanda's enthrallment, leading them to immediately bombard her with pleas and questions regarding their loved ones. Overwhelmed by guilt, Wanda collapsed in anguish, releasing a wave of energy that began suffocating all of them. She hastily reversed the effect, but finally realized the damage she had inflicted on Westview through her influence, and began to destroy the Anomaly.\n\nSpotting an opening in the barrier, Tyler Hayward ordered armed S.W.O.R.D. units into the town with the intent to eliminate Maximoff. As Wanda was destroying the Anomaly, her Vision and children began disintegrating right in front of her, which caused her to bring the hex back up. The Maximoff family prepared to fight Harkness, Hayward, and the original Vision - reprogrammed to serve as S.W.O.R.D.'s sentient weapon.\n\nBringing a brief scuffle to an end, Wanda's Vision was able to peacefully negotiate with the original and successfully restored the latter's memories. Billy and Tommy used their abilities to neutralize S.W.O.R.D., while Monica Rambeau and Darcy Lewis joined to pin Hayward down. In the skies above Westview, Wanda was able to nullify Harkness's magic by casting protection runes on the walls of the Hex before proceeding to absorb the witch's magical essence, rendering her powerless. The surge of magical energy caused Wanda to morph into the Scarlet Witch as depicted in legend.\n\nWith Harkness neutralized, the Maximoff family came to terms that it was time to move on from Westview. The Hex began to retract, slowly reversing its reality overwrite across town and restoring Westview to normal.[7]\n\nThe dissolution of the Anomaly meant that Wanda Maximoff's chaos magic constructs — Vision, Tommy, Billy, and their house — could no longer continue to exist. Maximoff returned to Monica Rambeau at the town square, where all of her former thralls scowled at her. Monica did not share the resentment however, instead expressing empathy towards her sacrifices, and revealed that if given the power, she would have brought her mother, Maria Rambeau, back. Maximoff apologized to Rambeau for her actions and admitted that she remained a novice at understanding her newfound powers but was determined to master them.\n\nAs the authorities arrived, Maximoff bid farewell to Rambeau before fleeing Westview for exile in Sokovia to a valley by the mountains, taking the Darkhold with her to better understand her Scarlet Witch abilities. Jimmy Woo emerged and took command of the Westview Investigation, while Tyler Hayward was arrested by the FBI.[7]\n\nThe unfortunately traumatic events of the Westview Anomaly had left the town residents with a deep fear of Maximoff's name as they tried to go back to their lives.[8] Some even vandalized the vacant lot where the Vision Residence used to be.[9]",
