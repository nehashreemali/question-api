  "content": "An Incursion is a probable result of prolonged Multiversal travel that can cause one or more universes to be entirely destroyed.\n\nIn 2018, Thanos started a crusade to gather the Infinity Stones. Doctor Strange used the Darkhold to search the Multiverse, using dreamwalking, to find a way to stop him. However, his actions resulted in an Incursion, which destroyed another universe and killed everyone in that universe.[1]\n\nIn another universe, Doctor Strange used dreamwalking to travel across the Multiverse to kill versions of himself. This eventually caused an Incursion between the universe he originated from and another one. The Incursion managed to destroy his universe to the point where he was the only one left alive.[1]\n\nIn late 2024, Doctor Strange met Clea who informed him that he had caused an Incursion and insisted that they had to fix it.[1]\n\nAfter Janet van Dyne was captured by Kang the Conqueror, he revealed to her how the Multiversal War between his Variants caused countless Incursions and threatened the stability of the Multiverse as a whole, which led to his campaign that resulted in his exile to the Quantum Realm.[2]",
