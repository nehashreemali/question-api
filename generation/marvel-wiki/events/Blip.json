  "content": "The Blip[2] was the resurrection of the victims of Thanos' Snap. It occurred after the Time Heist, in which the Avengers took Infinity Stones from different timelines to assemble the Nano Gauntlet, which Bruce Banner used to restore half of the universe's population.\n\nThe Blip had far-reaching consequences across the entire universe. On Earth, millions of citizens displaced by the Blip began living as refugees; they fell under the jurisdiction of the Global Repatriation Council, which aimed to return the refugees to their home countries.\n\nWhen all of the Infinity Stones were collected during the Time Heist and returned to the present, Bruce Banner, Tony Stark, and Rocket began working on a new gauntlet that would harness the power of the gathered Stones, allowing the wearer to bring back everyone killed by the Snap. Using Stark’s nanotechnology and their knowledge of Thanos’s Infinity Gauntlet, they created the Nano Gauntlet. Thor volunteered to use the Nano Gauntlet, but Stark, Steve Rogers, and James Rhodes noted that Thor was neither physically able nor emotionally stable enough to wield such power.[3]\n\nBanner warned his teammates that because of the Infinity Stones' unique gamma radiation signature, the Nano Gauntlet could kill anyone who tried to wear it, including Thor. Banner volunteered himself, reasoning that his body stood the best chance of surviving a massive burst of gamma radiation.\n\nAs Banner donned the Nano Gauntlet, the Avengers readied themselves. Stark ordered F.R.I.D.A.Y. to initiate lockdown procedures across the Avengers Compound in case the Gauntlet's energies proved too powerful to contain. Meanwhile, the alternate Nebula began covertly sabotaging the Avengers' Quantum Tunnel.\n\nBanner used the Gauntlet to channel the power of the Stones, screaming as the radiation scorched his right arm from his hand up to his shoulder. Despite Thor's plea for him to stop, Banner pushed through the intense pain and snapped his fingers, then collapsed, overcome by the effort. As the gauntlet fell from his hand, Stark rushed to Banner’s side and sprayed him with a substance to treat the burns.\n\nWhile Banner was seriously injured, he successfully restored everyone who had been a direct victim of the Snap.\n\nAnt-Man guessed that the mission of restoring the universal population to life had worked when he looked outside and saw a flock of birds appear, seemingly out of nowhere. At the same time, Clint Barton received a phone call from his wife, Laura, who had previously perished in the Snap. Banner, still dazed, noticed the Sanctuary II hovering above the glass ceiling. Before he could react, the Sanctuary II fired, destroying the Compound and separating the Avengers in the collapsing rubble.\n\nRogers, Stark, and Thor—the only Avengers to have remained on the ground level floor of the facility—confronted an alternate Thanos sitting amongst the ruins. Unimpressed with the results of his initial Snap, this Thanos sought to destroy the universe entirely and recreate it as he saw fit. Following a lengthy and violent struggle, Stark and Thor became temporarily incapacitated, leaving Rogers to face Thanos alone.\n\nAs Rogers, Stark, and Thor battled Thanos, Barton fell into the tunnels below the compound. Exhausted, he recovered the Nano Gauntlet but was tricked into handing it over to the alternate Nebula. Meanwhile, Ant-Man, upon finding Banner, Rhodes, and Rocket buried and drowning under the ruins of the Compound, became Giant-Man and carried them to the surface.\n\nAs Thanos summoned his armada in full force, Rogers received a transmission from Sam Wilson, who had also been killed in the Snap. When Wilson and an army of other Avengers and allies restored to life started arriving through portals created by the Masters of the Mystic Arts, Rogers led the charge against Thanos' army, and the final battle began in earnest.\n\nThose resurrected by the Blip returned to either the specific location they had disappeared from five years earlier or the nearest safe alternative.[4] The Daily Bugle reported that surgeon Karen Oggerton, who disappeared along with a patient in the Snap, was able to finish the procedure that had been interrupted when they both reappeared.[5]\n\nIn a Louisiana hospital, staff were overwhelmed as people reappeared and everyone scrambled to reach their loved ones or help patients. Monica Rambeau returned from having disintegrated in the Snap to find that her mother had survived the Snap but later died of cancer.[6]\n\nAt the Midtown School of Science and Technology, students who had crumbled to dust five years ago suddenly reappeared in the nearly-empty school gymnasium. While those resurrected were the same age they had been at the time of Thanos’s Snap, those who had survived the Snap had grown five years older.[7]\n\nTwo weeks later, WHiH World News and NY1 were actively reporting on families being reunited.[8] As a result of the five years that passed between the Snap and the Blip, many were displaced from their homes. The mass displacement was so acute it caused the United Nations to create the Global Repatriation Council, a supranational organization that was given a mandate to help the returned people get housing and several forms of social security.[9] In New York City, the Salvation Army sought donations to provide housing for displaced persons, with volunteer May Parker using Spider-Man to draw attention to the fundraising campaign.[7]\n\nIn the United States, the National Blip Support Hotline was founded for Americans victims of the Snap. In San Francisco, a dating service exclusively designed to pair up victims of the Snap known as Blip Sync was launched.[10]\n\nMeanwhile, restored students like Peter Parker, Ned Leeds, Michelle Jones, Flash Thompson, Betty Brant, and Jason Ionello found themselves five years behind their 2018 classmates due to not having aged the five years. Since many of Midtown's previously snapped students had failed to go through the entire school year and take finals, they were told that they had to start all over again, notably with Parker's class having to retake junior year during the remnants of the 2023-2024 school year.[7]\n\nThe restoration of Earth's population eventually triggered the Emergence of Tiamut the Communicator, which was previously delayed due to the population being halved five years prior. The Avengers' bravery led Ajak to realize that there was something special about Earth that needed to be protected. Aware that the Emergence would result in the inevitable destruction of the planet, the Eternals took it upon themselves to prevent Tiamut from emerging after the death of Ajak. Ikaris was determined to carry out his purpose and turned against his allies, although Sersi managed to turn Tiamut to stone.[11]",
