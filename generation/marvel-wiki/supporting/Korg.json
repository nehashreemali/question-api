  "content": "Korg is a Kronan warrior who was imprisoned on Sakaar and was forced to participate in the Grandmaster's Contest of Champions alongside his friend Miek. Upon meeting Thor, Korg helped him and Bruce Banner escape from Sakaar with help from Valkyrie. Sparking a rebellion, he led the former prisoners of Sakaar, along with Loki, on a trip to Asgard, where they provided reinforcements and fought the Berserkers. As Ragnarök was unleashed, Korg witnessed the destruction of Asgard and stayed with the surviving Asgardians on their flight towards Earth. Months later, their ship was attacked by Thanos, although Korg escaped.\n\nAfter the Snap, Korg was one of the survivors and relocated in New Asgard on Earth with Miek and the rest of the surviving Asgardians. He spent five years keeping Thor company as he descended into a drunken hermit over his failure to stop Thanos. In 2023, Korg joined the battle to defeat an alternate Thanos, before heading back to New Asgard under Valkyrie's new rule. The following year, he traveled to Indigarr, which he helped defend alongside Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nKorg and Thor then returned to New Asgard after they learned it was under attack by Gorr the God Butcher. When Gorr kidnapped the Asgardian children, Korg traveled with Thor and his allies on their quest to Omnipotence City, where they sought the aid of Zeus. Korg was nearly killed when Zeus struck him with his Thunderbolt, losing most of his body in the process. After failing to defeat Gorr in the Shadow Realm, Korg stayed behind in New Asgard. As his body fully regenerated, he met another Kronan named Dwayne, with whom he had a son.\n\nKorg was first born when two Kronan men O-Korg and Ahna met together inside a cave on Ria and held hands for a birthing ritual. A month later Korg was born. Later he was given to an adoptive mother who he was raised by.[1][3]\n\nSometime after he became an adult, Korg was forced to become one of the Grandmaster's champions on the planet Sakaar after his rebellion against him failed when he was unable to collect enough support. The only people that turned up were his mother and her boyfriend, whom he hated. He reflects on this later in his life, joking that he \"didn't print enough pamphlets.\" Korg met and became friends with another gladiator, Miek.[3]\n\nIn 2017, Korg encountered Thor after he was thrown into the gladiator's quarters. He struck up a conversation with him, introducing himself and his friend Miek to him and insisting that Thor not be intimidated by his appearance. Once Korg had confirmed to Thor that he was indeed a Kronan, Korg then explained how he had first gotten to Sakaar following his own failed revolution.\n\nAs Thor had attempted to explore their cell, he discovered that it was a magic circle which Korg described as a freaky circle. Thor and Korg then discussed the Grandmaster's champion, with Korg telling him that everyone who fought against the champion inside the arena had died, showing him the corpse of Doug, the last person who faced the champion. He then called Thor \"New Doug\" after Thor announced that he would be challenging the champion and intended to win.\n\nWhen Loki visited Thor using his illusion powers in order to try and convince his adopted brother not to challenge the Grandmaster's champion and consider escaping while Hela took over Asgard, Korg stayed close by but did not interfere. Just as Loki's illusion left the room, Korg took the chance and attempted to attack him, yelling at Loki to piss off and calling him a ghost, while Miek had also charged forward to assist his friend in the possible battle against Loki.[3]\n\nPrior to Thor's battle against Hulk, Korg complained to his fellow champions about the state of the communal weapons, asking them to clean them after use having found some hair and blood from the previous Contest of Champions battles over some of the weapons. Seeing that Thor was struggling to choose a weapon to use, Korg then offered him a three-pronged spear which he turned down, hoping instead to find a new hammer that he could use in his battle.\n\nThor then told Korg all about Mjølnir and its abilities to summon up lightning and return to his hand whenever he called it. Thor and Korg then discussed Scrapper 142, with Korg revealing that she was in fact Asgardian as well as a former member of the Valkyries, much to Thor's surprise as he attempted to convince her to help him escape Sakaar, although she refused.\n\nDuring Thor's duel with Hulk, Korg commented on his apparent foolishness, staying in the wings alongside Miek and all of the other fighters as the fight had gone ahead. However, when Thor gained the upper hand, Korg encouraged the other gladiators to participate in the chant supporting Thor. Eventually, however, the Grandmaster cheated and used the Obedience Disk to knock Thor to the ground and allow Hulk to win, prompting Korg to reminisce about Doug's fight.[3]\n\nDuring Thor's attempt to escape from Sakaar, Korg remained locked inside of his cell with Miek to keep him company while they remained as prisoners of the Grandmaster, with Korg questioning if the liquid that Miek was dropping from his body were in fact his eggs which he suspected. While Korg remained in waiting, Thor sent Valkyrie to deactivate the Obedience Disks on Korg and the other prisoners, finally giving them freedom.\n\nAround the gladiator quarters, the disks fell off them to Korg's delight before Valkyrie burst into their room and asked to know who Korg was out of the other Contest of Champions challengers. Korg himself then awkwardly questioned who it was who was asking before noting that he knew only Valkyrie was asking him and questioning if she was asking on behalf of anybody else. Valkyrie had then noted that Thor had sent her before Korg was then provided with Sakaaran weaponry by Valkyrie, Korg led the slave revolt against the Grandmaster.\n\nKorg then recruited Tasba and Biff into the rebellion, quickly gaining their freedom while Thor was able to make his escape. During the revolt, Korg and his companions broke into the hangar bay to escape the planet, leading Korg to find a Obedience Disk trigger, which he then switched off, releasing Loki, who they offered a way off the planet. The group then stole a large ship and escaped Sakaar, flying through the Devil's Anus towards Asgard in order to assist Thor.[3]\n\nWhile Loki piloted the Statesman towards the Bifrost Bridge, Korg got off early and managed to save Heimdall's life when he had been pinned down by the Berserkers. Korg then introduced himself and Miek to Heimdall before pointing him in the direction of the Statesman, inviting Heimdall and the other Asgardians to make their hasty escape from Asgard just before they could all be wiped out.\n\nKorg and his fellow Contest of Champions gladiators then proceeded to help all of the remaining Asgardians to evacuate the planet before it was too late by climbing on board the Statesman, with Korg using his Sakaaran Blaster to shoot down all of the attacking Berserkers which had been sent to stop them by Hela. Fighting alongside Loki, Heimdall and Miek to ensure the safety of the Asgardians, Korg and his new allies eventually found themselves overwhelmed.\n\nFaced with the onslaught of Berserkers, Korg held them off for as long as he could, before witnessing a massive lightning blast destroy much of the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf. Much to the surprise of Korg, out of the lightning came Thor, who charged through the Berserkers army and aided his allies, all while the Hulk dealt with Fenris, giving Korg and the others a clear advantage. During their battle, however, Korg had inadvertently stepped on and seemingly killed Miek.\n\nFeeling great guilt over killing Miek, Korg picked him up and took him on board the Statesman as they were evacuated. Having successfully evacuated all the surviving Asgardians, Korg watched as Surtur then destroyed Asgard by finally causing Ragnarök. Korg commented on how the Asgardians could rebuild the planet, only to witness the utter destruction of the world. Shocked, Korg commented that Asgard was well and truly destroyed, apologizing for his previous comment.[3]\n\nFollowing the Battle for Asgard, Korg found a young Asgardian girl and told her about the Statesman, saying that it belonged to the Grandmaster.[4] He then stood on board the Statesman alongside all of the remaining Asgardians and his new allies while Thor was named as their new King of Asgard. As Thor was asked by Heimdall where they should go next following the complete and utter destruction of their beloved homeworld, Thor was quietly musing where to go onto, before he asked where Miek's homeworld was, considering this to be a good destination to aim for.\n\nKorg admitted that Miek was dead because he had stepped on him while still on the Rainbow Bridge, and that he had been carrying him around because he felt guilty about killing his dear friend. However, Miek then regained consciousness, much to Korg's relief as he then announced to everybody that Miek was indeed alive. Apologizing to Thor and inviting him to speak again, Korg and everybody else were informed that their next destination would, in fact, be Earth.[3]\n\nIn 2018, the Asgardians were ambushed by Thanos and the Black Order. During this ambush, half of the Asgardians on the ship were slaughtered, including Heimdall and Loki. Korg was one of the many survivors from Thanos' attack who took part in leading the remaining Asgardians to safety in escape pods alongside Valkyrie and Miek, before Thanos destroyed the ship and killed the remaining forces inside the Statesman.[5]\n\nHours later, Korg survived the Snap, alongside Miek and Valkyrie.[5]\n\nThree weeks later, Korg, Miek, and the surviving Asgardians arrived on Earth, settling in New Asgard, Norway. They were then reunited with Thor. In the five years that followed, Korg played video games with Thor and Miek at Thor's house while he kept him company as Thor descended into depression.[2]\n\nIn 2023, while playing Fortnite, Korg greeted Bruce Banner and Rocket upon seeing them enter the house. Korg then invited Banner and Rocket to drink their beer and use their free wi-fi. However, a player on Playstation Network, NoobMaster69, insulted Korg by calling him a name, causing him to inform Thor, who threatened the player and promised to hurt him if he continued with the insults, much to Korg's gratitude. When Banner mentioned Thanos' name at the moment to Thor, Korg sat up and told Banner that they did not want to say that name on behalf of Thor's defense.[2]\n\nFollowing the Blip, Korg, along with Miek, Valkyrie, and the Einherjar, was transported by the Masters of the Mystic Arts via an Inter-Dimensional Portal to the ruins of the Avengers Compound to assist in the battle against an alternate Thanos and his army. During the battle, Korg fought Cull Obsidian, but Obsidian was able to overpower and restrain him until Drax the Destroyer leaped onto Obsidian's back and started stabbing him with his knives, which caused him to release Korg, who then promptly knocked him back. Later in the battle, Korg was forced to take cover when the Sanctuary II fired airstrikes on the battlefield.[2]\n\nDuring the battle, Korg left trace elements of his DNA on the battlefield, which was collected by Nick Fury's secret Skrull unit and placed into a vial known as the Harvest alongside other enhanced DNA samples. The Harvest vial was later administered by Super-Skrulls Gravik and G'iah, granting them access to Korg's physiology and abilities.[6][7] Following the battle's conclusion, Korg returned to New Asgard.[2]\n\nSometime later, Korg left New Asgard to accompany Thor and helped the Guardians of the Galaxy on a trip to Indigarr. There, he told a group of native Indigarrians about Thor's recent adventures, his training, his deceased friends, and his past love life, mentioning that Thor would always spring back into action if someone asked him to. Shortly after, he aided the Guardians in fighting off Habooska the Horrible and his army.\n\nKorg then stood by with the Guardians and watched as Thor single handledly defeated the army and killed Habooksa with Stormbreaker, although destroying King Yakan’s palace in the process. Despite this, Thor received two giant goats named Toothgrinder and Toothgnasher as gifts, and Korg mentioned that the goats screamed a lot, bringing them up inside the Benatar with the Guardians.\n\nAs the goats caused chaos within the Benatar, Korg was accidentally shot by Nebula, as she wanted to kill the goats for the chaos they made. Korg talked to Thor about making a special whistle for goats, being helped by Mantis, in order to control them. The Guardians then received countless distress calls for help from dead gods, scaring Korg upon seeing the corpses.\n\nKorg watched as Peter Quill played back a distress call on Thor's request which showed Thor's friend Sif calling for him and stating that Gorr the God Butcher was after the gods. Following this, Thor decided to split up so he could tend to Sif and not hold the Guardians up. Korg agreed to stay with Thor and watched as the Guardians left. Korg was then shocked to see how Thor summoned Stormbreaker, which was out of control, and Korg traveled with Thor and the two goats through the Bifrost Bridge to help Sif.[1]\n\nKorg and Thor went to Falligar and immediately saw the giant Falligar the Behemoth. Korg asked who it was, and Thor replied saying he was the nicest god you could ever meet. However, Falligar was killed. Thor then saw Sif and flew to her. Sif was dying, but said that Gorr the God Butcher's next stop was New Asgard. Thor then quickly brought everyone there.[1]\n\nArriving on New Asgard, Thor told the medics to get Sif to the infimary. They then fought Gorr the God Butcher's incoming Shadow Monsters. Korg witnessed Thor reunite with Jane Foster, who was now a Thor with Mjølnir. They fought the shadow monsters, but lost as Gorr took New Asgard's children with him and left.\n\nThe people of New Asgard gathered at town hall to discuss a plan. Although, everyone was upset at what happened. As everyone talked, Korg talked to Thor about Jodie Foster. Thor corrected him saying it was Jane. Thor then tried to summon Mjølnir, but Stormbreaker came over to him instead. Thor gave a speech before setting off the find the kids. However, an angry Stormbreaker prohibited that, crashing Thor into a sculpture.\n\nThor returned and Korg told him his cape was on fire. Suddenly, Axl Heimdallson emerged in the air as he had his father's powers. He told Thor where they were, the Shadow Realm. Thor called him Astrid, but Axl corrected him saying what his new name was, but Thor did not believe it. Korg stuck up for Axl, thinking his new name was \"asshole.\" The group then set off to Omnipotence City to get some gods to help.[1]\n\nKorg joined Thor, Mighty Thor and Valkyrie on their journey to Omnipotence City in hopes of recruiting any gods to aid the fight against Gorr the God Butcher. The group put on robes, disguising themselves as gods of emotion. During the visit, countless gods were seen, including Ninny of the Nonny, whom Korg worshipped. They then sat down and listened to Zeus, who welcomed everyone, being very show offish.\n\nWhen plotting on how to get the Thunderbolt, Zeus overheard somebody talking, which led to Korg directly calling out his own friends. When Thor was brought forth to Zeus, the three had to watch as Thor was chained down and stripped naked, forcing Korg, Foster and Valkyrie to take off their own disguises, revealing them as Asgardians. After Thor got his robe back on, Korg aided his friends to battle Zeus and his Spartan guards.\n\nThey fought the guards, with Korg easily shooting and smashing them with his hammer. He then told Valkyrie to watch out as he threw the hammer passed her. He then threw it to Thor, who smashed a guard with it. Zeus had enough as he took Thunderbolt and threw it at Korg. This struck Korg in the chest. Korg tried walking towards Thor, but quickly crumpled into rocks.\n\nLuckily, the only alive part of a Kronan was the face, so Korg lived. Korg was consoled by a worried Thor before he was taken by Valkyrie, who tied Korg to the back of her head. Korg told Valkyrie when enemies were coming up from behind so she could fight them. He then tried to whistle to the goats, but failed once again. He reminded himself to purse his lips, which emitted a elegant whistle that called the goats and Asgardian Skiff, leaving Omnipotence City.[1]\n\nNow just a head, Korg talked to Valkyrie on the Asgardian Skiff while they made their way to the Moon of Shame. He sang a song from his childhood, highlighting how his species made babies and how his two fathers made him. He then talked to Valkyrie about her past with the Valkyries. He then asked what she thought Thor and Mighty Thor were talking about outside, but Valkyrie claimed they were not talking. Suddenly, they crashed into the moon. Thor, Foster, and Valkyrie fought Gorr the God Butcher. The goats then took Korg over to them where Thor summoned the Bifrost Bridge. However, Gorr was able to grab Stormbreaker which he could use to get his wish. Thor returned later, having defeated Gorr, but losing Foster in the progress. Life returned to normal as Korg witnessed the aftermath and then left New Asgard.[1]\n\nFollowing Gorr the God Butcher's threat, Korg regained his body and returned to his home planet of Ria. There, he met a Kronan named Dwayne, whom he fell in love with. They soon went to a lava pit and submerged themselves in lava, which gave them a baby boy.[1]\n\nIn stark contrast to the rest of his kind, who are reputed for their brute strength and intimidating forms, Korg was a very civilized and kind-hearted individual. He was very kind to those who he considered friends, especially Miek, and even showed hospitality to complete strangers including Thor and Loki. He appears to be quite articulate, as shown when he described in great detail his beliefs regarding Thor's attachment to Mjølnir. Korg is very humorous, showcasing his humor in efforts to ease situations. Korg also appears to be well versed in other cultures, as he knew of the Earth game Rock, Paper, Scissors.\n\nKorg appears to be quite sensitive as when he was insulted by NoobMaster69, he turned toward Thor to defend him. He also seems to enjoy playing video games such as Fortnite.",
