  "content": "Odin Borson was the former King of Asgard, son of Bor, husband of Frigga, father of Hela and Thor, the adoptive father of Loki, and the former protector of the Nine Realms. During the ancient times, he was worshiped as the God of Wisdom by the inhabitants of Earth. Once the greatest warrior in all the Nine Realms, over the centuries he learned how to appreciate peace, eventually banishing his own daughter to Hel when she attempted to subjugate the entire universe. When Thor almost provoked a new war with the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, Odin stripped him of his powers and exiled him to Earth, leaving Loki to take the throne. Around this time, Odin unexpectedly fell into the Odinsleep, and when Thor had returned and saved the Frost Giants from extinction at the hands of Loki, who seemingly died during the conflict, Odin realized that Thor had proven that he would be worthy enough to take the throne of Asgard.\n\nLoki survived his fall into the abyss and was captured by Thor after causing the Chitauri Invasion of Earth, causing Odin to sentence him to life in prison. When Odin's own wife Frigga was killed at the hands of the Dark Elves' leader Malekith, Odin vowed revenge on them, no matter the cost, putting him at odds with his son. After faking his death, Loki cast a spell on Odin, banishing him to New York City while masquerading as Odin and ruling Asgard himself. While he had eventually recovered from the spell placed on him by Loki, Odin chose to remain in exile in Norway and would ultimately reach the end of his extremely long life. After an emotional farewell to his sons, Odin finally went to Valhalla. His spirit, however, would remain with Thor and all Asgardians to impart wisdom and help them on their future journeys.\n\nOdin was the son of Bor, the second king of Asgard, and his wife Bestia, alongside his brothers Ve and Vili.[1] After Bor's death in battle, Odin ascended to the throne as king of Asgard and peacekeeper within the Nine Realms.[5] In an effort to prevent the prophecy of Ragnarök from taking place, Odin defeated the Fire Demon Surtur, taking the Eternal Flame, the source of his power, back to Asgard with him and banishing Surtur in the realm of Muspelheim, where he remained for thousands of years.\n\nAs Allfather, Odin battled great beasts, invaded other realms, destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, and laid waste to mighty kingdoms. To maintain his immense power, Odin required a prolonged period of time to rest and regain his strength. This deep sleep became known as the Odinsleep.\n\nOdin eventually had a daughter named Hela, whom he chose to be his Executioner and Commander of the Einherjar, Asgard's army. Together, they conquered the Nine Realms, forging Asgard into a mighty empire.[2]\n\nHela's ambitions eventually grew too great for Odin's liking, as he realized that peace, not war, was the only way to maintain order within the Realms. Hela refused to back down, however, and attempted to take the throne from her father by force. Odin and Hela fought, with Odin emerging as the victor.\n\nOdin by now had realized that Hela was a danger to Asgard. Unwilling to seal his kingdom's fate with his daughter's life, Odin instead banished Hela to the barren wastes of Hel, binding his lifeforce to her prison to ensure Hela remained imprisoned for as long as he lived.[2]\n\nWhen Hela tried to break from her prison, Odin sent his legendary female warriors, the Valkyrie, to stop her. When Odin realized that the Valkyrie had been defeated and killed by his daughter, Odin personally entered Hel, once again emerging victorious over Hela, and re-imprisoned her. However, unknown to him, Brunnhilde, the leader of the Valkyrie, survived, but wanted nothing to do with Odin after the death of her fellow Warriors.[2]\n\nTo make sure Hela's impact on the Nine Realms was forgotten, Odin wiped her out of history and had several other murals installed in his palace, depicting a false history where Asgard would reach its status and glory through peace treaties and amiable meetings with other realms. Desiring to be benevolent, Odin chose to rely solely on peace to bring about a new state of stability and order in the Nine Realms.[2]\n\nEventually, Odin felt that the burden of wearing the crown was too much for him alone and married Frigga, because she was a strong partner and had a helpful ear. Odin and Frigga had a child together, a boy they named Thor. With the birth of Thor, Odin felt that one day he would be able to pass his crown to a worthy successor. Odin's efforts at benevolence were crowned with success, bringing a period of stability that he would later refer to as the \"Great Beginning.\"[6]\n\nIn 965 A.D., King Laufey of Jotunheim invaded Midgard, intending to enslave the humans and to place the planet into a new Ice Age, replacing their own dying world. Odin led his Asgardian army,[6] with help from the Eternals,[7] against Laufey and his horde of Frost Giants in the Asgard-Jotunheim War.\n\nDuring the furious Battle of Tønsberg, Odin lost one of his eyes, but eventually, the Asgardians came out victorious over the Frost Giants, with Odin defeating Laufey in single combat on top of a temple within Jotunheim. In exchange for his life, Laufey agreed to a peace treaty between Asgard and Jotunheim, which would last for over a thousand years. After the battle, Odin's forces took the Casket of Ancient Winters from one of Laufey's temples, ensuring that the Frost Giants could never attack any other worlds ever again.\n\nWhile exploring the depths of the Jotun temple, Odin discovered an infant Frost Giant, Loki, who was the son of Laufey. Loki was left to die by his cruel father because of his small stature. Odin and his wife, Frigga, already had a son, Thor, but they adopted Loki as Thor's brother, using sorcery to change his appearance to that of an Asgardian, and kept the truth of Loki's birth from both of them. Odin believed that a Frost Giant living as a prince of Asgard could help bring about a permanent peace between the two realms.[6] After the battle, Odin gifted to the Eternal Gilgamesh with a secret brew recipe as a reward for the Eternals helping him out.[7]\n\nOdin raised both Thor and Loki as brothers, attempting to never allow Loki to feel any different from his brother or allow him to know his true Frost Giant nature. He taught them about the responsibilities of being king of Asgard, the history of Asgard's great wars, and other lessons about maintaining the peace should they take the throne.\n\nOdin answered their questions happily and showed them both great love and care. Loki showed Odin many times that he would be a capable king; however, Odin had long since decided that Thor would be his heir, though he still told Loki he had what it took to become king. As they grew older, Odin gave Thor the mighty hammer Mjølnir to use as his weapon of war, while Frigga taught magic to Loki, giving them each their own power to protect the Nine Realms.[6]\n\nOdin brought Thor and Loki on a visit to Earth. The Asgardians taught the Norse people their language and culture and displayed their abilities; this caused the Norse people to believe the Asgardians to be deities, and bestowed upon Thor the moniker \"God of Thunder.\" This tradition was continued for many years.[6] During one of these visits, Odin brought the Tesseract from his vault and brought it to Tønsberg, Norway, where he left it in the care of devout Asgardian worshipers.[8]\n\nMany years later, Odin decided to retire as King of Asgard, intending to make Thor King in his place. In the Great Hall, Odin prepared to crown Thor as he watched his son confidently stroll through the cheering crowd with Mjølnir, while Frigga stood by Odin's side with Loki, Lady Sif, and the Warriors Three.\n\nOdin greeted Thor and explained the responsibilities of king and protector of the Nine Realms, asking Thor if he swore to defend all these people throughout the galaxy. While Odin spoke, Frost Giants entered Asgard in an attempt to retrieve the Casket of Ancient Winters from Odin's Vault. Sensing the attack, Odin released the Destroyer, which quickly obliterated the intruding Frost Giants.\n\nOdin, Thor, and Loki traveled to the Vault and found the remains of the Frost Giants and the Einherjar Guards. Thor was angered by the slaughter, demanding Odin travel to Jotunheim to retaliate for the attack. Odin, however, insisted that the peace with Laufey was still in effect and the attack was not an act of war, but an act of a few Frost Giant rebels doomed to fail, and they should continue to act as though their peace treaty was still in effect.\n\nSeeing Thor's rage and war-hungry ways, Odin chose not to name him King yet, fearing his uncontrollable rage would cause another war with Jotunheim, causing the deaths of thousands across the Nine Realms. Despite Odin's clear orders, Thor remained furious by this attack, and with his friends, Lady Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki, he went to Jotunheim to personally confront King Laufey and the Frost Giants to find answers he sought about the attack.[6]\n\nWhen Odin was warned of his son's actions by Heimdall, Odin got angry and said that he would not allow Thor to ruin their peace with the Frost Giants. He demanded to know why Heimdall allowed Thor to go and why he did not approach the King sooner, but Heimdall explained that he was obeying Thor's command and only approached when the situation required it. Odin demanded Heimdall open the Bifrost Bridge[9] and used it to rescue Thor and his friends from Jotunheim, riding aboard Sleipnir, his eight-legged steed, after Thor went there seeking answers regarding the intrusion. He soon found them in the middle of a fierce battle with a Frost Beast and the Frost Giants' entire army.\n\nAlthough Thor cheered at his arrival and suggested that they destroy the Frost Giants together, Odin furiously ordered his son to be silent. Odin tried in vain to rebuild the peace between Asgard and Jotunheim, but Laufey would have none of it, and declared war between their worlds, which Odin had no choice but to accept. Laufey tried to stab Odin in the back, but Odin was able to use Gungnir to throw Laufey away and escape with his allies.\n\nReturning to Asgard, Odin ordered Lady Sif and the Warriors Three to take Fandral to the healing room to treat the injuries he had sustained during the battle. Furious at what had happened and what had now begun, Odin berated Thor for his arrogance and stupidity in starting a new war with one of his greatest enemies, putting millions of innocent lives in harm's way, while Thor claimed that their enemies should fear him and the other Nine Realms were laughing at their inaction. He told Thor he was a vain, greedy, and cruel boy, only for Thor to yell back that his father was nothing more than an old man and a fool for not taking any action against Laufey.\n\nSeeing no alternative, Odin decided that the only possible chance for peace was the banishment of his own son. As he began insulting and degrading his son, Loki tried to step in, but Odin ordered him to be silent. Odin told Thor he was unworthy of his title and of his family while he stripped Thor of his powers, and in the name of his father Bor and Bor's father before him, he banished Thor to Earth for his arrogance. He placed an enchantment on Mjølnir that allowed only the worthy to wield it. He then sent Mjølnir to Earth as well.[6]\n\nLoki, witnessing his hand turning blue when he was at Jotunheim, decided to confirm his fears by breaking into Odin's Vault touching the Casket of Ancient Winters. Odin discovered his adopted son, who confronted Odin about his true origins, having turned blue upon touching the casket. Odin revealed that he not only stole the Casket, but Laufey's son who was left there to die.\n\nAs he took in this news, Loki demanded to know Odin's reasons for such a deception. Odin revealed that he wanted to gain a permanent peace between Asgard and Jotunheim by having Loki rule the world of the Frost Giants. Loki was disgusted by his own parentage and claimed that Odin could have never loved him the same way he loved Thor and would have never given him the throne. Overwhelmed by Loki's furious accusations, he fell into the Odinsleep.[6]\n\nWhile he slumbered, Loki took the throne for himself. Frigga spent much of her time sitting by his bedside, waiting for him to awaken. While living on Earth, Thor proved himself worthy and regained his powers while fighting the Destroyer as Loki carried out his plans to destroy Jotunheim by allowing Laufey to enter into Asgard before killing him, preventing Laufey from stabbing the sleeping Odin, while presenting Loki as the apparent savior of the King of Asgard.\n\nThe two brothers battled as Loki attempted to destroy Jotunheim while Thor tried to stop such a genocide and eventually caused the destruction of the Bifrost Bridge. As they were falling off the bridge, Odin, awoken from his Odinsleep by the dangers his sons were in, grabbed Thor's leg just before he fell into the black hole below. As they hung on the edge of the world, Loki desperately tried to explain to Odin that he did everything for his beloved family.\n\nOdin could not accept Loki's ideals and simply told him no. Loki, devastated by the rejection, let go of Gungnir and allowed himself to fall into the deep and dark abyss created in the wake of the Bifrost Bridge's destruction. While Thor screamed out in mourning agony, Odin watched on helplessly as his adopted son fell to his presumed death. Odin then ensured that Thor was safe while the Frost Giants reacted to their near extermination at Loki's hands.\n\nWith the threat of the Frost Giants now at an end, Asgard then had a mighty feast, to celebrate the end of the war and the return of Thor. Odin, however, did not attend, instead he looked out into the Nine Realms, mourning his lost son. When Odin was accompanied by Thor, Odin told Thor that he would be a wise king, but Thor declared that there would never be a wiser king than his father. Thor imparted that he now understood why he had been banished and knew he still had much to learn, promising that he would someday make his father proud. Odin turned to his son and told him that he had already made him very proud.[6]\n\nAs a group of rag-tag invaders called the Marauders started to attack several of the Nine Realms, at the same time, Frigga discovered that Loki was alive and that he intended to conquer Earth.[10] Odin sent Thor to retrieve Loki using his Dark Magic, at the cost of his own and Thor's health. However, there was an amount of time for Thor to get back onto Asgard with Loki. Odin watched Thor's confrontation with Loki through the eyes of Hugin and Munin.[11][10]\n\nWhen Thor returned to Asgard with the now captured Loki and the Tesseract, Odin decided to speak with the prisoner.[12] Loki told Odin that his actions on Earth were to rule as a benevolent god, comparing his motives to Odin's, but Odin swiftly reminded him that they were not gods and that they go through the same cycles of life that humans do. Though Loki tried to justify his actions on Earth claiming that it was his birthright to be a king, Odin scornfully told him that his birthright was to die after his real father, Laufey, had abandoned him, utterly disappointed that the revelation of Loki's true parentage had led him down the wrong path. Odin openly told him he only would spare his life because of Frigga's love for him, and he sentenced Loki to life imprisonment within the Asgardian Dungeons.[13]\n\nApproximately a year after Thor helped the mortals in saving Earth from Loki and his army of the Chitauri, the Marauders were still pillaging the peaceful inhabitants of the Nine Realms, and Odin had to send Thor to lead the armies of Asgard against them. During a final battle on Vanaheim, Thor along with Lady Sif and the Warriors Three managed to defeat the Marauders and force them to surrender.\n\nOnce Thor had returned from the Battle of Vanaheim, they discussed the newly secured peace across the Nine Realms as Odin thanked his son for everything he had done. Odin then discussed a pressing matter with his son; his infatuation with Jane Foster, recommending that Thor instead seek a romantic relationship with an Asgardian rather than a human, suggesting Lady Sif for Thor's affections as she clearly had strong feelings for him. Knowing that Thor would not listen, Odin suggested that he at least try to enjoy his victory over the Marauders by joining Fandral and Volstagg for celebrations in an Asgardian bar while having drinks with the people of Asgard.[13]\n\nThor eventually brought Jane Foster into Asgard, much to Odin's disapproval. Odin stormed into the room as Eir was conducting tests on a strange illness that had befallen Foster and demanded that she return to Midgard. However, when it was discovered that Foster was carrying the Aether within her veins, Odin was mortified and decided to keep her protected within the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf.\n\nOdin showed Thor and Foster the Book of Yggdrasil and explained the history of the Dark Elves, a race of creatures that was believed to be extinct for thousands of years ever since Odin's father King Bor defeated them during the First Battle of Svartalfheim. However, Odin knew that as the Aether had finally been found, the army of the Dark Elves, led by Malekith the Accursed would return seeking to finally reclaim their most powerful weapon once again.[13]\n\nWhen the Dark Elves attacked against Asgard by sending in their Dark Elf Harrows to attack Asgard's defenses, Odin led a troop to put down the rebellion in the Asgardian Dungeons led by Kurse. Along the way, he came across Frigga and Jane Foster; he assured Frigga that there was nothing to fear and smiled as she showed her concern for his safety. Odin said that even after he had survived so many previous battles, his wife still worries for him; she reminded him that it was due to her worrying that he had survived for so long.\n\nWhen Odin, Lady Sif and their squad of Einherjar soldiers returned to the upper chambers, they discovered that the army of Dark Elves had successfully invaded the palace and killed dozens of the Asgardian soldiers and destroyed Odin's own throne with a Black Hole Grenade. Once Odin had dispatched one fleeing Dark Elf with a single powerful blast from Gungnir, Odin realized that the Dark Elves would likely attack Frigga to get to Foster and steal the Aether.\n\nOdin quickly went to their aid but was too late, and discovered that his beloved wife Frigga had been murdered by Malekith and Kurse while protecting Foster with her magic. Although also Thor arrived, he was unable to kill the Dark Elf leader, instead severely burning his face with a powerful blast from Mjølnir. Upon discovering her body, Odin fell to his knees and cradled his beloved wife, devastated by the loss of the woman he truly loved so dearly while Thor looked on in defeat.\n\nOdin arranged for a ceremonial funeral for Frigga and the soldiers who died in the attack. Odin wore an all black armor and oversaw the ceremony where his wife's body was placed into a ship and transformed into glittering mist resembling stars in the universe. Odin remained silent during the ceremony, silently mourning his beloved wife. Every resident of Asgard, including Heimdall and Lady Sif, showed their respect for their queen and the soldiers.[13]\n\nDesiring to destroy the Dark Elves once and for all, Odin met with Fandral and Volstagg to discuss military plans only to learn that they were almost completely defenseless against this threat. Interrupting the meeting, Thor tried to convince his father to allow him to leave Asgard with Jane Foster and draw Malekith away, but Odin declined, stating that he was powerful enough to defeat Malekith himself, and insisted they simply wait. Odin said he was willing to sacrifice every soldier needed to avenge Frigga and defeat Malekith.\n\nThor defied Odin's own orders and enlisted Heimdall, Lady Sif and the Warriors Three in helping him, Foster and Loki escape Asgard with the intention of using the Aether to draw Malekith into the open and destroy him and his weapon. Heimdall then sent for Odin and confessed his disobedience. A slightly surprised Odin simply ordered his guards to stop Thor, who was escaping on a Dark Elf Harrow, by any means, but they were too late and quickly lost him.\n\nWith Thor now gone with Foster and Loki, Odin sent his Einherjar Guard to Svartalfheim to check on the battle against Malekith. When the guard returned, he approached Odin with news that they had discovered Loki's body. The guard, however, was actually Loki in a disguise. Some time later, the throne of Asgard was usurped by Loki who had disguised himself as the Allfather, allowing himself to rule Asgard as he had desired and sent Thor to Earth.[13]\n\nThe appearance of Odin was used by Loki to rule the Asgardians for some time after Loki's faked death on Svartalfheim. While ruling Asgard as Odin, Loki cast a spell on his father[2] to make Odin forget himself[9] and exiled him to Earth, leaving him dazed at Shady Acres Care Home: a retirement home in New York City. The retirement home was destroyed and he eventually overcame Loki's strong enchantment. With the aid of Doctor Strange, Odin spent his last days in Norway.[2][14] Odin made it clear to Strange he wished to remain in exile and was not to be disturbed, wishes that Strange respected.[2]\n\nWhen Thor exposed Loki's deceptive rule to the people of Asgard, Thor ensured his brother would aid him in his quest of finding their father. However, Shady Acres Care Home was bulldozed and destroyed, upon arrival. Doctor Strange, having detected the presence of Asgardians in his city, stepped in and volunteered to help Thor find his father on the condition that Loki leaves Earth thereafter. With the aid of several tomes within the New York Sanctum, Doctor Strange used Thor's hair to mystically pinpoint Odin's location and create a portal to Odin in Norway.[2]\n\nWhen his sons found him, Odin was nearing the end of his long life. He commented that Norway was beautiful and revealed it took him a while to break Loki's spell over him, noting that Frigga should be proud of him. He revealed that he could feel his time coming to an end by saying that his wife was calling out to him. When Thor insisted to take him back to Asgard, Odin instead took to resting on a rock.\n\nBefore dying, Odin lamented that Ragnarök would come and he revealed the existence of Hela, his oldest child and only daughter, warning Thor and Loki that Hela would be released once he died. Telling his sons he loved them, Odin finally died and his spirit ascended to Valhalla. Upon his death, Hela was finally freed from her banishment.[2]\n\nThor was devastated by his father's death and mourned him when he was imprisoned in Sakaar. Even Loki was also saddened and showed remorse for his death. However, Hela rejoiced at his demise, commenting that she would have loved to see it. While Odin failed to prevent Ragnarök, his spirit continued to aid Thor as he traveled to stop Hela, sending visions from Valhalla. Thor's first vision of Odin allowed him to quickly gain the upper hand over Hulk and this allowed him to survive the Tournament, the only person to have ever done it, although he did not win thanks to the Grandmaster interfering.[2]\n\nHeimdall, who had watched Odin die, started receiving visions of Odin while he attempted to help people escape Hela. Heimdall discussed his past with Odin's children and the mistakes that Heimdall had made. The vision assured Heimdall that things would work out, although Heimdall came to question whether it was truly Odin visiting him or simply a product of his own mind.[9]\n\nThor saw his father one more time when he was being easily defeated by Hela and had lost his eye in the process. When seeing Odin, Thor desperately admitted that he could not defeat Hela without his hammer, which she destroyed, and that he is not as powerful as Odin was. The Allfather encouraged Thor by reminding him that he is not the God of Hammers and Mjølnir was only ever a focus to his powers as well as revealing Thor was actually even stronger than him.\n\nThis vision allowed Thor to fight back against Hela alongside Valkyrie long enough for Loki to revive Surtur and destroy both Hela, and Asgard itself. Odin had said himself that Asgard was not a location, but wherever their people are was truly Asgard, thus Ragnarök being more of a Rebirth for the Asgardians than their doom.[2]\n\nOdin was a patient, just, and wise king. He strived to maintain the peace between the Nine Realms and was thoughtful of the lives of the innocent. Despite his enemies warring against him and his willingness to cause mass destruction when needed, he was compassionate enough to not seek the obliteration of the innocents of the opposing force. He even adopted Loki, the abandoned son of his old foe Laufey, and raised and loved him as his own son, although he initially did this as a way to unite Asgard and Jotunheim. Nevertheless, Odin was firm in his rule and did not hesitate to mete out justice on those who threaten the peace, even if those individuals were his own children.\n\nOdin was considered to be the wisest king in Asgard's history, admired by all for his exceptional leadership qualities. He had effectively led the Einherjar into victory in countless wars over all the Nine Realms. His skills allowed him to conquer the Nine Realms when he sought to conquer all the Realms. However, after realizing peace would be the only way to truly unite the Realms, Odin became the benevolent, peace-loving, nearly all-powerful and all-knowing ruler of Asgard and the guardian of the Nine Realms. As such, he was wise and honorable. He was dedicated to using his power for keeping the peace between the Nine Realms. He believed in being responsible (in terms of being careful and responsible for one's actions), duty (in terms of the protection of and keeping the peace between the Nine Realms), and honor (always being a man of his word). However, when angered or upset, he could be very stern to the point of ruthlessness when necessary. As Frigga stated, \"everything he does, he does with a purpose.\" He loved Thor but when Thor went to Jotunheim and nearly started a war in the process, he exiled Thor to Earth, to teach him what it meant to be a good warrior and a hero, as well as to bolster his humility.\n\nWhile he was a good king who cares about the peace of the realms, the ghosts of his past self and his initial anger that once controlled him can show, as he was willing to sacrifice as many Asgardians as necessary if Malekith had attacked again, showing to be just as ruthless as Malekith at the time, as Thor noted, due to the intense grief, rage, and need for revenge coursing through him after Frigga's death. Even when Thor asked what would make Odin different from Malekith, Odin merely laughed and said the difference was that he would win. It was from this that Thor realized that Odin, due to his lust for vengeance, was not thinking straight and under his rule, Malekith would be able to destroy Asgard.\n\nIn his youth, Odin was a ruthless war king who had no qualms violently conquering the Nine Realms with his daughter, Hela. After conquering the Nine Realms, Odin underwent a change upon realizing that only through peace can the Nine Realms truly be united and desisted with further conquest. He then made a transition both societal and personal, shifting from a ruler of a war-seeking realm into the wise and benevolent king his sons grew up knowing. Hela was not able to make this transition, which resulted in a conflict that ended with her exile and imprisonment.\n\nOdin was also criticized by all three of his children and Brunnhilde on how he dealt with his problems and past mistakes, most often through secrecy, lies, or by covering them up. He hid the original mural depicting his bloody history and conquests with Hela by covering it with a mural that showed him and his family uniting the realms through peaceful methods, and even erased his daughter from Asgardian history. He had never revealed to Loki his heritage, hoping that by hiding it, his adopted son wouldn't feel disparate from his family. Though he loved and respected him, Thor openly admitted his father's faults to others, even commenting that Hela had the right to be angry at him. Odin later showed remorse and regret for how he handled his mistakes and problems in his last moments, implying his exile made him realize had he not used secrets and lies, things would not have escalated to Ragnarök.\n\nIn his exile, Odin apparently thought over all the acts he had done and likely felt remorse over them, as he showed no hostility towards Loki and even noted Frigga would be proud of him. He also admitted that he truly loved both of his sons and expressed remorse for failing to stop Ragnarök. He had made peace with his fate and died peacefully while in the company of his sons, apparently content he would be reunited with Frigga in the afterlife and leave Thor as the new King of Asgard. His spirit was much kinder and less strict to Thor, as when Hulk pummelled Thor, instead of being angry and strictly asking him to get up, Odin simply serenely smiled at his son and later openly encouraged Thor that he was stronger than him.",
