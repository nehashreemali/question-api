  "content": "Yondu Udonta was the Centaurian leader of an exiled faction of the Ravagers and the adoptive father of Peter Quill. When Quill betrayed the Ravagers and stole the Orb for himself, Yondu led the hunt for his former ally. Eventually, Yondu caught up with Quill, but he was convinced to help him in the battle against Ronan the Accuser, who was threatening to use the Power Stone to destroy Xandar, with Quill ensuring Yondu did not get the Infinity Stone at the end. Despite losing the stone, Yondu chose not to get revenge against Quill, leading to mistrust among all of his own clan.\n\nYondu's clan turned against their former captain and put their trust instead in Taserface. With the help of Rocket, Yondu got his revenge against the mutineers and destroyed his own ship. Yondu went to help the Guardians of the Galaxy in the battle against Ego. As the planet collapsed into itself, Yondu sacrificed his own spacesuit, and his own life in the process, saving Quill.\n\nYondu Udonta's early years were not easy for him: his parents sold him to the Kree Empire and he spent most of his youth closed in a cage. After twenty years of slavery, Stakar Ogord freed Yondu and welcomed him into the Ravagers. Yondu eventually became the leader of his own Ravager clan. When Ego offered Yondu generous financial compensation in exchange for kidnapping his children and delivering them to him, Yondu agreed, despite the Ravagers' code explicitly forbidding the trafficking of children. However, when it became apparent that the children were being murdered, Yondu and his clan were exiled by Ogord.[2]\n\nIn 1988, Yondu was hired by Ego to travel to Missouri on Earth and kidnap Peter Quill. Aware at that point that the other children he had delivered had been murdered, Yondu chose to keep Quill and raised him to be a Ravager. During the following years, Yondu often joked about his crew killing and eating Quill for pleasure, although Quill perceived this as an actual threat and became terrified of them.[2]\n\nOne December, Yondu walked in on Peter Quill and Kraglin Obfonteri decorating a homemade Christmas tree. Upon seeing this, Yondu yelled at the two about what they were doing, which Quill and Obfonteri explained that they were celebrating Christmas. However, after hearing how people give presents to others, he demeaned them as Ravagers, stating that they have to fight for what they have and that being given presents sounded like sentiment, before angrily kicking the tree away. Yondu demanded that they clean up the decorations or he will make them clean the latrines, despite Obfonteri telling him that it was Gef's favorite thing to do. Yondu then asked if he was getting talked back to, which Obfonteri denied, after which Yondu declared that he hated Christmas before storming out.\n\nLater, Yondu walked by the trashcan with the Christmas decorations. Looking in, Yondu saw a present from Quill to him. Yondu opened the gift and saw it was a knickknack. Amused, Yondu left a present for Quill, giving him with two Quad Blasters on his bed. Yondu was then joined by Quill who began to tease each other to show that they appreciated the gifts. Yondu began to bond with Quill and began to see him as a son figure.[3]\n\nOver the next twenty-six years, Yondu developed a close relationship with Quill, despite his efforts of never showing any affection in person, training him to become a Ravager just like him.[1] During one such time, he took Quill to a forest, where he taught him how to accurately shoot using the Quad Blasters. Around the same time, Yondu was exiled from the other clans of Ravagers by Stakar Ogord after he found out that Yondu had been delivering children to Ego. Yondu defended himself saying he did not know better, but Stakar knew his protégé well enough to know that the former was too smart to be that ignorant and that the profitability from Ego's commissions made Yondu turn a blind eye. Because of this, Yondu became bitter towards his former mentor for leaving him, but knew deep down that he deserved the banishment due to letting his own greed overtaking his morals.[2]\n\nYondu discovered that a mysterious item called the Orb was located on Morag; he was offered a great fee if he retrieved the item for the Broker. However, when Yondu had finally arrived on Morag with his clan, he discovered Peter Quill had betrayed him and found and taken the Orb for himself with the intention of selling it to the Broker before Yondu could. Yondu was furious and phoned Quill, who tried to ignore the call until Bereet answered the call for him. As he reluctantly spoke with Yondu, Quill did not deny he had taken the Orb, but he instead refused to give his location before hanging up the call.\n\nFurious at this betrayal, Yondu issued a bounty for Quill's capture for 40,000 units; when Yondu said he wanted Quill alive, this led to an argument with Horuz, who insisted that they should have handed Quill over to Ego like they were originally hired to do, noting Yondu had always been soft on Quill and had never punished him when he disobeyed his own orders. Yondu turned the situation around and threatened Horuz with his Yaka Arrow and assured his men that once he had Quill in their custody, he would kill him himself.[1]\n\nYondu and Kraglin Obfonteri then both traveled to Xandar to meet with Broker. Before revealing why they were really there, Yondu took some time to admire the various artifacts that the Broker had on for sale, commenting that he wished to buy some to decorate his own M-Ship. When Broker questioned if this was a joke or not, Obfonteri confirmed that Yondu was being completely serious.\n\nHowever, he made his true intentions known quickly when he then demanded to know to whom Broker intended to sell the Orb. Although Broker tried to insist that he would be unable to reveal the names of his buyers, Yondu ignored his many excuses and spoke over him with gibberish, mocking and annoying Broker the more he did it while Obfonteri laughed. As Broker still refused to give up the information, Yondu drew his Yaka Arrow and aimed it at Broker who, scared for his life, finally revealed that the Collector was the buyer.\n\nYondu and his clan traveled together to Knowhere to confront the Collector and reclaim the Orb. However, instead, they quickly found Quill, who had been trying to sell the Orb to the Collector as well. Yondu called out to Quill and demanded he stay where he was. However, Quill was also being attacked by Ronan the Accuser and his army of Sakaaran soldiers, so he fled before the Ravagers could catch him, finding himself chased by Ronan's army.\n\nQuill was able to briefly get away from Yondu by piloting a mining ship; however, before long Quill was forced to give his location away to save himself and Gamora from suffocating in space, as Quill had given her his helmet to try and save her. Yondu came to Quill's aid and found him floating in space beside the already dying Gamora. Yondu abducted the pair onto the Eclector, sending Obfonteri and his men to then bring them to him for questioning.[1]\n\nYondu initially berated Peter Quill for his many rebellious antics, beating him up and explaining everything Quill had done to let him down. When Yondu ranted about how he had saved Quill from being eaten by his subordinates the day he had been taken away by him, Quill argued that this was not a good enough reason for him to feel grateful to Yondu before insisting that they needed to find the Power Stone, which was one of the Infinity Stones.\n\nDespite Quill's attempts to explain everything and insist that the Power Stone could destroy all of Xandar if it was not recovered, Yondu aimed his Yaka Arrow at Quill's throat and prepared to execute him, but Quill called his bluff by convincing him that it was possible to steal the Orb from Ronan the Accuser with insider knowledge provided by Gamora. Thinking for a moment, Yondu withdrew his arrow and they decided to work together, celebrating with laughs and cheers all around.\n\nBefore they could complete their arrangement, Yondu and Quill's reunion was interrupted by an explosion outside the ship. When Yondu went to investigate, he discovered Rocket had taken control of Quill's ship, the Milano, and was threatening to destroy Yondu's ship with Drax the Destroyer using the Hadron Enforcer if Yondu did not free Quill and Gamora. Yondu called Rocket's bluff but Quill quickly appeared and assured Rocket that everything had been worked out and they were now fine.\n\nYondu allowed Quill to return to his ship to work out a plan with Rocket, Groot, Drax, and Gamora. Eventually, Quill returned with his team and they discussed a plan which involved Quill and Yondu's ship boarding the Dark Aster and killing Ronan once inside. While they prepared for battle, Yondu pulled Quill aside to remind him that once the battle was over, he would get the Power Stone, threatening to kill him if he failed to obey.[1]\n\nWith their plan going into motion, Yondu and Star-Lord led their squad of ships into the Battle of Xandar; Yondu commanded his clan to attack Ronan the Accuser's army of Sakaarans when Ronan sent in his soldiers as defense. While Kraglin Obfonteri and Rocket shot a hole in the side of the Dark Aster, Yondu and Quill planned to enter the ship together. However, Ronan's army soon overwhelmed them and Yondu's M-Ship was quickly shot down in the chaos. As he fell, Yondu vowed to survive and promised to see Quill at the end of the battle while Quill continued to battle Ronan's army.\n\nYondu survived the crash and got out of his wrecked ship, picking up some of the items he had bought from Broker's shop. When he turned around, Yondu discovered that he had been surrounded by a fleet of Sakaarans who seemingly recognized him from his slave days as they referred to him by name. They aimed their Necroblasters at him and ordered that Yondu surrender himself before commanding his men to attack the various Nova Corps ships that were currently assisting Quill and the others in the aerial battle against Ronan's forces.\n\nInstead of obeying, Yondu calmly opened his jacket without a word and whistled. As the Sakaarans stood momentarily confused at his actions, Yondu used his Yaka Arrow to single-handedly kill every Sakaaran in front of him as his arrow darted through all their bodies, even causing one of their Necrocraft to crash and explode. With all his would-be captors dead, Yondu collected his arrow and made his way back towards Xandar where the battle was still raging on with his Ravagers protecting the innocent people from harm.[1]\n\nBy the time Yondu made it back to the city, he arrived just in time to witness Ronan the Accuser's death. Yondu teased Peter Quill and Gamora as they shared an intimate moment and demanded Quill to hand over the Orb as agreed. Although Quill tried to argue, he eventually agreed and handed the Orb over to Yondu and the Ravagers, before then reminding Yondu not to open the Orb for his and his men's safety.\n\nYondu agreed and left Quill, unaware that he took the wrong Orb. As he prepared to leave Xandar with Kraglin Obfonteri, they both discussed how Quill had turned out better than they expected, with Obfonteri noting that the result of not delivering Quill to his own father, Ego like they were originally hired to do had worked out for the best. Yondu noted that he had thought Ego was a jackass as they flew an M-Ship back to the Eclector to make their hasty escape.\n\nAs the Yondu Ravager Clan traveled through space, they drank and celebrated the victory in the Battle of Xandar and how they had defeated the Kree warmonger Ronan. Yondu sat alone and decided to open the Orb given to him by Quill only to find a Troll doll. Yondu realized Quill had used a classic Ravager move and that the Infinity Stone was left with Irani Rael for safe-keeping. Instead of being angered, however, Yondu began laughing and kept the doll as a souvenir.[1] Some time afterwards, Yondu acquired a Zune, which he would give to Quill if he rejoined the Ravagers.[2]\n\nA few months in the wake of the Battle of Xandar, Yondu, along with his clan went to the Iron Lotus on Contraxia to relax. After falling intimate and entertaining himself with a Love Bot, Yondu got dressed from his room as he watched all of the other Ravagers outside have fun. As Yondu went outside, he quickly approached Stakar Ogord who walked away from him in utter disgust at seeing Yondu again, in spite of the showing Ogord a respectful gesture.\n\nYondu got angry with Ogord and chased after him and the two started to argue. Yondu demanded that Ogord listen to him, but Ogord refused, citing that he had been exiled for the child trafficking that led to the children's deaths, claiming that Yondu did not care about their fate as it had made him wealthy. Right as Ogord left, Ayesha arrived to hire Yondu and his clan to hunt down the Guardians of the Galaxy who had stolen some of their Anulax Batteries from them. Yondu took the job and left to find the Guardians unaware that part of his faction was planning to start a mutiny against him as they believed he has gone soft. It is implied that Yondu's faction was struggling financially as they had been independent for many years.[2]\n\nThe Ravagers easily tracked the Guardians of the Galaxy on Berhert as Yondu had placed a tracker on the Milano after the Battle of Xandar. After Rocket took down some of the Ravagers, Yondu got the upper hand on him with his Yaka Arrow. Yondu told Rocket about the job they were given by Ayesha and that she wants him to return the Guardians to her so she can kill them. Rocket pleaded that they don't hurt Groot if he told them the location of the batteries but Yondu said that he wasn't going to hand him over which angered some of the Ravagers.\n\nYondu decided to keep the batteries and sell them for a quarter of what Ayesha was going to pay them causing a conflict between the Ravagers. Taserface along with some of the clan, including Kraglin Obfonteri, turned against Yondu saying he has gone soft. The Ravagers then turned on each other and were about to engage in a fight when Nebula shot Yondu's Yaka Arrow Controller off the top of his head, consequently causing him to go unconscious from the impact.[2]\n\nYondu, Rocket, and Groot were taken to the Eclector where all Ravagers who sided with Yondu were ejected into space. Yondu, being subdued, watched as Taserface took control of his clan and beat him up. Yondu was then put in a cell with Rocket and would be delivered to the Kree the next day where they would be executed.\n\nYondu told Rocket about his history as a Ravager including his time with his team that showed similarities to the Guardians of the Galaxy as they had a family like a relationship. Yondu also mentioned his exile by Stakar Ogord and that he deserves everything that is happening to him as he broke the Ravager code. Rocket told Yondu that Peter Quill was with Ego, worrying him. Yondu was asked by Rocket on why he didn't deliver Quill, saying that he was good for thieving.[2]\n\nRocket then told Yondu that they needed to escape right as Groot, who had just been terrorized by Retch, walked by their cell. Yondu asked Groot to retrieve his Yaka Arrow Controller so that he could use his Yaka Arrow to help them all escape. Groot failed to understand Yondu's orders and retrieved several items that were not the controller including his underwear, a desk, Vorker's eye, and a severed toe. After a few failed attempts, Kraglin Obfonteri eventually retrieved the controller and decided to help them as he was not aware that they were going to start a mutiny and kill all of Obfonteri's friends. Yondu told Kraglin to get the third Quadrant ready for release.\n\nObfonteri was instructed by Rocket to play some of Peter Quill's music to warn the Ravagers that Yondu was escaping, but what they didn't know is that he was already ready for them with his newly attached controller. When \"Come A Little Bit Closer\" alerted the Ravagers, two of them checked on Yondu they were killed by him with his new controller and the three escaped their cells. Then a group of Ravagers charged at them, but they were no match for Yondu who killed them all within seconds and then continued to escape. The three made their way to a catwalk where Yondu managed to kill a lot more Ravagers who then fell past them after being stabbed by the Yaka Arrow.\n\nYondu, Rocket, and Groot made their way to the control room where they used the advantage of the display screens to kill any remaining Ravagers. While having fun with their attacks, Yondu then noticed Taserface walking through a hallway and called his arrow and flew it straight at him while igniting it. Yondu destroyed the Eclector due to the arrow hitting the fuel tank, killing Taserface. Yondu then met up with Obfonteri and the four escaped into the Quadrant and headed for Ego's Planet.[2]\n\nHaving escaped with the others, the gang headed straight for Ego to rescue the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy as Yondu knew Ego's true intentions for Peter Quill. As they prepared to leave, Rocket set the ship to seven-hundred jumps - fourteen times the safe limit of fifty - causing all of their faces, including Groot and Kraglin Obfonteri, to temporarily disfigure as they traveled.\n\nWhen they arrived, the four were thrown to the ground after the number of jumps they just took at once. Rocket told Yondu that he wanted to save Quill from Ego so he could prove he's better than him, but Yondu confronted Rocket about who he really is. Rocket rejected Yondu's observation but he continued on by telling him how much they are the same. After their dispute, Yondu told them that they're going to fight a planet which Rocket hesitated as he was not aware of Ego's true form.[2]\n\nYondu and Rocket saved Star-Lord by crashing straight into Ego. The Guardians of the Galaxy got into the Construction Drilling Vessel which surprised Quill to see Yondu helping them. Quill sarcastically thanked Yondu for not delivering him to Ego still under the impression that the only reason he kept him was that he was skinny. Yondu told Quill that he knew about what happened to Ego's other children so that was why he didn't deliver him.\n\nAs they broke free of Ego's palace, Quill directed the ship towards the ground. Yondu insisted they flee the planet, only to be told that Ego was going to destroy the universe as they know it, so they had to drill into his core to destroy it. As they drilled down, Yondu asked Quill about what Ego wanted him for. Quill told him that he wanted to use his power, which he used to create a ball which was all he could think of, which Yondu tried to tell him that he doesn't use his head to control the Yaka Arrow.[2]\n\nAs they were destroying the core, Kraglin Obfonteri informed them that the Sovereign were coming right as they came under fire by the Sovereign, who were given Yondu's coordinates by Taserface in his final moments. The Guardians fell out of the ship and Rocket and Quill went to blow up Ego's core with a bomb he just created leaving Yondu and Nebula on the Laser Drill. Quill flew back to the ship to ask Yondu if he had any tape for the bomb but he didn't. The Sovereign started firing at the ship causing their thrusters to go out.\n\nNebula hooked herself up to the ship causing her to be electrocuted as the ship's lasers destroyed the entire Sovereign fleet. The ship then blew up from the attack so Yondu quickly summoned his Yaka Arrow to escape. Yondu used his Arrow to fly down which Quill compared him to Mary Poppins hovering with her umbrella and when he asked if \"he\" was cool, Quill said yes. Yondu, not knowing that Mary Poppins was woman, proceeded to proclaim that he was Mary Poppins. Yondu and Quill landed and regrouped with the rest.[2]\n\nAll the Guardians came together, but Mantis was knocked out by Ego causing the planet to be under his control again. Yondu called Kraglin Obfonteri to bring the Quadrant down so the Guardians could evacuate. They were soon separated by Ego leaving him, Quill and Rocket to fight off Ego's attacks. After a while of fighting, Yondu and Rocket become trapped by some rubble by Ego and his Yaka Arrow broke. Before Yondu could be completely covered by the rubble, he inspired Quill to fight Ego. Yondu was freed along with the other Guardians who were trapped by Ego.[2]\n\nWhen the Guardians of the Galaxy were evacuating due to the bomb being set off by Groot, Yondu decided to stay so he could save Peter Quill, as he has done nothing else right in his life. Rocket gave him the last space suit and flight suit. Groot then welcomed Yondu onto the Guardians of the Galaxy, to which Rocket proudly translated.\n\nAs Ego exploded, Yondu, wearing a flight suit rescued Quill from the destruction and flew him to safety. Unfortunately, there was only one space suit left so Yondu gave it to Quill and saved his life, sacrificing his own. Yondu told Quill that Ego may have been his biological father, but he was not his daddy, as they flew into space. Quill watched as Yondu began to suffocate and freeze right in front of him, not being able to do anything about it. Before Yondu fully succumbed, he patted Quill's face to calm him. Quill held onto Yondu as he mourned his loss.[2]\n\nQuill was retrieved from space along with Yondu's body, giving him a funeral with the Guardians and Kraglin Obfonteri. Quill gave a eulogy and talked about how he used to tell kids that David Hasselhoff was his dad when in fact Yondu was kind of like Hasselhoff, essentially meaning he was Quill's dad all along. They then cremated the body as Rocket called the rest of the Ravagers who gave Yondu a Ravager farewell. After Yondu's funeral, Obfonteri was given the Yaka Arrow Controller while he gave Quill a Zune that Yondu had found in a shop and was going to give to Quill.[2]\n\nObfonteri took up Yondu's trademark weapon and began to practice using the weapon only to end up accidentally (and nonfatally) stabbing Drax in the chest. Yondu's actions went on to inspire Stakar Ogord to assemble his previous team, which Yondu was previously a part of, as he believed that Yondu would be proud to know that they were together again.[4]\n\nAs the leader of his own faction of the Ravagers, Yondu Udonta appeared as an unscrupulous thief. He was willing to kill, threaten and betray if his well-being was in danger or he desired something of value, sometimes reneging on his employers for a benefit such as turning Peter Quill into a Ravager when he was supposed to deliver him to Ego. Though he claimed that the Ravagers have a code of honor, as Quill states that code is virtually stolen from everyone. It should be noted that Yondu may have had some morality as he stopped the Ravagers from eating the young Quill - an act which he continued to throw in his face, even though it was, in fact, a joke.\n\nWith Quill, Yondu had a complicated history. As numerous of his men have stated, he had always been soft on him and protected his well being - at times costing his credibility amongst the Ravagers but he was willing to use Quill as an example to his men, if not apologetically. Despite being a thief, he had a level of trust in Quill but due to being betrayed beforehand, an equal level of mistrust and disappointment. For example, he took Quill's word in defending Xandar from Ronan the Accuser for the Power Stone but vowed to kill Quill and the Guardians of the Galaxy if they double-crossed him. Yondu beat Quill in front of his men to seem tough and threatened to kill him as an example. However, both of these instances were ruses as Yondu knew that Peter would talk his way out of both instances while having no intention of actually killing his adopted son. When given the Orb containing the Stone, he did not seem particularly angered to find out that Quill gave him a fake Orb. Quill does state that Yondu was the only family he had.\n\nYondu also had a habit in which he collected oddities and placed them on the console of his chair, with the most recent one being a Troll Doll that was given to him by Quill in the place of the Infinity Stone.\n\nEven with his flaws and unscrupulous attitudes, Yondu was not a heartless person: in spite of being a criminal, he had a level of humanity and a soft spot for Quill, his adopted son. Despite being a Ravager and not knowing how to raise a son, he still treated Quill as if he was his own son, treating him kindly even though Quill deceived him multiple times before. When he found Peter trying to celebrate Christmas when he was young, Yondu lashed out because he was of the mindset that Ravagers had to fight to get what they wanted. However, after later opening Peter's present to him, he softened his stance to Christmas by giving Peter Quad Blasters as a present, and subsequently began bonding with Peter. When he found a Troll Doll instead of the Infinity Stone inside the Orb, he smiled and chose to forgive this deception instead of lashing out in anger. It is also revealed that Yondu did not deliver Quill to Ego because he learned what happened to Ego's other children and kept Quill away from his father to keep him safe. Yondu likewise felt shame and remorse for having delivered Ego's other children to their fates and despite attempting to justify himself that he didn't knew, Yondu deep down acknowledged he deserved the punishment of being banished by Stakar Ogord. Yondu was also surprisingly patient with the incompetence of baby Groot, even affectionately nicknaming him \"Twig\". Yondu’s fatherly love towards Quill was exhibited in the fact that Yondu sacrificed himself to save Quill after destroying Ego. Similar to his bond with Quill, Yondu also had a close bond with his first mate, Kraglin. Kraglin deeply respected and looked up to Yondu and Yondu also treated him like a member of the family.\n\nHe also kept the Ravagers from attacking the Guardians when he was not given the Infinity Stone he was promised and cleverly kept his intentions hidden by saying the Nova Corps would be after them since their actions on Xandar had made the Guardians allies to the Nova Corps. Yondu sacrificed his own life to save Quill and even inspired him to stand up to his megalomaniac father. In his dying moments, he told Quill while Ego was his biological father, he was not Quill's dad since he did not raise him and that Yondu was his dad. This act shows how much he loved Peter, as he sacrificed himself to ensure his survival. When Quill began frantically trying to remove his spacesuit, Yondu gently patted his face, granting Quill some genuinely fatherly affection at last.",
