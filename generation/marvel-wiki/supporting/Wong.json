  "content": "Wong is the current Sorcerer Supreme of the Masters of the Mystic Arts. When their former librarian was murdered by Kaecilius and the Zealots, Wong then became the highly protective keeper of all the ancient books when he met Stephen Strange, and assisted him in his studies. As Kaecilius attempted to use his power to bring Dormammu to Earth, Wong and the other Masters used their power to eventually defeat him, at the cost of Ancient One's death. With Kaecilius' conflict over, Wong joined Doctor Strange in protecting the New York Sanctum.\n\nWong stood with Strange and Iron Man when the Black Order attacked New York City in search of the Time Stone. After Strange was kidnapped by Ebony Maw, Wong was forced to remain behind in order to protect the Sanctum. When Strange perished along with half of the universe due to Thanos' Snap, Wong became the new Sorcerer Supreme. In 2023, Wong and the other Masters transported many of the revived Avengers and their allies to New York so that they could join the final battle against an alternate Thanos. By 2024, Wong was a regular fighter at the Golden Daggers Club in Macau, participating in cage matches where he met and befriended Abomination, whom he would return to the Damage Control Supermax Prison after their fights. Shortly after, he met Shang-Chi and Katy Chen in order to question them about the origins of the Ten Rings.\n\nLater that year, Wong was informed that Wanda Maximoff was the prophesized Scarlet Witch and that she was hunting America Chavez, a teenager with the power to open portals across the Multiverse. Wong survived Scarlet Witch's siege of Kamar-Taj and informed her of the Darkhold's origins at Mount Wundagore in order to save the lives of the other Masters. Wong was able to elude an attempt on his life and later assisted a dreamwalking Strange in fighting Scarlet Witch. After the battle, Wong took Chavez, who decided to stay in his universe, under his care as she began training in the Mystic Arts.\n\nWong would become involved with She-Hulk when he was brought forward as a witness during the parole hearing of Emil Blonsky. Wong himself would later employ She-Hulk in his lawsuit against Donny Blaze for utilizing dangerous magic for monetary gain. After Blonsky was arrested for breaking his parole conditions, Wong helped him escape from prison and offered him shelter in Kamar-Taj.\n\nWong began working as a Target Sales Associate in Kamar-Taj, Nepal. He worked there for nine years,[4] before becoming a librarian for the Masters of the Mystic Arts and becoming a sorcerer himself, seeking knowledge, understanding and peace. He felt free to develop his mind and spent as much time as possible reading, including The Book of the Five.[5]\n\nWong trained alongside Kaecilius and Karl Mordo, the latter having joined after Wong had been there for some time. Wong and Mordo became friendly, although Wong was never certain about whether they were friends. Wong observed strength and courage in Mordo's actions many times, but also sensed a rigidity in his beliefs that worried Wong.[5] During his time with the Masters of the Mystic Arts, Wong learned of the Infinity Stones, such as the Space Stone and its association with Red Skull before it was found by S.H.I.E.L.D.[6] He also knew that the Time Stone was housed inside the Eye of Agamotto.[1] As he continued studying and keeping track of the Infinity Stones, he feared what would occur if somebody would ever combine all six.[6]\n\nWong had been tasked with locating and securing the Dark Sceptre. A object of immense power the Scepter had been stolen by a woman who had grew scornful against the world. Wong tracked her down to London and attempted to take the Staff off her. However, the power of the Dark Scepter proved to immense and the woman managed to escape. Back at Kamar-Taj, Kaecilius scorned Wong for losing the woman and the scepter; however, Wong insisted that with the power that the woman possessed with the Scepter the situation should be handled more reverently.\n\nKaecilius claimed the Wong's concentration on his own failings was the reason the mission was not a success. Fellow Masters of the Mystic Arts members Daniel Drumm and Tina Minoru then arrived and told Kaecilius that Wong's trepidation should be a sign to be careful and heed his instincts rather than just insult him. When Kaecilius asked why they were not doing their other duties Drumm told him the situation proved serious enough that more than one member of the Masters of The Mystic was needed to subdue the thief. Kaecilius refused, however, and claimed that he could handle the thief himself. Wong, Drum, Minoru later arrived to find an unconscious Kaecilius who had been beaten by the thief and had underestimated the Staffs power.\n\nKaecilius realized the others were right and decided to team up to stop the thief. Later at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, the group confronted the thief and after a grueling battle with their combined efforts they were able to overpower her and claim the Scepter. With Wong putting it with all the other mystical objects at the Sanctum Sanctorum.[7]\n\nWong was appointed as the librarian at Kamar-Taj following the unexpected betrayal of Kaecilius, who had murdered the previous Librarian and stolen pages from the Book of Cagliostro.[1] Wong noticed a new member, Stephen Strange, wandering Kamar-Taj for several days, and although he never asked, Wong wondered what prompted Karl Mordo to bring a man such as Strange into the walls of Kamar-Taj to meet the Ancient One.[5] While still working in the Library, Wong was formally introduced to Strange. Wong remained serious despite all of Strange's attempts at making him laugh by comparing Wong's own single name to Adele and Eminem while Wong simply focused on his work.\n\nImpressed by his level of understanding of all the Mystic Arts within such a short amount of time training with Mordo, Wong decided to give Strange access to some deeper parts of his library which were normally for Masters of the Mystic Arts only and handed him new books, informing Strange that he could borrow any book he pleased, including the Ancient One's private collections of books, noting that no knowledge in Kamar-Taj would be forbidden for him to learn.\n\nDuring their conversation, Strange found the Book of Cagliostro and pointed out the missing pages as Wong then proceeded to explain to Strange how the Zealots' recent attack, led by Kaecilius had resulted in the pages being stolen. Noting how the previous librarian had been beheaded by Kaecilius in the Library, Wong noted that all the books were now under his protection and if anyone tried to steal any of the books, Wong would personally kill any person who was responsible, making Strange extremely uncomfortable as Strange began jokingly questioning if there would be any punishments for him if he were to bring the books back late, which Wong still did not laugh at.[1] Mordo later told Wong about Strange's attempts at making an Inter-Dimensional Portal and how the Ancient One challenged him by stranding him on a frozen mountain.[5]\n\nWhile still working in the Library in Kamar-Taj, Wong was then visited once again by Stephen Strange, who requested some new books on the Astral Dimension for his studies. Wong, however, claimed that Strange was not ready for these just yet, only for Strange to still insist while jokingly calling Wong \"Beyoncé\". However, Wong still did not laugh and simply refused to hand over the books to Strange.\n\nLater, as he was reading while listening to Beyoncé inside the Library while reading more of the books, Wong failed to notice Strange using his Sling Ring to take books from the library. Although Wong failed to see him actually taking any of the books, he did notice that Strange had even stolen the book right in front of him, resulting in Wong then going to the Ancient One and informing her of all Strange's actions, noting how Strange was becoming impatient in his studies.[1] Strange particularly became impatient with how to use his astral form. Wong gave him books to help.[8]\n\nLater, when he and Karl Mordo caught Stephen Strange practicing a time spell from the Book of Cagliostro and using the Eye of Agamotto, they reprimanded him for it, stating that he was breaking natural laws. Strange had earlier tried to call Wong to check whether or not the book was restricted, but proceeded on his own after not receiving a response. Wong explained to Strange the purposes of the Sanctums for keeping Dormammu from Earth before the London Sanctum was destroyed by Kaecilius and the explosion knocked him back.[1]\n\nIn response to attacks made towards all the Sanctums around the world, Wong defended the Hong Kong Sanctum from Kaecilius and the Zealots. While Wong collected the Wand of Watoomb, he ordered the remaining Masters of the Mystic Arts to not allow anyone to enter the final Sanctum.\n\nWong died when the Sanctum was destroyed, allowing Dormammu to arrive, beginning to consume Earth and bring it into the Dark Dimension. When Strange used the Eye of Agamotto to reverse what had happened, he was revived. Doctor Strange brought Wong into his time slip where the reverse effects wouldn't affect him, nor their comrade Karl Mordo, preparing to fight Kaecilius. Strange was expecting a lecture on breaking the laws of nature, but Wong, realizing there was no other choice and that he had just been dead a moment ago, told Strange to keep going. Right when the duel was about to start, Strange seemingly abandoned the group and flew into the Dark Dimension.\n\nStrange returned seconds later and the Zealots were taken to the Dark Dimension instead. Wong laughed at Strange's quip about the \"warnings coming after the spells\". Unlike Karl Mordo, who became disillusioned and left the Masters of the Mystic Arts, Wong did not blame Strange for breaking natural law.[1] As Mordo left Strange, Wong, and Kamar-Taj, Wong worried about the danger that Mordo now posed.[5]\n\nBefore Strange was appointed to be a new guardian of the New York Sanctum in the wake of Daniel Drumm's untimely death, Wong revealed that the Eye of Agamotto held an Infinity Stone. Wong also noted that due to the Ancient One's death, Earth was vulnerable and needed them to be ready to defend it from those seeking to destroy it.[1]\n\nStrange and Wong started to develop a close relationship, as Strange would often say things as an attempt to get a rise out of Wong, but Wong would refuse.[5] A few months into Strange's time as the New York Sanctum's guardian, Wong interrupted his journey into the Astral Dimension to alert him to the foreboding air in the sanctums. Updating Strange with what he knew about the Infinity Stones, Wong also alerted Strange to Thor and Loki's presence in New York City.[6] At a full moon party that was held at Kamar-Taj, Strange cast the Runes of Kof-Kol to erase the memories of everyone who attended the party, including Wong.[3]\n\nWong took it upon himself to document the events of the previous year, though he struggled to find the correct words to describe Stephen Strange. He eventually simply wrote \"he was arrogant\" on the page and smiled to himself. Strange called after him, suggesting that he needed a break. Strange gave Wong tea and jokingly asked how arrogant he was. As the two drank tea together, Strange noted that Wong appeared suspicious. Wong explained that he never brought tea, so Strange confessed that he wanted to see what Wong was writing about him. Wong laughed and explained that he needed to note what happened since Strange joined so that future generations could learn.\n\nStrange eventually left, and Wong returned to writing, thinking about how quickly Strange had learned. Hours later, he left the study and saw Strange at the foot of the staircase. Wong asked where Strange went, but Strange replied by expressing frustration that Wong was keeping his writing secret. Wong started to leave, but Strange told him to stop. Wong convinced Strange to tell him where he went in exchange for Wong thinking about telling Strange about the writing, so they went to Strange's room. Strange told Wong about headaches he had been having with visions of something growing closer. Wong went to Kamar-Taj while Strange stayed to meditate and looked through the texts, starting with The Book of the Setting Sun. Strange offered Wong various fruits through an Inter-Dimensional Portal, but Wong turned them down. After hours of reading, Wong fell asleep.[5]\n\nWhen Wong woke up, he realized that Stephen Strange had not bothered Wong for a long time and realized that Strange was probably trying to get rid of Wong so that he could do something reckless. He closed his book and rushed back to the New York Sanctum, finding the foyer empty. He found Strange meditating on a mountain through the Rotunda of Gateways, so he returned to his writing. He spent an hour writing and heard Strange return to the Sanctum and told Strange that the research in Kamar-Taj was fruitless, getting Strange to confess that he knew Wong would not find anything. Strange explained that he lied so that Wong would not get attacked in case something followed him on his return to the mountain. Wong then asked what Strange learned, so Strange took him back to the library.\n\nStrange explained that he had another vision of a tentacled creature going to Earth, and Wong guessed it was the E'kolith. However, Strange said that it was the Kalkartho, something which no one on Earth had encountered. Wong asked what they were going to find in the library, so Strange said they were looking for hope. Strange looked through The Book of the Five and found the Bonds of Baelzar, and Wong voiced his disagreement. However, Strange went ahead with the plan and led Wong to Mendoza, Argentina, where they went to the Magenta Dimension before returning to the New York Sanctum.\n\nOnce back in the Sanctum, Strange explained that the bonds drew power from the Magenta Dimension, so he planned to intercept the Kalkartho in the Astral Dimension and banish it. However, the Kalkartho suddenly attacked, knocking Strange unconscious. Wong managed to contain Strange and pry his eyes open, seeing only black. Strange stopped breathing, so Wong administered CPR, saving his life. Wong tried to get Strange to stay out of it, but Strange insisted on helping, and the two decided to end it.\n\nThey projected themselves into the Astral Dimension and went to the Moon. The pair released energy from the Magenta Dimension, when Wong suddenly felt himself being torn apart. Strange and Wong realized that Kalkartho was feeding on their bodies, and that the rest of the planet would be next. The green creature suddenly appeared in front of them and attacked Wong, who avoided the attacks, feeling a jolt of electricity that nearly caused him to faint. Wong continued avoiding attacks but passed out. He woke up in the Sanctum, when Strange revealed that Kalkartho would be coming, and he needed to be ready. The creature appeared and Wong activated the Bonds of Baelzar, releasing mist from the Magenta Dimension. Wong, Strange, and Kalkartho were brought into the Magenta Dimension, where Kalkartho would have a never-ending supply of energy. Strange and Wong watched Kalkartho consume an energy cloud and returned to Earth.\n\nWong returned to his writing, only to find Strange spying on him with an Inter-Dimensional Portal and eating pizza. Wong offered to tell Strange what he was writing in exchange for a slice, and Strange commented that they would always be ready to fight before closing the portal. Wong reflected on the fight, worried that there were bigger threats to come.[5]\n\nOne day in 2018, Wong visited Doctor Strange at the New York Sanctum. He asked Strange, who was heading out, to go to the deli-grocery store for food, as Strange asked why Wong did not have any money. In response, Wong noted that attachment to the material was detachment from the spiritual, to which Strange had to mockingly tell Wong that he would tell this statement when he arrived at the store. Remembering his currency, Wong had then pulled out two hundred rupees and was asked how much it was worth, which Strange noted was a buck and half.\n\nAs Wong decided to go with Strange, Strange asked what Wong wanted at the store and told him that he would not say no to a tuna melt. However, the two were then interrupted by the Bifrost Bridge bringing Bruce Banner crashing down from the sky into the staircase inside the Sanctum, and they decided to investigate. As he was equipped with his Tao Mandalas, Wong found Banner lying in the wreckage, warning that Thanos was coming to Earth, as Strange asked who Thanos was.\n\nAt Banner's urging, he and Strange went to find Tony Stark who was with Pepper Potts at Central Park, needing Stark's help for the upcoming battle. Once Strange summoned Stark to the Sanctum, Wong filled Banner and Stark in with information about the Infinity Stones, as Strange introduced their names. Once Stark asked about Thanos, Stark proposed to destroy the Time Stone, but Wong told him that he and Strange had sworn an oath to protect with his life. After a brief verbal tiff between Stark and Banner, Wong and Strange noticed the commotion outside.[9]\n\nAt that moment, a Q-Ship arrived, hovering above the city, causing mass chaos and destruction in the streets, such as car accidents. Wong walked outside and witnessed it, standing with Doctor Strange, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner. They then saw Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian being beamed down from the ship onto the street. Wong then took notice of Maw's statements.\n\nAfter Maw became annoyed with Stark, he took his attention towards Strange and demanded the Time Stone. However, Strange refused to give up the Stone, and he and Wong prepared for battle by equipping duel Tao Mandalas and fought Maw and Obsidian, with Wong also casting the Shield of the Seraphim to shield himself and Banner. As Obsidian focused his attention on Stark, Maw cast a flurry of brick spikes at them, which Strange caught in an Inter-Dimensional Portal before Wong redirected them out of another, injuring Maw in the face. Infuriated, Maw responded by rupturing a fire hydrant, causing a spray of water that incapacitated Wong.\n\nOnce Wong managed to recover, he arrived at Greenwich Village and saved Stark by transporting Obsidian to Antarctica. Wong then closed the portal, severing Obsidian's left forearm. After this, Stark remarked that Wong was now invited to his wedding for saving him, before flying away. Due to Strange being captured, Wong said goodbye to Banner and returned to the New York Sanctum to protect it in his stead.[9] Soon after, Wong survived the Snap.[3]\n\nIn 2023, following the Blip, Wong was contacted by a restored Doctor Strange and traveled across the universe, enlisting allies for the battle against an alternate Thanos and his army.\n\nWong and Strange then opened up numerous Inter-Dimensional Portals to bring them all to the ruins of the Avengers Compound. Wong also brought the sorcerers from Kamar-Taj and the Hong Kong Sanctum with him. When Strange met Wong in person, he inquired if they were able to summon everyone, in which Wong exasperatedly asked Strange if he wanted more. Wong then stood alongside all the assembled heroes as Steve Rogers led the charge into battle.\n\nDuring the battle, Wong and his fellow sorcerers conjured massive Tao Mandalas to protect their allies after alternate Thanos ordered the Sanctuary II to rain fire on them, until they were all saved by Captain Marvel, who destroyed the spaceship with ease. The battle came to an end when Iron Man used the Infinity Stones to snap alternate Thanos and his entire army out of existence, though at the cost of his own life.\n\nA week later, Wong and Strange attended Stark's funeral at Stark's home. He and Strange stood side by side together at the procession as they watched Stark's Arc Reactor being sent adrift into the lake.[10]\n\nIn 2024, Wong was chosen to be the Sorcerer Supreme, as the title had to be filled and Doctor Strange was no longer eligible to be a candidate.[11] As Sorcerer Supreme, Wong sought for a worthy opponent and thought of Emil Blonsky.[4] Wong used his Sling Ring to portal himself to the Damage Control Supermax Prison and break Abomination out of his cell and transported him to the Golden Daggers Club, where they participated in cage matches and became close friends. During one such match, Wong and Blonsky had a deal to fix the match, although Wong managed to defeat Abomination by using a portal to cause him to punch himself.\n\nAfterwards, Wong and Abomination went to a room to decompress from the tournament.[12] Wong told Abomination that he had gotten more violent than they had agreed, but Abomination only grunted. Wong then offered Abomination a drink of water. Ready to leave the club, Wong conjured a portal for him and Abomination to leave through. Wong went first and called Abomination to follow as they went to back to his cell.[12]\n\nLater, Wong and the other sorcerers detected a beacon being emitted from when Shang-Chi used Xu Wenwu's rings. Wong then located Shang-Chi in a restaurant in San Francisco and emerged through an Inter-Dimensional Portal, telling Shang-Chi and Katy Chen to come with him to Kamar-Taj, shocking Soo and John.[12]\n\nWong then contacted Carol Danvers and Bruce Banner via hologram to try and better understand the mythical artifacts. However, they were clueless about its origins, with Danvers noting it wasn't alien technology. Danvers suddenly left the call to respond to an alert, while Banner disconnected soon after. Wong informed Shang-Chi and Chen that they were now on the hero's path, with no way to turn back.\n\nHe encouraged them to return home and get some rest, but Shang-Chi then got the idea to sing karaoke. Wong agreed to participate and went with them to a nightclub in San Francisco and sang \"Hotel California\".[12] After completing all of the requirements of his training, Wong was appointed the role of Sorcerer Supreme.[4]\n\nNow Sorcerer Supreme, Wong strived to be better than every Sorcerer Supreme that came before him. As such, decided rethink how Magic was taught to students at Kamar-Taj. Noting the failings of past Sorcerer Supremes, most notably the Ancient One, Wong decided to focus on teaching his students defensive magic rather than offensive magic. As Sorcerer Supreme, Wong also took up an apprentice named Rintrah.[13]\n\nSeveral months later, the Rotunda of Gateways opened up to Siberia and a blizzard came through into the New York Sanctum covering it in snow and ice. To handle this, Wong hired a young woman and man to shovel out the snow and he and Doctor Strange had to wear winter jackets inside. In November, Wong appeared in the Sanctum's foyer via Inter-Dimensional Portal and found Peter Parker inside. He greeted Parker, addressing how Parker was now the most famous person in the world as his identity had been revealed to the public.\n\nWhen Parker asked if they were having a holiday party, Wong told him what had happened in the Sanctum. Strange then arrived and levitated down to stand beside Wong. When Parker became confused after hearing Strange was not Sorcerer Supreme, Strange told him that Wong now held the title due to Strange having blipped. He then walked off to collect his luggage leaving Strange and Parker to talk.\n\nWong overheard Parker asking Strange to help reverse what Mysterio had done by revealing his identity and when Strange proposed a spell he could do, Wong advised against it. He stated it was too dangerous, although Strange reminded him that they had done the spell before in Kamar-Taj. Wong forgot this and reluctantly agreed, trusting Strange's judgment before walking back through another portal to head to Kamar-Taj.[3]\n\nShort time later, Wong learned that an inter-dimensional being from within the Multiverse had entered his universe. He located it in New York City, used an Inter-Dimensional Portal to arrive there and confronted Gargantos, who had been chasing a girl. As he tried to combat the being using his Eldritch Whip and a mystical sword, it soon overpowered him and grabbed him with its tentacles. Wong watched as the Cloak of Levitation arrived and rescued the girl. As Gargantos carried Wong in pursuit of the girl, Doctor Strange, who had been knocked into Jonas & James, arrived and sliced off the tentacle freeing Wong.\n\nWong followed to remind him that it was an ancient customary to bow to the Sorcerer Supreme, something Strange clearly remembered, and they used two Eldritch Whips to restrain the creature. Both were lifted by the creature and Wong lost his whip, causing it to fall, but he opened a portal, managing to save himself, and crashed his head into a car as he watched Strange kill Gargantos with a pole. Afterwards, Wong and Strange met to talk to the girl and find out why Gargantos was chasing her, however, they realized that she had taken Strange's Sling Ring, and Wong used his ring to get to her, gaining his trust, and finding out. that she could travel the Multiverse.[14]\n\nAt Mancini's Pizzeria, Wong and Doctor Strange questioned who the girl was. She asked them if they had any experience with the Multiverse, in which they explained their recent events helping Spider-Man, and got into a discussion about his powers. In the talk, Wong found out that someone sent Gargantos to steal the girl's power. He also conversed in Spanish with her, as she was shocked that Strange could not.\n\nWhen Strange got irritated with the girl, he said he had left a wedding to help her, and Wong was shocked that Strange had decided to go to Christine Palmer's wedding. The girl then told them she was looking for the Book of Vishanti, in which Strange said wasn't real, but Wong stated it was real but no one knew how to get to it. The girl stated she did.\n\nTo believe the girl regarding her powers, Wong and Strange were taken to a building's rooftop and shown the corpse of Strange's alternate counterpart, implying that Strange's nightmares were things that happened to his counterparts from other universes, and Wong hinted that his dream in which he was being chased by a clown was in another universe. Wong then asked the girl what her name was and she introduced herself as America Chavez. Wong saw Strange bury his counterpart's corpse, and quickly suggested that it was not magic, but witchcraft, so Strange decided to go see Wanda Maximoff to find out more while Wong took Chavez to Kamar-Taj to protect her.[14]\n\nLater that day, Doctor Strange returned to Kamar-Taj and met with Wong, America Chavez, Sara, Rintrah, and other Masters of the Mystic Arts. He told them that the Darkhold had influenced Scarlet Witch and that she was coming for Chavez. Wong then explained that Scarlet Witch was a being of unfathomable power. Strange also relayed that Scarlet Witch had taken over a town with her powers, noting how powerful she was. Wong then instructed that all teaching of the students be stopped as Kamar-Taj needed to be set up as a fortress.\n\nAfter all the students and Masters had gotten in their positions, Wong and Strange went outside and saw a huge dark cloud floating towards them. It soon covered Kamar-Taj, encasing the atmosphere in darkness. In the center of the cloud, they saw Scarlet Witch levitating above. Knowing that Strange would speak to her, Wong told him to chose his words wisely as the fate of the Multiverse may depend on it. Wong then watched as Scarlet Witch removed the cloud and as Strange flew up to speak to her.\n\nWong watched as Scarlet Witch grew angry and used her chaos magic to blast the protective shield around Kamar-Taj. As Strange returned to stand beside him, Scarlet Witch continued to blast different sides of the shield. However, she eventually stopped and stared in the direction of some students. Strange told Wong that Scarlet Witch was trying to use her telepathy to control them and Wong shouted out commands to the Masters.\n\nEven after their best efforts, Scarlet Witch was able to use her astral form to compel one of the sorcerers to run, closing his shield and causing confusion. Scarlet Witch then was able to blast Kamar-Taj with her powers. As she became too powerful to stop, Strange and Wong ordered the Masters to fall back. Wong and Strange rushed inside and went to the room where Chavez was with Hamir and another Master. Strange had set up a trap for Scarlet Witch using the Mirror Dimension, but after she found a way to escape it by using the mirror's reflections, Hamir and the other Masters were taken away through them.\n\nSeeing this, Strange told Wong and Chavez to cover up any puddles in the room. Scarlet Witch soon located an entry point through a gong and confronted them. Scarlet Witch told them that all she wanted was her two children. Strange told her she had none, but she then summoned the Darkhold, and displayed various universes revealing that she had two boys in each. She told them that every night she had the same dream and woke up with a nightmare about not having them.\n\nWhen Strange asked what would happen to Scarlet Witch's alternate self, she stared at them without answering, in which Strange sensed she was going to attack them. He engaged first, but was swiftly knocked aside by Scarlet Witch, who lifted Chavez and began stealing her powers. Wong then tried to rescue Chavez and fought Scarlet Witch, but she was stronger and cast him aside, knocking him out.[14]\n\nWhen Wong regained consciousness, he found himself tied up with magic restraints in one of Kamar-Taj's courtyards. He saw that Scarlet Witch had engaged in dreamwalking and was soon approached by Sara. Sara told him that the Darkhold needed to be destroyed and Wong asked her to release him so he could do it. However, she told him that it was not him that needed to do it and instead ran at the Darkhold, destroying it with a dagger. Wong watched in horror as Sara immediately burnt to a crisp.\n\nWong watched as Scarlet Witch was interrupted from her dreamwalking and panicked that the Darkhold had been destroyed. She then glared at Wong and blasted him further into the courtyard, demanding to know where she could find another Darkhold. Wong stated she could kill him, but she instead threatened Rintrah and two other Masters of the Mystic Arts. Seeing this, Wong gave in and told her that the Darkhold was a copy and the original text could be found at Mount Wundagore. Scarlet Witch recognized the name and snatched a Sling Ring off of one of the Masters and demanded Wong take her there.[14]\n\nWong opened an Inter-Dimensional Portal and walked through with Wanda Maximoff to Mount Wundagore in Eastern Europe. They found it snowing and Wong told her how treacherous the journey was. When they reached the top, they saw that the Darkhold Castle was on the other side of the gorge. Maximoff asked why he could not have portalled them there and he told her that the Masters of the Mystic Arts were not supposed to practice magic on the forbidden grounds of the mountain. Maximoff then used her powers to fly herself and Wong over.\n\nWong and Maximoff walked carefully into the Castle, with Wong noting that he had no idea what could be there and explained to Maximoff that Chthon was the author of the Darkhold and had written it there. Maximoff then used her powers to create fires in the Castle so they could see, only to find themselves confronted by the Elder Beasts. Wong and Maximoff prepared to fight them, until they knelt down and bowed to Maximoff. Confused, Wong and Maximoff looked up and noticed they were in a temple for the Scarlet Witch, and a statue of her was on the wall behind them.\n\nMaximoff stated she was meant to rule the world, but didn't want that, only to have a family. Wong asked her why she did not just ask America Chavez to send her to a universe where her children were without a mother. Maximoff said that wouldn't work, because she would want to find a universe where they wouldn't get sick. Realizing that the Darkhold was making Maximoff not being able to reason, Wong accidentally angered Maximoff and she threw him out of the Castle. He fell down below onto an icy ledge and fell unconscious.[14]\n\nEventually, Wong regained consciousness and took in his predicament, stranded on a ledge overlooking an abyss. He used his Eldritch Whip to get up, but then saw the Elder Beasts looking down on him. He hit one with the Whip, sending it over the ledge. One Knight threw a huge stone slab down to stop him, but he used a Tao Mandalas to shield himself. As the others prepared to throw more stones at him, Wong watched as Doctor Strange, who had dreamwalked through his variant's corpse arrived, carried by demons. Wong watched as he caused the Knights to fall over into the abyss.\n\nWong then used the Whip to propel himself back up to the Castle. He and Strange then used their magic to entrap Wanda Maximoff in a prism cell with the demons. However, she was stronger and fiercely blasted Wong backwards, as well as decimating the demons. Wong regained consciousness again and watched as Maximoff, who was now free of the Darkhold, stated that she would make things right and began destroying the Castle. America Chavez ran over to Wong and told them they needed to leave, and opened a portal back to Kamar-Taj.[14]\n\nWong rebuilt Kamar-Taj and resumed teaching of the Masters of the Mystic Arts. Strange walked near America Chavez, who joined the Masters to learn mystic arts but had troubles with using the Sling Ring, which prompted Wong to compare Chavez to Strange, due to Chavez's impatience.\n\nTalking about Strange's dreamwalking experience, Strange asked Wong was he happy, remarking that saving the world does not necessarily bring one happiness. Wong replied that despite everything, he is grateful for his current life.[14]\n\nWong then took residence in the New York Sanctum again, as Doctor Strange was in another dimension. In 2025, he received a phone call from Nikki Ramos asking him to get in contact with Jennifer Walters as Emil Blonsky was being investigated. Wong used his Sling Ring to portal himself to the GLK&H office in Los Angeles, California and appeared in Holden Holliway's office in the middle of a discussion between Walters, Holliway, Dennis Bukowski and Augustus Pugliese.\n\nWalters told them she had to go and led Wong to her office. He admitted that he was responsible for freeing Abomination and falsely claimed that he had only done so once as he needed a worthy opponent to train as Sorcerer Supreme. He then asked Walters not to punish Blonsky. She told him she would not be doing that, in which Wong told her not to suggest erasing memories. Wong mentioned he could send Blonsky to the Mirror Dimension or the Shadow Dimension, but Walters, not knowing what he was talking about, asked him to be present for the hearing. Wong agreed and said he would save sorcery as a plan B.[4]\n\nThe next day, Wong portalled himself to the Damage Control Supermax Prison, albeit being late to the hearing. Incriminating himself, Wong testified that he had freed Emil Blonsky against his will to participate in a kumite, adding that he had offered Blonsky refuge at Kamar-Taj which Blonsky had refused, wishing to complete his prison sentence. He then watched as Blonsky transformed into Abomination to show the parole jurors that he had indeed reformed and was capable of controlling himself.\n\nHe watched calmly as Jennifer Walters told Blonsky to transform back and then give her closing argument. The parole officers were convinced of Blonsky's innocence and agreed to parole him, and informed Wong that he had admitted to the crime of facilitating a prisoner escape. Wong then opened a portal to escape and returned back to Kamar-Taj.[4]\n\nWong returned to his room in Kamar-Taj and began watching shows. As he watched The Sopranos and danced while he ate a snack, an Inter-Dimensional Portal opened up above him and a woman fell through holding a bleeding heart much to his confusion and surprise.\n\nShe introduced herself as Madisynn King and explained who she was and where she was from. She then explained what had happened and how she had been sent into another dimension and met a demon who made a deal with her. She then saw what he was watching and blurted out a spoiler, much to Wong's frustration. Wong then deduced who was behind it and realized that Donny Blaze was to blame.\n\nWong then conjured a portal to She-Hulk's office at Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway and asked for assistance. He proceeded to elaborate on Blaze's former status as a student of the Mystic Arts before he was banished from Kamar-Taj after a week. He expressed his concern that Blaze's reckless use of the Mystic Arts without understand of interdimensional travel not only endangered innocent people, but also risked untangled the material and astral planes.\n\nThus, he needed to make an example of Blaze to dissuade any other unlicensed persons from practicing the Mystic Arts. When Walters asked if Blaze signed any contract or law binding agreements, to which he denied, thus serving to complicate his case. Wong stated that the Masters of the Mystic Arts answered to a higher power, but Walters argued they were dealing with the American legal system and insisted they do things by the book; Wong mistakenly assumed she was referring to the Book of Vishanti. Before returning to Kamar-Taj, Wong left Walters his business card.\n\nThe next day, Wong and Walters met with Blaze and Cornelius P. Willows at the Mystic Castle to serve their cease-and-desist order. Blaze accused Wong of fearing competition, to which he firmly declared that as Sorcerer Supreme, he did not engage in competition, yet boasted he was definitely more mystical than Blaze. He was almost provoked into proving his mystical superiority only for Walters to intervene and stop him. With Blaze refusing to back down, Walters promised to take them to court. As they were leaving, Wong demonstrated his own parlor trick but regurgitating a metal ball Blaze had previously made disappear.[2]\n\nWong and She-Hulk arrived at court and argued with Donny Blaze. Wong refused to call it real magic, which led Blaze to stand up and attempt a magic trick. She-Hulk then pushed Wong to call in Madisynn King as a witness. Wong did not want to do so, but eventually caved in, summoning her.\n\nKing then testified and was on Wong's side, but Judge Hanna ruled that Blaze should still be allowed to practice magic. As Wong walked out, King wanted to watch The Sopranos. Wong agreed, but King instantly spoiled a plot point from the show, much to Wong's frustration.[2]\n\nWong was back in Kamar-Taj when Donny Blaze suddenly arrived in front of him saying there was a huge problem. Wong saw the demons in the room and went to help but noted that it was for the good of the universe, he was not helping Blaze. He then told Blaze to call She-Hulk.\n\nWong then fought the demons, but She-Hulk did not pick up, so he sent a portal to her and saw she was on a date. Although he felt bad, he forced her to help. She-Hulk threw the demons at Wong as he sent them to an icy world while he repaired Blaze's portal. They were eventually able to get all of them as well as forcing Blaze to sign the cease and desist.\n\nIn Kamar-Taj, Wong watched another show with Madisynn King, becoming friends with her. They talked about different drinks that they have had, with Wong stating he one time had vodka and yak milk, but did not recommend it. King asked if they still had that and Wong said there might be some left over from the wedding.[2]\n\nWhen Emil Blonsky was returned to the Damage Control Supermax Prison, Wong decided to break his friend out. He opened up an Inter-Dimensional Portal to the cell and apologized to Blonsky for not liberating him earlier. Blonsky deduced that Wong must have preoccupied with his television shows as he stepped through the portal to Kamar-Taj.[15]\n\nAs a longtime student of the Ancient One and one of the most knowledgeable Masters of the Mystic Arts in Kamar-Taj, Wong is serious and unflinching when it comes to performing his duties, both as an instructor and later, a librarian of Kamar-Taj. After Kaecilius' betrayal, Wong gets more reluctant to trust others, and constantly puts up a stern appearance, to the point of threatening Doctor Strange when the latter was only trying to be friendly and make jokes when coming to borrow books. Despite being seemingly ignorant of contemporary pop culture, it is revealed that Wong actually enjoys his fair share of pop culture just like most are, but pretends to not be aware of it around others, and is less serious when others are not around. Like Karl Mordo, he has a great deal of respect for the Ancient One and the natural laws, but unlike the younger student, he is capable of moral flexibility and willing to bend said laws when the situation desperately calls for it, as shown when he approved of Strange's time-bending when confronting Dormammu. He has also shown more willingness to bend the law for his own convenience, as he helped Emil Blonsky, a dangerous criminal who nearly killed Hulk, out of a high-security prison in order to use him as training partner to become Sorcerer Supreme.\n\nAlthough initially hostile to Strange, due to the latter's attempts to be funny and exceeding inquisitiveness, Wong has come to appreciate those traits as well as Strange's exceptional gift at the Mystic Arts, eventually becoming one of his strongest allies, and his surrogate tutor in the absence of the Ancient One. He was deadset against Strange using the Eye of Agamotto as it violates the laws of nature, but after seeing Strange use it for the benefit of mankind rather than abusing it, he decided to let Strange inherit it once he mastered its powers, but advised him not to wear it in plain sight until then as it is the vessel of an Infinity Stone. As time passed, Wong came to see Strange as his best friend as he trusts him, although he sometimes doesn't have enough faith in him as a sorcerer.\n\nEven though Wong is evidently a very serious person, he is not completely without a sense of humor, as he laughed at Strange's remark about warnings coming after the spells upon the surviving Zealots’ transformations into Mindless Ones, which shocked Strange and Mordo. Wong does have a soft spot for younger children or teenager, as seen by his close relationship with America Chavez. Wong is also very loyal to his friends, as he incriminated himself in front of authorities to ensure that Emil Blonsky gained parole by admitting that he had aided in a prisoner escape. Upon Blonsky's return to prison, Wong once again broke the law to liberate Blonsky.",
