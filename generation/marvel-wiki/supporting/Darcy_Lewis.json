  "content": "Doctor Darcy Lewis is a former student of political science at Culver University who became an intern for Erik Selvig, and an assistant to Jane Foster. While working in New Mexico, Lewis came into contact with Asgardians when Thor arrived on Earth, only to be followed by the Warriors Three, Sif and the Destroyer. Lewis and Foster became focused on understanding the Bifrost Bridge and when Thor returned to Earth in 2013, Lewis assisted him in his war against Malekith and the Dark Elves. Returning to school, Lewis graduated with a doctorate in astrophysics.\n\nIn 2023, three weeks after the Blip, Lewis was recruited by S.W.O.R.D. to investigate a mysterious supernatural phenomenon occurring in the town of Westview, New Jersey. Lewis herself discovered that the town was actually trapped in an simulation reminiscent of past sitcoms, and that Wanda Maximoff was the culprit. During her mission, Lewis befriended Jimmy Woo, Monica Rambeau and Vision in her quest to dispel the Hex and was instrumental in the arrest of S.W.O.R.D. Director Tyler Hayward, who had violated the Sokovia Accords.\n\nTwo years later, Lewis supported Foster when she was undergoing chemotherapy for Stage IV cancer and urged her friend to continue the treatments rather than ignoring them to focus on scientific pursuits.\n\nDarcy Lewis became a political science student at Culver University. She went to work with Jane Foster and Erik Selvig as an intern for six college credits.[4] In June 2010, he group traveled to New Mexico, where a series of spatial anomalies that Foster believed to be precursors to a wormhole were taking place.[1]\n\nLewis was traveling in a van with Jane Foster and Erik Selvig, when the mysterious weather event subject of Foster's research unexpectedly turned into a powerful vortex before them. As they struggled with the zero-visibility conditions, the van collided with a man who had stumbled out of the dust into their path. The man, who only announced himself as Thor, began raving on about a hammer and the Bifrost, prompting Lewis to taser the supposedly delusional stranger. With the man knocked out, the group took him to the hospital.[1]\n\nThe following day, Lewis made a surprise discovery when she noticed the figure of a man in one of the photographic images captured from the atmospheric event. While Jane Foster realized that the newcomer might be able to shed some light on the event, Erik Selvig was more skeptical, sparking a lengthy disagreement that Lewis only rarely weighed in on to support the more fanciful elements of Foster's theories.\n\nLewis continued to tag along with the scientists, providing numerous observations about their rapidly changing situation that were helpful to them.[1]\n\nWhen they returned to the base, they discovered S.H.I.E.L.D. agents confiscating their equipment and research. Lewis watched as Erik Selvig tried to calm an angry Jane Foster down, due to knowing how serious the actual situation was. Phil Coulson told Foster they needed to take all of her possessions, and attempted to compensate her. Despite her pleas, all of Foster's belongings, including her research that was on the verge of an extraordinary discovery, were taken.\nS.H.I.E.L.D. then left the base, so they then sat on the roof of the building, commiserating the loss of their property, as Selvig informed them of who the people that they encountered were.[1]\n\nLater, four Asgardians appeared at the base, much to Lewis, Jane Foster, and Erik Selvig's shock and awe. They entered the base and introduced themselves as Sif and the Warriors Three, and Lewis watched as Thor conversed with them.\n\nWhen another vortex formed out in the desert, they all went outside to look at it, where Thor realized that the Destroyer had been sent down, causing him to warn Foster, Lewis, and Selvig to leave. However, they stayed to help and Lewis watched as Sif and the Warriors Three battled the Destroyer. When the Destroyer quickly overpowered them, Thor ordered to them run away before they were caught in the destruction. When Thor seemingly died, Lewis watched as Foster ran out to him, but she was pulled back by Selvig. They watched as Mjølnir was returned to Thor, which helped revive him, and allow him to defeat the Destroyer.\n\nLewis stayed at the site with Foster and Selvig and watched as Thor and the other Asgardians departed Earth. They watched as the Bifrost Bridge opened to begin producing dark lighting clouds, much to their concern. After some time, they then saw the Bifrost opening completely disappear before them, and decided to leave.[1]\n\nLewis tried to help Jane Foster find a way to bring Thor back to Earth. They built a device to open a wormhole, but it failed. Lewis told Foster to wait since Thor promised to return. However, one year passed and Lewis began to doubt that Thor would return at all. When Thor's brother Loki came to Earth, S.H.I.E.L.D. contacted Foster and sent her to Tromsø, Norway to an Astrophysics Lab.[5] Once arrived in Norway, nobody in the lab had any idea why she and Foster were sent there. Lewis hacked into the computer and found live footage of Thor in New York City, and she showed the video to Foster. Discovering from Erik Selvig that Thor had left Earth, Lewis comforted her friend, telling her that Thor would return again, but Foster disagreed and gave up.[6]\n\nIn November 2013, Lewis and Jane Foster were called to London by Erik Selvig, who had been there for several weeks researching a new series of anomalies. When they got there, they found Selvig missing and took up residence in his flat. During this time, Lewis hired Ian Boothby as her own intern. After several days without any word from Selvig, Lewis discovered that Selvig's scientific equipment was acting up, and brought this information to Foster, interrupting her date with a man named Richard Madison. The pair, accompanied by Boothby, followed the signals to an abandoned warehouse where the laws of physics were going haywire and various portals had opened up. While Lewis and Boothby were distracted by the events, Foster disappeared.[7]\n\nHaving not being able to locate Jane Foster for five hours, Lewis called the Metropolitan Police, only for Foster to appear as suddenly as she vanished. When the police were about to arrest the group for trespassing on private property, Thor suddenly appeared, having been alerted by Heimdall to Foster's disappearance. While Foster was speaking with Thor, Lewis confirmed that they were likely going to be arrested, as she warned Foster about this, before commenting that Thor was still muscly, and questioning how Asgard was, to which Thor confirmed that it was fine. When one of the officers tried to forcefully arrest Foster, her body reacted by unleashing a mysterious energy that forced everyone away from her. Before the police could react, Thor left with Foster via Bifrost Bridge, leaving a stupefied Lewis behind.[7]\n\nIn Foster's absence, Lewis was left with Boothby to try to locate Selvig and to make sense of the situation. After failing to page S.H.I.E.L.D. for assistance, Lewis saw a newscast of Selvig running around naked at Stonehenge, and together they traced him to a local mental institution. After bailing Selvig out and nearly being pummeled by birds affected by dimensional portals, Lewis, Boothby, and Selvig returned to Foster's apartment and studied Selvig's research over the strange anomalies, which were revealed to be echoes of the Convergence.[7]\n\nJane Foster and Thor eventually returned, having traveled to Asgard, then to Svartalfheim, where they discovered a portal that returned them safely to Earth. Foster revealed that Malekith sought to use the Aether to obliterate the Nine Realms through the Convergence.[7]\n\nTogether, the group confronted Malekith at Greenwich, where, while Thor fought him, Lewis and her friends dealt with his minions via teleportation devices created by Erik Selvig. Lewis and Ian Boothby were separated from the others and were nearly killed by a platoon of Dark Elf soldiers. Fortunately, a Frost Beast was teleported to their exact location and killed the Dark Elves, inadvertently saving the pair. However, they were teleported away accidentally by Foster, mostly to her indifference, where the bemused pair were attacked by two Dark Elves. Lewis fell on the ground but Boothby saved Lewis from their assailants by picking up a floating car and slamming it onto the elves, fatally crushing them. After acknowledging he had saved her life, Lewis passionately embraced him in a kiss, which Foster and Selvig witnessed when they used the teleporter. Lewis awkwardly dropped Boothby just as Mjølnir sailed past them intent on reaching its owner. Lewis and Boothby arrived to see Foster and Thor nearly been crushed by the dark elves ship. Fortunately, Selvig used the device to teleport it elsewhere where it crushed Malekith to death. Relieved her friends were alright, an overjoyed Lewis kissed Boothby more passionately.[7]\n\nAfterwards, Lewis returned to Foster's apartment with Boothby, Foster, and Selvig. A few days later, Lewis witnessed Thor returning in the Bifrost Bridge to stay on Earth with Foster.[7]\n\nSometime later, Lewis completed her university studies and gained a doctorate.[8] In 2018, she survived the Snap; however, she lost both Jane Foster and Erik Selvig to it.[3]\n\nIn November 2023, a few weeks after the Blip, Lewis was called by S.W.O.R.D. to help them find out what was happening in Westview, New Jersey. Lewis rode in a van with several other scientists and inquired about what they all specialized in. Upon arriving at the S.W.O.R.D. Response Base, Lewis was greeted by a S.W.O.R.D agent who took her to her workstation.[8]\n\nUpon monitoring the levels of radiation coming from Westview, Lewis picked up high levels of CMBR and saw that there were longer waves imposed amongst it. Afterwards, she pulled out a device and tuned it which revealed the WandaVision show. Jimmy Woo, Tyler Hayward, and a few of his agents came over and saw the show also.[8]\n\nOnce Lewis had discovered the broadcast, she and Jimmy Woo worked together in attempt to identify all the victims of the Westview Anomaly. One by one they identified most victims in order of appearance on the show. During it Lewis spotted Monica Rambeau and she asked Woo if he thought Rambeau was okay. They discussed what was going on and Lewis wished to experiment to see if they could reach inside Westview.\n\nLewis planned when Wanda Maximoff was washing the dishes Woo would try and contact Maximoff by radio. During the test it looked as though it was working only for the broadcast to buffer. Lewis told Woo that the attempt failed and that he needed to head back to her. Woo and Lewis watched the broadcast in which Rambeau had a larger role. When Rambeau mentioned Ultron killing Quicksilver, Lewis asked Woo if their reality had ever been mentioned. The broadcast buffered again, and the alarms went off. Lewis and Woo rushed out of the base to find out what had happened when they saw Rambeau being thrown out of Westview.[8]\n\nSometime later, Lewis alongside Jimmy Woo visited Monica Rambeau, catching her up on what she had missed. Lewis gave Rambeau some clothes to wear and told her about an upcoming briefing with Tyler Hayward. In said briefing, Lewis watched as Hayward displayed a video of Wanda Maximoff stealing Vision's corpse from the S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters, as Lewis commented on how it was all very confusing.\n\nLater, Rambeau said that she wanted to go back into Westview, but Lewis pointed out the Hex could wipe her mind again. Rambeau explained to Lewis that everything in the Hex was real, to which Lewis replied stating that Maximoff must have a lot of power. They then discussed the Battle of Earth, and how Maximoff could have killed Thanos. Woo said he could argue that Captain Marvel came close as well, prompting Lewis to note that her powers came from the Space Stone; however, Rambeau wanted to change the subject back to Maximoff. During the discussion, Rambeau had an idea and they went to where Rambeau's clothing was being stored. Rambeau shot at the clothing in which they discovered the clothing was her Bulletproof Vest. The discovery led them to the conclusion that everything in Westview was rewritten, which led Rambeau into the idea that if they sent something from the time period in it would not need to be changed.\n\nSometime later, Lewis and Woo rushed out of the base after the alarms had gone off. Wanda Maximoff had left Westview to confront S.W.O.R.D. and Lewis watched her interaction with them.[9]\n\nFollowing Wanda Maximoff's confrontation with S.W.O.R.D., Lewis was angry with Tyler Hayward, and how he had acted, as Lewis remarked about how he was nearly murdered by his own men. As Hayward questioned if Lewis worked for him, Lewis confessed that she was not actually sure about the chain of current command. Once their conversation had ended, Lewis, alongside Jimmy Woo and Monica Rambeau, were ordered to leave the Response Base. While they were being transported out of the base, Woo and Rambeau fought back and disarmed the S.W.O.R.D. agents, as Lewis remarked on how no one had told her the plan. She and the other two then changed into S.W.O.R.D uniforms and headed back inside of the base.[10]\n\nNot long after they broke back into the base, Lewis hacked into the S.W.O.R.D. database and looked through Tyler Hayward's files. In this, Lewis found a section on Monica Rambeau and discovered that Rambeau's cells had been rewritten. Lewis looked through the files and found a project code named 'Cataract'. She saw that Hayward had a full map of Westview and a headcount of its residence, before Lewis noticed that Vision was being tracked by Hayward. Once Rambeau and Jimmy Woo agreed that they needed to leave, Lewis stayed behind to break through the final fire wall.[10]\n\nShortly, Lewis heard alarms go off and she headed out to find out what had happened. She saw Vision pleading for help after escaping the Hex. Lewis screamed at the S.W.O.R.D. agents to help him but was promptly reprimanded by Monti and handcuffed to a Humvee, under the orders of Tyler Hayward. Lewis watched as Vision was torn apart bit by bit. When the Hex was expanded, Lewis was abandoned by the agents and became consumed into the Hex.[10]\n\nThe next day, Lewis awakened in the Hex under the influence of Wanda Maximoff. She was shackled to a circus truck as the escape artist for the circus. Vision headed over to Lewis and asked her about the night before, in which Lewis remarked she had no clue who he was. Lewis released herself and walked away from Vision, who proceeded to follow, trying to remind of her investigation of the Maximoff Anomaly but she only responded she won't go out with him, until finally agreeing. An exasperated Vision distracted her and released her from the mind control.\n\nAs she regained her bearings, Lewis remarked that part of her secretly wanted a guest spot on the show only to feel disappointed by the role she was given. Monti rushed over to Lewis and commanded her alongside Vision to get on stage, but when she refused, he grabbed her arm. In return, Lewis punched him in the face. As they climbed into a food van, Lewis responded to Vision's inquiries, admitting she didn't know the status of his children nor the identity of the impostor \"Pietro\".\n\nAs they drove back to Westview, Lewis filled Vision in on the events of the past few years. She told him of the Infinity War and how Maximoff had to kill him, but that sacrifice was rendered meaningless when Thanos used the Time Stone to reverse time and killed him again. They soon pulled to stop at a red light but as they tried to proceed, with Lewis noting it never rained in Westview, suddenly a work crew pulled up, blocking their way.\n\nWhile waiting for the crew to finish, Vision asked what he was now if not J.A.R.V.I.S. or Ultron's creation. Lewis could only speculate that Maximoff simply flipped a switch and brought him back to life, but she was clueless as to why Vision was unable to leave the Hex. Nonetheless, she assured him that the love between him and Maximoff was very real from watching WandaVision for the past week. Lewis' relief as the crew cleared out quickly evaporated as a crossing of school children continued to block the road; she rhetorically asked if puppies were the next impediment. Vision then left by phasing out of the truck and flying off to go meet Maximoff. Lewis said she would meet him there and continued to drive.[2]\n\nBy the time Lewis arrived into Westview's town square, she rammed the food van into Tyler Hayward's Humvee, disabling it. After the Hex was gone, Lewis left before she could be questioned by the FBI and Eastview police, telling Monica Rambeau that \"Debriefs are for the weak\".[11]\n\nBy 2024, Lewis was informed by Jane Foster that she had been diagnosed with cancer that had advanced to stage IV. Lewis accompanied Foster as much as possible to her chemotherapy appointments at the Puente Antiguo County Hospital. In 2025, Lewis told Foster not to try and fight the cancer alone because she had people who could help her. She then suggested she go to New Asgard to seek Thor’s help regarding it.[12]\n\nDarcy Lewis is shown to be very impulsive, evidenced when she tasered Thor upon their first meeting. Despite not being a scientist like her friends, Lewis is the first to notice the \"anomaly\" that made Jane Foster realizes that Thor was present in the Bifrost Bridge. When investigating the Westview Anomaly, Lewis was able to understand why Wanda Maximoff was controlling the town and its residents, as she had lost Vision during the Battle of Wakanda before the Snap. When watching the sitcoms of WandaVision, Lewis was very intelligent when picking up their signals and hacked into Tyler Hayward's profiles to find out what his motives where. Lewis is also shown to believe in true love where she comforted Vision by telling him that the love between him and Wanda was real, due to having watched the sitcoms for several days.",
