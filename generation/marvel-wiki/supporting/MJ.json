  "content": "Michelle Jones-Watson, commonly referred to as MJ, is a former student at Midtown School of Science and Technology, and soon-to-be student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who greatly enjoyed mocking all of her classmates, which included Peter Parker. Despite keeping her distance socially, Jones was eventually given the opportunity to take over from the departing Liz Allan as captain of the Academic Decathlon Team, and began to open up more with her fellow teammates, which included Ned Leeds and Parker.\n\nJones was a victim of the Snap in 2018, but along with all other victims, was resurrected in the Blip five years later. Her affections were sought out by Parker and Brad Davis during Midtown Tech's trip to Europe. When she deduced Parker's identity as Spider-Man, Jones helped discover Mysterio's fraudulence, by exposing him as the one who staged the Elemental crisis. Shortly after their trip to Europe, Jones and Parker began dating. After their first date, Jones was horrified when The Daily Bugle showed a modified video of Mysterio and Spider-Man, claiming that Parker was responsible for the casualties of the Battle of London.\n\nWith Parker's identity exposed, he and Jones tried to return to their normal lives, but this was thrown into jeopardy when Parker sought Doctor Strange's help to make the world forget his identity as Spider-Man. This resulted in a spell going wrong, and visitors from other universes being sent to Jones'; she and Leeds worked with Parker to track down and capture the rogue visitors, but then went against Doctor Strange in order to try and redeem them instead of sending them to their deaths. Ultimately, the majority of the visitors would betray Jones and her friends, who then encountered other versions of Parker from alternate universes. Jones and her allies successfully sent the visitors back to their home universes, but instabilities in spacetime caused by Doctor Strange's spell tragically meant that she had to forget her entire history with Parker. The two shared a kiss before Jones' memories were erased, and she resumed her life with a new acceptance into MIT.\n\nMichelle Jones-Watson was born on June 10, 2001 in New York City.[2] Jones had a difficult home life and she and her mother had not heard from her father in years by the time she had concluded her junior year in high school. Jones developed a sarcastic, guarded demeanor as she grew, preferring to read her books and often had difficulty when trying to establish friendships.[8] However, her father eventually returned to her life. Jones also came to dislike being called by her last name, \"Watson.\"[1]\n\nJones became a student at Midtown School of Science and Technology and a member of the Academic Decathlon team. At lunch, Jones was reading a sizable collection of novels while drinking tea. She called her classmates, Peter Parker and Ned Leeds, \"losers\" for staring at Liz Allan for too long. When Leeds then wondered why she always sat at their table, Jones simply replied that she didn't have any friends, and returned to reading her book.[9]\n\nAt Academic Decathlon practice, Jones continued reading while the team studied for Nationals, with Liz Allan quizzing them. When Peter Parker revealed he was dropping out of the team to focus on his internship with Tony Stark, Jones pointed out that he had already quit robotics lab and marching band. When her teammates were surprised at her knowledge of Parker's activities, Jones quickly denied paying any special attention to him, insisting that she was just very observant.[9] After practice, Jones watched as the Decathlon team failed to convince Parker to come with them to Nationals.[10] Jones also read Of Human Bondage throughout the entirety of gym class, even while she was supposed to be doing curl-ups.[9]\n\nJones attended a house party held by Liz Allan, the captain the Academic Decathlon team. When Peter Parker and Ned Leeds arrived, she called them losers for attending while preparing a meal for herself. When Leeds pointed out that she was attending the party as well, Jones just gave them a quirky look and asked, \"Am I?\" before walking off.[9]\n\nJones joined the Academic Decathlon team for the field trip to Washington, D.C. to participate in Nationals. She questioned Mr. Roger Harrington on the timetable for the trip because she wanted to get in some light protesting while in the nation's capitol.[9]\n\nOn the way to Washington, Jones approached Peter Parker and Ned Leeds as they noticed increased activity around the damaged Triskelion structure. She explained that the United States Department of Damage Control was still cleaning up the mess after Captain America caused the Helicarriers to crash for seemingly no reason. While Leeds stated that Captain America did so to save them, Jones rebuffed him and declared that was just what the government wanted the public to think.[10]\n\nMuch to the team's annoyance, Parker did not attend the Decathlon and Jones had to replace him. However, she managed to answer the last question correctly and the Midtown School of Science and Technology team won the Decathlon. The team was ecstatic and embraced Jones, much to her delight.\n\nFollowing the competition, Harrington took them to the Washington Monument. Jones refused to go up to the top, not wanting to visit a building that had been built by slaves. While she waited at the bottom, an explosion at the top trapped her teammates in the Monument's elevator. When Spider-Man arrived, Jones frantically informed him that her friends were in the elevator.[9]\n\nJones sat next to Peter Parker when he was issued a detention for attempting to skip class. After Parker left, Andre Wilson asked Jones why she was there, as she did not have detention. Jones answered that she enjoyed sketching people in crisis, teasingly showed Wilson a drawing she'd made of him.[9]\n\nFollowing the revelation that Liz Allan's father was Vulture, she was forced to move to Oregon with her mother. In the wake of her leaving, Jones was made captain of the Decathlon team. She told her teammates that her friends called her \"MJ\". When Peter Parker received a message and had to leave, Jones looked at him with suspicion and asked what he was up to. She then laughed, claiming that she was just kidding and did not care. When Parker left however, Jones stared after him.[9]\n\nShortly after, Jones was interviewed by Betty Brant, an anchor of Midtown News, as to who she thought Spider-Man might truly be. Jones replied with one statement: although she was not sure, she had her suspicions.[10] Secretly, Jones was suspecting Parker to be the wall crawler.[6]\n\nIn 2018, Jones was a victim of the Snap. Five years later, Jones was restored to life in the Blip.[11][12]\n\nJones and her fellow restored classmates had to retake their junior year from 2023-2024. In that time, the world steadily returned to normal, and Jones improved her overall social skills and relationships with the also-restored Ned Leeds and Peter Parker. However, Jones also grew more suspicious that Parker was living a double life as Spider-Man, which she'd considered since the Washington Monument rescue. Still insecure about the feelings for him she developed sometime before, she told herself that she only paid attention to him to see if this theory was correct. Along with Parker, Leeds, and other classmates, Jones planned on attending a school sponsored trip during summer break to Europe to visit various museums and sites of interest.[6]\n\nBefore the plane ride, Jones defended Peter Parker from his rival Flash Thompson by telling the airline stewardess that since Thompson had been one of the Snap's casualties, he was sixteen, not twenty-one. Parker himself had planned to tell Jones how he felt about her during the trip, but grew envious when his attempt to sit next to her on the flight resulted in her instead seated next to Brad Davis, a Snap survivor who, according to Leeds, was the most charming student in the school. During the flight, Jones and Davis watched some in-flight movies together, while an upset Parker watched on from his seat next to one of the chaperones, Roger Harrington.[6]\n\nAfter the plane landed in Venice, Jones and her classmates explored the city together, posing for some pictures with some Venetian pigeons in front of Saint Mark's Basilica for Brad Davis. She also took a liking to an Italian slang word, \"Boh,\" that could be defined as \"Nothing,\" \"I don't know,\" or \"Leave me alone.\" As she chatted with Peter Parker as they explored the city, she noticed a small package he had bought and asked him what it was. She smiled appreciatively when he answered \"Boh.\"\n\nHarrington realized too late that he had forgotten to book the museum for the students to tour, and the students were permitted to do some more exploring. At the docks of the Grand Canal, Jones noticed that the waterway's crabs seemed to be hurrying out of the water. Seconds later, Hydro-Man emerged from the canal. Jones rushed away and reunited with her classmates and chaperones, but noticed that Parker was no longer with the group.\n\nJones and her class went to spend the night at the Hotel DeMatteis, where they watched a news broadcast about Hydro-Man's attack and the strange new superhuman who defeated it. She doubted a story Ned Leeds found online, that claimed a man named Morris Bench had recently been infused with water-related powers and translated the broadcast's description to her classmates as \"l'uomo di misterio,\" Italian for \"the man of mystery.\"\nFrom this, Ned Leeds and Betty Brant took to calling the new hero \"Mysterio.\" When Flash Thompson dismissed their rescuer as an inferior hero to Spider-Man, Jones questioned him why he idolizes Spider-Man so much. Thompson admitted that he saw Spider-Man as a personal role model, while also insulting Parker, who had caught up with the group. Parker and Jones shared a quiet moment together, in which he told her that he was looking forward to their arrival in Paris, specifically to see the Eiffel Tower. Jones noted that she was also looking forward to it, as the Eiffel Tower was a personal favorite landmark due to the conspiracy theory that it was built as a mind-control device.[6]\n\nThe following morning, Roger Harrington and Julius Dell abruptly announced that they had spoken with the travel company and upgraded the group tour; Paris had been canceled and the students would instead be traveling to Prague in the Czech Republic. Unknown to the chaperones and students, the \"travel representative\" Harrington and Dell had spoken to work for Nick Fury and had redirected the group to Prague because they wanted Spider-Man's help in defeating an Elemental, projected to appear there soon.\n\nAfter a quick stop in Austria, Brad Davis tried to show Jones a photo he had taken but was interrupted by a series of odd interjections by an unusually worried Parker. While her classmates were distracted by some baby mountain goats that Parker claimed to have spotted, Jones watched through the seats, and Parker apparently leaped through the bus' overhead window. By the time the odd episode had calmed down, the photo had vanished from Davis' phone, and the class made their way to their new hotel, where Jones continued to observe Parker while Harrington told the class that they would soon be attending a regional festival. Jones became suspicious of Parker realising that he might be hiding a big secret.\n\nHowever, that was also subject to an abrupt change, when Dell and Harrington announced that the travel agency had given the entire class free tickets to a four-hour opera, much to the class' collective frustration. In the near-empty opera house, Parker and Jones again made small talk. After playfully teasing Parker about a perceived gendered double standard in a compliment he paid her, Jones asked Parker if he would like to sit with her. He sent a mixed message that he would like to, but would not be able to for whatever reason.\n\nCurious about Parker's abrupt leaving, she followed him out of the opera house. As she wandered the streets of Prague looking for him, she suddenly came face-to-face with the Elemental illusion itself, known as Molten Man. She fled as Mysterio and an apparently new hero fought the creature, but in the process, she discovered an especially odd piece of debris - a small black camera covered in Spider-Man's webs. Horrified that their kids had been at ground zero for two different Elemental attacks, the students' families called for the trip to be canceled. The itinerary changed once again for a flight back to the United States the following morning. As this would be their last night in Europe, Parker asked Jones out on a walk through the city.\n\nOn the \"date\", Parker tried to confess his feelings for her, but she interrupted him, presuming he was about to reveal his secret identity to her. Parker was flummoxed but admitted she was correct when she revealed the webbed-up camera. While she'd speculated about this for some time, the confirmation still came as a shock, and the social quagmire of the situation led her to indicate that her interest in him was purely to see if her theory was true, avoiding in admitting that having a crush on Parker was a partial reason in her watching him. This devastated Parker, but before they could continue to discuss this, they accidentally activated the projector, and the Elemental known as Cyclone emerged. Parker and Jones deduced that it was actually an elaborate hologram and that Parker's new mentor and friend Quentin Beck, otherwise known as Mysterio, had deceived him, and was the true mastermind behind the Elemental Attacks.\n\nParker and Jones raced back to the hotel, where Parker changed into his Stealth Suit as he and Jones explained the situation to Ned Leeds. Parker headed to Berlin, Germany to warn Nick Fury about Beck's true nature, while Jones and Leeds told the teachers, class, and Parker's aunt that he would be staying with \"family\" there. Though Jones was uncomfortable with the elaborate lie, she stood by her friend and handed him the tell-tale and only piece of evidence against Beck; Cyclone's hologram projector.[6]\n\nUnknown to Jones, Spider-Man was defeated in Germany and Mysterio redirected the class trip for the third time. Jones and the rest of the students flew to London, England the next morning with the intent of taking an afternoon flight back to the United States; Beck planned to stage his fifth and final attack in the city and use the ensuing chaos as a cover to kill Jones and anyone else aware of the truth about him.\n\nAfter their arrival, Brad Davis interjected. In a bid to make himself look like a better romantic option for Jones than Parker, he again brought up the photo he had taken in Austria, in which he claimed that he had seen Parker in the bathroom with an older European woman. However, Jones and the rest of the class found it strange that Davis would take a picture of Parker in the bathroom and doubted his story. This effectively ended Davis' pursuit of Jones for the rest of the trip.\n\nThe fifth and final elemental attack began soon after, in which all the previous monsters fused into the Elemental Fusion, and wreaked havoc on the city. Knowing that Mysterio discovered Jones and Ned Leeds knew the truth, they ran to lead the villain away from their classmates, where they were joined by Flash Thompson and Betty Brant. The four teenagers met Happy Hogan, who introduced himself as an ally of Spider-Man and was here to protect them while Spider-Man took on the false hero.\n\nAfter Hogan's jet was destroyed, the five hid in the Tower of London's Museum. However, they were tracked by some of Mysterio's E.D.I.T.H. drones. The group did what they could to fight back, with Jones even grabbing a mace from one of the museum's display cases, and using it to smash one of the machines. However, they were overwhelmed and backed into a corner, with only the Museum's vault door between the drones and them. Fearing that she was about to die, Jones confessed that she regretted her brutal honesty and poor social skills, which isolated her from any potential friends.\n\nElsewhere in the city, Spider-Man thankfully defeated Mysterio and used the E.D.I.T.H. glasses to recall all of the drones. Once the drones returned to space, Hogan handed Jones the contents of the small package Parker had in Venice - a necklace with a small glass pendant in the shape of her favorite flower; the black dahlia. With the necklace in her pocket and the mace still in hand, Jones went back into the city, where she found an injured Parker on the Tower Bridge. They hugged each other and Jones showed Parker the necklace which had now become damaged, while he was dismayed that his gift for her was broken, she quickly kissed him, confessing to Parker timidly that she had misled him in Prague; she genuinely was interested in him for reasons that were actually not related to his double life, indicating to Parker she had a crush on him as well, much to his relief. Parker apologized again that the necklace was broken, but Jones told him she didn't mind and said she liked it better this way. Jones and Parker tried their kiss again, marking the start of their relationship. After their embrace, Jones picked up the mace again and told Parker she should head back to the class, as she walked away she looked back to Parker, as he left the bridge too.[6]\n\nAfter awkwardly returning the mace to the museum and boarding the flight with her class, Jones and Peter Parker arrived back to the Newark airport, now as a couple, holding hands. On one of their first dates back in New York City, Parker decided to take Jones for a swing around Manhattan with his web-slinging. Once she decided to get up on Spider-Man, Jones was overwhelmed by the speed of Spider-Man's web-swinging, and what was intended to be a fun adrenaline rush, instead became a harrowing experience. Once she was back on the ground at the Madison Square Garden, Jones plainly told Parker that she never wanted to do anything like that again.\n\nTheir date took an unexpected turn when they noticed a NY1 newscast on the Madison Square Garden MegaVision, reporting on a video published by The Daily Bugle. Speechless, Jones watched in shock as J. Jonah Jameson played edited footage of the Battle of London; a dying message from Mysterio claimed that Spider-Man was responsible for the attacks and had murdered Mysterio. To make matters worse, Mysterio concluded the message by revealing Spider-Man's identity and real name.[6]\n\nImmediately, people who were next to Jones asked her if she was Spider-Man's girlfriend. Parker leaped down from the light post and rushed to Jones. As he did, the crowd increased and people began to push him, causing him to stumble into Jones. Jones grabbed onto him and Parker pushed his way out of the mass crowd to swing away.\n\nJones held onto Parker as they swung through Times Square. Jones, who was scared and upset about swinging again, put her hands over Parker's face, accidentally causing him to not see. He told her and she apologized. She then asked where they were going and he suggested her house, but she said her father would be upset to see him, now that his identity had been exposed.\n\nInstead, Parker and Jones landed on Queensboro Bridge. As Jones tried to remain calm and keep her balance, Parker answered a face-time call from Ned Leeds. However, as Jones became fearful of the heights, she called out to Parker, cutting his call short as he tended to her. Parker then told her to hang on and leaped down off the bridge into a subway station below.\n\nAs he swung through the station, they narrowly missed colliding into a train, much to Jones' horror. Parker took them into the sewer tunnel and helped Jones up through a sewer hole in the street in front of Delmar's Deli-Grocery. Parker then swung Jones to his apartment and opened his bedroom window to sneak inside.\n\nIn doing so, they made noise, which caused Happy Hogan to open the bedroom door to find Parker undressed and Jones looking embarrassed. May Parker then rushed inside, only to close the door, and reopen it to introduce herself to Jones, who greeted her. As Parker got dressed, Jones followed him out of his room. A neighbor popped his head inside through the open front door and asked if it was true that Parker was Spider-Man, but Jones told him now wasn't a good time and closed the door.\n\nShe then joined them in the living room and as Parker demanded an explanation for May and Hogan's relationship, Jones alerted Parker to the television which had NY1 on breaking the news of his identity. When May asked if the building on television was theirs, Parker opened a blind to reveal that the WLGJ helicopters had stationed outside. Following this, Jones left Parker's apartment and returned to her home.[1]\n\nDays later, Jones, along with May and Leeds, were taken by the Department of Damage Control to an NYPD precinct. As they were being escorted in, they passed Parker, and so Jones and May both told him to not answer any questions without a lawyer. Jones was brought into the interrogation room first and was interrogated by Agent P. Cleary. She told him that she was highly aware of his tactics and knew her rights, what she could say, opting to wait for a lawyer, as she knew very well how Cleary could easily manipulate her statements otherwise.\n\nCleary tried to get the statement of Jones, asking her why she would get involved romantically with a vigilante like Parker to risk her future, but failed as the strong willed Jones told him nothing.[1]\n\nThe night before their senior year started, Parker video-called Jones, where they both discussed about their applications to their preferred institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While Parker was hopeful that they could get into the institute, Jones wasn't sure about it saying that they would have to earn scholarships so that they could get in, but Parker tried to make her feel better by saying that she has all the scores, all the grades, and basically everything needed to get into M.I.T, making Jones wonder whether or not he thought she was pragmatic.\n\nMuch to her happiness, Parker said while she was indeed pragmatic, that was one of the best things about her, making her wonder what his other favorite things were, which led to the duo joking around about her \"relentless optimism,\" how she loved people, and Jones' \"love for sports.\" After hearing a unique noise for a while, Jones discovered that the noise came from Happy Hogan, who decided to sleep with his CPAP machine and the one who moved into the living room of his condominium.\n\nAfter some reluctance, Jones asked Parker whether he was ever relieved about not having to lie to anyone anymore about his dual life, feeling as though it made thing less complicated. Parker replied to Jones that ever since he got bitten by that radioactive spider, that he only had one week where he felt normal was when she and everyone whom he wanted to know about knew he was Spider-Man which was his aunt, her, and Ned. Parker continued that everyone finding out his true identity ruined that for him, joking around how despite he was currently the most famous person in the entire world, he is still broke.\n\nThen, Jones told him that she was excited to see him tomorrow, with Parker replying he felt the same. However, their special moments were ruined by Hogan who told them to wrap it up as he was trying to sleep, telling them he needed his eight hours of sleep, much to Jones and Parker's mutual shock as they learned he had been listening the whole time. As Parker was getting scolded by Hogan, Jones greeted Hogan, before the duo ended the call, to meet each other for their next day for senior year.[1]\n\nThe next day, Jones returned to Midtown School of Science and Technology. She met up with Peter Parker and Ned Leeds outside and walked together towards the building, and they were joined by Flash Thompson. As they approached the building, crowds of pro-Mysterio supporters and pro-Spider-Man supporters were gathered on each side of the sidewalk, with NYPD officers doing crowd control. One protestor was in support of Jones and called out to her. When they made it to the entrance, an officer separated her and Leeds from Parker and they were escorted in afterwards.[1]\n\nAt the end of the school day, Jones met with Parker on the school's rooftop and read a local newspaper detailing propaganda about Parker and his friends. As they enjoyed the time alone, they were soon joined by Leeds, who discussed Massachusetts Institute of Technology with them and the proposal of them living together in Boston. Jones agreed with them that they deserved a new start.[1]\n\nJones, needing some income, applied to and started working at Peter Pan Donut & Pastry Shop. When she, Ned Leeds, and Peter Parker had received their letters in the mail from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, they met at the shop and opened the letters together. However, their excitement left them as they saw they had been rejected due to the recent controversy surrounding Parker. They were met by Flash Thompson, who walked in excitedly informing them he had been accepted and then asked why they were rejected. Jones ripped up her letter and was called back into work, while Leeds and Parker left.[1]\n\nLater that day, Jones and Ned Leeds were found by Doctor Strange and brought to the New York Sanctum where they met with Peter Parker. Strange told them that Parker had tampered with a spell causing universe-displaced people, within the Multiverse, who were aware of his identity to arrive in their universe. Parker apologized but Jones told him not to and was then told by Strange, who was impatient with them, to get started on fixing the problem.\n\nHe sent them to work in the Sanctum's undercroft, in which only Leeds seemed excited about. Jones told Parker that next time he would decide to act on something huge to include them for insight.\n\nShe, Parker, and Leeds then began to work on Leeds' laptop, until they were interrupted by Doctor Octopus, a universe-displaced man with cyborg legs, who was inside the holding cell. They laughed at his name, which infuriated him, but he still went on to tell them that they were chasing ghosts as Norman Osborn had died in his universe. Shortly, Leeds tracked down a flying anomaly noted outside the city by a military institution and Jones worked with him while Parker left to investigate.\n\nJones and Leeds remained in touch with Parker via video call and tried to help him using Leeds' laptop, but once Parker came across Electro, they lost communication due to Electro's electricity powers. However, soon, Electro and Sandman appeared in holding cells in the undercroft, as well as a tree that had accidentally been brought with them. Jones then received a phone call from Parker, who told her that he was going to stay behind to fix the power lines. Jones and Leeds stayed the night at the undercroft.\n\nThe next day, Parker returned bringing Norman Osborn with him. Strange then appeared and prepared to conjure the spell, but Parker stopped him and stole the Macchina di Kadavus. Moments later, he returned through an Inter-Dimensional Portal and explained he had been inside a mirror place. He then tasked Jones with keeping the Macchina safe and told her to press the button if need be. Parker then gave Leeds Strange's Sling Ring, and Jones and Leeds left the Sanctum.[1]\n\nLater, Jones went to Leeds' house and waited for the message of Parker. They turned the television on and saw news reports about the destruction at a condominium, both knowing that Parker had been there and worried for his safety. Jones told Leeds she was going to push the button on the Macchina to activate it, but just before she did it, Leeds waved his arms in the air, stating he wanted to see Parker and have his opinion on the matter.\n\nMuch to their shock, a spark of magic flickered in the air before them and Jones asked Leeds to repeat what he just did. Upon her instructions, Leeds conjured an Inter-Dimensional Portal using the Sling Ring. To their excitement, they saw what appeared to be Spider-Man walking around in an alleyway. They called out to him and when he jumped through, they saw that he was another Spider-Man who was Peter Parker.\n\nStartled and confused by this, Leeds and Jones asked who he was. Leeds started to bring up the spell, and Jones stopped him from saying too much, before the Amazing Spider-Man deduced that his studies on multidimensional travel was real. Feeling suspicious, Jones threw bread at Amazing Spider-Man who replied that his Spider-Sense would not work when something harmless like bread would attack him, calling Jones a mistrusting person. Nevertheless, Amazing Spider-Man proved himself to be one as he climbed around the walls of Leeds' house to clean up the cobwebs.\n\nJones told Leeds to try again and this time, another Spider-Man walked through. When Leeds had asked if he was another Spider-Man and why he did not tell them that, in which he replied he kept his identity anonymous. After the two Spider-Men used their webbing on each other, they told Jones and Leeds where they went when they needed alone time, thinking that that was what Parker was doing after the attack he had faced. Through their words, Jones then figured out where Parker was most likely.[1]\n\nJones and Leeds took the alternate Spider-Men to Midtown School of Science and Technology and went to the rooftop where they found Parker, crying and alone. They realized his aunt had died and comforted him, by hugging him. Jones then introduced him to his alternate counterparts, who jumped down to meet him. Jones listened as Parker interacted with them, eventually agreeing to help the universe-displaced as planned.\n\nJones and Leeds went with Parker and his counterparts into one of Midtown's laboratory rooms and watched as they concocted cures for the universe-displaced. When Jones noticed that Parker was anxious, she comforted him and told him that they were in this together. When the cures had been made, Jones joined the group at a table and listened as they made the plan. She then witnessed when the older Parker produced organic webbing, much to their shock.[1]\n\nJones and Leeds were tasked with staying at Midtown's chemistry classroom to wait for Parker to hand them the Macchina di Kadavus. Leeds used the Sling Ring to conjure an Inter-Dimensional Portal to the Statue of Liberty and Parker handed Jones the Macchina.\n\nHowever, Leeds was unable to close the portal, much to Jones' concern. She tried to give him advice, telling him to keep trying and asked why he could not close it. Leeds made several attempts; much was not successful. Their voices carried throughout the Statue, making Lizard aware of them.\n\nLizard then leaped up onto the scaffolding and ran at them, wanting the Macchina. Jones and Leeds then ran away into the laboratory, with Lizard in pursuit, destroying the laboratory in the process. Parker caught up to Lizard in an effort to stop him, but Lizard got away from him and continued to chase Jones and Leeds through another portal. As they ran on the Statue's scaffolding, Leeds opened another portal, sending water rushing through into Lizard.\n\nJones found the cure and tossed it to Parker who was then able to give Lizard the cure and he reverted back to Curt Connors. Leeds then opened another portal and Doctor Strange walked through surprising them. Jones then gave the Macchina to Strange while Strange took back his Sling Ring. Jones and Leeds went to another level of scaffolding to wait while Electro and Sandman were cured.\n\nShortly, Jones and Leeds then witnessed Green Goblin's arrival. When the Goblin seized the Macchina, he planted a pumpkin bomb inside it. When Strange reclaimed it, the bomb detonated and released the unstable spell, causing a multiversal tremor. The Statue's scaffolding fell and Jones and Leeds both lost their balance and fell. Jones was almost saved by Parker, but he was stopped by Goblin, who took him away on his glider.\n\nJones watched in horror as she continued to fall but was rescued by Amazing Spider-Man. When he brought her safely to the ground, he asked if she was okay, and when she saw him become emotional, she asked him the same. Jones then met with Leeds and hugged him.\n\nParker called out to them to make sure they were okay in which they nodded at him. They then watched in horror as he confronted the Goblin on the fallen statue of Captain America's Shield, nearly killing him. They watched as Parker was stopped by his older counterpart and gave the Goblin the cure.[1]\n\nAfterwards, Jones reunited with Parker and was devastated to learn that the only way to stop the infinite amount of people in the Multiverse from arriving was for Strange to finish the spell that would cause everyone in there universe forget that Parker ever existed. She tried to protest, but he said it was the only way and he came by to share one more moment with her and Leeds.\n\nThe three shared an emotional embrace one last time and Jones told Parker she loved him; right before Parker could say the same, she told him to save it for her once they reunited again. Parker shared one more look with Jones before he swung away; Jones tearfully watched him leave before the spell took effect, erasing Parker from her memories.[1]\n\nJones continued working at Peter Pan Donut & Pastry Shop and was accepted at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with Ned Leeds.\n\nWeeks later, a young man came inside the shop. Jones smiled and waved at Leeds, who entered behind the young man. After she greeted Leeds, she asked the young man what he would like at the counter. He introduced himself suddenly as Peter Parker and after a pause, ordered a coffee, albeit awkwardly.\n\nBefore making the coffee, Jones gave Leeds a doughnut as a congratulations on getting accepted to MIT and expressed excitement over it, with Leeds teasing Jones about her school spirit, to which she said if he told anyone she would simply deny it.\n\nJones proceeded on making the coffee and called Parker's name, which she had to repeat two times to get his attention. After giving Parker the coffee, he asked Jones if she was excited for MIT, with her replying she was, which she admitted was weird for her because she is not usually excited for things because if she always expects disappointment, she will never be disappointed, with Parker finishing her sentence, leaving her a little stunned.\n\nAs Jones and Parker exchanged a smile at each other, Parker grabbed his coffee but noticed Jones' band-aid on her forehead and asked if she was okay, gesturing to his own forehead. Jones shrugged it off, remembering the recent event, and said that it didn't really hurt anymore. Jones then asked Parker if there was anything else she could help him with, as he replied \"no\" with a bittersweet smile and was on the edge of becoming emotional. Parker thanked Jones for the coffee and walked out, but as he did, Jones watched after him, as she contemplated if he seemed familiar to her.[1]\n\nIn the following June, Jones was among the students who graduated from Midtown School of Science and Technology as the class of 2025.[13]\n\nMichelle Jones considers herself to be a very observant person in general, noticing things others may not, and usually keeps a close eye on Peter Parker. She was aware of his academic situation, keeping tabs on which classes he'd neglected or which clubs he quit. During the Rescue at the Washington Monument, she observed Spider-Man as the hero climbed up the Washington Monument, after notifying him that her friends were up there. Although she publicly deems Parker to be a loser, she chooses to sit with him and Ned Leeds at lunch, chided them for coming to Liz Allan's party, gave herself detention just to sketch Parker, and gave Parker the middle finger during the homecoming dance. However, despite the other students occupied by the dance, she immediately noticed Parker leaving the dance after apologizing to Toomes, and later questioned Parker where he was going and what he was hiding, before brushing her earlier statements off and declaring that she did not care. As Parker left the library, however, she gave him a glance, watching him leave. Jones was also able to deduce that Parker was Spider-Man by noticing a pattern in his behavior as well as evidence she found or observed, only confirming her suspicions when he confessed.\n\nHowever, it comes clear that after the class' trip through Europe, Jones developed a crush on Parker throughout her observations of him, though she perhaps tried to deny it at first, mostly by being mean towards him. Her habit of documenting his schedules and drawing him in detention could just be her showing concern for his well-being and being fascinated by him. This is later confirmed in London, where she admits that she likes Parker and observed him; not just because she thought he was Spider-Man, but because of her mutual attraction to him.\n\nJones is generally a serious person, though she does possess a dry sense of humor, and is nearly always seen reading a book. She is a loner and claims not to have friends, though she soon comes to consider her Academic Decathlon team as friends. After the Blip, she has opened up considerably more to Leeds and especially Parker, who she frequently starts conversations with and is considerably more comfortable around then any of her other classmates. She has a tendency to speak out her feelings even if it offends someone, although she is aware of this habit.\n\nJones is also fascinated by morbid, yet otherwise controversial and macabre topics, with Parker saying that she like black dahlias, due to being fascinated by the Black Dahlia murder, and her mentioning a lot of conspiracy theories and propaganda, as well as memorizing gruesome historical events and practices from Europe.\n\nJones is a very strong-willed and loyal person who is more than willing to take the lead and defend her friends, even in dangerous situations. She defends Parker against both Flash Thompson and Brad Davis when they try to pick on or humiliate Parker. She doesn't hesitate to search for Parker when he leaves the opera in Prague both out of concern for his well-being and out of curiosity for his whereabouts. She manages to keep herself together and help Parker out when they realize Mysterio is a fraud. When she, Leeds, Happy Hogan, Betty Brant, and Thompson are getting chased by one of Beck's drones, she's the first to take action, grabbing a mace to hit the drone and helping formulate a plan with the others to distract it. She also brings a mace along with her after she leaves to find Parker, telling him that she brought it just in case he needed help fighting drones, showing that she was willing to help him fight against an army of killer drones, showing how much she deeply cares for him. Jones was more than willing to help Parker in his search for the multiversal villains, is unwilling to leave Parker's side as he cures the villains, only doing so at his continued insistence, and continues to support him after his Aunt's death, stating that she'll stay by his side no matter what.\n\nJones is very particular about her name. It is implied that she allows people to call her \"MJ\" when she feels that they are friends with her and \"Michelle\" only to those who she is merely acquainted with. Additionally, she does not seem too fond being referred to as \"Miss Jones-Watson,\" instead preferring to be called \"Miss Jones,\" implying that she disfavors one of her family names.\n\nOver her lifetime, Jones has become accustomed to becoming disappointed in order to hide her true emotions upon issues, as shown when she was already expecting to be disappointed while filing out for MIT so she wouldn't be disappointed for herself. After having her memories of Parker wiped away and got admitted into M.I.T., she has finally reached a point where she isn't expecting disappointment or being unhappy, which caused Parker to hide his true identity in front of her. However, during her talk with Parker and witnessing him leave the Peter Pan Donut & Pastry Shop, Jones felt that she knows him.",
