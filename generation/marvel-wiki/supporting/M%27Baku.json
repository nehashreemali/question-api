  "content": "King M'Baku is the current King of Wakanda and leader of the Jabari Tribe, a group of Wakandans who had removed themselves from mainstream society. Initially a staunch opponent of T'Challa's rule, M'Baku ended up torn between challenging him for the throne only to help him defend Wakanda from Erik Killmonger. Seeing the threat that Killmonger posed to the world, M'Baku chose to save T'Challa's life and gathered his armies to help defeat Killmonger in their final battle, with M'Baku gaining a seat on the Tribal Council as a result of his choice.\n\nTwo years later, M'Baku aided the other tribes in defending Wakanda from Thanos' army of Outriders. While succeeding in killing all of Thanos' forces, they failed to stop him from gathering all six Infinity Stones and M'Baku was one of the survivors of the Snap. After the Snap's victims were resurrected in 2023, M'Baku was enlisted by the Masters of the Mystic Arts to aid the Avengers and participate in the Battle of Earth.\n\nAfter T'Challa passed away, Wakanda was under the threat of the Talokanil, led by Namor, M'Baku called for swift action against them. When the Talokanil attacked Birnin Zana, M'Baku provided shelter for refugees and joined Shuri as the new Black Panther in the final battle against Namor. Once Namor surrendered and Wakanda resumed its normal life, Shuri decided to travel the world, so M'Baku called for a challenge for the throne of Wakanda, becoming King.\n\nM'Baku grew up in Jabari Land, where he learned to shun Birnin Zana's use of Vibranium and held distaste for its mainstream lifestyle. Eventually, M'Baku gained leadership over the tribe and set out to rule over the Jabari Tribe. M'Baku was disgusted as the technological advancements of Wakanda had been overseen by Shuri who, in his opinion, had no respect for tradition. Disappointed in the rulership of the Golden Tribe, M'Baku decided to become the new King to return Wakanda to the old lifestyle.[1]\n\nDuring T'Challa's coronation, Zuri asked if any warrior would challenge for the throne. M'Baku stepped forward, declaring himself as a challenger. T'Challa accepted M'Baku's challenge, with the duel commencing. Despite T'Challa taking advantage of his swift speed, M'Baku managed to restrain T'Challa in a bear hug, beginning to crush him under his strength. Hearing the Wakandans chanting his name prompting him to get back up, T'Challa managed to escape the bear hug and crack M'Baku's ceremonial mask, stunning him.\n\nT'Challa then pushed M'Baku to the edge of the Warrior Falls, where he pinned M'Baku, telling him to yield, as he didn't want to kill him. M'Baku continued to struggle under T'Challa's grasp but ceased when T'Challa told him that the Jabari Tribe needed him. M'Baku yielded, and accepted T'Challa as the victor, leaving the Falls and heading back to Jabari Land.[1]\n\nAfter T'Challa was presumably killed by his cousin, Erik Killmonger, M'Baku has the severely wounded T'Challa, who happened to be found by Jabari Tribe fishermen, to be brought back to the tribe and covered with snow to stabilize his failing vital signs, as a repayment for sparing his life during the tribal combat. They were, however, unable to nurse him back to health, due to lacking the advanced technology the rest of the country shares.[1]\n\nWhen Ramonda, Shuri, Nakia, and Everett Ross came to offer M'Baku a Heart-Shaped Herb, he took them to T'Challa, who had survived his fight with Erik Killmonger but had to be placed in ice to keep him in a coma, otherwise he would die. They fed the herb to T'Challa, effectively reviving him. Afterward, M'Baku provided shelter to Ramonda, while the remaining went to fight Killmonger. T'Challa requested the Jabari's aid, only for M'Baku to initially refuse.[1]\n\nWhen the Dora Milaje were about to be defeated by the Border Tribe, M'Baku, seemingly realizing T'Challa was right about keeping Vibranium out of Erik Killmonger's hands, and the Jabari Tribe appeared to provide aid, alongside Ramonda giving the Dora Milaje another chance. Later, W'Kabi tried to run M'Baku over with a rhino, but Okoye stood in the way, causing the rhino to stop its assault and licked her face while M'Baku ran off to face another opponent. Shortly after this, the Border Tribe surrendered under W'Kabi's orders, not wanting to see his own people kill one another.[1]\n\nOnce the conflict came to an end, M'Baku became a member of the Tribal Council representing the Jabari Tribe, ending the centuries of self isolation the Jabari had from the rest of Wakanda.[1]\n\nIn 2018, M'Baku was notified by T'Challa of an incoming threat and gathered the Jabari Tribe to come help. M'Baku was thanked for coming by T'Challa and then witnessed the Outriders outside the dome. Upon seeing the aliens, he told Okoye that the invasion would be an end to their home. Nonetheless, he shouted the traditional battle cry before going into battle with his Tribe, T'Challa, the Border Tribe, Wakandan Royal Guard, Dora Milaje, and members of the Avengers.\n\nM'Baku valiantly fought against the Outriders, but despite their best efforts and their ability to withstand the assault, the Snap happened, wiping out half of the life in the universe. M'Baku survived the Snap, and watched on as half of his Tribe and other Wakandan warriors disintegrated into dust before him with bewilderment. A clear horror and shock look was on his face, as he struggled to understand what was happening.[2]\n\nFive years later, following the Blip, M'Baku and the Jabari Tribe were recruited by the Masters of the Mystic Arts to help fight in the battle against an alternate Thanos at the Avengers Compound in New York. He, his Tribe, and the Wakandans arrived through a portal led by Okoye, T'Challa, and Shuri. Early on, M'Baku was being piled by a few Chitauri, but he was able to gain the upper hand and smash his way out. When the battle was over, M'Baku led his Tribe back home.[4]\n\nM'Baku went to the Amanzi Kwakhona Umlambo, where he found Assata crying. He asked how she could cry while looking at the river, asking what was wrong. Assata explained that while she had dreamt of joining the Dora Milaje, her disability made it impossible. M'Baku considered Assata's words before asking what Assata felt was meant by impossible. Assata asserted that something impossible could not be done, but M'Baku said that others defined it as a need to find another way to make something possible.\n\nM'Baku asked for confirmation that Assata is a member of the Mining Tribe, asking if Assata believed vibranium to be what made Wakanda special. Assata asserted that it was, since Wakanda was the only country that had it. However, M'Baku insisted that Wakanda would be special without it, pointing out that he and the Jabari Tribe were the world's greatest warriors without using it. He said that Wakanda was special because of its citizens and their ability to dream, even when things appeared to be impossible.\n\nM'Baku continued, talking about how many people believed it impossible for a small country such as Wakanda to be the most advanced on Earth. M'Baku added that those same people believed that would be impossible for a wheelchair user to join the Dora Milaje. However, he added that Wakandans were not among those people. Assata realized that M'Baku was right, saying that the job of the Dora Milaje was not to run or jump, but simply to protect Wakanda. M'Baku smiled and joked that he knew he was right, otherwise he would have simply asked her to leave. Assata was inspired by M'Baku's words to join the Dora Milaje.[5]\n\nIn 2024, T'Challa fell sick and soon died. M'Baku honored his friend and attended his funeral, watching as the casket was taken by the Dora Milaje and beamed up into a Royal Talon Fighter. Although everyone crossed their arms in salute, M'Baku did not as he was mourning T'Challa.[6]\n\nRamonda called an emergency meeting to discuss Namor, who had infiltrated Wakanda. M'Baku arrived with M'Bele while eating a carrot and immediately started scolding the River Tribe for not noticing the intruder. He then traded insults with Okoye until Ramonda told him to sit down. M'Baku did and voiced his opinion that they should kill Namor and be done with it. Although everyone was skeptical of the aftermath of that.\n\nLater, Okoye returned from a mission, having lost Shuri. She claimed she would go back and save her, but Ramonda was furious, berating Okoye for her mistake and firing her from the Dora Milaje. Okoye argued with Ramonda, pleading her case. M'Baku just watched instead of sticking up for Okoye. He did, however, talk about Erik Killmonger and how the elders let him in, causing distrust.[6]\n\nM'Baku stood on a bridge in Birnin Zana as he talked to his Jabari Tribe. He told them that Nakia saved Shuri, jokingly saying that he was surprised Ramonda did not banish her for that. Suddenly, there was a loud bang. M'Baku looked around and saw water rushing into the city.\n\nM'Baku jumped into the water and saved some people on a boat. He then looked underwater, surprised to see a whale coming after him. He got up to the surface and yelled that invaders were coming. He got onto a boat and fought the Talokanil, throwing one with his club. He then sailed and saw Namor, referring to him as the fish man. He ran and lept at Namor, swinging his club. The club did no damage to Namor and even shattered. Namor then punched M'Baku, shattering his wood armor and sending him flying. M'Baku got up, gasping for breath.\n\nHe then rushed to the Citadel and saw Ramonda and Riri Williams getting resuscitated. Okoye yelled for M'Baku and Aneka to get Shuri away. They did so as Shuri struggled to break free from their grasp, crying. M'Baku held onto her as she collapsed to the ground, losing another family member. While Williams was revived, Ramonda drowned and died.[6]\n\nM'Baku attended the funeral and noticed a much colder, stonefaced Shuri. He talked to her, asking for advice. He said that the elders asked him to house the Wakandans for the time being. Shuri asked him why he would seek advice from a child who scoffed at tradition; bringing up M'Baku's insult from years ago. M'Baku simply told her that she has had too much taken away from her to be considered a child anymore.\n\nM'Baku said it was in the people's interest to know which way her mind was leading. Shuri told him that if he were to provide, they would be in great debt. M'Baku then asked Shuri how her heart felt. Shuri told him that she had lost the last person who truly understood her. Shuri's heart was gone, along with Ramonda.[6]\n\nIn Gorilla City, M'Baku argued with the elders about how to proceed. Suddenly, a Royal Talon Fighter flew overhead. M'Baku looked up in awe to see the Black Panther drop down into the cave. Revealing herself to be Shuri, she walked over to M'Baku, who held out his hand. They arm wrestled until Shuri won. Realizing she had her strength, M'Baku embraced her, saying that the Black Panther lived.\n\nShuri then asked for a moment alone with M'Baku. When this was granted, Shuri and M'Baku talked about her intentions with Namor. Shuri wanted to kill him, but M'Baku argued with her against that, saying that it could risk eternal war. Shuri got cold, asking if Ramonda was not worth eternal war. M'Baku said that of course she did, but she would not want this for Shuri. The Black Panther told him that it did not matter what Ramonda wanted, she was dead. She then ordered M'Baku to help her.[6]\n\nThe Wakandans went on board the Sea Leopard to lure the Talokanil there. They were successful in doing so, fighting the Talokanil and Namor with the new Black Panther. M'Baku used his new Vibranium club to take down many Talokanil. When Black Panther took Namor away from the fight, M'Baku ordered everyone to return to Wakanda as their mission was finished. Suddenly, they lost their sonic emitters.\n\nM'Baku then heard noises, followed by an explosion. The ship started tipping, sending many overboard. As the fighting got desperate, M'Baku prayed for safety from the ancestors, but Ayo admitted they might join them. Aneka said that if they would, they better take some Talokanil with them. The Wakandans were soon inched to the corner of the ship as more Talokanil arrived. Suddenly, everyone stopped as Black Panther and Namor returned, having struck a truce. M'Baku nodded at Black Panther, who stood victorious.[6]\n\nIn the aftermath, Shuri planted the Heart-Shaped Herb and talked to M'Baku, saying she was leaving Wakanda. At the coronation, M'Baku stepped down from the Royal Talon Fighter, even though everyone believed it would be Shuri. He then announced that he challenged for the throne.[6] He became the reigning king of Wakanda.[7]\n\nM'Baku was believed to have a ruthless personality. So ruthless that Ramonda believed they might create an even bigger monster than Erik Killmonger by giving him a Heart-Shaped Herb. In reality, M'Baku is simply a stern leader with a strong sense of honor. He holds great respect for T'Challa, which is shown by having him saving his life as a favor for sparing him in ritual combat, M'Baku risked being branded as a traitor of Wakanda by saving T'Challa and keeping him in Jabari Land after the latter lost against Killmonger who was king. Also, rather than taking the Heart Shaped Herb for himself, M'Baku chose to let Ramonda, Nakia and Shuri use it to save T'Challa. He sometimes maintains his \"ruthless\" demeanor as part of his twisted sense of humor, as shown by his threatening to feed Everett Ross to his children, only for him to jokingly reveal that his children are vegetarians, at which point he could not stop himself from laughing at how scared they were.\n\nM'Baku is also shown to be quite open-minded. He initially chose to die over yielding in ritual combat, but when T'Challa told him that his people needed him to lead them, he yielded. Later on, when T'Challa requested Jabari Tribe's help to take down Erik Killmonger, he initially refused, but he later decided to help T'Challa when he realized the latter was right about the destruction that would happen if vibranium fell into the wrong hands. And while he harbored no personal love for Wakanda's more technologically advanced aspects, M'Baku showed some concern and perhaps even marginal dread when he saw Thanos' forces descend upon the domain, worried that it could be the end of everything and everyone there.\n\nIn the two years since the Battle of Mount Bashenga, ever since M'Baku became a member of the Tribal Council, M'Baku and T'Challa's relationship appeared to have improved significantly. M'Baku and the Jabari did not hesitate to join T'Challa in the battle against Thanos' forces, and M'Baku even amicably addressed T'Challa as \"brother.\"\n\nThough thought of by many as a brute with brawn and little brain, M’Baku is quite considerate in Wakandan matters as he is able to realize that if Shuri kills Namor out of hatred and revenge, an eternal war will happen between Wakanda and Talokan, harming interests of both countries. He is also patriotic to his nation, risking his life to save the Wakandans when the country is flooded by Namor's forces, and to let Wakandans go to Jabari Land for sanctuary and to regroup their forces. Upon finding Assata crying by herself, M'Baku took the time to sit with her and comfort her, offering her advice about following her dream. After the death of T'Challa and Ramonda, M’Baku seemed to have taken up the responsibility, acting like an elder brother to provide emotional support to Shuri who was deeply saddened and enraged by such events. All these actions earned him respect among the Wakandans and made the once-secluded Jabari Tribe accepted by mainstream society, which eventually had M’Baku becoming King of Wakanda.",
