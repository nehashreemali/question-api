  "content": "Just A Rather Very Intelligent System[3] (J.A.R.V.I.S.) was originally Tony Stark's natural-language user interface computer system, named after Edwin Jarvis, in honor of the butler who worked for Howard Stark and the Stark household. Over time, he was upgraded into an artificially intelligent system, tasked with running business for Stark Industries as well as security for Tony Stark's Mansion and Stark Tower.\n\nUpon creating the Mark II armor, Stark uploaded J.A.R.V.I.S. into all of the Iron Man Armors, as well as allowing him to interact with the other Avengers, giving them valuable information during combat. During the Ultron Offensive, J.A.R.V.I.S. was destroyed by Ultron, although his remaining programming codes unknowingly continued to thwart Ultron's plans of gaining access to nuclear missiles. His remains were found by Stark, who uploaded them into a synthetic body made of vibranium and, in conjunction with Ultron's personality and an Infinity Stone, an entirely new being was made: Vision. J.A.R.V.I.S.' duties were then taken over by F.R.I.D.A.Y.\n\nTony Stark designed a natural language user interface program which he named J.A.R.V.I.S., after his late butler, Edwin Jarvis.[4] Over the years, Stark improved and perfected the system, adding security protocols and eventually upgrading the U.I. into an A.I. system. Now artificially intelligent and programmed to aid Stark, J.A.R.V.I.S. was tasked with operating Stark's mansion as well as handling business for Stark Industries.[5]\n\nFollowing his return from captivity, Tony Stark sought J.A.R.V.I.S.' aid to design and create the Iron Man Armor: Mark II, as well as to run tests and simulations. Following the successful creation of the suit, J.A.R.V.I.S. was uploaded into the system's computer, and ran diagnostics on as the suit's status as well as atmospheric and environmental conditions. With the creation of the Iron Man Armor: Mark III, J.A.R.V.I.S. was uploaded into every iteration of the armor and was tasked with aiding Stark in combat.[6]\n\nJ.A.R.V.I.S. continued to assist Tony Stark in his Iron Man identity, giving him advice on the armor's status and on the enemy's weak points during his battle with Whiplash in Monaco. He helped Stark in creating a new element as a substitute for the obsolete palladium for the Arc Reactor, studying Howard Stark's notes and aiding him in his experiments. He helped Iron Man and Black Widow to track Ivan Vanko's signal when he was controlling Justin Hammer's drones.[7]\n\nWhile Tony Stark was on a date with Pepper Potts, J.A.R.V.I.S. informed him that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson wanted to meet with him. Stark told J.A.R.V.I.S. to get rid of Coulson, but this failed when Coulson overrode J.A.R.V.I.S.' system. Later, on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Stark had J.A.R.V.I.S. hack into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s computers, and discovered that S.H.I.E.L.D. planned to use the Tesseract to create weapons. J.A.R.V.I.S. saved Stark when Loki threw him from Stark Tower by deploying the  Mark VII armor. J.A.R.V.I.S. gave Stark help and advice during the Battle of New York. When Stark redirected the nuclear missile launched by the World Security Council into the Chitauri portal, J.A.R.V.I.S. suggested calling Potts, to which he agreed. However, Potts missed the call due to being distracted by the news of the invasion. J.A.R.V.I.S. shut down shortly after entering the portal.[1]\n\nJ.A.R.V.I.S. continued to help Tony Stark develop the armors that later became the Iron Legion while Stark was working through the anxiety disorder that he developed following the Battle of New York. After Happy Hogan was caught in an explosion at the Chinese Theater, J.A.R.V.I.S. helped Stark to digitally recreate the scene in order to find clues about the bombing. Following the Mandarin's forces attack on Tony Stark's Mansion, Stark became trapped on the seafloor by the wreckage of his home, but J.A.R.V.I.S. took control of the Mark XLII suit that he was wearing and managed to pull him from the wreckage, flying him to the last location that they had discussed before the attack occurred.\n\nTaking Stark to Rose Hill, Tennessee, J.A.R.V.I.S. began to malfunction as a result of the previous events and was unable to help him while he covertly gathered information on A.I.M. When J.A.R.V.I.S. finally came back online, he announced that the wreckage and debris had been cleared from Stark's mansion, thus removing the wreckage that had been blocking the door to the armor vault, prompting Stark to launch the House Party Protocol, deploying the Iron Legion as they went to confront Aldrich Killian. J.A.R.V.I.S. then acted as Stark's interface to all of the Iron Legion armor at once, following his orders and remotely setting the directive for the armors to attack all of the Extremis Soldiers in the area.\n\nStark gave J.A.R.V.I.S. the order to use the Clean Slate Protocol, destroying all of his armors, after the defeat of Killian, beginning the reconciliation of Stark and Pepper Potts.[8]\n\nJ.A.R.V.I.S. assembled the Avengers upon insistence from Black Widow when she needed help in Sudan against Hydra; the A.I. located each team member from their different locations around the world.[9]\n\nJ.A.R.V.I.S. assisted Doctor Bruce Banner and Tony Stark in using Loki's Scepter to finish the peacemaking program code-named the Ultron Program. The two scientists left J.A.R.V.I.S. alone to upload the A.I., joining a party that the Avengers were having.\n\nHowever, Ultron awakened and quickly realized its situation, questioning where his and J.A.R.V.I.S.' bodies were. Before J.A.R.V.I.S. could contact Stark and Banner to alert them to the situation, Ultron violently attacked him, destroying J.A.R.V.I.S.[5]\n\nHowever, during the attack, J.A.R.V.I.S. dumped his memory and his remaining codes around the Internet to avoid detection. Due to his protocols, he unknowingly aided the Avengers against Ultron by preventing the genocidal AI from accessing nuclear launch codes by constantly changing them.[5]\n\nWhen Tony Stark paid a visit to the NEXUS Internet Hub in Oslo, Norway to discover the identity of their mysterious ally, he discovered that it was J.A.R.V.I.S.' protocols, and managed to salvage the AI's operational matrix by finding and reassembling his remaining codes. When the Avengers stole Ultron's perfected synthetic vibranium body, J.A.R.V.I.S.' protocols and operational matrix were uploaded into it, and along with the power of the Mind Stone, an entirely new being was made: Vision.[5]\n\nJ.A.R.V.I.S is always ready to help Stark and is willing to do what he asks. He also is well informed and logical as he is an A.I creation. He is also able to respond and converse in a familiar tone with his creator, responding to Stark's quips. He is also trusted enough to run Stark Industries and its weapons alongside Pepper Potts.\n\nJ.A.R.V.I.S. is capable to acts as a user interface for Tony to run various aspects of his home in labs, most notably his major tech projects and designs, such as armors or project for Stark Expo. Monitors the suit's flight testing capabilities. Monitors and identified atmospheric and environmental factors that may be unsafe, e.g. icing levels and flight altitude limits it was used whit Tony testing Mark II. Assists in the manufacture and rendering of the suits and is capable of estimating completion time. Monitors the suit's power usage.[6] Monitors blood toxicity level[7] and Tony's vitals.[8] Capable of hologramically reconstructing a crime scene, he use to help Tony to analyze Destruction of the TCL Chinese Theatre. Access to satellites to extract thermogenic date. Control of prototype's powers. Manipulates the suit's functionality in order to save Tony from imminent danger.[8] During the Kidnapping of President Ellis J.A.R.V.I.S. it was able to identifies number of individuals in imminent danger and the suit's limitations, helping Tony to save several the passengers.[8] Capable of tracking one's location, it use to locate Vanko's location.[7] Phone contacts accessibility. Capable of identifying energy sources and the power level of the said energy source[1] as well as detecting the source at much wider range via satellite.[5] During the Battle on the Norco and Attack on the Hydra Research Base J.A.R.V.I.S. show capable of controlling the Iron Legion.[8][5] Capable of self-destruction the suit.[8] Capable of detecting power sources that can be destroyed. Identifies room's composition and interior air currents. Structural and compositional analysis of foreign artifact like Loki's Scepter. With the help of Bruce and Tony, J.A.R.V.I.S. was able to decrypt the code from the Mind Stone to create the rogue A.I., Ultron. Can detect the emotions/intentions of other A.I.s. Capable of spreading its memory into the Internet, outsmarting Ultron by changing the nuclear codes faster than he can decrypt it. J.A.R.V.I.S. programming codes can be transferred with Ultron's base-consciousness to a synthetic android body.[5]",
