  "content": "Nakia is a former member of the War Dogs and T'Challa's lover, who was often sent on missions around the world, witnessing the hardships experienced by many people and growing the belief that Wakanda should actively help them. She was pulled out of an assignment to attend the Coronation of T'Challa and took part in a mission in order to arrest the criminal Ulysses Klaue. Following their failure to apprehend him, Nakia exiled herself when Erik Killmonger took the throne of Wakanda. She reunited with T'Challa in Jabari Land and assisted him in reclaiming the throne from Killmonger. When T'Challa decided to open Wakanda to the rest of the world, Nakia would oversee the humanitarian policy of Wakanda.\n\nIn secret, Nakia and T'Challa had a child, Toussaint, who Nakia raised in Haiti after the Snap. In 2025, one year after the death of T'Challa, Queen Ramonda had visited Nakia and recruited her into rescuing Shuri from the clutches of the Talokanil, an underwater civilization on the verge of waring with the Wakandans. In the process of the rescue, Nakia saved Shuri while inadverantly sparking the Talokanil-Wakandan War, where Ramonda would be killed by the Talokanil leader Namor. Nakia then agreed to join Shuri and Wakanda in their campaign to fight Talokan in a final confrontation, which eventually ended in a truce between the two nations. After the war, Nakia invited Shuri to Haiti and introduced her to Toussaint as her nephew.\n\nNakia had developed a close bond with T'Challa and the two dated for a short while.[2]\n\nWhile T'Challa learned to become King of Wakanda and the ways of the royal family, Nakia joined the War Dogs. During a mission in South Korea, she was involved in a confrontation with ivory smugglers. She was later given an undercover assignment in Nigeria where she pretended to be a Nigerian woman as she observed the trafficking going on in the country.[2]\n\nTwo years later, Nakia was still on her undercover mission. She traveled in a truck with several other captives until the truck line was suddenly stopped. As the captors engaged in defense position, Nakia sneaked out of the truck. While Black Panther suddenly attacked the traffickers, Nakia picked up a machine gun and assisted him in the fact. She then stopped Black Panther as he moved forward to the last soldier, claiming that he was a young boy who had been forced to carry a weapon.\n\nOne last soldier took another woman hostage in front of Nakia and Black Panther, only to be taken down by Okoye. With the attack being over, Nakia blamed Black Panther for having sabotaged her cover. However, Black Panther informed her that T'Chaka had died and that he wanted her to attend his incoronation. Therefore, Nakia told the captives to go home and agreed to return to Wakanda. During the journey, Nakia comforted T'Challa over the loss of his father.[2]\n\nUpon arriving in Birnin Zana, Nakia left with Ayo who escorted her back to the River Tribe province to prepare for the impending Coronation of T'Challa. Nakia then went onto the River Tribe's boat during the ceremony, performing the ritual dances along with the other members of her tribe. Later, Nakia attended the coronation ceremony and was surprised when M'Baku and the Jabari Tribe arrived and declared that they would challenge T'Challa for the throne.\n\nT'Challa accepted the challenge, and Nakia then attended the duel between T'Challa and M'Baku, expressing distress when M'Baku stabbed T'Challa in the shoulder with his knobkerrie. However, T'Challa eventually triumphed over M'Baku, much to Nakia's joy who happily cheered her new King. Therefore, T'Challa was celebrated by the people of Wakanda as he was officially crowned the King of Wakanda.[2]\n\nLater, Nakia took a walk with T'Challa in the Birnin Zana. When T'Challa asked her to remain in Wakanda, Nakia insisted that she wanted to return into a mission to help other people outside her country. Indeed, Nakia thought that Wakanda should do more towards people in need instead of keeping hiding from the world, although T'Challa did not share her views. When T'Challa noticed that her stubbornness would keep her from being a great Queen, Nakia replied that this was what would make her a great Queen, making her imply that she thought about it.[2]\n\nNakia was later recruited for a mission along with Black Panther and Okoye to arrest the criminal Ulysses Klaue. They journeyed to Busan, South Korea, where Nakia reached her contact Sophia, who had information regarding the deal Klaue was about to make in the Jagalchi Market Casino. They entered the casino and decided to split up to cover more area. Nakia sat at the bar and soon spotted three Americans, suspecting them to work with Klaue's buyer.\n\nWhile T'Challa discovered that CIA operative Everett Ross was the buyer, Klaue arrived in the casino with more bodyguards, prompting Nakia to stand up and be ready for action. As more Americans kept coming, Nakia and the others out figured out that this was an ambush meant for them. When bodyguards eventually identified Okoye as a target, a violent gunfight erupted in the casino. Nakia took down several of Klaue's bodyguards before leaving the casino with Okoye.\n\nBoth Nakia and Okoye engaged in the hot pursuit in the streets of Busan, chasing Klaue in his SUV. They successfully followed him for a while, nearly catching up with him, but in the end, Klaue used his prosthetic hand's cannon to blast their car, leaving them behind while he escaped. Nakia and Okoye were then picked up by CIA Agent Everett Ross, who took them to where Black Panther had ultimately caught Klaue. Nakia begged him not to execute Klaue as they were being watched by numerous witnesses.[2]\n\nNakia joined the CIA South Korean Black Site along with Black Panther and Okoye. However, while Ulysses Klaue was being interrogated, Nakia figured out that something was not right outside the CIA facility. Indeed, a disguised Erik Killmonger had arrived to release Klaue. Killmonger began shooting in the facility and Everett Ross jumped in front of Nakia, taking a bullet for her. Nakia then agreed with Black Panther upon bringing Ross to Wakanda to heal him.[2]\n\nBack in Wakanda, Nakia took some time alone with T'Challa, who had learned the truth about his uncle N'Jobu who had betrayed Wakanda and had been killed by T'Challa's father T'Chaka. Nakia comforted T'Challa, stating that he was not responsible for his father's mistakes and that he had to choose what kind of King he would be. Their conversation was however interrupted as Shuri called T'Challa and asked him to come back to her lab, along with Everett Ross, who was recovering from his gunshot wound.\n\nAt Shuri's Lab, the two uncovered that the man from earlier was Erik Killmonger, whose real name was Erik Stevens, a former Navy Seal and a member of a CIA black ops assassination squad. Indeed, Killmonger had returned to Wakanda with the corpse of Ulysses Klaue as a gift. Nakia listened to Everett Ross' presentation about Killmonger, all the while exchanging concerned looks with T'Challa.[2]\n\nLater, Nakia attended the duel between Erik Killmonger and T'Challa. When Okoye asked her where Everett Ross was, Nakia replied that she had locked him up. Nakia then watched the fight and despite her support, T'Challa was defeated and Zuri was murdered by Killmonger. Nakia watched in horror as Killmonger took T'Challa and threw him over the waterfall, leaving him for dead. Knowing that they were in danger as of now, Nakia took Shuri and Ramonda away for safety.[2]\n\nNakia later met with Okoye and asked her to come with them and leave Birnin Zana. However, Okoye refused claiming that she was bound to serve whoever sat on the throne of Wakanda. Nakia replied that she loved Wakanda as much as Okoye did and that she would save it from Killmonger while Okoye would serve the new King. Nakia then went to find Everett Ross. She informed him of T'Challa's demise and gave him clothes so he could escape with Shuri, Ramonda and Nakia herself.\n\nBefore leaving the Birnin Zana, however, Nakia went to the City of the Dead, where Killmonger was to undergo the ceremony where he would meet his ancestors on the Ancestral Plane. Nakia watched as Killmonger returned from his interdimensional journey and ordered all the Heart-Shaped Herb to be burnt down. Nakia managed to salvage one single herb before secretly leaving. She then reunited with Shuri, Ramonda and Ross and they made their way to Jabari Land, where they intended to give the Herb to M'Baku so he could challenge Killmonger.\n\nOn the way, Ramonda questioned this plan and suggested that Nakia should take the herb herself, but she refused, as she was a spy with no army. They were captured by Jabari warriors who brought them to M'Baku. Nakia explained to M'Baku that they had come to offer him the Heart-Shaped Herb so he could help them overthrow Killmonger. However, instead of taking it, M'Baku took Nakia and the others with them and revealed the truth: T'Challa was alive and had been secretly kept by the Jabari Tribe.\n\nNakia gave the Heart-Shaped Herb to Ramonda, who crushed it into the drink which would restore the powers of the Black Panther. Thanks to that, T'Challa was revived, much to Nakia's joy. They returned to the Jabari throne room, where Nakia explained the situation in Wakanda and swore to fight at T'Challa's side against Killmonger.[2]\n\nNakia, Shuri and Everett Ross sneaked into Shuri's Lab while Black Panther faced the Border Tribe who followed Erik Killmonger. Nakia then reclaimed advanced Circular Vibranium Blades and, on Shuri's request, wore a Dora Milaje armor. She then left the lab with Shuri, leaving Ross behind so he could take remote control of the Royal Talon Fighter. Nakia and Shuri joined the battlefield on Mount Bashenga and quickly confronted Killmonger as he had defeated Okoye and two other Doras.\n\nUsing her Circular Vibranium Blades, Nakia managed to disarm Killmonger, but he fought back and wounded her on the thigh with his Panther Habit's claws. He then threw Nakia away before turning to Shuri. As Black Panther joined into the fight, Nakia was found by Shuri, and they decided to resume the fight against the Border Tribe alongside with the Dora Milaje. However, they were outnumbered and Nakia, Okoye, Shuri and Ayo found themselves cornered by the Border Tribe.\n\nNakia and the others were eventually saved by M'Baku and the Jabari Tribe, who came into battle to fight for Black Panther. Thanks to these reinforcements, Nakia was able to defeat several members of the Border Tribe. In the end, the Border Tribe surrendered while Black Panther successfully defeated Killmonger.[2]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Mount Bashenga, Nakia was present in the throne room as T'Challa returned as the rightful King of Wakanda. She then took another walk with T'Challa in the streets of Birnin Zana. When T'Challa thanked her for having saved both himself and Wakanda, Nakia simply replied that she had done her duty and protected what she loved, prompting T'Challa to kiss her. Nakia kissed him back and T'Challa announced that he had found a way for her to fulfill her plans of providing the world with assistance.\n\nAs T'Challa decided to create Wakandan International Outreach Centre, Nakia was appointed a head of the social outreach department.[2] She then accompanied T'Challa to Vienna for a United Nations meeting during which T'Challa decided to open Wakanda to the world, following Nakia's advice.[2]\n\nSometime later, Nakia and T'Challa had a son together and kept his existence a secret. Nakia abandoned her positions, leaving the War Dogs, and made plans with T'Challa for her to move to Haiti. They decided to move there so their son wouldn't be pressured with the Golden Tribe.[1]\n\nIn 2018, Nakia, pregnant with her son, was kept away when the battle with aliens occurred. She and her son then survived the Snap. After learning that T'Challa and Shuri had disappeared, she and her son, without telling anyone, moved to Haiti. Making the move and grieving the losses wasn't an easy feat for her.[1]\n\nShe then gave birth to her son there. During the next five years, she bought a house for herself where she raised her son. She also took part in helping out at nearby orphanages, working as a headmistress.[1]\n\nIn 2023, Nakia was contacted by T'Challa after he had been restored to life and was visited by him. In 2024, he told her about his illness and prepared her and their son for his subsequent death. He also told her that when he died, he wanted her to stay there and not attend his funeral. After he passed, Nakia held a little funeral at her house.[1]\n\nNakia was living peacefully in Haiti when she was approached by Toussaint who had led Ramonda to her. Nakia talked to Ramonda about all that had happened in the past six years. Ramonda then told Nakia that Shuri had been taken and asked for her help. Nakia wanted Ramonda to distract Namor while she went in.[1]\n\nNakia searched Mexico for any information on Namor, trying to find his location. She approached a woman, posing as a student and she asked for information, but the woman did not want to speak to outsiders, telling Nakia to go. Nakia then spoke in Yucatec Mayan, telling her that she has seen him, too. The woman then told Nakia about Namor.[1]\n\nNakia located the underwater nation of Talokan and used an underwater vehicle to travel into a cave. She emerged in a cave without water and found Shuri. She pointed her gun at a Talokanil that was holding Shuri by the throat. Nakia spoke in Xhosa, telling Shuri to move her left arm. Once she did, Nakia shot the Talokanil. Although Shuri wanted to help the woman, Nakia told her she was as good as dead. They hopped on her vehicle and made it to the surface where Ramonda reunited with Shuri, thanking Nakia.[1]\n\nNakia finally returned to Wakanda after six years. She talked with Okoye in the city about T'Challa and his death. Suddenly, water came rushing through the city. Okoye told her they were under attack. Nakia and Okoye used a ship to rescue many civilians including Shuri. They then rushed to the Citadel where they found Ramonda and Riri Williams drowning.\n\nNakia grabbed Williams and used Kimoyo Beads to try to resuscitate her. Following many attempts, Williams finally woke up, spitting and coughing out water. Nakia then ran over to Okoye, who was doing the same to Ramonda. Nakia connected her beads to Ramonda's and figured out it was too late for her. Nakia told Okoye to back off as it was too late, the queen was dead. Nakia stayed silent at the funeral as Shuri mourned.[1]\n\nNakia met with the grieving Shuri in her lab. Shuri was set on recreating the Heart-Shaped Herb so she could take Namor down. Nakia helped her recreate the herb along with Riri Williams. Nakia then set Shuri down and had her drink the substance. When Shuri woke up, she claimed not to feel any different. Angry that it did not work, she argued with Nakia before punching a mannequin, only for it to go flying. Realizing she did have strength, Nakia told Shuri to make a suit.[1]\n\nPrior to luring the Talokanil to the Sea Leopard, Nakia approached the new Black Panther. Nakia first told Shuri that she would always have a home with her in Haiti. She then told Shuri to breathe, which she did. Nakia then asked Shuri who she saw in the Ancestral Plane. Shuri backed off, refusing to say. Fearing the worst, Nakia told Shuri that killing out of vengeance would only make things worse, it will grow the hole in her heart until it consumed her. Shuri told Nakia that she was already consumed.\n\nOn the Sea Leopard, the Talokanil arrived, allowing the Wakandans to ambush. Nakia fought the Talokanil, but Namor threw an aircraft onto the ship. When Black Panther got Namor away, Nakia and M'Baku ordered the ship to retreat. However, the Talokanil bombed the bottom of the ship, making it nearly tipped over, sending many Wakandans into the deadly seas below. Nakia used her Circular Vibranium Blades in battle. Finally, Shuri and Namor returned from their own battle, having struck a truce. The fight ended with the Wakandans praising the Black Panther once again.[1]\n\nNakia then returned to Haiti. She and her son joined Shuri on the beach next to her house, and introduced him to her as her and T'Challa's child.\n\nNakia explained to Shuri that she and T'Challa had agreed it was better for him to grow up in Haiti, away from the pressure of being Wakanda's king. She also revealed that he had prepared them for his death, and told them not to come to his funeral. Shuri then asked if her mother had met him before her passing, which Nakia confirmed.[1]\n\nDespite being loyal to Wakanda and has the country's best interests in mind always, Nakia disapproved of Wakanda's secretive, isolationist political policies, seeing it as obstacles holding Wakanda back from making the world a better place, instead of effective and efficient measures of keeping Wakanda safe. Despite her duties as a War Dog being mainly espionage and little else, she consistently gets involved in conflicts for the good of others, adamant to use her abilities to help those in need. Her insistence of not sitting by idly while others are suffering, coupled with her open disapproval of Wakanda's isolationism, results in her constantly being outside of the country helping others when she does not need to. Her stance and her headstrong attitude often have her coming to idealistic clashes with T'Challa, despite both having clear romantic affections for each other.",
