  "content": "Frigga was the Queen of Asgard and wife of Odin, mother of Thor, and adoptive mother of Loki. She attempted to keep the peace between the family even when Loki discovered he was the true son of Laufey and became vengeful towards her and her husband.\n\nWhen Thor brought Jane Foster to Asgard to protect her from the powers of the Aether, Frigga took care of her and defended her against the attacking Dark Elves, even sacrificing her life at the hands of Malekith to ensure her safety. Frigga's death allowed Loki, whom she had always cared for, to reconsider his life choices and join with his brother to avenge her death, although her death was not enough to change Loki's desire to rule.\n\nDuring her youth, Frigga was raised by witches, who taught her magic.[3] When she was older, Frigga met Odin, the king of Asgard. The two fell in love and married, whereupon Frigga became the Queen of Asgard. She later gave birth to her and Odin's son, Thor, who would eventually become the God of Thunder.[4]\n\nFrigga was compassionate and nurturing to her son, Thor, and Loki, the son of Laufey whom Odin had brought with him from Jotunheim after the war with the Frost Giants and whom the couple had adopted. She raised both boys with love and warmth, appearing to be a good and wise queen.[4] Aware that Loki felt overshadowed by his father and brother's physical prowess, Frigga trained him in magic, believing that this would give her adoptive son his own ground to stand on next to his brother.[5] She showed him tricks such as turning a flower into a frog or casting fireworks over the water, telling Loki that he could do these things too one day because he could do anything.[6]\n\nFrigga told Thor and Loki the story of the Dark Elves when they were children.[1] Frigga also joined her family in traveling to Norway on Earth. The Norse, revering them as deities, named days of the week after Thor and Frigga, which became known as Thursday and Friday respectively.[4]\n\nPrior to Thor's coronation to become the new King of Asgard in the wake of Odin's reign, Frigga talked with her son, assuring Thor that it was understandable for him to be nervous.[7] Frigga then participated in the ceremony, standing by Loki as Thor walked through the crowds while showing off Mjølnir and delighting in the crowd's reaction to him as the Warriors Three and Sif enjoyed the display, with Thor even winking at his mother as she tried to get him to calm down.\n\nFrigga watched as Thor stood before all the Asgardians and swore to defend the Nine Realms as the new King of Asgard. However, before Thor could be crowned King, the Frost Giants invaded to steal the Casket of Ancient Winters and return it to Jotunheim, although they failed and were all soon destroyed by the Destroyer; however, the sudden incident forced Odin to delay Thor's coronation, much to their son's frustration as he desired the throne immediately.[4]\n\nSeeking to punish Thor for disturbing the peace of the Nine Realms by attempting to gain revenge against the Frost Giants and attacking their land, Odin stripped Thor of his powers and banished him to Earth. Frigga confronted Odin, angered by his decision, pleading with him to reverse his decision.[7] When Odin collapsed and was brought to his bedchamber, Frigga stayed at his side and refused to leave, afraid that he had put off the Odinsleep for too long and would never awaken.\n\nShe expressed this fear to Loki, who joined her to both comfort her and ask about the truth of his parentage, having learned the truth that he was, in fact, the son of Laufey. In response to Loki's question, Frigga tried to reassure him that he was loved and an integral part of the family. She then emphasized that everything Odin did was for a purpose.[4] As Loki went to leave, the Einherjar entered the room and handed him Gungnir, proclaiming him as King of Asgard.[7]\n\nWhen Laufey and two other Frost Giants invaded Asgard and then attempted to assassinate Odin by charging into his room to kill him, Frigga desperately attempted to defend her husband by drawing a sword. As the Frost Giants froze the door and destroyed it, Frigga charged forward and cut down one of the Frost Giants, killing him before being thrown aside by Laufey, who then moved to Odin to end their long conflict.\n\nHowever, just as Laufey attempted to kill Odin by stabbing him with a frozen knife while he was still in the Odinsleep, he was then knocked backwards as Loki had appeared and then shot Laufey directly in the back with Gungnir. Loki proceeded to destroy Laufey with another shot before he then embraced his mother, who delighted in the fact that Loki had saved Odin, while Loki had vowed that all of the Frost Giants of Jotunheim would soon pay for what they had done.\n\nImmediately after this, however, Thor returned, having regained all his power and Mjølnir, with Frigga running to him, embracing him while Loki was horrified. Thor revealed to Frigga that Loki had deceived her and had just sent the Destroyer to kill him as well as Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. Frigga then witnessed her two sons battle as Loki tried to destroy Jotunheim, resulting in the destruction of the Bifrost Bridge and Loki seemingly dying by falling into a black hole.\n\nDuring a banquet to welcome Thor back to Asgard, she talked with Lady Sif about how Thor was feeling; Lady Sif revealed that Thor mourned for his brother and that he missed the woman he encountered while he was banished on Earth.[4] Unable to accept the death of her son, Frigga used magic to find him. She found him making his deal with Thanos and attempted to talk to him, but he told her it was not a good time.[8] When Thor reached Earth in order to collect Loki, he begged him to come back onto Asgard, since Frigga was in grief. Loki claimed that he did not consider Frigga his mother.[9]\n\nWhen Thor managed to return Loki to Asgard, Frigga was relieved to see him, although his crimes during the Battle of New York were too great to go unpunished. Frigga watched as Loki was brought in chains before Odin and sentenced to life imprisonment. Although Loki was seemingly touched when Odin revealed that he had spared him for Frigga's sake, he was warned that he would never see her again. Despite this, Frigga continued looking after her adoptive son in secret, personally arranging for books and food to be delivered to Loki's cell.\n\nLater, Frigga visited Loki in the Asgardian Dungeons, telling him she had done everything in her power to make him comfortable during his time there, as Loki looked over as more Marauders arrived and were locked in their cells. Loki was bitter towards her, showing little gratitude for the books that she was providing him with, and in turn she reminded him of his crimes on Earth during the Chitauri Invasion, which had resulted in his current imprisonment in the cell.\n\nWhen Frigga called Odin his father during their conversation, Loki turned around in anger and snapped at Frigga that Odin was not his true father. Hearing this, Frigga questioned if he viewed her as his mother, which Loki claimed he did not, something Frigga knew he was actually lying about. A sullen Loki responded by trying to touch her outstretched hand, causing the holographic projection Frigga had used to visit him to dissolve, leaving Loki alone in his cell to continue considering his actions.[1]\n\nJust as Frigga had ended her talk with Loki in his cell, she was then visited by Thor, who had returned from the Battle of Vanaheim and had seen her talking with Loki. Thor questioned why she still had compassion for Loki, telling her that Loki was not the boy she once knew. Frigga reminded him that he was not either, and that she had loved him no less when Odin banished him to Earth. Thor asked her if she wished she had not shared her magic with his adopted brother, but Frigga told him she was still glad she did as she had only done it to help him be different from his own brother and father. Frigga then noted that by Thor's presence in Asgard that the Nine Realms must be at peace, and Thor told her that they were and asked her where he could find Odin. Frigga told him that he would find him inside the Asgardian training grounds where he was most at ease.[5]\n\nFrigga later reunited again with Thor as he was still showing the newly-arrived Jane Foster all around the streets of Asgard and they joked about Odin. Just as Thor was introducing Foster to his mother, however, he overheard the alarms as a riot was breaking out in the Asgardian Dungeons, so Frigga told Thor to investigate while she would protect Foster, as he summoned Mjølnir and charged into battle.\n\nAs they entered the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf, Frigga encountered King Odin leading his Einherjar armies into a battle against the invading forces of the Dark Elves, which were led by Malekith, although he insisted that this was nothing more than a minor skirmish and nothing to be concerned over. Frigga accused Odin to lying about the risks, but he promised to come for them as soon as it was safe, advising Frigga to take Foster into her own chambers for their protection.\n\nFrigga and Odin then teased each other over the fact that Frigga still worried for her husband's safety despite everything Odin had survived, while Lady Sif walked past and made eye contact with Foster. As Odin went into the battle armed with Gungnir, Frigga took Foster with her, taking one of the Einherjar's swords and then advising Foster to do exactly as she told her, believing that Malekith would be coming for the Aether, which was currently trapped inside of Foster's body as Foster quickly agreed to obey her orders.[1]\n\nWhen the Dark Elves assaulted Asgard, Frigga took Jane Foster to her chambers and shut her away. She then created an illusion of Foster. Malekith invaded the palace and stumbled upon Frigga, who had her sword ready to fight. Frigga gave him a chance to surrender, but Malekith refused, stating he had come to claim his prize, the Aether, which was stored within Foster's body.\n\nFrigga responded by viciously attacking Malekith with a sword, soon overwhelming him with her surprising skills with the blade. Disarming the Dark Elf, Frigga held her own sword to Malekith's throat, but before she could force him and his entire army to surrender, she was restrained by Kurse. Malekith then rounded on the illusion of Foster and attempted to reclaim the Aether from her, discovering it was an illusion when he attempted to reach out of her.\n\nMalekith angrily demanded Frigga to tell him where Foster was, but Frigga refused, despite Kurse gripping her by the neck. Malekith recognized that she would not answer and ordered Kurse to kill her. Kurse impaled her from behind with her own sword, only moments before Thor stormed into the room and used Mjølnir to burn half of Malekith's face off. He was too late to save Frigga, however, as the Dark Elves escaped and Odin held his wife's body in his arms.[1]\n\nFrigga received a ceremonial funeral with the rest of the fallen warriors, and all of Asgard paid their respects, placing their bodies on boats that were set adrift and alight. Odin then made her body dissolve into energy that dissipated among the stars, and Frigga's soul ascended to Valhalla, an Asgardian afterlife.[1]\n\nIn 2017, an ailing Odin told Thor and Loki that he could hear Frigga calling out to join him in Valhalla before dying and at last reuniting with her.[10]\n\nFrigga's death was a contributing factor to both Odin's strong desire for revenge at the cost of sacrificing countless Asgardian soldiers so as to destroy Malekith, as well as Thor's decision to liberate both Loki and Jane Foster from incarceration. With the help of the Warriors Three, the three successfully evaded the Einherjar and managed to escape to Svartalfheim, where they encountered Malekith, Kurse, and his Dark Elves once more. While Malekith, who, having extracted the Aether from Foster's body, departed to Earth along with a majority of Dark Elves so he could finally unleash the Aether upon the Nine Realms, Loki finally killed Kurse, despite being supposedly fatally wounded by the Dark Elf. Therefore, Frigga's death was avenged, with Loki even noting that his actions were not for Thor or Odin's sake, but to avenge his deceased mother.[1]\n\nAn alternate Loki discovered Frigga's death on the Time Variance Authority's holoprojector, upsetting him and causing him to want to fight alongside the TVA to keep the universe in balance.[11]\n\nFrigga was a benevolent, kind-hearted, fair and wise person. Frigga was beloved by all her family and all people of Asgard. Frigga loved equally both her biological son Thor and her adoptive son Loki. Even though she was a very wise ruler, her kind heart can occasionally get in the way of certain punishments given to her sons. The prime example of this was when she attempted to convince Odin to end Thor's banishment from Asgard, despite knowing the gravity of Thor's crimes and the war that would ensue because of it. When Odin asked Frigga what she would've done, she states she wouldn't have had the heart to banish Thor. Odin calls her out on this, saying that while he grieves as well, he knew was the necessary action and he is king because he can make these difficult decisions. Frigga similarly continued to show Loki great care and sympathy even after his numerous crimes on Earth and would visit him in his dungeon cell through Magic and give him gifts of books and food to keep him comfortable. Frigga was likely the person closest to Loki as she understood him more clearly than anyone else in his life, directly calling out his nature to lack perceptiveness on his own feelings. Loki genuinely expressed the most care and love for his adoptive mother, as he bears no scorn towards her and displays apparent affection for her. Frigga was first to notice the large shadows Loki's adopted father and adopted brother casted on him, so she decided to share her skills of Magic with him as a hope that she would grant him something unique and special for himself. Frigga trained Loki in magic and encouraged him by telling him that he could do anything, showing just how kind-hearted and considerate she was for her adopted son.\n\nFrigga had a great sense of compassion for all of those around her and was very empathetic and considerate, especially to her sons. Unlike her husband, Frigga was ready to forgive Loki, even after his deeds, and had hope for Thor despite his actions, as well. She also was willing to accept Thor's relationships with Jane Foster. Frigga was highly polite, friendly and sympathetic. She was shown to be good friends with Jane, even though she was only human, and a majority of the other Asgardians disapproved of the relationship. Frigga also showed a great care for her husband, Odin, as she watched over him during his Odinsleep and refused to leave his side. When the Frost Giants came to Asgard and attempted to kill her husband, she defended him by striking an incoming Frost Giant down herself that was approaching his chambers. Frigga also told Odin to take care during the Sacking of Asgard to which Odin teased her by noting that she still expressed care and worry over her husband despite how much he had survived. Frigga's relationship with her biological son Thor was close, as well. Upon meeting a future version of her son, she and wasn't at all fooled by any of Thor's feeble attempts to lie that he was not from the furtuee and accepted him immediately, allowing the opportunity for Thor to be given the necessary words of encouragement and solace to him over all that he has lost. Frigga comforted Thor over his depression and shared a final tender moment with him, expressing the resounding love she had for her son before he departed.\n\nIn contrast to her kind-hearted nature, Frigga was quite brave, strong-willed and noble, since she was brave enough to stand against Malekith, the leader of Dark Elves, by herself. When she is attempted to be warned by a Thor from a future after her death, she refused to hear any warnings about her fate, showing her inherent bravery in accepting such a grim future for herself. She was ready to sacrifice herself for the safety of her family and friends. Her noble sacrifice had great importance, as it allowed Loki to temporarily quell his rivalry with Thor and aid him in seeking revenge on Malekith. Loki was filled with a vengeance and grief over his loss, as seen by the state of his prison room after learning of her death, displaying the impact that Frigga had on him as being a loving caregiver for him, and he achieved vengeance by uniting with his brother, Thor. Frigga's care for her kingdom and people as well as her compassion for her family led her to a noble sacrifice which encouraged and inspired her sons within their love for her and the care she had showed them both to put aside their differences in successfully avenging her death.",
