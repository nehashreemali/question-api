  "content": "F.R.I.D.A.Y. (Female Replacement Intelligent Digital Assistant Youth)[2] is an artificial intelligence created by Tony Stark, designed to work with his Iron Man armor. She served as Stark's main user interface computer system during the final battle between the Avengers and Ultron in Sokovia and to find information about Helmut Zemo. In contrast to J.A.R.V.I.S.' voice, which was patterned after a male English accent, F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s is patterned after a female Irish one.\n\nIn May 2015, after J.A.R.V.I.S.'s matrices were uploaded into Vision, Tony Stark sought to find a replacement A.I. program for his Iron Man suits. Sorting through a pool of back-up programs that included ones named J.O.C.A.S.T.A. and T.A.D.A.S.H.I., he selected F.R.I.D.A.Y. and uploaded her into the Mark XLV armor to assist him during the Battle of Sokovia.\n\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. monitored Ultron's attempts to escape into the internet when Vision attacked him; her mission was to track his attempts and ensure he did not succeed. Stark did not understand what was happening when Ultron activated his device to launch Novi Grad into the sky; he consulted F.R.I.D.A.Y. who quipped that Sokovia was going \"for a ride\". F.R.I.D.A.Y. helped Stark rescue a family trapped in a collapsing building.\n\nAfterwards, she warned Stark that the Avengers could not afford to allow either the main Ultron or Ultron Sentries to touch the device that had raised Novi Grad, as this would cause the device to enter full reverse, ultimately destroying all life on Earth. Stark suggested capping the vibranium with Thor, but F.R.I.D.A.Y. warned that this action could vaporize the city and everyone on it. Ultimately, Stark came up with a plan to create a heat seal so the rock would explode harmlessly, but this would only be an option following a total evacuation of Novi Grad.[3]\n\nIn June 2016, when there was a blackout in the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre, Stark asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to give him the source of the damage. Later, Stark used F.R.I.D.A.Y. to assist him at the Leipzig-Halle Airport. When Wanda Maximoff buried Stark under cars, F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed him that multiple contusions were detected, to which Stark replied that he detected them too.\n\nAs Stark shot the repulsor blasts at Clint Barton, it suddenly deactivated and F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed him that many weapons system were offline. After F.R.I.D.A.Y. found out that Ant-Man was inside the Mark XLVI, she ejected him with the suit's extinguishing foam. When War Machine crashed on the ground, Stark asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to read his vitals. She found that Rhodes had a heartbeat and informed Stark that emergency medical was on its way.\n\nAs Stark was in his helicopter on his way to the Raft, F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed him that Berlin police had found the psychiatrist who had been hired by the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre as soon as Bucky Barnes had been captured and he met someone in the airport. Stark asked if she scanned his face, so F.R.I.D.A.Y. asked what she looked like, to which Stark answered he had always imagined her as a redhead. F.R.I.D.A.Y said he must confusing her with someone else and continued. She said Broussard met Helmut Zemo, who had run EKO Scorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad. Broussard was found dead in a hotel room in Berlin. The police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of Barnes. Stark then asked her to deliver the information to Thaddeus Ross.[4]\n\nA few hours later at the Hydra Siberian Facility, Iron Man learned that Winter Soldier had killed his parents. As he tried to kill him, Captain America fought Iron Man to stop him. Iron Man tried to kill Winter Soldier with a missile, but F.R.I.D.A.Y. said the targeting system was inaccurate, so Iron Man shot the missile to the entrance's axis without his helmet. As Iron Man and Captain America dueled, the latter pushed Iron Man to the wall and hit him hard several times. F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed Iron Man that he could not beat the super soldier in hand-to-hand combat, so Iron Man asked her to analyze his fighting pattern. F.R.I.D.A.Y. predicted where Captain America would hit next, allowing Iron Man to counter the blow.[4]\n\nTwo months later, F.R.I.D.A.Y. told Peter Parker from the Mark XLVII suit that Stark had ended the phone call, before the Mark XLVII suit flew away.[5]\n\nIn the R&D lab of the Avengers Compound, F.R.I.D.A.Y. aided Stark in running battle tests on his new Mark L suit, testing out the unit's response time to defend him against sudden attacks ranging from physical blows to energy blasts. The tests were interrupted when she informed Stark that Maria Hill was there to see him.[6]\n\nIn May 2018, when a Q-Ship containing Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian arrived in New York City, Stark, unaware of the situation, asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. what was happening. She responded that she was working on finding out and was asked to give guidance to the NYPD. As Stark followed the Q-Ship in order to rescue Doctor Strange and Peter Parker, he asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to provide him with a boost. She answered by uniting the propulsors in the Iron Man suit, allowing Stark to gain considerable altitude.\n\nWhen the Q-Ship almost exited the atmosphere, Stark told F.R.I.D.A.Y. to send the Iron Spider Armor to catch Parker. After the suit successfully attached to Parker, Stark told F.R.I.D.A.Y. to send Parker back home, and she responded by activating the parachute of the Iron Spider Suit.\n\nOnce inside the Q-Ship, Stark was contacted by a panicked Pepper Potts, but quickly lost connection with both her and F.R.I.D.A.Y. as he went out of Earth's atmosphere, thus making F.R.I.D.A.Y. unable to assist him further.[7]\n\nIn October 2023, Stark was working in his house when he asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to help him experiment with figuring out how to operate quantum time travel mechanics. After Stark had figured out that he had discovered the Time-Space GPS, he was astounded.[8]\n\nAfter Stark, Bruce Banner, and Rocket had constructed a Nano Gauntlet, they met with the other Avengers and prepared to enact the Blip. As Banner put on the Gauntlet, Stark asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to put the Avengers Compound under lockdown by activating Barn Door Protocol.[8]\n\nFollowing the attack on the Avengers Compound, Tony Stark joined Steve Rogers and Thor to confront an alternate Thanos and battle him. However, Thanos grabbed Stark and lifted him up as a shield, using him to block Mjølnir after it was thrown at him. The impact of Mjølnir caused Stark to be blasted to the ground and knocked out. F.R.I.D.A.Y. immediately told Stark to get up, while checking on his vitals.[8]\n\nDuring the battle, Stark noticed that the Sanctuary II's missiles were being launched into the sky, prompting him to ask F.R.I.D.A.Y. what was beyond them. She then told him that something had entered the upper atmosphere.\n\nAfter Stark had used the Infinity Stones to defeat Thanos and his army, he was gravely injured by the Stones' radiation. Pepper Potts came to Stark's side and asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. for a scan of Stark's body and F.R.I.D.A.Y. replied that Stark was in critical life condition.[8]",
