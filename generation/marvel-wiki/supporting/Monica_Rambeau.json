  "content": "Captain Monica Rambeau, Ph.D. is the daughter of Maria Rambeau. During her childhood, she befriended Carol Danvers, a friend of her mother, and refused to believe the reports that Danvers had died in a mysterious plane crash. Rambeau was amazed and happy when Danvers returned six years later with considerable abilities and convinced her own mother to join Danvers in a mission to help Talos to save Skrull refugees from Kree forces. Before the mission, Rambeau helped Danvers to choose the colors of her outfit which she would later on use as Captain Marvel.\n\nAfter Danvers returned to space, Maria founded S.W.O.R.D. on Earth. Rambeau eventually followed in her mother's footsteps by joining S.W.O.R.D. in her adult life. In 2018, Monica was killed in the Snap while accompanying her mother for cancer treatments. She returned to life five years later but discovered her mother had passed due to complications from cancer. While recovering from the sudden loss, Monica was dragged into a supernatural crisis in the town of Westview, where she was instrumental in saving the townsfolk from the Hex forged by Wanda Maximoff. Crossing the Hex's barrier multiple times caused Rambeau's cells to be rewritten, resulting in her developing superhuman abilities. When the Westview Anomaly was resolved, Rambeau was recruited by a Skrull who informed her that Nick Fury wanted her to join S.A.B.E.R.\n\nThree years later, Rambeau was tasked with investigating the Universal Neural Teleportation Network. This led to Rambeau having her light-based powers become entangled with those of Danvers and teenage superhero Kamala Khan, which resulted in them swapping places anytime they used their powers at the same time. Forming the Marvels, the trio fought against the Kree Accuser Dar-Benn, who had been using the power of the Quantum Bands to create jump points to steal other planets' resources to repair her own, destabilizing the universe as a result. Dar-Benn then tore open a rift in the Multiverse, prompting Rambeau to cross over to the other side in order to close it. Now stranded in an alternate universe, she was saved by a Variant of her mother named Binary, who brought her to the X-Mansion in order to be studied by Beast.\n\nRambeau was born in 1983 as the daughter of Maria Rambeau. She came to consider her mother's friend, Carol Danvers, as her own family since Danvers did not get along with her parents and spent a lot of time with the Rambeaus. Rambeau and Danvers were very close to the point that Rambeau called Danvers \"Auntie Carol,\" while Danvers nicknamed her \"Lieutenant Trouble.\"[3] Additionally, when Rambeau was a baby, Danvers changed her diaper, only to throw up. She also one time went into the parked plane with her as the two played.[8] Danvers would stargaze with Rambeau at night in her backyard, telling her stories of the constellations. Over time, Rambeau collected various objects of Danvers' life, including photographs of different moments in Danvers' past.\n\nIn 1989, Rambeau was very saddened when she learned that Danvers had disappeared in a mysterious plane crash. However, she refused to believe that Danvers had died and remained convinced for years that her friend had somehow survived the crash and would return soon. Rambeau preciously kept all the memorabilia of Danvers' life, including her leather jacket, although she was forbidden to wear it after spilling ketchup on it.[3]\n\nIn June 1995, while hanging out in a plane owned by Maria Rambeau, Rambeau saw a woman approaching and immediately identified her as Carol Danvers. Overjoyed to see that her friend had indeed survived the crash, Rambeau rushed to Danvers, only to figure out that Danvers did not recognize her. Rambeau was even more surprised when Danvers told her and Maria her story involving extraterrestrial shapeshifters, but she was amazed when Danvers demonstrated her powers by boiling water by mere contact with a kettle.[3]\n\nWhile Maria and Danvers talked to each other, Rambeau met Goose, a Flerken who had been traveling with her and Nick Fury. Rambeau pet Goose, who purred in response. Monica brought Goose lots of things, including a television, a bowling ball, a radio, a mailbox, a plane rotor, a chair, a sandwich, a rubber duck, a desk, a lamp, and an ironing board. Goose then ate all of the objects with her alien tentacles, making Rambeau cheer.[9]\n\nIn an attempt to bring back Carol Danvers' memories, Rambeau, helped by Nick Fury, went in her bedroom to pick up all the objects connected to Danvers she had kept. She then detailed several of them to Danvers, hoping that something would match in Danvers' mind. Having forgotten the leather jacket, she briefly left to get it, and on her way back was approached by her mother. Rambeau then returned into the house, only to find her mother already there with Talos, as Rambeau had actually encountered Norex, disguised as her mother.\n\nRambeau was ordered by her mother to wait outside when Danvers, Maria, Fury, and Talos listened to the black box recordings of Danvers' plane crash. Later, as Danvers planned on getting into space and asked Maria to be her co-pilot, Rambeau insisted that her mother should go, arguing that working with dangerous technology was what Maria used to do. Rambeau jokingly concluded on the example Maria would give to her daughter, which convinced Maria to join in the mission, much to Danvers' delight.\n\nAs they prepared for the mission, during which Rambeau would remain with her grandparents, Rambeau was approached by Danvers, who praised her determination and asked her to choose the new colors of her Starforce Uniform. In the end, the colors were based on the United States Air Force T-shirt Rambeau was wearing, giving the uniform the red, blue and yellow colors Danvers would later permanently use.[3]\n\nRambeau was reunited with her mother Maria and Carol Danvers as they successfully returned from their mission against the Kree Starforce. During the following dinner, Rambeau played Uno with G'iah, and then suggested that the Skrulls could remain with them.\n\nHowever, she was told that it would not be safe, and that Danvers would find a new home for them. Rambeau then claimed that she could meet with Danvers in space, and when Nick Fury remarked that she would have to gain superpowers, she quickly retorted that she might be able to build a spaceship someday. Upon Danvers' departure, Rambeau shared a loving farewell hug with her friend before watching her taking off in complete amazement.[3]\n\nRambeau continued her life in Louisiana while her mother, Maria Rambeau, founded S.W.O.R.D.. Monica attended Rice University and graduated with a doctorate in Physics and Astronomy.[8] Monica then became a S.W.O.R.D. agent, working directly under her mother.[7] In S.W.O.R.D., she underwent astronaut training and made local headlines, getting interviewed for the newspaper. In the interview, Monica cited Carol Danvers as inspiration for her space travel. At the end of the same year she finished her training, Monica went on her first mission to space.[8] Eventually, Maria was diagnosed with cancer. In May 2018, Rambeau accompanied her mother to the hospital Parkside, where she underwent surgery. On the day her mother was scheduled to be released, Rambeau sat by her mother's hospital bed and fell asleep, thinking back on memories with her from 1995. Rambeau then died in her sleep as the Snap occurred, unaware of what had transpired.[7]\n\nFive years later, in 2023, Rambeau was resurrected in the Blip, and woke up believing she had been asleep for twenty minutes. However, she was taken aback when she saw that her mother was not in her bed. Rambeau left the hospital room to find other civilians being resurrected, and Parkside's capacity doubling. Rambeau frantically rushed to find a nurse for her mother's whereabouts, but all the staff were overwhelmed with the return of the Snap victims.\n\nEventually, Rambeau found Doctor Highland, who survived the Snap and was still working at Parkside. When asked about her mother, Doctor Highland explained to Rambeau that Maria had passed away in 2020 from cancer complications after it came back, two years after Rambeau died in the Snap. Initially confused, Rambeau had little time to grasp and comprehend this information, as she realized that she herself had been dead for five years.[7]\n\nTwo weeks following the Blip, Rambeau returned to the S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters and met Tyler Hayward, who had taken on the role of director of S.W.O.R.D., in the wake of her mother's death. Rambeau was told by Hayward that the Earth and S.W.O.R.D. had been different since Rambeau's temporary death, due to the Snap.[7] Rambeau also began to distrust Carol Danvers as she started getting mad that Danvers never visited them despite her promise back in 1995.[8]\n\nHaving been grounded at S.W.O.R.D., Rambeau was sent on a missing persons case by Tyler Hayward. Once she arrived at Westview, Rambeau met FBI agent Jimmy Woo, who approached her and explained the situation. He exclaimed that according to the Eastview Sheriff's Office, the place had never actually existed. Rambeau walked up to the two cops sitting next to a Welcome to Westview sign and, when she asked the cops about Westview, Sheriff Miller exclaimed that it never existed, despite the fact that they were from Eastview. Rambeau and Woo then walked over to the energy field to check out, as Rambeau then touched the field and was sucked into a strange reality.[4]\n\nOnce she was trapped inside the Westview Anomaly, Rambeau, having been mind-controlled by Wanda Maximoff, took on the identity of a woman named Geraldine. While a group of women of Westview attended a meeting for the small-town talent show, Geraldine and Maximoff began to get closer, although heavily annoying Dottie Jones.[4]\n\nLater on, Geraldine hosted the talent show and got caught up by the consequences of Vision's gum problem, as Vision forgot to put Maximoff inside of the Cabinet of Mysteries. As a result, Maximoff, desperate for the town's approval, teleported Geraldine inside the cabinet. After that last act, Maximoff fixed Vision, and attempted leaving without noticing. However, Dottie Jones surprisingly gave them the award and, while she was receiving this, Geraldine asked Vision how he managed to get her inside the cabinet, to which he claimed that a magician never revealed his secrets. Vision left that to his assistant to which Maximoff replied that she would not be talking.[4]\n\nWhen Wanda Maximoff started having contractions due to her pregnancy, she inadvertently altered reality. As a result, Geraldine went to the Vision Residence to borrow a bucket because all of the pipes in her ceiling burst.\n\nUnaware of what was going on in Maximoff's home, Geraldine began to tell a story about work. Geraldine eventually headed into the nursery. There she noticed the crib and discovered that Maximoff was pregnant, exactly at the moment that Maximoff started going into labor. Geraldine attempted to get Maximoff ready to give birth and then noticed things around the home going haywire once again, but said to herself that she was sure there is a perfectly logical explanation for all of this. Eventually, Geraldine delivered Maximoff's baby boy and handed him over to Maximoff.[10]\n\nBack inside, Wanda Maximoff revealed to Geraldine that she herself is a twin. She appears overcome with emotion as she brings up Pietro Maximoff. before singing to her newborn babies a Sokovian lullaby. Geraldine was confused and reminded Maximoff that Pietro was killed by Ultron during the Battle of Sokovia. This made Maximoff quickly grow angry and confrontational, as Maximoff asked Geraldine to repeat what she said. Geraldine offered to take a shift rocking the babies, but Maximoff instead asked her to leave, as she noticed a strange necklace Geraldine was wearing. Maximoff once again questioned Geraldine about the symbol on her necklace and asked who she really was. Geraldine became visibly flustered and could not answer any of Maximoff's questions.\n\nSecretly, Maximoff had then used her powers to eject Rambeau out of Westview through her unbridled fury. Rambeau was thrown out through an invisible barrier protected by towering pylons shielding Westview from the rest of the world, hurling through the air and landing in a field outside the S.W.O.R.D. Response Base. As she drifted in and out of consciousness after being blasted outside, several S.W.O.R.D. SUVs and trucks with armed soldiers, and a helicopter, arrived and tended to her. She then told the S.W.O.R.D agents that Maximoff was the one who created the barrier.[7]\n\nThe next day, Rambeau was questioned about her experience inside the Hex. She explained feeling pain, loss, and grief, as well as hearing Maximoff in her head. Jimmy Woo and Darcy Lewis accompanied Rambeau to a briefing after Lewis noticed her scans were blank.\n\nAt the briefing, Tyler Hayward identified Maximoff as the \"principal victimizer\" and Woo explained her history, as well as defending her against Hayward. Rambeau also defended Maximoff, saying she only survived her experience in the Hex because Maximoff protected her. To make Maximoff seem more dangerous, Hayward showed everyone in the room footage he claimed was of Maximoff stealing the corpse of Vision, which went against both the Sokovia Accords and the Vision's will, claiming she disobeyed his wishes to not be a weapon. In reality, the footage was of Hayward showing Maximoff the body of Vision, and her shattering glass to \"feel\" him.\n\nRambeau, in an attempt to re-enter Westview, enlisted the help of Major Aly Goodner. Rambeau then explained to Woo that Billy and Tommy were Maximoff's children and that everything that's been happening inside the Hex was real. Woo and Lewis remained initially skeptical of Maximoff having such abilities, but Rambeau pointed out that Maximoff almost took Thanos out on her own. Woo replied that Captain Marvel almost did the same. This, along with Lewis asking if Captain Marvel received her powers from an Infinity Stone, led Rambeau to change the topic and refocused on Maximoff.\n\nRambeau found her 70’s-style attire, which she assured to Woo and Lewis was real. She grabbed Woo's gun and shot the outfit, but it remained unscathed. Rambeau then realized the clothes were 87% Kevlar, similar to her bulletproof vest, which proved that Maximoff was rewriting reality. Rambeau wondered what would happen if they sent something from that time period into the Hex.\n\nS.W.O.R.D. then sent a 90-era drone into the Hex, with Rambeau operating the controls. Rambeau attempted to speak to Maximoff, but she was unable to. Hayward then ordered another S.W.O.R.D. agent to fire a missile at Maximoff, much to the dismay and shock of Rambeau. However, the signal was lost, and Rambeau expressed her outrage at Hayward for his actions.[11]\n\nOnce an alarm began to sound to signal another breach at the edge of the Westview Anomaly, Rambeau joined the rest of the S.W.O.R.D. agents, as they rushed to the border of the Hex. There, Rambeau witnessed Wanda Maximoff emerging from the Hex, dragging their destroyed S.W.O.R.D. Drone with her. Maximoff warned S.W.O.R.D. to stay out of her home, before Rambeau implores Maximoff to trust her, and that she knew she was an ally. Maximoff claimed that she had what she wanted, and that nobody could take it from her again. She then used her powers to have the soldiers turn their guns on Tyler Hayward, before she turned around and re-entered the Hex, turning it red and fortifying the Hex.[11]\n\nAfter S.W.O.R.D. returned to the base, Rambeau confronted Tyler Hayward for antagonizing Maximoff, while Darcy Lewis, teased Hayward for nearly getting killed by his own men. Hayward remained convinced that taking out Maximoff was their only option, but Rambeau told him that that would only end in disaster for them, as Maximoff was more powerful. Hayward, claiming Rambeau was incapable of being objective, ordered her, Jimmy Woo, and Lewis off the base. However, Rambeau and Woo overpowered the S.W.O.R.D. agents, and snuck back onto the base.\n\nRambeau informed Woo and Lewis that her contact would be arriving with her method of re-entering the Hex in the next hour. In response, Lewis attempted to dissuade her, revealing that her exposure in the Hex has rewritten her cell DNA, but Rambeau remained determined to help Maximoff. Woo accompanied Rambeau, while Lewis stayed behind to breach Hayward’s remaining firewalls.\n\nAfter Maximoff expanded the Hex, Rambeau and Woo witnessed it from their Jeep, but had already left in time to escape the expansion from reaching them.[12]\n\nRambeau and Jimmy Woo retrieved the email that Darcy Lewis sent them about Project Cataract, learning that Tyler Hayward was unsuccessful at attempting to bring Vision back online. Rambeau and Woo then met up with Major Aly Goodner, who had delivered an armored S.W.O.R.D. Space Rover, theorized to be able to safely penetrate through the Hex.\n\nRambeau prepared to re-enter Westview. However, the rover collided with the barrier. This led Rambeau and Goodner to discover that the barrier's density matched that of the rover and altered it into a truck. Due to this Rambeau was forced to eject from the vehicle. Despite protests from Woo, she decided to breach the barrier herself.\n\nRambeau then began pushing through, but found herself being overwhelmed by the intense power of the Hex, which started to pull her apart. However, Rambeau managed to pull herself together, reflecting on her journey up until this point, in particular her relationship with her mother, and was able to push through the resistance and break through to the other side. Having gone through the Hex a third time, Rambeau's DNA was altered and she gained powers, such as spectral vision.[13]\n\nRambeau then barged into the Vision Residence, attempting to warn Wanda Maximoff about Tyler Hayward's agenda. However, Maximoff angrily pushed Rambeau out of the house, and into the street, gaining the attention of all of Maximoff's neighbors. Maximoff accused Rambeau of lying about everything. Rambeau informed Maximoff that Hayward would destroy Westview to eliminate her, and attempted to get her to let go of her past, referencing how she lost her mother. However, before Rambeau could convince Maximoff that she was telling the truth, Agnes O'Connor intervened and carried Maximoff away to her house, claiming Rambeau had overstayed her welcome.\n\nRambeau snooped around the outside of Agnes O'Connor's House, and found an entrance into the basement lair, only to be confronted by \"Pietro Maximoff\", who proceeded to capture Rambeau.[13]\n\nInside Agatha Harkness' home, Rambeau was left trapped by \"Pietro Maximoff\", who refused to let her leave. She found a document regarding the property, revealing that Harkness did not own the house, but rather \"Pietro\", whose real name is Ralph Bohner. Rambeau found an Enchanted Necklace on Bohner. Once Rambeau removed it, Bohner was freed from his enthrallment, and Rambeau escaped.\n\nWhen Tyler Hayward attempted to shoot Billy and Tommy Maximoff, Rambeau rushed in and used her body to shield the twins, but missed one. However, it was stopped by Billy's telekinesis. Hayward attempted to use his Humvee to ram the three, but was stopped by a food truck driven by Darcy Lewis.\n\nOnce she had subdued Harkness, and erased the Hex, Vision, and her children, Wanda Maximoff returned to the scene of the battle, where she met Rambeau. She apologized to her for everything she had done, but Rambeau admitted she would have done the same to bring back Maria Rambeau. When the authorities arrived, Rambeau watched Maximoff fly away.[14]\n\nRambeau then reunited with Jimmy Woo, in charge of the FBI's Westview Investigation, as Tyler Hayward was escorted away in handcuffs. She was then called into the local theatre by an FBI agent, who revealed herself to be a Skrull sent by Nick Fury, regarding an intergalactic mission. She was then recruited to S.A.B.E.R..[14]\n\nIn late 2026, due to a surge in the Universal Neural Teleportation Network, Rambeau, Dag and Talia were sent out in suits to survey the S.A.B.E.R. Space Station. By phasing her hand through her suit, Rambeau was able to seal up parts of the station with her powers. Rambeau then remarked if they could finish fixing it by dinner, but Talia wanted it fixed by the time they needed to read another jump point. Dag and Talia then noted they knew someone with powers that could get a reading on the jump point herself.\n\nRambeau obliged and untethered herself to drift over to the malfunctioning jump point. This prompted Nick Fury to ask what she was doing. Rambeau concluded that there seemed to be a residual effect on the jump point. She said she was going to get some readings, only for Fury to come up as static on the other end of the call. As Rambeau got close, her radio caught signal to Captain Marvel on MB-418. This overwhelmed Rambeau, as she was not ready to talk to Danvers yet.\n\nRambeau then got close to the jump point and noticed the energy surging from it. She then stuck out her hand towards it in marvel. Suddenly, Rambeau was transported to Danvers' location on MB-418. Rambeau hit the surface of the planet very hard and groaned. She looked up to see many Kree ready to surround her. Before anything else could happen, Rambeau was transported back to the space station.[8]\n\nRambeau talked with Nick Fury on board S.A.B.E.R. Space Station and looked over Ms. Marvel's file as that was someone she had switched with according to Fury. Rambeau remarked how there was nothing in her skill set about teleportation. Fury said enough about her and he wanted to know what happened to Rambeau on MB-418. They walked into the S.A.B.E.R. Space Elevator to pay Khan a visit while Rambeau explained that she was unsure what happened.\n\nOn the way down, Rambeau was suddenly teleported again, only to be immediately teleported to an Accuser Warship. Rambeau immediately saw a Kree soldier in front of her and went intangible to absorb the bullet. She then dodged a Kree staff and did a spin to fight off the others. While fighting, she was transported to the space elevator before being transported to the Khan Residence. She found herself fighting more Kree and dodged their attacks.\n\nShe dodged another one, forcing their staff into the wall. The staff then dragged across the wall as Rambeau moved away. She dodged another attack against the window, breaking it. She found herself fighting two Kree, backing her onto a table where she went intangible to not get hurt. This forced the staff right through her chest. She then powered up her fist and punched a Kree, sending her into a chair. The chair was promptly eaten by Goose.\n\nRambeau fought another Kree until she noticed the Khans about to be killed. To break free, she redirected energy from the staff to a punch on the soldier. She then flew through the soldier and punched him on the other side, forcing her to be transported again. This sent her to the space elevator where she started telling Fury what was happening. However, she saw Fury fighting a Kree and went to help. She stated how she switched when she used her powers. Fury killed the Kree before sarcastically telling her it was a strong theory.[8]\n\nRambeau and Nick Fury finally got to the Khan Residence and knocked on the door to see Yusuf Khan answer it. They were let in as Fury got S.A.B.E.R. agents to clean up the two apprehended Kree. Rambeau then started looking at Ms. Marvel's file again only for Ms. Marvel to talk to her about it and see the tablet for herself. Khan looked at it and asked Rambeau what S.A.B.E.R. meant. Rambeau told her, much to the annoyance of Fury.\n\nRambeau then talked about how Khan, her and \"Aunt Carol\" had light based powers. She then stopped herself, changing her wording to \"Captain Marvel\". This caught the attention of Khan, but Rambeau ignored her question towards saying \"aunt.\" Rambeau then remarked at how Ms. Marvel was able to turn light into physical matter, prompting Ms. Marvel to show her. Despite Rambeau saying not to, Khan used her powers, causing her to switch places with Captain Marvel.\n\nAlthough originally annoyed, Danvers looked up, delighted to see Rambeau. Danvers called her \"Lieutenant Trouble,\" unknowing that Rambeau was mad at her. Rambeau corrected Danvers, saying it was Captain Rambeau. Rambeau then pretty much ignored Danvers' attempts to make conversation and started talking about how their powers have caused them to temporarily get intangled. Danvers then asked when she got powers. Rambeau explained, prompting Muneeba Khan to sarcastically say she was very happy for her, then switch her tone to ask where Kamala was.\n\nRambeau explained that Kamala was wherever Danvers was. This worried Danvers who tried to use her powers to get Kamala back, to no avail. Danvers then started flying to her destination, causing Kamala to switch with her in midair. Rambeau and the others on the ground watched as Kamala fell uncontrollably to the surface. Fury tried to get Rambeau to fly up, which she did. When Rambeau got to Kamala, she realized she could not grab her as the intangibility allowed her to fly. Therefore, Kamala shielded them with Noor, swapping their places with Danvers. The two then found themselevs on the Accuser Warship, forcing them to surrender.[8]\n\nWith her hands up in the air, Rambeau watched as Ty-Rone talked to Dar-Benn. She then focused her attention on the Quantum Band, which Dar-Benn put on. Dar-Benn then went to go kill Rambeau and Ms. Marvel, only for the shot to be blocked by Captain Marvel, who had just arrived.\n\nRambeau fought some Kree, allowing Dar-Benn to jump down to the surface of Tarnax IV. Rambeau and Danvers flew down to stop her. On the surface, they watched as Dar-Benn hit her Universal Weapon against the Quantum Band, causing a jump point to open and further cause imminent danger to Tarnax. Rambeau helped get many of the Skrull population onto the Hoopty to save them, but they could not save everyone, saddening Ms. Marvel.[8]\n\nOn the Hoopty in space, Rambeau watched as King Valkyrie arrived to take the remaining Skrulls. Rambeau then went to the lower level of the ship and found Carol Danvers tinkering with a part. Rambeau asked if she needed a hand. Danvers told her yes, so Rambeau simply used her powers to fix it, making Danvers surprised she got it by walking through a witch hex.\n\nRambeau then could not hold in her annoyance anymore, pointing out that Danvers said she would come back. Danvers tried to explain she had no idea what she was in for and was not sure how to explain to a little girl that. Rambeau pointed out she was a little girl who hung on her every word. Danvers said there were people that needed her. However, Rambeau rebuttaled, saying that she needed her. Back upstairs, Rambeau fidgeted with the table as Danvers talked about the situation not being ideal, but she was happy they were there.\n\nRambeau then started to make a plan, which caused Danvers to point out it was her team. This caused a minor argument until Kamala Khan got hooked on the fact that they called them a team, which both Danvers and Rambeau denied. Khan then tried to give Rambeau the codename of Professor Marvel, which she did not like. Khan also named their team the Marvels. Khan then shifted her topic to the Quantum Bands, explaining that she had one. Danvers talked about the ancient stories of the bands, which had Rambeau confused at the coincidence of Khan and Dar-Benn just bumping into each other randomly.\n\nRambeau then realized that the bands were connected, which explained the intertanglement of the Marvels. Rambeau also concluded that Dar-Benn was overloading the power in the single band using the Universal Weapon, which is causing instability in the Universal Neural Teleportation Network, so they ahd to stop her before she both got the second one and kept using the band. Khan then mentioned seeing a map but unable to recall the locations. Therefore, Danvers gave them Fracking Pods to reaccess the memories, which saddened Rambeau to know that Danvers still had memory troubles with what the Kree did to her.\n\nWhile using the fracking pods, Danvers started accessing Rambeau's memories without thinking of it. They also saw a conversation with Danvers and Maria Rambeau before her death, which made Monica upset enough to disconnect herself from the pods. Once out, Ms. Marvel hugged Rambeau and Danvers followed suit, apologizing for what she did.\n\nThe Marvels then talked about the jump points and figured Dar-Benn could be going to planets that Kree used to inhabit like Tarnax IV. Khan pointed out the flaw in that thinking, making Rambeau realize she was siphoning resources. Danvers confirmed this, saying Hala was rid of their resources in the Kree Civil War. Therefore, next would be water likely. Danvers noted that she would go after Aladna, which was 99.63% water. Both Khan and Rambeau remarked at the specificity of Danvers' fact, but Danvers brushed this off, not explaining.\n\nDanvers then put on music while Khan tried to give Rambeau various codenames, all shut down by Rambeau. They then started to practice their entanglement as if they needed to be successful, they had to work together. They did various exercises to both study the mechanics and practice it. These involved throwing balls, balancing and even jumping rope.[8]\n\nArriving in Aladna, Captain Marvel gave Kamala Khan and Rambeau comms, which excited Khan to the point where she loudly talked into the comms, prompting Rambeau to say they could hear her. Danvers then warned the group that she was famous on Aladna by helping the prince with a legal issue but refused to go into detail.\n\nNow on the surface, the Marvels were greeted by singing Aladneans as Danvers explained their language was song. The Aladneans then sang that their princess was home, causing Rambeau to realize Danvers was married to the prince. The Marvels then followed the dancing civilians to the banquet. On the elevator, Rambeau remarked to give her what they were having. Rambeau then teased Danvers for being a princess, but Danvers explained it was a diplomatic act.\n\nThey then walked into the banquet where Rambeau applauded the party. They then watched as a man announced their arrival, telling Rambeau she could be more cheerful. He then called them the Marvels, exciting Khan, but confusing rambeau on how the name was already a thing. Rambeau then watched as Prince Yan arrived. She got confused at seeing Danvers' clothes turn into an elegant dress. As Danvers and Yan danced, Rambeau asked Khan how many fanfiction stories this was fulfilling. Danvers then stopped singing and told Yan they needed help. Rambeau got confused on how he understood her, but Danvers explained he was bilingual.[8]\n\nYan then agreed to fit the Marvels with new uniforms. While Ms. Marvel was fitted for her's, Rambeau called Talia and asked about the status of the Universal Neural Teleportation Network. Rambeau suggested that the negative matter was bombarded with photokenetic energy. She asked for Talia to run a simulation to make sure she was right in her hypothesis. Not only was she right, but they found that hitting a point with the same amount of energy would close it. Talia then cut out due to poor service.[15]\n\nThe Marvels were fitted in new suits as Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel spit out more codenames for Rambeau, who ignored them. Rambeau then ripped off a drape from her uniform as she did not like it. As Dar-Benn arrived, the Marvels stayed back for Yan to hopefully handle the situation.\n\nRambeau watched as Dar-Benn went to use her Universal Weapon to attack the Aladnean Armed Forces. Therefore, Rambeau ran in front and absorbed the blast, redirecting it back at Dar-Benn. As the armed forces started fighting the Accusers and soldiers, Rambeau used her intangibility to run through the fight and towards Dar-Benn. Rambeau missed a punch, then dodged Dar-Benn's, shooting a blast at the enemy. Dar-Benn absorbed this blast with the Quantum Band. Danvers then arrived to double team, only to accidentally switch spots with Rambeau.\n\nRambeau blasted Dar-Benn away, only for Dar-Benn to grab her weapon and cause a shockwave that sent both Danvers and Rambeau flying. Rambeau recovered and flew through Aladna until she saw Dar-Benn on a ship. Rambeau then tackled Dar-Benn right before she used the bangle. Rambeau then flew through Dar-Benn and grabbed the bangle, but was countered by Dar-Benn's hammer. Rambeau then made contact with the bangle, sending both parties flying back.\n\nAs Dar-Benn charged at Rambeau, the latter purposefully switched with Danvers for her to handle it. As Dar-Benn and Danvers struggled against each other, Rambeau flew back in and tackled Dar-Benn. The two then charged at Dar-Benn together. While fighting, Ms. Marvel accidentally switched with Danvers, causing Dar-Benn to see that Khan had the other bangle. Rambeau the told Khan to run. As she did so, Danvers flew in, causing a shockwave that launched Rambeau backwards.\n\nDar-Benn soon defeated Danvers and went to use the bangle as Rambeau charged at her. Rambeau was too late as the Universal Neural Teleportation Network started siphoning the water from Aladna to Hala. Additionally, the shockwave flew Rambeau backwards off of the ship. Therefore, Rambeau returned to the Hoopty. Rambeau tried to drive the ship, but had trouble, especially flying it through debris. Danvers then arrived and tried to still fight Dar-Benn. However, Khan made a call and teleported them.[8]\n\nThe Marvels crash landed on a deserted planet and walked out of the Hoopty while Carol Danvers and Kamala Khan argued about the decision to jump. Danvers told them they did not understand that this was all her fault. Danvers then confessed that she was the one who caused this problem for Hala, unintentionally. Danvers' voice broke as she told Rambeau that she did not want her to see that version of her.\n\nRambeau asked if that was why she never came back. Danvers continued, saying that she thought that if she could fix it, she could come home. Rambeau told Danvers that she never expected her to be \"The Mighty Captain Marvel\" she expected her to be her aunt. Danvers told Rambeau she was really glad she was there. Suddenly, a jump point opened above them. Rambeau remarked that Dar-Benn could be anywhere. However, Danvers said she was targeting people she cared about, so Earth was next.\n\nThe Marvels arrived at the S.A.B.E.R. Space Station to reunite with Nick Fury, only to see many Flerken kittens running around. Rambeau did not even want to process what was happening and just told Carol Danvers to handle it. Rambeau then went to the computers and did research, figuring out that Dar-Benn wanted the Earth's Sun next.[8]\n\nThe Marvels then flew to the Accuser Warship where Rambeau went invisible to allow Captain Marvel time to talk with Dar-Benn. Rambeau then revealed herself and switched with Ms. Marvel in order to get her on the fight level. Rambeau then came up through the floor to join the fight.\n\nThe Marvels then fought Dar-Benn, switching their locations strategically. However, at one point Rambeau used her powers only for it to be redirected by Dar-Benn. Dar-Benn then picked up Rambeau by the throat and threw her down. Rambeau made herself intangible to go through the floor. Rambeau then returned and caught the Universal Weapon that Danvers threw at her, using it to hit Dar-Benn. However, Dar-Benn caught the hammer, so Rambeau and Danvers switched places, allowing Rambeau to take the hammer and hit Dar-Benn.\n\nRambeau then tried to strike Dar-Benn only to miss. Rambeau was soon hit backwards, but got up and was able to strike Dar-Benn, sending her into a wall which impaled her. Laying there dying, Dar-Benn claimed that Danvers owed Hala, which Rambeau actually agreed with. Rambeau told Danvers see could reignite Pama with her own powers. When they lifted the wall off of Dar-Benn, the enemy turned on them, threatening Khan, who was caught in her hammer.\n\nDar-Benn then took the band off of Khan, now having both. As she went to hit them together, Danvers charged at her, so Rambeau went to protect Khan from whatever power was coming. Rambeau and Khan then watched as Danvers flew Dar-Benn out to space. Dar-Benn then tried to use the bands, only to be overloaded and explode. Rambeau then flew out to save Danvers while Ms. Marvel grabbed them both to safety with her hard light. They then learned their powers were not entangled anymore.[8]\n\nThe Marvels got up and looked into space to see a huge rift in front of them. Rambeau explained that Dar-Benn tore a hole through space-tim into another reality. Rambeau explained that Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel should be able to reproduce the same amount of energy used to open the rift. Then Rambeau would absorb it and release it from inside the tear, allowing it to close.\n\nMs. Marvel then put on both Quantum Bands and blasted Rambeau while Danvers did the same. This allowed Rambeau to absorb the energy, allowing her to glow binary with white light. As Rambeau floated in front of Danvers, the latter told her that Maria Rambeau would be proud. Monica responded saying \"higher, further, faster,\" which Danvers repeated. Rambeau then flew out until she was inside the rift.\n\nShe then redirected her energy, causing various blasts to hit the Universal Neural Teleportation Network. As the rift started closing, Rambeau radioed to Danvers, saying she could not leave as she would have to close it on the other side. Danvers disapproved and tried to talk Rambeau out of it, but Rambeau assured Danvers that it was okay. As Rambeau saw Danvers flying to her in a desperate attempt to rescue her, she said that she always knew she would have to stay. She then used all of her might to close the rift and passed out.[8]\n\nRambeau woke up on a bed in the X-Mansion, unsure of where she was. She then looked to her left to see her very own mother. Rambeau started panicking and hyperventilating as Maria was very confused on what Monica meant. As Beast walked in, Monica asked what happened, but Beast wanted her to tell them. Monica then watched as Maria and Beast talked to each other, with Maria being called Binary. As Beast left, Binary asked who Monica was, annoying Monica as she realized what was happening.[8]\n\nDuring her childhood, Rambeau was a very lively and mature person, despite her age, which impressed most people who encountered her. She remained convinced that her friend Carol Danvers had survived, refusing to believe in her death since no solid evidence of it existed, and was proven right when Danvers came back to her six years later. Rambeau did her best to bring back Danvers' memories, nostalgically going through all the memorabilia she had gathered and kept for days to remember her friend. Rambeau could also be quite witty, such as she teased her mother about the example she was setting for her when refusing to leave for a dangerous mission, or when she claimed to Nick Fury that she could be able to build a spaceship to meet up with Danvers in space.\n\nMonica was very close with her mother Maria. When she was resurrected in the Blip, Monica was in denial after finding out that in the five years since her disappearance, Maria had succumbed to her cancer. Knowing the pain of suddenly losing a loved one, she was able to connect and empathize with Wanda Maximoff, despite being attacked by her on two occasions, although those were merely fits of rage from a grieving Avenger who couldn't let go of a life she never had. Her empathy towards Maximoff led her to defy Tyler Hayward's order to terminate her. Despite pleading with Maximoff to let go of her past, Monica would admit to her in the aftermath of the Battle of Westview that if given the power, she would've brought Maria back.\n\nRambeau was also willing to throw herself into danger in order to protect the people she cared for. When the S.W.O.R.D. rover was unable to penetrate the Anomaly barrier, she used her body instead, exposing herself to the bombardment of radiation that altered her DNA multiple times. When Hayward attempted to shoot and kill Maximoff's children, she used her body to stop the bullets.",
