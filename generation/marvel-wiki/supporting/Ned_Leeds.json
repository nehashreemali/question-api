  "content": "Edward \"Ned\" Leeds is a former student at Midtown School of Science and Technology. Upon discovering his best friend, Peter Parker, was Spider-Man, Leeds then focused on assisting Parker in his heroics as they attempted to find and defeat Vulture before he could sell high-tech hybrid weapons to the criminal underworld, while also hoping to use the Spider-Man identity to improve their own social standing at school.\n\nLeeds was a victim of the Snap, but, along with all the other victims, was brought back to life by the Hulk in 2023. The following year, Leeds would go on a school field trip to Europe with his classmates, including Parker. When their trip was interrupted due to the Elementals crisis, Leeds would do his best to cover for Parker as he investigated and fought the perpetrator, Mysterio, so that his secret identity as Spider-Man would not be revealed. During this time, Leeds also had a brief romance with Betty Brant.\n\nLeeds worked once more with Parker as his \"guy in the chair\" when, due to Doctor Strange's botched spell to make the world forget that Parker was Spider-Man, villains from alternate universes crossed over into theirs; Leeds and Parker's girlfriend, Michelle Jones, aided Parker in capturing the visitors, but then helped free them from Strange after discovering his plan involved sending these visitors to their deaths. Using Strange's Sling Ring, Leeds accidentally summoned alternate versions of Parker, who helped him, Parker, and Jones in taking down the visitors, who had betrayed them. Tragically, though, instabilities in Strange's spell could only be solved by having the entire world, including Leeds, forget Parker's existence. Leeds exchanged a tearful goodbye with Parker before his memories of him were erased. In his new life, Leeds was accepted into MIT and maintained a friendship with Jones.\n\nEdward \"Ned\" Leeds was born November 10, 2001.[2] By September 2016, he was a student at Midtown School of Science and Technology and was Peter Parker's best friend. He was also a member of the Academic Decathlon Team. At the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year, Leeds revealed to Parker that he had just gotten the LEGO Death Star, and asked if he wanted to help build it tonight. Parker ended up distracted by Liz Allan passing by, however, and unwittingly accepted.[3]\n\nShortly after, Leeds went to Parker's apartment. While Parker was not in due to the \"Stark Internship,\" his Aunt May allowed Leeds to wait in his room. Leeds was playing with the LEGO Death Star when he saw Peter Parker enter through the window, crawling on the ceiling while wearing his Spider-Man Suit. Leeds dropped the Death Star in disbelief and surprised Parker, who had to admit that he was Spider-Man but got Leeds to agree to keep it a secret.\n\nWhile Parker tried to resume his daily life, Leeds asked him questions of when he was aware of his superpowers. On the way to school, Leeds listened to Parker recount how he gained his powers from being bitten by the spider and that it was now dead. On route, they came across the aftermath of the Robbery of the Queens Community Bank, as Parker noted the arrival of the United States Department of Damage Control and Anne Marie Hoag before they continued towards school.\n\nWhile they sat in their classes, including science and one lecture on the origins of the Sokovia Accords, Leeds bombarded Parker with questions regarding his abilities as Spider-Man, such as how he gained his powers as well as other trivial matters which soon began to annoy Parker. As he continued, Leeds further questioned Parker, who ignored most of the questions as Leeds asked if he laid eggs, how far he could fire his Web-Shooters, and if he could summon an army of spiders.\n\nAs they prepared for Coach Andre Wilson's gym class, they were shown a video of Captain America's Fitness Challenge. Leeds continued to question Parker whether he had met other heroes like Captain America. Unexpectedly anticipating his question's answer, Leeds listened to Parker that he had once managed to successfully steal Captain America's Shield during the Battle at Leipzig-Halle Airport, much to his complete amazement.\n\nWhen they were continuing their training in the school's gym, Leeds continued to question about the Avengers until Parker told him to shut up. Leeds would then asked Parker if he could be the guy in the chair, much to Parker's confusion. Leeds noted to Parker that he could be giving him assistance during missions, exemplifying that if Parker was in at a burning building, he could tell Parker where to go due to the number of screens around him, but Parker still refused his offer.\n\nLeeds and Parker then overheard Liz Allan talking with her friends, including Betty Brant and Seymour O'Reilly about the Avengers, even confessing to harboring a crush on Spider-Man. Knowing this information, Leeds blurted out in front of the entire class that Parker knew Spider-Man. When they both got invited to Toomes' party, Leeds convinced Parker to make an appearance as Spider-Man to increase their social standing.[3]\n\nLater that same evening, May drove the pair onto the Toomes Residence, noting her own love for house parties. While outside the house, May complimented Leeds on his hat while Peter Parker became nervous and suggested going home, only for May to tease him by his own body's changes until Leeds told Parker to finally enter the party, much to his great delight. Leeds asked Parker if he was wearing the Spider-Man Suit beneath his clothing, to which Parker confirmed.\n\nEntering the house, they saw that Flash Thompson was acting as the DJ for the party while Michelle Jones teased them for coming to the party while denying that she was also attending the party. They were soon greeted by Liz Allan, who told them to hang around the party. Setting up his plan, Leeds insisted that Parker needed to dress up as Spider-Man to impress everybody there, but Parker refused and was adamant to be himself, despite Leeds insisting that nobody wants that.\n\nAfter another taunt from Thompson, who mocked Parker for failing to arrive with Spider-Man, Leeds was left waiting at the party so that Parker can excuse himself and donned his costume outside on the Toomes Residence's roof in private, however when Parker noticed an explosion and had to bail to investigate what turned out to be an arms deal. Leeds then called Parker multiple times, realizing that he ditched. Once Parker answered, Leeds, advised him not to return to the party since Thompson had continued to make a mockery out of him.[3]\n\nHaving broken up the arms deal, Peter Parker had also discovered the Chitauri Energy Core. After telling him that he ditched, Leeds noticed that Parker was investigating the energy core and asked him where he found it. He was told by Parker that he encountered it by seeing it left behind in the wake of the recent chase all across the streets with Jackson Brice. While Leeds expressed his delight at merely being a part of this situation, Parker used a hammer to break the core, as Barry Hapgood advised his students to keep their fingers clear of the blades, while Leeds and Parker agreed on what to do next before doing their own tradition handshake.\n\nOnce they had spent some time examining the Chitauri power core, Leeds and Parker had encountered Herman Schultz and Randy Vale who had both arrived and searched for the core through Midtown School of Science and Technology. While Parker hid, Leeds slowly moved towards him and was told that Schultz had attempted to kill him the night before alongside Jackson Brice. Although he insisted that they run and hide, Leeds was ignored by Parker who decided to get a lead on Vulture, As Parker followed Schultz and Vale, as they searched through the school, Leeds was noticed by Tiny McKeever on what he was doing, to which he told that it was nothing.\n\nReturning to the Parker Residence together, Leeds helped Parker on tracking Schultz and his gang's current movements as they made their way outside of New York City. Eventually, while Leeds was trying on the Spider-Man Mask, they learned that Schultz and Vale had finally stopped in Maryland. While they discussed with Schultz and his gang had an evil lair, they discussed how to get to Maryland, realizing that the Decathlon was taking place in Washington, D.C..[3]\n\nSeeking to get a lift to Maryland, Leeds joined the Academic Decathlon team in Washington, D.C. for Nationals. Peter Parker later ran up to the group as they were all heading onto the bus, asking to rejoin them. Although Flash Thompson rejected the idea as he had taken Parker's spot, Roger Harrington was delighted to have Parker back and immediately agreed, causing Abe Brown to tease Thompson for being demoted, much to Leeds and everyone else's amusement.\n\nDuring the journey to Washington, D.C., Liz Allan quizzed their team to get them ready for the finals. Leeds, meanwhile, observed the Spider-Tracer that Parker implanted to track the two members of Vulture's gang. When Parker got a call from Happy Hogan, Leeds listened as Parker protested Hogan tracking him through his Spider-Man Suit without his consent. Although Leeds indicated they were also invading Vulture's privacy, Parker insisted that was different.[3]\n\nAfter Parker ended the call, Leeds excitedly asked if it was Tony Stark or Thor, though Parker pointed out that Thor might not use a phone. As they neared their destination, Leeds and Parker then caught sight of the wreckage of the Triskelion. Michelle Jones came over to them and explained that the Department of Damage Control was still clearing up the destruction left behind by Captain America during the Battle at the Triskelion. While Jones expressed her own conspiracy theories about the incident, Leeds told her that it was probably Captain America helping the people.[9]\n\nLater, Leeds accessed the Spider-Man Suit's subsystems with his laptop to help Parker locate its tracker. Leeds was wary of his friend's's actions, being told that Parker did not want Stark to know where he was while he tracked Vulture's Crew. Leeds questioned Parker on why he was now lying to Iron Man, to which Parker justified that he was not lying, but just wanted Stark to fully understand everything he could do as a hero, but Leeds remained unsure. Parker then successfully removed the tracker which he placed on a lamp.\n\nLeeds found out that the suit had more many subsystems programmed into it, but they had all been disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol, much to his amusement and Parker's frustration. Parker encouraged Leeds to hack into the suit and disable that protocol. Leeds was concerned that Parker was being reckless, as well as the potential consequences of him tampering with the suit, but ultimately relented when Parker told him to be his guy in the chair. With Parker having to get back on the move, Leeds kept the Chitauri Energy Core safe in the meantime and urged Parker to be careful.\n\nWhen Parker ended up being trapped in the Damage Control Deep Storage Vault and missed the finals the next day, Leeds kept the energy core and participated in the finals, leaving the team winning the competition. Once Roger Harrington took the team to the Washington Monument, Leeds was called by Parker to get rid of the energy core only to have it snatched up by Toomes to questioned him, only to retrieve it back to Leeds.\n\nAt the top of the Monument, Leeds' backpack was starting to burn down as the power core exploded, damaging part of the building and trapping several of the Academic Decathlon team members inside the elevator. While several people were saved by the security, Leeds, Toomes, and Harrington were trapped in the elevator, only to be saved by the arrival of Spider-Man.[3]\n\nIn the wake of the events of Washington, D.C., Leeds returned to New York City where all of the new positive attention is being put on Spider-Man, following the success of the Rescue at the Washington Monument. While walking through the school's hallways, Leeds greeted Peter Parker and questioned what it was like being famous without anyone actually knowing, as Parker told Leeds once again to not tell anybody the truth. Leeds told Parker he was going to class only to be told he was not going to class, saying he figured out Vulture was using the technology stolen from Damage Control to make weapons and all he had to do now was catch Vulture in the act.\n\nHaving Parker losing his Spider-Man Suit, Leeds waited for him to return to his daily life at Midtown School of Science and Technology and also put his superhero activities on hold. Sitting at the hallway, Leeds confronted Parker after he was sent to the office of Principal Morita. Leeds assumed Parker was expelled only to be wrong, relieved on how lucky he was. While Parker improved his schoolwork, Leeds and he finished the Lego Death Star they had worked on for months, much to their considerable satisfaction.[3]\n\nAt the homecoming dance, Leeds discovered that Peter Parker had left the dance. After following his friend, Leeds discovered Shocker nearly killing his friend. Trying to save his friend's life, Leeds intervened and distracted Shocker with one of Parker's Web-Shooters, giving Spider-Man the advantage to web him against a bus. Upon recovering, Parker revealed to Ned that Vulture is in fact, Liz Allan's father, much to Leeds' shock.\n\nAs Parker went after Vulture before he could steal Avengers' equipment, Leeds was able to contact Happy Hogan, and locating Parker's phone, which was on Toomes' car. Leeds used a couple of computers in the school to help Parker in his mission, as well as to help him drive Flash Thompson's car, which Parker stole from him, much to Ned's delight. After Spider-Man arrived at Vulture's lair, Leeds was caught by Warren, one of the school's teachers. To cover for Parker, he claimed to be watching pornography.[3]\n\nFollowing Adrian Toomes' incarceration, Leeds and Peter Parker had returned to Midtown School of Science and Technology and talked about their fight against the Shocker. Leeds excitedly recounted his brief experience in the field while Parker thanked him for saving his life. They quickly ran into Liz Allan, who was moving to Oregon due to her father's arrest, and Parker decided to talk to her.\n\nLeeds and Parker then attended the decathlon meeting in an announcement of their new leader: Michelle Jones. When Jones stated that her friend's call her \"MJ,\" Leeds reminded Jones that she told them that she has no friends, to which Jones stated that she didn't have.[3] Sometime after, Leeds was interviewed by Betty Brant and Jason Ionello, anchors of the school's news team, as to his thoughts on Spider-Man's true identity. Leeds, defending his best friend's identity, responded that the costumed hero's identity was a mystery and would always be.[9]\n\nIn May 2018, while on a field trip to MOMA, Leeds was listening to music, when Peter Parker tapped him on the face to ask him to cause a distraction. Leeds looked at Parker and looked out the window and saw a Q-Ship descending on Greenwich Village. This caused him to begin screaming that an invasion was occurring, drawing his classmates’ attention, as well as the bus driver, allowing Parker to escape the bus and head towards the disturbance.[4] Later the following day, Leeds was a victim of the Snap.[7]\n\nFive years later, as a result of the Blip, Leeds was restored to life. Leeds was one of several students who would have to retake junior year, now during the current 2023-2024 school year. On the first day of the new school year, Leeds saw Peter Parker and they exchanged an emotional reunion, realizing they had been both victims.[7]\n\nOver the course of the school year, Leeds noticed that Peter Parker had developed feelings towards Michelle Jones. Also, Leeds was told about Parker's time in space. Towards the end of the school year, Leeds and Parker both signed up to go on a sponsored trip to Europe in the summer. On the last day of school in June 2024, Parker explained to Leeds that he had plotted out a six-step plan to confess his feelings and hopefully win Jones' heart during their trip. Leeds encouraged Parker not to go through with the plan, as he was excited by the idea of them being two American bachelors in Europe. When Jones approached them, Leeds accidentally embarrassed Parker in front of her when he let slip that Parker had a \"plan\" for the trip, which he covered with a lie that Parker intended to collect miniature spoons.[10]\n\nWhen the trip began, Leeds attempted to help Parker with the first step of his plan - sitting next to Jones on the airplane and watching movies together. He tried to persuade Betty Brant to trade seats with Parker by claiming that Parker was allergic to a perfume that the lady in front of them was wearing. Unfortunately, their chaperone and teacher Roger Harrington overheard this and re-arranged the students himself. Jones sat with Brad Davis, a survivor of the Snap. Parker sat next to Harrington and a new teacher Julius Dell, while Leeds sat next to Brant. On the flight, Leeds mostly played video games, but when he looked up and made eye contact with Brant, they quickly established a rapport. By the time the plane landed in Venice, Italy, Leeds and Brant had decided to become a couple despite Leeds' initial plan to be a bachelor.[10]\n\nLeeds and Brant were inseparable as they explored Venice, but the day took an unexpected turn when a water monster burst through the Grand Canal and attacked the city. As they ran away, Leeds worked to distract his classmates so they would not notice that Parker himself was trying to fight the monster.\n\nThat evening at the Hotel DeMatteis, Leeds and his classmates tried to make sense of what they had just seen. He found an online article that claimed a man named Morris Bench had recently gained water-related superpowers, but Jones didn't believe it. In addition to the attack, the class was also interested in the strange new hero who defeated it. Mishearing the Italian news coverage that called the man \"l'uomo di mistero\" as \"l'uomi di misterio,\" Leeds and Brant coined the moniker \"Mysterio.\"\n\nAs Leeds and Parker got ready for bed, Leeds asked Parker what he planned to do if another monster attack happened. Parker asserted that \"Mysterio\" could handle the situation and he just wanted to continue to spend time with Jones. Leeds supported his friend, and began to like Parker's situation to his own romance with Brant, but was cut off by an abrupt shot from a tranquilizer gun.[10]\n\nWhen Leeds awoke the next morning, Parker explained that Leeds had been tranquilized by Nick Fury, who wanted to recruit Parker to fight the next monster, which was projected to strike soon in Prague. Soon after, Harrington and Dell announced that their itinerary had been reworked by the travel company to go to the Czech Republic. Parker quickly put together that the \"travel representative\" was actually working on Fury's behalf, effectively hijacking the class trip. Leeds found this prospect very exciting.\n\nLeeds and Brant texted each other as they were bused through Austria, and with her took note of a pair of glasses Parker had recently acquired. Leeds and the class were excited when they were told that they would be attending a regional festival while in Prague; a few hours later, this was changed to a four-hour opera. Leeds was the only student who tried to defend the idea, knowing that it was to keep their class safe from the impending attack from an Elemental. Still, he was not sold on the idea and with Brant, he snuck out of the opera house to attend the carnival anyway.[10]\n\nBrant and Leeds rode a Ferris wheel together when suddenly the fire Elemental struck. Mysterio and Parker appeared on the scene to counter it, with Parker wearing a new spider-suit to keep him from being recognized. However, Brant quickly made a connection between the hero's powers and believed it was in fact Spider-Man. Leeds tried to cover for his friend, inventing the alias \"Night Monkey\" and claiming him to be a \"European knock-off\" of Spider-Man. When the monster approached the Ferris wheel and it became clear that they were in danger, Leeds reluctantly called for \"Night Monkey\" to rescue him and Brant.\n\nLater that night, when Leeds returned to their hotel suite, he found Parker wearing his stealth Spider-suit in front of Jones. He tried to cover for his friend by complimenting the \"costume\" and that it was for a costume party, but Parker and Jones explained that Jones knew about Parker's secret identity. Leeds was then informed that Mysterio was actually a villain who had been staging the Elemental attacks, and that Parker was on his way to Berlin, Germany.  Leeds was then asked to cover for him by telling their chaperones that Parker would be visiting family in Berlin instead of flying back to the United States with the rest of the class.[10]\n\nUnknown to Leeds, Mysterio defeated Spider-Man in Berlin and used stolen information-gathering technology to redirect the class  to fly from Prague to London, England, the location of his fifth and final Elemental attack. The sight of the Elemental Fusion tipped Jones off that Mysterio knew that she and Leeds were aware of the truth. To protect their classmates, Leeds and Jones broke off from the rest of the group but were followed by Brant and Flash Thompson.\n\nThe four soon ran into Happy Hogan, who introduced himself as an ally of Spider-Man's and worked to get the group to safety. However, the plan quickly fell apart as Leeds and the others found themselves cornered in the Tower of London Museum. The group tried to fight back, but it soon became clear that they could not overpower Mysterio's drones. Believing his death to be imminent, Leeds confessed that he felt he'd wasted his life playing video games. However, the drones came to a sudden stop; elsewhere in the city, Spider-Man had defeated Mysterio.[10]\n\nLeeds and his classmates soon boarded a flight back to the United States, again sitting next to Brant while Parker sat beside Jones, who was now his girlfriend. During the flight, Brant and Leeds amicably agreed to end their relationship. After landing at Newark airport, Leeds and Brant announced this to Parker, before returning to New York City.[10]\n\nA week later, Leeds saw that Peter Parker was being framed for the Battle of London and Mysterio's death, along with his identity being revealed by the Daily Bugle. Worried, he contacted Parker via face-time. However, Parker had to cut the call short as he was on the Queensboro Bridge and had to tend to Michelle Jones.[11]\n\nDays later, Leeds was brought by the United States Department of Damage Control to the New York City Police Precinct to be questioned. He came in alongside Michelle Jones and May Parker and passed Parker, who was in a separate room.\n\nWhen it was Leeds' turn, he was brought into an interrogation room and was interrogated by Agent P. Cleary, who asked if Leeds was hungry. Leeds told Cleary that he had helped Parker hack his Spider-Man Suit in order to remove the Training Wheels Protocol, how he had assisted Parker in his mission to stop Vulture, and how he had made a distraction so Parker could help out in the Infinity War. Cleary then told Leeds that this information wasn't good on his part as it made him Parker's main accomplice. Leeds then asked to have his words retracted and kept silent.[11]\n\nThat September, the 2024-2025 school year began, with Leeds returning to Midtown School of Science and Technology along with Peter Parker and Michelle Jones, beginning their senior year. When they arrived, they were met by Flash Thompson, who voiced his support for Parker. They then walked past Betty Brant, as she reported on Parker's return, and through the crowds of protesters, those who were in support of Parker and those who were in support of Mysterio. Leeds was asked by one Mysterio supporter who he was, but Thompson interrupted him, stating he was Spider-Man's best friend. At the entrance, NYPD officers escorted Parker in first, while Leeds and Jones stayed behind and came in later.\n\nThat afternoon when the school day was over, Leeds met Parker and Jones on Midtown's rooftop. He sat down and pulled out his laptop, showing them that he had researched Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then discussed going there with them and staying as roommates. He then agreed with Parker that it would be a fresh start for all of them.[11]\n\nIn November, Leeds met Peter Parker and Michelle Jones at the cafe that Jones worked at and sat down to open his college admissions letter from MIT. However, to his disappointment, he was rejected, as well as Jones and Parker, due to the recent controversy surrounding Parker's identity. Jones then ripped her letter up, and Leeds did the same, only to remember he needed to show it to his parents.\n\nThey were then met by Flash Thompson, who told them enthusiastically that he was accepted to MIT. When he learned they weren't, he asked why, and Leeds replied that he and Jones were actually Parker's friends. When Jones was called back to work, Leeds patted Parker on the back and left for home.[11]\n\nSoon after, Leeds and Michelle Jones were found by Doctor Strange and taken to the New York Sanctum. Leeds expressed excitement about being inside the Sanctum and asked Strange what he should do regarding tingling in his hands. Strange told him to see his physician. Peter Parker then met up with them, and Strange told them that they needed to use their technology to find the universe-displaced people who had come to their universe from within the Multiverse after Parker had fractured the spell.\n\nStrange sent them to the undercroft, in which only Leeds expressed awe about going too. Leeds then explored it, finding what he thought was a torture machine, but was only a Pilates machine. He then found a crossbow and other various items. Later, as he became hungry, he opened the refrigerator only to find glasses of eyeballs and other supernatural objects, and quickly changed his mind.\n\nWhile researching on his laptop, they met Doctor Octopus and Lizard who were in holding cells nearby. Leeds asked if the Lizard was a dinosaur and was surprised he could talk. After finding another universe-displaced person near a military institute outside of the city, Leeds told Parker and Parker went to investigate.\n\nLeeds and Jones remained at the undercroft and face-timed Parker, who attached his phone to his chest. Leeds informed Parker that they hadn't seen anything from their footage yet, but then witnessed Electro, who consumed electricity from nearby towers before attacking Parker. During Parker's attempt to escape, Leeds and Jones lost connection with him. However, soon after, Electro appeared in a holding cell, along with Sandman. Surprised at seeing the different universe-displaced, Leeds asked if a tree was also one, in which Electro informed him it was just a tree. Leeds and Jones remained there for the night.\n\nThat next day, Leeds and Jones saw that Parker returned with Norman Osborn. Hearing that Osborn recognized Jones initials, Leeds was surprised that another version of his friend existed in his universe and that her counterpart goes by a different name, Mary Jane, as he wondered if there were other versions of himself within the Multiverse. Osborn spoke with Octopus, who was surprised to see him. Sandman then revealed that both of them had died in their universe. Strange then transported himself there and appeared with the Macchina di Kadavus. He told them he was there to finish the spell and transported Osborn into a cell. Leeds watched as Parker used his Web-Shooters to grab the Macchina and run off with it, with Strange in pursuit.\n\nMoments later, Parker returned through an Inter-Dimensional Portal and told them that he had trapped Strange in a mirror place. He then gave Jones the Macchina and handed Leeds Strange's Sling Ring, asking them to go and wait for him, as he was to help cure the universe-displaced.[11]\n\nLeeds and Jones went to Leeds' house and waited. They turned the television on and saw news reports about recent destruction at a condominium, both knowing that Parker had been there and worried for his safety. Jones told Leeds she was going to push the button on the Macchina to activate it, but stopped when Leeds waved his arms in the air, stating he wanted to see Parker. A spark of magic flickered in the air before them and Jones asked Leeds to repeat what he just did.\n\nLeeds did so, and conjured an Inter-Dimensional Portal using the Sling Ring. To their excitement, they saw what appeared to be Parker in an alley way. They called out to him and when he jumped through, they saw that he was another Spider-Man. Startled and confused by this, Leeds and Jones asked who he was. Leeds started to bring up the spell, and Jones stopped him from saying too much, before the other Spider-Man deduced that his studies on multidimensional travel was real.\n\nJones told Leeds to try again and this time, another Spider-Man walked through. Leeds asked if he was another Spider-Man and why he didn't tell them that, in which he replied he kept his identity anonymous. After the two Spider-Man used their webbing on each other, they told Leeds and Jones where they went when they needed alone time, thinking that that was what Parker was doing. Leeds and Jones then figured out where Parker was most likely and took the other Spider-Men with them.[11]\n\nLeeds and Jones arrived at Midtown School of Science and Technology with the Macchina di Kadavus, and went to the rooftop where they found Peter Parker, crying and in deep distraught. They learned that his aunt had died and comforted him. Jones then signaled the other two Spider-Men to join them. Leeds watched as Parker said bitterly that he didn't care if the villains died fighting them and prepared to send them and the other Spider-Men back to their universes. However, after hearing the other Spider-Men's stories of loss, Parker was encouraged to keep persevering.\n\nLeeds and Jones then joined Parker and the other Spider-Men to one of Midtown's laboratory rooms. They watched as the three concocted cures for the universe-displaced. As they worked, Leeds asked the older Spider-Man if he had a best friend. He replied that he did, but he had died in his arms after he had attempted to kill him. Fearing that he might follow in that individual's footsteps, Leeds became unsettled and remained quiet.\n\nLater on, Leeds called out to Parker and all three responded, confused at who he was talking to. Leeds became exasperated and told them to look at his laptop. Leeds then told Parker that he wouldn't become a super villain and try to kill him, granting him confused looks from Parker and Jones. After the cures were concocted, Leeds and Jones were tasked to stay at the laboratory while Parker and the other Spider-Man left with the Macchina.[11]\n\nLeeds and Jones waited for the signal from Parker and Leeds used the Sling Ring to open up another Inter-Dimensional Portal in which Parker tossed them the Macchina. However, Leeds was unable to close the portal, telling Jones that he had only opened them and they had closed on their own. As Leeds and Jones tried to offer suggestions of what to do, they were soon confronted by the Lizard, who wanted the Macchina. Leeds and Jones ran through Midtown's laboratory room, dodging as the Lizard slammed into laboratory tables. Parker managed to catch up to them and tried to stop the Lizard, but he was unsuccessful.\n\nAs Leeds and Jones left Midtown and escaped through another portal onto the Statue of Liberty, the Lizard followed. Leeds then conjured another portal, in which water came through and knocked the Lizard off his feet. Parker then subdued the Lizard and retrieved the cure, giving it to him. As Leeds opened another portal for him and Jones to head back to Midtown, Doctor Strange walked through it as he took Sling Ring and the Macchina back from him and Jones. However, Leeds and Jones convinced Strange to hold off on reversing the spell as they explained that Parker's plan to cure the multiverses displaced people was working. Leeds, Jones and Strange watched as the Lizard reverted into his human form of Dr. Curt Connors. Before Strange went to meet Parker, Leeds was asked by the latter if he was the one who opened the portal that brought him to their location as he told him that he did, which surprised him of his ability to perform magic.\n\nLeeds and Jones remained on the scaffolding of the Statue and witnessed from a distance the Green Goblin's attack, in which he stole the Macchina. When Strange retrieved it back, a Pumpkin Bomb that had been placed inside detonated and released the unstable spell. This caused a massive rift within the Multiverse, which created a tremor that caused the scaffolding of the Statue to fall down. As a result, Jones lost her balance and fell, but was rescued. Leeds also fell off, but was rescued by the Cloak of Levitation, which carried him safely to the ground. Leeds then ran off to see Jones and the two hugged. Parker saw them and asked if they were okay, before going to fight the Goblin.\n\nLeeds and Jones then watched in horror as Parker nearly beat Green Goblin to death in his rage, only for the older Spider-Man to stop him. They watched as Parker administered the cure to Green Goblin, transforming back into Osborn, and said goodbye to the other Spider-Men, as well as the arrival of an infinite number of universe-displaced people emerging from within the rift in the Multiverse.[11]\n\nLeeds and Jones were then met by Parker, who revealed to them that he had asked Strange to cast the spell again, this time removing everyone in their universe's memory of him in order to fix the cracks in the Multiverse.\n\nAt this news, Leeds burst into tears and hugged Parker, who tried to console Leeds telling him that he will find them and re-establish their friendship. Parker and Leeds then did their handshake for the last time. After Parker said goodbye to Jones, Leeds watched tearfully as he swung away.[11]\n\nAfterwards, Leeds and Michelle Jones were admitted to Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A few weeks later, Leeds visited Jones at Peter Pan Donut & Pastry Shop and was surprised to find her in the college spirit. Also there was a young man who looked at Leeds and considered talking to him, but decided not to.[11]\n\nIn the following June, Leeds was among the students who graduated from Midtown School of Science and Technology as the class of 2025.[12]\n\nNed Leeds is a highly intelligent science enthusiast, hacker, gamer, and geek, though he is also somewhat socially awkward, hence his close friendship with Peter Parker. Leeds is strongly displeased with being the school geek and wishes to become more popular. Initially, upon discovering that Parker was Spider-Man, Leeds wanted to use his friend's alter-ego for rather selfish needs such as making himself and Parker more popular by claiming that Spider-Man was their close friend.\n\nLeeds was very excited that Parker is a superhero and immediately wanted to be his \"guy in the chair.\" After realizing that criminals could've killed Parker multiple times, he began to take the Spider-Man more seriously and genuinely wanted to help Parker capture Vulture, offering support whenever he could. Also, upon hearing from his older counterpart that his best friend tried to kill him and was dead, Leeds was shocked by this then told his Parker that he would never turn evil and try to kill him, much to the latter confusion, but he appreciated it nevertheless.\n\nDuring their trip to Europe, despite wanting initially to remain bachelors together, Leeds quickly entered a relationship with Betty Brant. Despite this, he remained supportive of Parker's plan to court Jones and remained willing to support his duties as Spider-Man.\n\nLeeds has also been known to run his mouth. While being interrogated by federal agents after Parker was accused of murdering Mysterio, Leeds, in his pride as Spider-Man's \"guy in the chair,\" accidentally incriminated himself as his main accomplice. In addition, an alternate Spider-Man learned of the existence of magic in this universe after Leeds wouldn't shut up about it, despite being told repeatedly to remain silent by Michelle Jones.",
