  "content": "Knowhere is the severed head of a Celestial and the headquarters of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Originally located on the edge of the Galactic Rim[1] and colonized by the Tivan Group, the Exitar mining operation was established to acquire organic Celestial skull matter, with Taneleer Tivan presiding over the territory. Knowhere also housed the Collector's Museum, where Tivan kept his possessions. In 2018, it was attacked by Thanos, bringing an end to Tivan's operations. By 2025, the Guardians bought Knowhere from Tivan and converted it into their headquarters while repairing the damages Thanos had caused. In addition, they outfitted the Celestial head with propulsion engines, allowing them to move Knowhere through the cosmos as a mobile city.\n\nHundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group set up mining operations in the decapitated skull of the Celestial, in order to harvest the valuable bone, brain tissue, and spinal fluid from it. The absence of rules and regulations turned Knowhere into a safe haven for outlaws from across the galaxy.[2]\n\nIn 2013, Asgardians Sif and Volstagg arrived at the Collector's Museum inside Knowhere to deliver the Aether to the Collector. They were introduced to the infamous Taneleer Tivan by Carina, and willingly gave the Aether to him, not realizing that he was apparently seeking the other Infinity Stones.[3]\n\nIn 2014, the Guardians of the Galaxy arrived at Knowhere with the intention of selling the Orb to Taneleer Tivan. After he explained that the Orb was a containment device for one of the Infinity Stones, his assistant Carina attempted to free herself from his slavery by using the Orb, but the power of the stone was too much so she and the Collector's Museum were destroyed, releasing Cosmo and Howard the Duck in the process.\n\nMeanwhile, Drax the Destroyer, obsessed with avenging the deaths of his wife and daughter, alerted Ronan the Accuser to their presence. Ronan's forces attacked Knowhere while he and Drax faced each other in hand-to-hand combat. Easily overpowering Drax and leaving him to die, Ronan took possession of the Orb. Sometime following the Battle of Xandar, Taneleer Tivan sat at the remains of his museum, getting licked by Cosmo and having a drink with Howard the Duck.[2]\n\nFour years later, Thanos went to Knowhere and destroyed most of it in his quest to acquire the Reality Stone and was ultimately successful. When Gamora, Peter Quill, Drax, and Mantis arrived, Thanos created false versions of himself and the Collector and hid the destruction in order to lure the Guardians of the Galaxy into a trap. He was successful in doing so and revealed Knowhere to be a mostly destroyed, burning ruin.[4]\n\nFollowing the attack, Knowhere was left deserted and in a burning husk for years. In 2025, the Guardians of the Galaxy bought Knowhere from the Collector to use as their base of operations. They also took in Cosmo as a new member. As Knowhere needed rebuilding, the Guardians took the task to rebuild it and make it habitable again.\n\nIn December, Mantis and Drax made a plan and brought Kevin Bacon there. They, along with the other Guardians and the new residents of Knowhere, had a Christmas celebration for Peter Quill.[5]\n\nIn 2026, the Guardians of the Galaxy were cleaning up various things on Knowhere including a new sign. Meanwhile, Kraglin Obfonteri was practicing his Yaka Arrow while Cosmo made fun of him. Cosmo eventually showed that she could use her telekinesis better, prompting Obfonteri to call her a bad dog.\n\nNebula walked into a room and found Peter Quill drunk. She picked up the unconscious Quill and brought him back to his apartment where she put him in his bed. The rest of the Guardians then followed suit with Rocket looking at his key card before going to bed.\n\nSuddenly, Adam Warlock arrived, taking out Rocket and causing a ruckus. The group rushed to take down the Warlock with Drax, Nebula, and Groot attacking. Warlock hosed through them, breaking Groot's entire body most notably. Nebula then impaled Warlock with her arm. Meanwhile, Mantis and Quill wee aiding Rocket, who was dying. The group tried to help, but it was no use as they brought him to the Bowie. Having to go on a mission to save Rocket, the Guardians left Obfonteri and Cosmo in charge of Knowhere.[6]\n\nWhile the Knowhere citizens waited for the Guardians of the Galaxy to return, Kraglin Obfonteri and Cosmo continued to bicker about him calling her a bad dog. Eventually, Obfontri got a call to meet the Guardians at Arête Laboratories. Obfonteri and Steemie Blueliver piloted Knowhere, which was fit with propellers. They arrived at the lab and docked in order to help the Guardians get transferred from the lab to the head. This allowed the Hell Spawn to invade, leading to an internal battle.\n\nHowever, they were not prepared for what was to come. The Guardians arrived along with children and countless species of animals who were being experimented on by High Evolutionary. As Cosmo used her powers to keep the two ships connected, everyone helped to save the animals. Cosmo then fell ill with the strength she had been using, causing the two ships to break apart. Star-Lord leaped out of the lab and tried to get to Knowhere, but it was two far. Just as he was about to die, Adam Warlock came to his aid as he had a change of heart. The group then rejoiced on Knowhere as the lab blew up.[6]\n\nBack on Knowhere, High Evolutionary was imprisoned.[7] After Gamora left to return to the Ravagers, the Guardians of the Galaxy had a tough meeting. Peter Quill, who realized that he had been running away from Earth and his life there, announced his intentions to leave the Guardians to reconnect with his home planet and to see his grandfather. This led Mantis to say she was leaving as well in order to discover what she wanted and not be made to do what others want her to do. Drax decided to leave the Guardians as well and offered to go with Mantis but refused it, although she appreciated his well-meaning intentions to keep her safe. However, Nebula told Drax that she needed him on Knowhere in order to look after the children they rescued and to help build a new society. When Rocket Raccoon asked her that if she is leading the Guardians, Nebula tells him no because she intended to leave the group in order to lead Knowhere and make it the type of home she never got to have.\n\nThinking that the team is disbanding, Rocket gets emotional, but cheers up when Quill, who was taking advice from an old friend, assured him that it wasn't the case as the galaxy still needs its Guardians and makes him leader of the team. Rocket accepts the role of leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy with Groot, Cosmo and Kraglin Obfonteri staying with the team. They then walked outside and played some music where they danced and cheered.[6]\n\nIn her quest to gain vengeance against the Time Variance Authority, Sylvie Laufeydottir sent a Reset Charge through a Timedoor into Knowhere. The Reset Charge was then detonated, creating a nexus event and a subsequent branched timeline. The TVA then traveled to the alternate Knowhere and pruned the branched timeline.[8]\n\nIn an alternate universe, T'Challa and the Ravagers arrived on Knowhere in order to steal the Embers of Genesis. Star-Lord met with Collector, who was the kingpin of the galaxy.\n\nIn order for this to work, Thanos and Korath the Pursuer staged a fake fight to lure the Black Order away from Collector. However, when Star-Lord met with the kingpin, he noticed an exhibit related to Wakanda. Through this, he realized his true origins. Nebula suddenly revealed herself to be working with Collector. This caused Star-Lord and the rest to be imprisoned.\n\nWith the help of Carina, the Ravagers broke out. Nebula explained that it was all a part of the plan and she was not a traitor. Yondu and Star-Lord double teamed Collector, being able to use the sticky hands technique to defeat him. Meanwhile, the rest of the Ravagers were chased by the Black Order. Luckily, Nebula was able to use the Embers of Genesis to kill Cull Obsidian, causing Knowhere to undergo rapid terraformation. The Ravagers then escaped.[9]",
