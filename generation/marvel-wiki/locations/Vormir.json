  "content": "Vormir is a remote, barren planet at the very center of Celestial existence within the universe, where the Soul Stone was located.\n\nIn 1945, Red Skull vanished from Earth upon holding the Tesseract while trying to finish off Captain America,[1] leading him to be teleported by the Space Stone to Vormir, where he was cursed to serve as the keeper of the Soul Stone.[2]\n\nDecades later, Gamora came to learn of Vormir and its housing of the Soul Stone, keeping this information a secret from Thanos, whom desired all the Infinity Stones to wipe out half of the life in the universe to avoid the extinction of lives by overpopulation.[2]\n\nIn 2018, eventually being forced to reveal the location of the Soul Stone upon seeing her sister Nebula being tortured, Thanos took Gamora to Vormir to find it. Reaching the mountains, they were greeted by Red Skull. Red Skull explained that the only way to acquire the Soul Stone was to give up one's soul but it had to be the soul of someone he loved. Gamora laughed saying that Thanos never felt a thing for anyone but himself.  However, a remorseful Thanos sacrificed Gamora in anguish, weeping for her, while earning the Soul Stone for his Infinity Gauntlet soon afterward.[2] Subsequently, Red Skull's curse was finally broken and he was liberated from his duty, free to leave Vormir after seventy years of lonely torment.[3]\n\nIn 2023, the Avengers used the Quantum Realm to time travel through the Multiverse as part of their Time Heist. Arriving in an alternate 2014 timeline, Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton flew in the Benatar to Vormir to collect the Soul Stone. There, they found out by word of Red Skull that the only way to obtain the Infinity Stone is by giving away the life of a beloved one. Both Romanoff and Barton were determined to sacrifice themselves so the other could get the stone and had a fight over who should stay alive and return with it; however, after a tense struggle, Romanoff won and decided to sacrifice herself falling into the abyss, allowing Barton to obtain the Stone soon afterward.[4]\n\nLater, Steve Rogers was assigned to return all the Infinity Stones to their original timelines.[4] When he went to Vormir, Rogers met with Red Skull. However, rather than showing hostility to each other, Rogers delivered the Stone to Red Skull, who bound to guard it, placed it back to its spot.[5]\n\nDuring her quest to gain vengeance against the Time Variance Authority, Sylvie Laufeydottir sent a Reset Charge through a Timedoor to Vormir in 2301. The Reset Charge was then detonated, forming a Nexus event and creating a branched timeline. The TVA then traveled to the alternate 2301 Vormir in order to prune the branched reality.[6]\n\nIn another universe, couples' cliff diving was on Vormir was a part of the itinerary for the cruise on the SS Grand Master. Howard the Duck told Darcy Lewis that it was said to be an experience that you could only truly appreciate with someone you love, unaware of why.[7]",
