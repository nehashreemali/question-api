  "content": "Xandar is the homeworld of the Xandarians and to many other species as the capital of the Nova Empire with a population of twelve billion. Xandar is located in the Andromeda Galaxy.\n\nStarting in 1014, Xandar was at war with the Kree. However, by 2014, a peace agreement was reached with the Kree Empire.[1]\n\nIn 2014, Star-Lord arrived in Xandar with the Orb in order to sell it to the Broker. The Broker questioned Star-Lord and in the process learned that the Orb was also sought by Ronan the Accuser. Fearing for his life if he acquired the Orb, the Broker refused to take the Orb and evicted Star-Lord from his shop. Gamora followed Star-Lord to Xandar and ambushed him as he exited the store. Her planned attack was thrown off, however, when Rocket and Groot arrived, instead seeking Star-Lord who had a high bounty on his head from Yondu Udonta. In the confusion, Star-Lord fled, causing Gamora, Rocket and Groot to pursue him. Eventually, Gamora pinned Star-Lord, but the Nova Corps quickly intervened and arrested the four for civil disruption and prior criminal actions.[1]\n\nShortly, Ronan the Accuser and the Sakaarans attempted to destroy Xandar using the Power Stone. However, due to a combined effort by the Nova Corps, the Ravagers and the Guardians of the Galaxy, his ship, the Dark Aster, was destroyed, and he was killed.[1]\n\nTwo months later, Xandar was one of the planets nearly assimilated by Ego, but the plan was soon stopped.[2]\n\nIn 2018, Thanos arrived on Xandar on the quest to obtain the Infinity Stones. There Thanos annihilated the Nova Corps and Nova Empire to collect the Power Stone and then decimated half of the planet's population as part of his mission to balance the universe.[3]\n\nDuring her quest to gain vengeance against the Time Variance Authority, Sylvie Laufeydottir sent a Reset Charge through a Timedoor into Xandar on September 24, 1001. The Reset Charge was then detonated, triggering a Nexus event and creating a branched timeline. The TVA then traveled to the alternate 1001 Xandar to prune the timeline.[4]\n\nIn an alternate 2015, Xandar was targeted by Ultron, who was in possession of all six Infinity Stones. As Ultron prepared to exterminate it, Captain Marvel arrived and stopped him, ramming him into Xandar's core. However, Ultron was still able to harness the Stones' power and decimated Xandar.[5]",
