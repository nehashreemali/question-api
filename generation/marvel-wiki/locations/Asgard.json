  "content": "Asgard was a plane within the Nine Realms and the former home world of the Asgardians located in space. Asgard was destroyed in 2017, when Thor ordered Loki to unleash Ragnarök in order to kill Hela, killing 9,719 Asgardians in the process. The surviving Asgardians relocated to Earth, transforming the town of Tønsberg, Norway into the nation of New Asgard.\n\nAsgard was a small, planar body that served as home to the Asgardians, a race of beings recognized by humans on Earth as the deities of Norse mythology, such as Thor and Odin. It was not round like an ordinary planet; thus, it did not spin on its axis or revolve around a star, instead being a flat, asteroid-like mass with a vertical gravitational pull on its surface, mimicking conditions on other planets.\n\nAsgard possessed natural nexus portals due to deposits of the wormhole-sensitive, crystal-like material used in the construction of the Bifrost Bridge. These portals were in direct contact with the roots of Yggdrasil, a tree-like cosmic grid that connects the Nine Realms. The Asgardian government operated through a strict monarchy that separated the royal family from regular Asgardians.[1]\n\nAsgard was founded in the distant past under their first king, Buri; since his reign, Asgardians have protected the Nine Realms.[2] Buri's rule saw the construction of the Hall of Science and the Asgardian Dungeons, Asgard's first two major structures.[3]\n\nAfter Buri's death, his son Bor succeeded him as king. In the First Dark Elf Conflict, Bor and the Asgardians fought to prevent the Dark Elves, led by their king Malekith, from using the Aether to revert the universe to its previous state of darkness during the Convergence. The Asgardian army successfully put a stop to Malekith's campaign, with the surviving Dark Elf army retreating into suspended animation for 5,000 years.[1]\n\nFollowing Bor's death in battle, his son Odin ascended as king.[4] With his daughter and Executioner Hela at his side, Odin led Asgard into a violent conquest of the Nine Realms, building a wealthy and indomitable empire. Hela's ambitions exceeded the realms of Yggdrasil, however, and she began plotting a wider and bloodier conquest of other worlds.\n\nOdin, realizing at last the dangers posed by his warlike philosophy and, unable to reason with his daughter, banished her to Hel. Odin proceeded to strike all reference to his tyrannical daughter from Asgardian art and record, ensuring she was forgotten by history.[5]\n\nFollowing his daughter's banishment, Odin accepted that an enforced peace was the best way to keep order within the Realms, leading to a millennium of relative calm. The next threat to order within the Realms was the war between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants over Midgard and the Casket of Ancient Winters during the 10th century A.D. The Tesseract was also left on Earth by Odin hundreds of years ago. However centuries later, the reckless actions of Odin's son Thor nearly disrupted the peace between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants, almost causing another war by attacking Jotunheim, home to the Frost Giants.\n\nThe city of Asgard is now a collection of elaborate buildings and intricate spires. Seemingly built into the rock, large structures with sweeping terraces top many of the cliffs; gleaming pyramids, statues, and columns surround Odin's palace - Valhalla, a many-tiered structure resembling a towering pipe organ - at the center of the city. Another notable feature in Asgard is the Bifrost Bridge, which provides passage to all the Nine Realms, but can only be opened if permitted by its guardian, Heimdall. It also includes Odin's Vault which contains many powerful and ancient artifacts, including the Casket of Ancient Winters, which was nearly in possession of the Frost Giants again with the help of Loki.[6] Additionally, it is where the Hall of Asgard, where all important public events take place presided over by Odin, is located; colorful ceremonial banners of the Nine Realms adorn the vast chamber during celebrations, in which the hall is crowded with Aesir and representatives from across Yggdrasil. This was also where Thor's coronation took place. It was severely damaged by the latest Dark Elf attack in 2013.[1]\n\nAfter the Sacking of Asgard, Loki deceitfully replaced Odin as the king of Asgard, by casting illusions that made Loki look identical to his father Odin. Asgard hence temporarily stooped to a time of corruption in which Loki abused his powers as king, indulging in his individual entertainment and pleasure. Upon arriving at Asgard two years later, Thor could see straight through Loki's guise as Odin. He quickly publicly exposed Loki's trickery and deception to the wider Asgard.[5]\n\nThor and Loki's abrupt capture and absence from Asgard left it without a leader and thus defenseless. This gap in leadership was quickly filled by Hela, who stormed Asgard and forcibly took the throne. Asgardian civilization soon began to fall apart under her reign. Hela alone slew Asgard's entire army, killing Fandral, Volstagg, and Hogun. Hela defiled the city by resurrecting soldiers buried deep within Asgard, who terrorized and killed dissenting civilians. However, her occupation came to an abrupt end when Thor, Valkyrie, and Hulk came to reclaim Asgard, with Loki helping Heimdall safely relocate the Asgardian people.\n\nThis climactic fight over Asgard was unwinnable, as Hela was just too powerful. Thor subsequently ordered Loki to release Surtur, as it was the only way to ensure Hela's demise. Fully aware that releasing Surtur would also ensure the desolation of Asgard, Thor watched Asgard burn and particulate into the void.[5]\n\nIn 2023, the Avengers initiated the Time Heist, where they used the Quantum Realm to time travel through the Multiverse to acquire all six Infinity Stones from alternate past timelines in order to resurrect the victims of Thanos' Snap. Arriving in Asgard of an alternate 2013, Thor and Rocket are assigned with extracting the Aether from Jane Foster during her brief stay at the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf.\n\nWhile Thor conversed with Frigga, Rocket used a device to extract the Aether from Foster's body. The two then returned to their timeline, with Thor bringing with him the 2013 version of Mjølnir. After the Battle of Earth, Steve Rogers journeyed to the alternate 2013 to return the Reality Stone in its solidified state along with Mjølnir back to Asgard.[7]\n\nSylvie Laufeydottir lived in an alternate reality Asgard during her childhood. As she sat playing in the palace one day, the TVA appeared and arrested her for being a Variant. The TVA then set down a Reset Charge to prune the timeline.[8]\n\nIn her quest to gain vengeance against the Time Variance Authority, Sylvie Laufeydottir sent a Reset Charge through a Timedoor into Asgard. The Reset Charge was then detonated, creating a nexus event and a subsequent branched timeline. The TVA then traveled to the alternate Asgard and pruned the branched timeline.[9]\n\nIn an alternate 2010, the entirety of Asgard, including Asgardians living throughout the galaxy, was invited to Thor's Party on Midgard.[10]\n\nIn an alternate 2015, Asgard was targeted by Infinity Ultron, an android who was created for peace but went rogue and deemed life itself to be the ultimate threat to peace itself. Using the newly acquired Infinity Stones, Infinity Ultron used the Power Stone to obliterate Asgard and kill all of its population.[11]\n\nIn an alternate 1988, Asgard was targeted by Peter Quill, the offspring of the celestial Ego, who wanted to make the entire universe an extension of himself by planting seedlings in each and every planet. Quill completely destroyed Asgard, leaving Thor as the sole survivor of the tragedy.[12]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Surtur unleashed Ragnarök upon Asgard. Odin attempted to use the Tesseract against Surtur but was unable to prevent Asgard's destruction. Only the Tesseract survived as it was hurled towards Earth.[13]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Hela was Odin's top commander in his quest to conquer the realms. She lived on Asgard with her father until she had an argument with him about him wanting to stop at only Nine Realms. In response to this, Odin stripped her of her powers and banished her to Midgard to learn how to be merciful. When Hela bested her father in a battle on Midgard, she returned to Asgard as its rightful ruler.[14]",
