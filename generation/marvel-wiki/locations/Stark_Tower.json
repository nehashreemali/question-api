  "content": "Avengers Tower, formerly known as Stark Tower, was a high-rise building complex located in Manhattan, New York City. Constructed by Tony Stark, the tower was powered by an Arc Reactor that made it capable of running itself for over a year. The top ten floors housed the research and development initiatives. Following the dissolution of S.H.I.E.L.D., Stark Tower became the main headquarters of the Avengers.\n\nIn 2015, after the Ultron Offensive, Stark refurbished a Stark Industries warehouse upstate into the Avengers Compound to use as their primary base while Avengers Tower was repurposed for Stark Industries' use. In the aftermath of the Avengers Civil War, Stark sold the tower to Valentina Allegra de Fontaine and moved all of its equipment to the Avengers Compound. The tower, under its new ownership, had gone through extensive construction and renovation and was rebranded as the Watchtower.\n\nPepper Potts announced in a press conference that, after all damage resulting from the Stark Expo incident had been repaired at the expense of Stark Industries, the relationship between Stark Industries and New York City would make another step towards the future. She presented the plans for a structure acquired by Stark Industries, that would be transformed into the Stark Tower, the first completely clean energy-powered skyscraper in Manhattan, hoping it would become a model for future development in the city. During the press conference, Tony Stark called Potts to congratulate her and told her that he was waiting for her to have a date with a bottle of Dom Pérignon. Potts told Stark that she was going to give him the benefit of the doubt, stating she assumed that he remembered their date was the following night. Stark replied that he obviously remembered, while in Malibu altering one of his armors. A few months later, Stark helped in the construction of the Tower, lifting the giant letters in the front of the building as Iron Man.[2]\n\nIn 2012, Tony Stark finished installing the last piece of an Arc Reactor in the undersea wiring near New York City thanks to his armor, in order to disconnect the newly constructed Stark Tower from the general electricity network, making it the first self-sustaining building in New York. Stark contacted Pepper Potts while returning to the tower to tell her that she could turn on the power. Stark witnessed the Tower successfully light up, and flew back towards the tower.[3]\n\nAs Tony Stark landed on the Tower, J.A.R.V.I.S. informed him that Phil Coulson was trying to contact him, but Stark dismissed the call. Pepper Potts checked that the energy levels of the Tower were stable, and discussed with Stark how the idea about Stark Tower came from the Arc Reactor in Stark's chest. Stark suggested to Potts that she must attribute herself a 12 percent of the merit, and although he tried to justify himself, Stark realized the comment was inappropriate.\n\nCoulson called Stark again, annulling J.A.R.V.I.S.'s protocols, and although Stark tried to dismiss him again, Coulson appeared in the Tower where Potts greeted him on a first-name basis, to Stark's surprise.\n\nAs Coulson explained that his visit was not based on Stark's status as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D., he thought it had to do with the Avengers Initiative, even though that project had been discarded and Stark had been deemed as unsuitable. Coulson handed Stark a tablet containing files about the other candidates of the Avengers Initiative: Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, and Thor, about the Tesseract and Loki. Potts realized that she must leave Stark alone to let him focus in the task handed over by S.H.I.E.L.D.. and left.[3]\n\nDuring his quest to conquer Earth, Loki chose Stark Tower in New York City as the place to open his portal for the Chitauri with the Tesseract, in order to publicly beat the Avengers to assert his authority over the world. Erik Selvig installed the upgraded Tesseract Accelerator under Loki's control on the rooftop of Stark Tower, connecting to the Arc Reactor sustaining the tower.\n\nTony Stark arrived at Stark Tower and was informed by J.A.R.V.I.S. that the Arc Reactor had been disconnected, but the Tesseract was already activated. Stark asked Selvig to turn off the device, but Selvig said it was too late for it, so Stark tried to attack the device. The barrier surrounding the Tesseract knocked both Stark and Selvig down, breaking Loki's control over Selvig. Stark descended to the penthouse of the Tower to deal personally with Loki. Stark entertained Loki while J.A.R.V.I.S. prepared the Mark VII Armor. Stark offered Loki a drink, menacing him of how he should be afraid of the Avengers, as he pissed each and every one of them. Loki tried to control Stark, but as the Scepter touched the Arc Reactor in Stark's chest, the reaction was not the one he expected, and he couldn't control Stark. Angered by his failure, Loki threw Stark out of a window, and he was saved in the nick of time by the Mark VII Armor launched by J.A.R.V.I.S., who attached to him before hitting the ground. Stark went to confront Loki again, this time knocking him down with an attack of his repulsor gauntlets.[3]\n\nA portal to the Sanctuary was finally opened, and the first waves of the Chitauri began arriving above Stark Tower. Tony Stark managed to destroy the first Chitauri that crossed the portal, but their number soon proved to be more than Stark could handle alone. The Chitauri began spreading through the area surrounding Stark Tower and attacking civilians, while Loki beheld the destruction they were causing.\n\nThor arrived and ordered Loki to turn the Tesseract off or he would destroy it. Loki, instead, chose to fight Thor, and they battled on Stark Tower.[3] When a Quinjet carrying Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton came into view, Loki hit the Quinjet from the penthouse of Stark Tower with a shot from his Scepter, and they were forced to land near the Tower.[3]\n\nBlack Widow realized that they needed to destroy the Tesseract Accelerator and close the portal after containment proved to be overwhelming. Captain America helped her to jump on a Chitauri Chariot to quickly ascend to Stark Tower while the rest of the Avengers continued to battle the Chitauri. Loki began following Black Widow, shooting at her to prevent her from reaching the Tesseract, but Hawkeye was able to shoot him and knock him down from his vehicle, landing on Stark Tower. Hulk then jumped over to Stark Tower and brutally beat Loki.[3]\n\nTogether, the Avengers went to the penthouse of Stark Tower to confront Loki, who surrendered and now accepted the drink Stark offered him earlier.[3]\n\nLater, Tony Stark returned to Stark Tower with Pepper Potts, planning to transform the Tower into the Avengers headquarters, adapting it to the needs of each and every member.[3] New York Bulletin published an article called \"Stark Tower ruined during Battle of NY\".[4]\n\nStark Tower become a gathering point for fans of superheroes, including many cosplayers, hoping to see one of the Avengers. Skye approached Stark Tower once in cosplay.[5]\n\nIn early 2014, Tony Stark retold the story of his battle against Aldrich Killian to Bruce Banner at Stark Tower, detailing the story from the beginning in Switzerland. As Stark was wrapping the story and thanking Banner for listening, Stark realized Banner had been sleeping since almost the beginning of the tale. Banner excused himself as he was not a therapist and lacked the necessary temperament for it. Stark ignored this comment and began telling more stories of his life, much to the dismay of Banner who went to sleep again.[6]\n\nBy 2014, Stark Tower had been rebranded as Avengers Tower. As Tony Stark was inside the Tower at the time, it was one of the intended targets of Hydra's Project Insight. However, the Tower was not destroyed as Project Insight was successfully stopped.[7] In 2015, Phil Coulson found out the location of the Scepter and sent it to Maria Hill, who was working out of Avengers Tower.[8]\n\nIn 2015, Tony Stark decided to create weapons capable of seeking out and defeating Hydra’s remaining outposts and members, creating the artificial intelligence known as Ultron in the process.\n\nThe Avengers returned to Avengers Tower where Clint Barton was given medical aid by Dr. Helen Cho. All of his injured skin was repaired using a device called the Regeneration Cradle.\n\nLater, the Avengers hosted a celebratory party at Avengers Tower to celebrate their recent victory. Notable attendees to the party were James Rhodes and Sam Wilson. After the party was over, only the Avengers, Rhodes, and Maria Hill remained.\n\nAfter attacking J.A.R.V.I.S., the newly created Ultron launched an offensive against the Avengers inside of the Tower. While the Avengers fought back, Ultron recognized Cho's potential and one of his sentries fled with Loki's scepter. After his main body was destroyed, Ultron entered the Internet and spread across the world, filled with purpose about saving the world by exterminating the Avengers.[9]\n\nLater, the Avengers reunited in Avengers Tower alongside two new recruits, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. Having retrieved a device known as the Regeneration Cradle containing what was supposed to be Ultron's final body, Tony Stark opted to upload J.A.R.V.I.S. into it in order to use the body to fight Ultron, resulting in a disagreement with Steve Rogers and a brief brawl to ensue between him, Stark, Bruce Banner, and Maximoff. The fight was interrupted when Thor arrived and used Mjølnir to provide the power necessary to complete the upload.\n\nThe now activated synthezoid, dubbed Vision, showed the Avengers they could trust him after returning Mjølnir to Thor. Thor then told them that Vision carried the Mind Stone, which was one of the Stones he had seen in his vision. Vision then proceeded to persuade the Avengers into working together in order to stop Ultron. Shortly after, Clint Barton told them where Ultron was located. The Avengers suited up and departed the Tower in a Quinjet.[9]\n\nLater on in 2015, the Avengers relocated from Avengers Tower to a new base in upstate New York.[9] Despite this, Tony Stark continued to make use of the Tower and used it for Stark Industries purposes. However, in 2016, Stark decided to sell it[10] to Valentina Allegra de Fontaine[11] and arranged for Happy Hogan to transport any Avengers related items to the new base.\n\nAs the Stark Cargo Plane was being prepped to go, Vulture who was watching Avengers Tower, kept a close eye on the plane. Shortly after the plane left, it was hijacked by Vulture, who attempted to steal the entire inventory, until his efforts were impeded by Spider-Man.[10] In 2018, the Tower still retained the Avengers logo on the building.[12] Around this time, Wade Wilson was caught masturbating with toy Hulk hands in the tower's lobby.[13] Avengers Tower was later extensively remodeled[14] and was reconstructed as the Watchtower.[11]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Hulk destroyed Stark Tower while in New York City.[15]\n\nIn 2023, the Avengers used the Quantum Realm to time travel through the Multiverse as part of their Time Heist, arriving in an alternate 2012 during the Battle of New York. Iron Man, Captain America and Ant-Man entered the tower, while the alternate Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D. worked on apprehending Loki, his Scepter and the Tesseract. Captain America managed to procure the Scepter from undercover Hydra operatives, and briefly fought his alternate self.\n\nMeanwhile, as the alternate Tony Stark and Thor argued with Alexander Pierce, Ant-Man gained access to alternate Stark's Arc Reactor, causing him to experience a heart attack. While the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were distracted, Stark was able to steal the Tesseract, but before he could get away, he was struck by Hulk. Loki took the opportunity and reclaimed the Tesseract, using it to escape from the custody.[16]\n\nIn an alternate universe, a version of the Avengers Tower existed and was known as Qeng Tower. However, this version of New York City was pruned by the Time Variance Authority and sent to the Void, where part of the city, including the Tower, was left to decay. It remained present when Loki was pruned as well, landing in the Void near the destroyed Tower.[17]\n\nDuring the Battle of New York, Loki stationed himself at the top of Stark Tower. Captain Carter and Black Widow hitched rides on Chitauri skiffs to reach the top of the tower. There, they defeated Loki together.[18]\n\nIn an alternate 2015, Ultron gained control of America's nuclear codes and destroyed Earth. He retreated to the Avengers Tower to rest before Thanos appeared through a wormhole with the Infinity Gauntlet. Ultron became interested and used the Mind Stone to laser Thanos, killing him instantly, and seized the Infinity Stones from the Gauntlet. He then used the Reality Stone to build his army and departed the Tower.[19]\n\nIn an alternate 2014, Avengers Tower was attacked on Christmas Eve during the annual Christmas party by Justin Hammer and his goons, Sergei and Rusty, with the intent of acquiring Bruce Banner's blood. Sergei and Rusty held the guests at gunpoint while Hammer turned the Iron Legion against the tower's staff. Witnessing all this was Happy Hogan, who took it upon himself to stop Hammer.\n\nIn an attempt to evade gunfire from Sergei and Rusty and secure the blood sample, Hogan accidentally injected himself with it. Hogan managed to contact Darcy Lewis and tell her to restart the tower's mainframe with a backup AI, but while running away from the Iron Legion, Hogan fully transformed into a purple, Hulk-like being known as Freak. Lewis chose W.E.R.N.E.R. as the backup AI, but she and Maria Hill were captured. Freak organized an ambush, fighting through the Iron Legion in order to get to Hammer, only to find him in the Hulkbuster Armor. Nevertheless, Freak was still too strong for Hammer to handle.\n\nThe Avengers arrived, but mistook Freak for an enemy and battled him. Eventually, they realized Hammer was the enemy and teamed up to defeat him. Freak apologized to Tony Stark for allowing the attack to happen, but Stark was more concerned that Freak may never be able to turn back into Happy Hogan. As the group headed off to celebrate their victory, Thor arrived via the Bifrost Bridge and remarked that he had missed the party.[20]",
