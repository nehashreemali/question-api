  "content": "The Avengers Compound, also known as the New Avengers Facility, was a Stark Industries warehouse renovated by Tony Stark to become the Avengers' primary base of operations following the Ultron Offensive.\n\nAfter the Avengers Civil War, Stark sold Avengers Tower and moved all Avengers equipment to the compound, and used it as his primary place of residence. It was later annihilated before its ruins were the stage for the last battle against Thanos and his army for the fate of the universe.\n\nHoward Stark had established numerous Stark Industries facilities in the United States of America, including a warehouse in upstate New York, which was used to store some of Stark Industries equipment. Eventually, Stark Industries abandoned the warehouse, although some of the equipment, such as the Signal Decoy remained stored inside.[1]\n\nShortly after the Battle of Sokovia and Ultron's defeat, the Avengers reformed, so Tony Stark repurposed the Stark Industries warehouse into the Avengers Compound. With the assistance, provided by Nick Fury, Maria Hill, Erik Selvig, and Helen Cho, the Compound was used for scientific research, military training, weapons development, and the new Avengers program.\n\nUnaware of the Compound foundation, Hank Pym sent Scott Lang to infiltrate the facility and retrieve the Signal Decoy, assuming that it was still an abandoned warehouse. Lang still attempted to carry out the plan but was intercepted by Sam Wilson who detected Lang's presence through motion detectors. Following a brief duel, Lang managed to disable Wilson's EXO-7 Falcon and escape from the Compound after successfully retrieving the Signal Decoy.[1]\n\nIn 2016, Thaddeus Ross convened with the Avengers along with Tony Stark at the Avengers Compound to discuss the catastrophe in Lagos, which Wanda Maximoff and the Avengers were blamed for. Ross presented the Avengers with the Sokovia Accords which was supposed to restrict the Avengers' actions under the government supervision due to all conflicts they were involved in. Steve Rogers strongly opposed the idea of the government restriction, while Stark was rather supportive of it, causing the Avengers to split into two factions. Due to the growing unrest within the Avengers, Stark requested Vision to keep Maximoff under lockdown at the Compound until further notice.[2]\n\nShortly, Steve Rogers enlisted Clint Barton to rescue Wanda Maximoff from the Avengers Compound. Barton set off an explosion outside to distract Vision while he explained the situation to Maximoff. However, Vision interrupted them and set off Barton's electric trap, which he eventually escaped from and restrained Barton.\n\nMaximoff used her powers to control the Mind Stone forcing Vision to phase and release Barton. She then used her powers to increase Vision's density against his will until she slammed him through several stories of the Compound and deep into the ground, allowing Barton and Maximoff to escape.[2]\n\nFollowing the end of the Avengers Civil War, Tony Stark helped James Rhodes with physical therapy in his new exoskeletal brace, which allowed him to walk but ended his military and Avenger careers. Soon, Stark received a cellphone and a letter from Rogers, who apologized for keeping the truth about his parents' death from Stark and promised to be with him if he ever needed help.[2]\n\nIn the wake of the dissolution of the Avengers, Stark chose to live at the Avengers Compound after having it remodeled.[3] He built armors obsessively in the Compound, worrying Happy Hogan, who tried to get him to eat. Hogan talked to Stark about Rogers and Peter Parker while Stark worked, trying to perfect the gauntlet on his armor. They went for a walk outside, where Stark told Hogan that he wanted to keep better track of the Avengers so they could be prepared for future threats. Stark was interviewed by Chalmers, but left rather than answering questions regarding the Duel of Johannesburg.[4]\n\nStark, Vision, Rhodes, and Hogan continued to use the Compound as their place of residence and offered a room to Parker upon his invitation to become an official member of the Avengers. However, Parker declined, thinking he had more to learn before becoming an Avenger.[3] Stark then spent the weekened monitoring his nano-satellite, which Hogan joined him for. Stark stepped into another room for a call, so Hogan tried on the gauntlet to one of Iron Man armors. Stark returned and said that he was surprised Hogan waited as long as he did to try them on, and they agreed the suits were heavier than they appeared.[4]\n\nOn March 14, 2018, the Compound was visited by Wade Wilson, who had a meeting with Happy Hogan to discuss his wish to join the Avengers' ranks. After a very awkward interview, Wilson was politely dismissed and escorted out of Hogan's office, though the latter claimed that the team would be 'keeping an eye' on him.[5]\n\nIn 2018, Thaddeus Ross contacted James Rhodes via hologram in the Avengers Compound and the two were talking about the disappearance of Vision and his rescue by Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson. When Rogers and his team arrived with Vision and Wanda Maximoff, Rhodes ended the call and with the reassembled Avengers and Bruce Banner, who had arrived earlier, discussed their next move.\n\nBanner warned them that Thanos was after the Mind Stone. Although Vision agreed to sacrifice himself and let the Mind Stone be destroyed in order to prevent Thanos from obtaining it, however, Rogers did not allow it. He decided to go to Wakanda, where they could extract the stone from Vision without killing him. The Avengers took a Quinjet and flew left the Compound.[6]\n\nFollowing the Snap, the surviving Avengers and Rocket returned to the United States and, en route to the Avengers Compound, discovered a pager displaying a strange symbol which they recognized as having been activated by Fury who was one of the victims. At the Compound, they bypassed the battery in order to prevent it from running dry.\n\nAs the pager continued to transmit with James Rhodes monitoring, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Bruce Banner monitored the immense reports of casualties, making the full scale of the catastrophe horrifically clear. Rhodes reported that the pager had stopped transmitting, and Rogers requested that the signal is restarted, to Banner's objection as they had no idea who the signal was intended for.\n\nAs Romanoff explained that Fury knew and that she wanted to know herself, she suddenly discovered that Carol Danvers arrived, demanding to know where Fury was.[7] Shortly after her arrival at the Compound, Danvers set out to rescue Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space, managing to return them to Earth and to the Compound.[8]\n\nFollowing their arrival, the remaining Avengers assessed the casualties in the Snap. Following the briefing, Stark berated Rogers for their separation during the Infinity War, arguing that a suit of armor around the world could have prevented Thanos' success, although Rogers quickly argued back that such an idea failed to work before. Weakened from his prolonged time in space and sudden outburst, Stark fainted.\n\nAs Stark was administered medical care by Banner, the Avengers noted that Thanos' location was unknown following his escape after the Snap. Nebula revealed that Thanos planned to settle in a place known as \"the Garden\" once his plan was complete. Following a deep-space analysis, Rocket determined that the same energy signature emitted by the Snap was present on another uninhabited planet, Planet 0259-S, just two days prior.\n\nSurmising that Thanos was located there, Thor, Danvers, Rocket, Nebula, and the remaining Avengers sans Stark traveled there to confront him and regain the Infinity Stones to undo the Snap. However, Thanos revealed that he had destroyed the stones to prevent further use, making the Snap irreversible, before Thor killed him. Forced to live with their failure and annihilation of half the universe, the Avengers returned disheartened to Earth to the Compound.[8]\n\nBy 2023, many of the remaining Avengers had set out on their own missions and lives, with only Natasha Romanoff and Steve Rogers remaining in the Avengers Compound.\n\nFollowing a meeting between Romanoff and Okoye, Nebula, Carol Danvers, Rocket, and James Rhodes, Rhodes revealed to Romanoff that Barton had mass murdered the members of the Mexican Cartel as part of his campaign, much to Romanoff's distress. Later, Rogers offered to comfort Romanoff by making her dinner, but was interrupted by the arrival of Scott Lang.[8]\n\nLang revealed that he had been transported to the Quantum Realm where he was trapped for five hours, only to realize that five years had passed on Earth when he emerged. Realizing that such a phenomenon could allow for time travel, Lang proposed that the Avengers travel back in time to extract the Infinity Stones from the past in order to reverse the Snap in the present.\n\nWith the help of Bruce Banner, the Avengers managed to construct a makeshift time machine out of the quantum realm portal. Despite their efforts, however, their attempt to send Lang back in time was a failure, sending time through Lang instead. Having anticipated this failure and had a change of heart, Tony Stark drove to the Avengers Compound with a working Time-Space GPS, making amends with Rogers and agreeing to help.\n\nWhile Stark developed the time machine, the others were tasked with bringing together the rest of the Avengers, including Thor, Clint Barton, Rocket and Nebula who returned from space, and Rhodes.\n\nAs the Avengers reassembled, Banner, Nebula, and Lang worked on the Time Suit that would allow them to travel through the Quantum Realm, Barton agreed to use the time machine for one test run. The test run was a success, with Barton landing in his homestead in an alternate time period and returning to the present within seconds.\n\nHaving managed to create a safe, working time machine, the Avengers worked together to determine the best time periods to go back to, eventually deciding to go to New York City in 2012 for the Time, Space, and Mind Stones; Asgard in 2013 for the Reality Stone; and Vormir and Morag in 2014 for the Soul and Power Stones respectively. Later, working time-travel suits were made for all the Avengers, using the Ant-Man Suit as a basis for its design.[8]\n\nFollowing the successful Time Heist in which each Infinity Stone was extracted from the past and brought to the present, the Avengers regrouped in the hangar of the Avengers Compound, although, unbeknownst to them, an alternate version of Nebula from 2014 had been to replace her true self. After taking a moment to mourn Romanoff's sacrifice, the Avengers decided to move forth with their plan.\n\nAfter Tony Stark, Rocket, and Bruce Banner built a new Nano Gauntlet to house the Infinity Stones, Thor volunteered to use it, but was quickly advised against it due to his physical and mental condition. Instead, Banner decided to wield the Gauntlet, realizing that the gamma radiation within him would help him survive the Stones' power.\n\nDespite initially struggling under the raw power of wielding the Infinity Stones, Banner was able to snap his fingers and enact the Blip, restoring all the lives taken five years before.[8]\n\nWhile the Avengers were preparing to initiate the Blip, Nebula from the alternate 2014 activated the Quantum Tunnel, allowing Thanos and his army to enter the Quantum Realm in the Sanctuary II and exit through the Quantum Tunnel in the compound. Before the Avengers could notice, the Sanctuary II destroyed parts of Avengers Compound, blasting through the roof. Now in the sky, the ship fired several missiles at the Compound. A final larger missile successfully destroyed the entire Compound, creating a huge explosion across the entire compound and beyond, leaving a large black cloud filling the area and sky.[8]\n\nThe ruins of the Compound served as the battleground during the Battle of Earth. Sam Wilson, Peter Parker, Wanda Maximoff, Bucky Barnes, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Wong, and the Masters of the Mystic Arts, T'Challa, Shuri, and the Wakandan armies, the Asgardians, the Ravagers, Hope van Dyne, and Pepper Potts arrived there to participate. Parts of the main Compound remained still intact. During the battle, a dam broke by the lake next to the Compound, but this was stopped by Strange.\n\nAbout a week later, Bruce Banner was operating another Quantum Tunnel outside the destroyed Compound, which was concurrently being cleaned up.[8]\n\nBy 2024, the Compound's ruins had been scavenged. As such, certain artifacts, such as Ronin's suit and sword, and a Rolex watch owned by Laura Barton, were recovered and illegally auctioned on the black market.[9]\n\nIn an alternate universe, the Avengers had a training exercise in which team members fought holographic images of Thanos while running through the Avengers Compound corridors.[10]",
