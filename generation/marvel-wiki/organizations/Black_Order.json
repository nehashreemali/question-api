  "content": "The Black Order, also known as the Children of Thanos, was an elite team comprised of powerful individuals who used their abilities to serve their adoptive father Thanos.\n\nAs Thanos' vicious generals, they assisted him in his mission to find and harness the power of the Infinity Stones. Each of them had a specific superpower appropriate to their character.\n\nThe Black Order was created by Thanos as part of his modus operandi of adopting a child from one of the worlds that he conquered before killing half of the population. Thanos adopted six known children, Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight, Corvus Glaive, Cull Obsidian, the Zehoberei Gamora, and the Luphomoid Nebula, and trained them in the ways of combat, turning each of them into a deadly warrior. While the other four were unfailingly devoted and loyal to Thanos, Gamora and Nebula would come to resent their adopted father, the former having severe reservations about his goal and the latter for the torture he'd inflicted on her, coming to hate not only him but her adoptive siblings.[1]\n\nIn 2018, the Black Order joined Thanos on his mothership, the Sanctuary II, on his quest for the Infinity Stones. They accompanied him to Xandar where he obtained the Power Stone and participated in the attack on the Statesman to retrieve the Space Stone. While half of the Asgardians were allowed to escape, the other half were slain by the Black Order, with only Thor and Heimdall surviving. The Black Order stood guard around Loki to prevent him from doing anything against them.\n\nFollowing their victory, Ebony Maw delivered his traditional speech claiming that the sacrifice of the Asgardians helped to restore balance in the universe. Loki then announced that \"they had a Hulk,\" whereupon the Hulk attempted to attack Thanos, Cull Obsidian intended to intervene, but Ebony Maw stopped him. Although Hulk initially held the upper hand, Thanos easily defeated Hulk on his own. When Heimdall used his last forces to send Hulk on Earth with the Bifrost Bridge, Thanos impaled him with Glaive's weapon. When Thor protested Ebony Maw silenced him using a metal restraint and then gave the Tesseract to his adoptive father.\n\nWhen Thanos destroyed the Tesseract and attached the Space Stone to the Infinity Gauntlet, the Black Order were tasked with going to Earth to find the Mind Stone and the Time Stone. Proxima Midnight promised that they would succeed. Loki offered to guide them, but it was only a trick so he could attack Thanos before the Black Order could react. However, Thanos stopped Loki and murdered him in front of Thor. Using the power of the Space Stone, the Black Order then returned onto the Sanctuary II as Thanos destroyed the Statesman with the Power Stone.[2]\n\nBoth Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian hitched a ride on a Q-Ship to New York City, where the Masters of the Mystic Arts kept the Time Stone hidden in the Eye of Agamotto belonging to Doctor Strange. Once their ship arrived in the city, causing massive damage and panic, Maw and Obsidian both accosted Strange, accompanied by Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and Wong. As Ebony Maw grew tired of Stark's taunting, he ordered Cull Obsidian to go and fight.\n\nHowever, the defenders of Earth proved to be more than a match for the Black Order. Despite Banner's failure to turn into the Hulk, the remaining force frustrated the invaders. Although he seemingly gained the upper hand over Iron Man, Cull Obsidian also had to fight Peter Parker, whose Spider-Sense tipped him off to the conflict, forcing him to arrive and help his mentor. Meanwhile, Ebony Maw fought against the Masters of the Mystic Arts, who managed to wound him. This angered Maw and prompted him to fully commit to the battle. In order to get to Strange, Ebony Maw caused a fire hydrant to burst next to Wong and attacked Strange, blocking him with his telekinetic powers. However, Maw could not open the Eye of Agamotto, forcing him to abduct Strange onto the Q-Ship.\n\nAlthough both Spider-Man and the Cloak of Levitation attempted to stop him, Ebony Maw successfully escaped with an unconscious Strange. Cull Obsidian, however, was trapped by Wong who sent him to Antarctica through a portal, losing his left forearm in the process.[2]\n\nProxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive took their own Q-Ship to Scotland, where Vision, who carried the Mind Stone, attempted to live in peace with Wanda Maximoff. As Vision and Maximoff were wandering in the streets of Edinburgh, Corvus Glaive stealthily backstabbed Vision, preventing him from phasing. Maximoff attempted to stop him, but she was thrown into a store by Proxima Midnight. The Black Order then attempted to forcefully extract the Mind Stone from Vision.\n\nHowever, Maximoff returned and knocked Corvus Glaive and Proxima Midnight over before taking Vision away. The Black Order found them, and a double duel was engaged, with Proxima Midnight facing Maximoff while Corvus Glaive fought against Vision. Corvus Glaive managed to gain the upper hand over Vision, deflecting the Mind Stone's blast and attacking him one more time to remove the Mind Stone from his head. However, Maximoff, who had momentarily got rid of Proxima Midnight, rescued Vision. As they attempted to fly away, Proxima Midnight shot them in midair, forcing them to violently crash-land in a nearby train station.\n\nCorvus Glaive and Proxima Midnight found their target again and prepared to finish them. However, they soon had to deal with reinforcements: Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson, and Natasha Romanoff. In the ensuing battle, Corvus Glaive was heavily wounded by Romanoff and Proxima Midnight was almost defeated. Knowing that they were outnumbered, Proxima Midnight elected to retreat and took herself and the weakened Corvus Glaive back into the Q-Ship.[2]\n\nRefusing to return to Thanos without having fully accomplished his mission, Ebony Maw attempted to torture Doctor Strange with microsurgery needles so he would hand the Time Stone over. However, unbeknownst to him, Iron Man and Spider-Man had stealthily stowed away on his Q-Ship. Tony Stark confronted Ebony Maw, who mocked him for being no match to the Black Order. However, Iron Man blasted a hole in the spaceship's hull, causing Ebony Maw to be sucked into space and subsequently freeze to death. Thus, Ebony Maw was the first member of the Black Order to perish in the Infinity War.[2]\n\nProxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive rescued Cull Obsidian and led a massive army of Outriders to Wakanda, where the Avengers had taken Vision with the Mind Stone. Pretending that Glaive died, Midnight and Obsidian confronted Captain America, Black Widow, and Black Panther, claiming that Thanos would obtain the Mind Stone in the end, even if they had to sacrifice their whole army to complete their mission.\n\nProxima Midnight then ordered the Outriders to charge, and a massive horde soon swarmed out of the Wakandan forest, attacking the protective dome surrounding the Wakandan armies. When their opponents decided to open the barrier to stop the Outriders from flanking them, Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian joined the fray and began laying waste on the Wakandan armies. The Black Order then resorted to Threshers which caused even more casualties, prompting Wanda Maximoff, who had remained at Vision's side to be ready to destroy the Mind Stone, to join the battlefield as well.\n\nNoticing her presence, Proxima Midnight signaled Corvus Glaive to infiltrate the Wakanda Medical Center to get to Vision. Corvus Glaive entered the center, defeating the Wakandan guards, and knocked both Ayo and Shuri unconscious. Vision attempted to fight back, which caused both Glaive and Vision to fall out of the window into the forest.\n\nAs Cull Obsidian left to assist Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight remained in the core of the battle and attacked Scarlet Witch to keep her from helping Vision. Even with Scarlet Witch receiving backup with Black Widow and Okoye, Proxima Midnight successfully held her own against them and nearly defeated them. However, Scarlet Witch used her powers to project her under one of the Threshers, killing her.\n\nMeanwhile, Cull Obsidian and Corvus Glaive respectively fought against Bruce Banner using a Hulkbuster armor and Captain America who had come to Vision's rescue after he was wounded by Corvus Glaive. While Cull Obsidian was eventually killed by Banner who lured him into the protective dome using the Hulkbuster's gauntlet, which could be fired from the suit, before Proxima's death, Corvus Glaive defeated Captain America and nearly killed him.\n\nHowever, due to having dropped his weapon in the fight, Corvus Glaive was backstabbed by a weakened Vision using his very own weapon, thus putting an end to the fearsome Children of Thanos.[2]\n\nBy 2024, humans on Earth knew about the Black Order following their attacks in New York City, Edinburgh, and Wakanda. Despite it being six years later, people were still fearful that aliens like them could return. At a charity event for the Blip-displaced, a reporter asked Peter Parker what would happen if they were to come back.[3]",
