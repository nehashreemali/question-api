  "content": "Pym Technologies was a technology and scientific research company which specializes in nanotechnology and human enhancements, as well as molecular and atomic studies. After Hank Pym was ousted, Darren Cross took over as CEO, running the company as both Pym Technologies and Cross Technologies. The company went defunct following an attack on their headquarters until it was revived ten years later by Hope van Dyne and restructured into the Pym van Dyne Foundation.\n\nUpon leaving S.H.I.E.L.D. after the disappearance of his wife, Hank Pym founded his own company, Pym Technologies, in order to find her.[1] Pym Technologies advanced the fields of nanotechnology, human enhancements, and molecular and atomic studies; with Hank Pym earning a distinguished reputation in the technology community.[2]\n\nHank Pym was later voted out as CEO of Pym Technologies with his daughter Hope van Dyne casting the deciding vote. Hank Pym's estranged protégé, Darren Cross, became the new CEO and partially rebranded the company to Cross Technologies. although business was still conducted as Pym Technologies.[3] Hank Pym confiscated the Ant-Man Suit and kept the formula of Pym Particles a secret from Darren Cross in the following years. Since Cross' tenure as CEO, profits for Pym Technologies have risen but innovation has stopped, leading many to question how Pym Technologies will continue to remain profitable.[2] Darren Cross obsessively tried to replicate the Pym Particles and market his weaponized Yellowjacket Suit to military and nefarious organizations around the world.\n\nHank Pym enlisted Scott Lang to become the new Ant-Man and orchestrated a heist of the Yellowjacket Suit. Darren Cross caught wind of the heist and laid out a trap for Lang and his conspirators, Hope van Dyne and Hank Pym. Hank Pym was shot and wounded but Lang managed to escape his trap and pursue Cross who had taken the Yellowjacket suit. Hope van Dyne and Hank Pym enlarged a miniature tank Pym had been using as a keychain and used it to escape Pym Technologies Headquarters just before it exploded from the explosives they set. Cross later was defeated using the Yellowjacket Suit which was sabotaged by Lang during their duel.[3]\n\nThe Pym Technologies logo was on an arrow used by Clint Barton to change the size of things. Barton used one to make a wooden arrow grow and destroy a truck.[4] Kate Bishop later used it to shrink a Trust a Bro Moving Company truck.[5]\n\nFollowing the implosion of their headquarters in 2015, Pym Technologies was rendered defunct.[3] By 2025, however, Hope van Dyne revived the company and rebranded it as the Pym van Dyne Foundation, restructuring the company to focus specifically on the mass manufacturing of Pym Particles for global usage.[6]",
