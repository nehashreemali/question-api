  "content": "The Dora Milaje (English: Adored Ones)[1] are an elite group of warriors who serve as the all-female special forces for Wakanda as well as the Black Panther's personal bodyguards.\n\nThe Dora Milaje have been active for thousands of years. As early as 1260 BC they already had a working hierarchy, distinctive uniforms and weapon designs, and institutional norms, one of which was the capability for teamwork. A woman named Noni was expelled from the group for being unable to work with others, but was offered reinstatement by Akeya, the Dora Milaje's leader at the time, in exchange for completing a mission. The former Wakandan Royal Guard Nkati stole several Wakandan artifacts and went rogue.\n\nNoni's mission ended in Nkati's death and the scattering of his stolen artifacts. As promised, Akeya allowed her back into the Dora Milaje, but Noni declined as she felt her talents were better suited for the War Dogs.[2]\n\nThe Dora Milaje served King T'Chaka during his time as the Black Panther. In 1992, two Dora Milaje accompanied King T'Chaka to the apartment home of the undercover Prince N'Jobu in Oakland, California after arriving via stealth-craft. After confirming N'Jobu's identity, they struck their spears on the ground, causing the lights to go out during a short range EMP burst to allow the Black Panther an entrance. When the light returned, King T'Chaka was standing between them, as N'Jobu knelt per his standing. After removing his helmet, T'Chaka dismissed the Dora back to the Royal Talon Fighter on the roof.[3]\n\nIn 2016, following the death of King T'Chaka, T'Challa was escorted by Ayo, a member of the Dora Milaje, to his car when he learned from his Attaché that Bucky Barnes had escaped from the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building. The Attaché informed him their tracking satellites are in full tracking of Barnes, when the group was intercepted by Natasha Romanoff; of whom Ayo ordered out of their way or else she would be removed by force, to which T'Challa mused at as he dismissed her to hear what Romanoff had to say.[4]\n\nPrior to his coronation as King of Wakanda, T'Challa enlisted the aid of Okoye, General of the Dora Milaje, to assist him in recruiting Nakia, a War Dog and T'Challa's former lover. As they tracked her down, T'Challa prepared to intercept the slave convoy Nakia had infiltrated when Okoye reminded him not to freeze when he and Nakia saw each other, which T'Challa refuted before dropping from the Royal Talon Fighter.\n\nAs he descended, T'Challa released several EMP Beads onto the convoy, disabling their vehicles. After dispatching the guerillas on the ground, T'Challa hesitated when he saw Nakia, allowing one of the slave traders to get the drop on them, holding one of the women at gunpoint until Okoye appeared, disarming and impaling him with her spear. She then dryly remarked that T'Challa froze as expected, much to the prince's chagrin.\n\nAfter freeing the slaves, Okoye ordered the group to never speak of the events they'd just witnessed before the Wakandans took off in the Royal Talon Fighter, leaving the group awestruck. Okoye piloted the Flyer back to Birnin Zana, and by the coming morning had entered into Wakanda.[3]\n\nAs the three entered Birnin Zana, they were greeted by Dora Milaje escorts, led by Ayo, accompanying Princess Shuri and Queen Mother Ramonda. After having a brief conversation with Shuri, Okoye dismissed the rest of Dora escorts, leading them away to prepare for the festival. Nakia departed to redress so as to arrive in her traditional River Tribe attire.\n\nLater, as the leaders of the Wakandan Tribes and their warriors journeyed down the river to Warrior Falls, the Dora Milaje struck their spears on their riverboat, activating the drainage system for the waterfall. The falls reduced to reveals a hidden space just below the cusp of the waterfall, which allowed for the Tribal Elders to gather and visitors to bear witness. As the ceremony commenced, the Dora Milaje took their places along the edge of the Falls while Zuri asked for challengers from the Wakandan tribes to face T'Challa in ritual combat to fight for the mantles of Black Panther and King of Wakanda.\n\nWhen none of the tribes chose to challenge, the Jabari Tribe had then arrived, led by M'Baku. Entering in tribal chant, M'Baku, believing the Golden Tribe had weakened Wakanda's character, challenged T'Challa, who accepted after hearing the Jabari leader speak of his late father T'Chaka. As the ritual combat began, both leaders commanded their warriors to take up position surrounding the combatants, with both Jabari tribesmen and Dora Milaje forming a semi-circle boundary with their spears, drawing closer whenever a combatant was downed or nearing the precipice. Ultimately, T'Challa bested M'Baku, much to Okoye's relief as the Wakandans celebrated their new king.[3]\n\nWith the surprise of arrival of Erik Killmonger with the corpse of Ulysses Klaue, Okoye then informed T'Challa of Killmonger's arrival, just as the King also learning at the moment about Killmonger's service record by a recovered Everette Ross. After W'Kabi brought Killmonger before the Wakandan Council, the Dora Milaje stood ready in the Council Chamber to protect the King and Council Members from the potential threat. But upon his revelation as N'Jobu's son, proved by his possession of his father's Wakandan Royal Ring, the Dora Milaje were duty bound not to interfere as Killmonger claimed his bloodright to challenge for the throne and mantle.\n\nAt Warrior Falls, the Dora Milaje stood by as the challenge played out. As the challenge was informal, and Killmonger was of no tribe, the Dora stood to witness. They observed as T'Challa was removed of the power of the Black Panther, to fight as a mortal man, and battle Killmonger to an eventual losing battle. Okoye held back her concern for T'Challa out of her duty as a Dora to serve whoever may be king. But it was Zuri who broke the clause of non-intervention and prevented a killing blow from Killmonger, thus turning the lost prince's bloodlust onto him. After witnessing T'Challa's supposed death being thrown off the edge at Warrior Falls, the Dora stood to serve their new King and Black Panther; however, Okoye allowed Nakia to take Ramonda and Shuri into exile to save them from their cousin's wrath.[3]\n\nAs Erik Killmonger was preparing forces to disseminate Wakandan weapons to War Dogs, all were surprised as T'Challa had revealed himself alive by grounding an aircraft. Seeing as he neither died nor yielded, the Challenge for the throne was still ongoing.\n\nWhen Killmonger ordered the Border Tribe to attack T'Challa instead of finishing the challenge himself, General Okoye ordered the Dora Milaje to stand against him, as Killmonger was no longer acknowledged by tradition as the rightful King. Stating that his hatred and dishonor made him unsuited for the Wakandan throne or mantle of Black Panther, Okoye led a small squad to fight Killmonger while Ayo led the remaining members against the Border Tribe on the slope of Mount Bashenga. Following the M'Baku's reinforcements, the Dora Milaje and Jabari Tribe were victorious and the remaining Border Tribes men laid down their weapons and kneeled.[3]\n\nIn 2018, the Dora Milaje stood alongside T'Challa when he greeted members of the Avengers upon their arrival in Birnin Zana. Later, they rode in troop hover tanks to the edge of the outer force field. They then stood alongside members of the Border Tribe, the Jabari Tribe, and the Wakandan Royal Guard and fought bravely in the battle against the Outriders. The joint Avenger Wakandan forces waged a long battle, suffering many casualties before the arrival of Thor, Rocket, and Groot which turned the tide of battle in their favor and they had managed to defeat the Outriders.\n\nMoments later, Doras on the battlefield watched helplessly as Wakandan warriors disintegrated into dust before them.[6]\n\nFive years later, following the Blip, the Dora were transported via an Inter-Dimensional Portal by the Masters of the Mystic Arts to fight with their king, princess, and commander in the battle against an alternate Thanos and his alien army.[7]\n\nAssata grew up admiring the Dora Milaje, dreaming of joining them. However, her disability required her to use a wheelchair, so Assata met with Okoye about potentially joining. Okoye offered Assata a modified training regimen that would allow her to become a Dora. However, Assata had been made to feel as though it were impossible, so she rejected the offer and chose to study science instead.[8]\n\nIn 2024, three Dora Milaje members, Ayo, Yama, and Nomble travelled to Riga, Latvia to arrest Helmut Zemo after learning he had escaped prison.[9] There Ayo met with Bucky Barnes and told him that he had eight hours before they would come back.\n\nAfter the hours had passed, they returned and then engaged in a fight with John Walker and Lemar Hoskins, with Zemo escaping in the skirmish. Barnes and Sam Wilson intervened to stop them, in which they ultimately did and left after finding Zemo gone.[10]\n\nAfter getting updated on Zemo's location by Barnes, the Dora Milaje went to Sokovia and took Helmut Zemo into custody at the Sokovian Memorial. Ayo told Barnes that they would take Zemo to the Raft, before Barnes asked them for another favor.[11]\n\nAssata was presented with the ability to join the Wakandan Design Group alongside Shuri, which caused her to feel conflicted about whether she should join the Design Group of the Dora Milaje. She talked with M'Baku about her conflict, and he inspired her to turn down Shuri's offer and decide to join the Dora Milaje. Assata approached Okoye and asked to join, prompting Okoye to ask about Assata's previous belief that it was impossible. Assata explained that while being disabled meant she would need to take a different path than others, she should still follow her dreams. Okoye expressed pride and began Assata's training.\n\nWeeks later, Assata was approached by Shuri and Ramonda during her Dora Milaje training. Assata cheerfully greeted Ramonda, who returned the greeting using Assata's name. She told Assata that everyone would know her name, since she had the courage to dream.[8]",
