  "content": "The New Avengers, previously named the Thunderbolts by Alexei Shostakov, are a team of extraordinary individuals, with either superpowers or other special characteristics. They were assembled in 2027 as a result of being targeted by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine and working together to stop the Void from taking over New York City. Following their victory, de Fontaine manipulated the situation to declare the team as the newly formed iteration of the Avengers, which was met with a mixed reception from the public.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Red Room, Antonia Dreykov, also known as Taskmaster, was freed from control and able to live her own life.[4] Knowing only how to be a highly-trained killer, Dreykov encountered Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, who recruited her to work for O.X.E. as an assassin, supplying her with a new suit.[5]\n\nUpon being cured of her disease but retaining her powers, Ava Starr, dubbed Ghost, went on the run for her crimes committed while trying to save her life.[6] Starr was later found by de Fontaine and recruited to complete various missions for her, utilizing her unique abilities with the support of a new suit.[5] When John Walker was stripped of his title of Captain America after a public incident, he was approached by de Fontaine, who was aware that he had received the Super Soldier Serum and told him that they would be in contact.[7] Walker took up de Fontaine's offer and was provided with a new suit and given the moniker U.S. Agent.[8]\n\nOnce Yelena Belova, a former Black Widow operative from the Red Room, returned during the Blip, she sought work that made the most of her skills,[9] and came into connection with de Fontaine. One of the missions de Fontaine assigned Belova was to kill Clint Barton, telling her that Barton was responsible for Natasha Romanoff's death.[4] Following the shut down of Project Sentry, de Fontaine tasked U.S. Agent and Belova seperate missions to destroy evidence towards its existence.[5]\n\nTo erase all evidence towards her illegal activities, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine orchestrated to have all of her shadow operatives kill each other. De Fontaine instructed Yelena Belova, U.S. Agent, Ghost, and Taskmaster to enter an O.X.E. Vault in Utah and assigned each of them an operative to eliminate. The four arrived at the vault, where U.S. Agent shot at Belova, but was stopped by Taskmaster who attacked him. Ghost joined the fight and attempted to kill Taskmaster, but Belova stepped in and fought Ghost.\n\nThe fight was brought to a stop when Ghost shot Taskmaster in the head, and the remaining three held each other at gunpoint as the vault closed around them. They were interrupted when Bob Reynolds revealed himself, so they all questioned who he was and whether he had been sent. The three mercenaries argued over their mission until Belova figured out that de Fontaine had sent them all to kill each other as a cover up. Ghost went to leave, but her powers were disabled by a high frequency sound barrier.\n\nAn alarm went off, and they discovered that the room they were in was an incinerator, which would burn them and everything within two minutes, so they rushed to figure a way out. Belova found the power source for the sound barrier, which U.S. Agent destroyed, allowing Ghost to phase out of the room. With only a few seconds left, Ghost opened the vault doors, and Belova, U.S. Agent, and Reynolds quickly escaped before being burned alive and killed.[5]\n\nGhost revealed that the power had been cut to the elevators, so the group entered the elevator shaft and discussed how to get up. Bob Reynolds came up with the idea for them to lock arms and walk up against the walls. As they ascended, Yelena Belova and Ghost compared their tragic pasts, which U.S. Agent felt was not that bad.\n\nOnce they reached the top, U.S. Agent broke the hold to save himself, and the others managed to prevent themselves from falling. On the surface, the group went to leave the facility, but discovered that they were surrounded by O.X.E. U.S. Agent attempted to make a plan, but the others rejected him taking the lead. Briefly discussing their pasts again, with Belova mentioning her little league soccer team, the West Chesapeake Valley Thunderbolts, she then made a plan for them to set off an explosion, have the soldiers enter using night-vision, which would allow her to blind them so that U.S. Agent could defeat them, all while Ghost acquired them a getaway vehicle.\n\nGhost disappeared, but Belova, U.S. Agent, and Reynolds proceeded with the plan. Belova set off an explosion at the entrance, which drew the soldiers inside. As she and Reynolds went to switch on the lights, U.S. Agent waited to attack. However, the power did not come back on, so U.S. Agent was forced to fight the first wave, successfully eliminating them all. Belova and Reynolds regrouped with Walker, disguised themselves in the soldiers' uniforms, and made their way outside, where Ghost was waiting inside a truck.\n\nThey all got inside and drove away, but without Reynolds, who decided to sacrifice himself to ensure their escape. As they drove away, they witnessed Reynolds, who had been gunned down by O.X.E., fly into the sky. Reynolds then came crashing down, which caused a powerful shockwave to knock the vehicle off the road. Belova, U.S. Agent, and Ghost continued on foot and discussed Reynolds, learning that he was a part of Project Sentry from the files Belova stole from the vault.\n\nThe trio talked about the condition of the lives that they all lived, with Ghost reflecting on Taskmaster with Belova, and U.S. Agent commenting on having a family. By morning, the three were still walking through the desert until they spotted a limousine approaching them. They discovered that the driver was Belova's father, Red Guardian, who had arrived to save them from being killed in the vault by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.\n\nAs they drove away, Red Guardian expressed his approval of Belova's new allies, believing that they were a team, leading U.S. Agent to sarcastically cheer for the Thunderbolts. Red Guardian misunderstood this as Belova dubbing her new team after her soccer team. Belova and U.S. Agent stated that they needed to get as far away as possible and split up, but Red Guardian was determined for them to band together to become a team of heroes that would put a stop to de Fontaine's plans.\n\nThe limo was attacked by an approaching convoy, so U.S. Agent used his shield to block the bullets from hitting them. Red Guardian and Ghost both made attempts to fight back, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Belova went to fire back at the convoy, but they were saved when Winter Soldier arrived and swiftly destroyed O.X.E. vehicles. The team celebrated their escape, but it was cut short when Winter Soldier shot a Disc Grenade at the limo, causing it to crash.[5]\n\nWinter Soldier restrained the Thunderbolts and brought them to an abandoned garage, planning to use them as evidence against Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in her impeachment trial. The Thunderbolts explained the situation to Winter Soldier, including Bob Reynolds, but he did not believe them. However, after Winter Soldier was called by Mel Gold, who confirmed the dangers of Project Sentry, he freed the Thunderbolts, telling them that they were all going to stop de Fontaine. Yelena Belova felt that they were not the right people to help, but Winter Soldier motivated them to face their pasts and do the right thing.[5]\n\nThe Thunderbolts departed for New York City, acquiring a moving truck as they headed for the Watchtower. During the drive, Yelena Belova, U.S. Agent, and Ghost sat in the back and discussed their equipment, while Winter Soldier and Red Guardian talked about the Super Soldier Serum they received.\n\nAs they were approaching the Watchtower, Red Guardian asked about the plan, which was just for Winter Soldier to crash through the entrance. The Thunderbolts rushed out of the truck and fought against the group of O.X.E. agents gathered in the area. Being significantly more skilled, the Thunderbolts quickly defeated the agents. However, they then heard Valentina Allegra de Fontaine over the intercom, who claimed that she left the door unlocked, and invited them up to confront her.\n\nThe Thunderbolts entered the elevator and went up to the top floor, where de Fontaine was waiting for them by the bar. The Thunderbolts surrounded de Fontaine, telling her that they were putting a stop to her plans and would have her impeached. De Fontaine addressed each of the Thunderbolts individually and dismissed their efforts to bring her down. De Fontaine then remarked on them becoming a team after she had sent them to kill each other. Winter Soldier went to grab de Fontaine, but his hand was stopped, so de Fontaine revealed that she was not alone and called out for Bob Reynolds.\n\nThe Thunderbolts witnessed Reynolds join them, now wearing a gold suit, and de Fontaine introduced him as Sentry. De Fontaine explained that Sentry was more powerful than all of the Avengers combined, and that she planned to unveil him as Earth's mightiest hero after defeating the Thunderbolts. Red Guardian announced the team as the Thunderbolts and they all attacked Sentry, only to be incredibly overwhelmed and shortly defeated, forcing them all to retreat from the Watchtower.[5]\n\nThe Thunderbolts exited the Watchtower, defeated, but Red Guardian attempted to convince them to keep fighting. U.S. Agent stated that Sentry was too powerful and that they were not a real team, but Red Guardian did not accept that, declaring their name again, which Winter Soldier did not understand, so Ghost explained it. Amidst the arguing, Yelena Belova snapped and insulted the group before walking away.\n\nThe Thunderbolts split off, with Red Guardian following Belova and comforting her. They all noticed Sentry in the sky, although he had now been taken over by Void and caused a crane to collapse, resulting in debris to fall. Red Guardian, Belova, Winter Soldier, Ghost, and U.S. Agent all rushed to save civilians from the chaos. U.S. Agent stopped a giant piece of debris from crushing a woman by holding it up, but it was too heavy, so the rest of the Thunderbolts helped him push it over.\n\nThe Thunderbolts were applauded for their efforts saving the people of New York City, only for it to be short-lived when Void started sending several people around them into his dimension. Void started to spread his darkness across the city, so the Thunderbolts helped whoever they could evacuate to safety. The Thunderbolts noticed that Belova had not come with them, but instead approached Void and intentionally walked into the darkness, which consumed her as another victim.\n\nThe remaining Thunderbolts debated their next course of actions, with Red Guardian and Ghost wanting to go after Belova, but Winter Soldier tried to stop them. U.S. Agent shared that he experienced Reynolds' powers before, and thought that Belova knew what she was doing, so they rest of the Thunderbolts followed into the darkness. Inside Void's dimension, Belova found Reynolds, but they were both attacked. The other Thunderbolts found the two and saved them, and they decided to find the worst room in order to escape.\n\nThe Thunderbolts found themselves at the facility, where Reynolds was experimented on, and they were confronted by Void. All of the Thunderbolts were pinned against the walls, leaving only Reynolds. As Reynolds faced Void and began attacking it, he started to become consumed by Void, which was what it wanted. Belova was able to break free and rushed to Reynolds, followed by the rest of the Thunderbolts, who all comforted him, freeing him from Void's grip and restoring the city.[5]\n\nWith New York City and Bob Reynolds saved, the Thunderbolts went to apprehend Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. However, de Fontaine tricked them into walking to the press conference she had prepared for Sentry, where she instead presented the Thunderbolts as a team she had been assembling to protect the city, announcing them as the New Avengers. The group was perplexed, but Yelena Belova decided to go with the ruse, whispering to de Fontaine that they owned her.\n\nEmbracing their opportunity as the New Avengers to be the heroes they aspired to be, the team established their headquarters in the Watchtower and were supplied new uniforms with matching logos. Reynolds continued to stay with the team, although he did not operate as Sentry at risk of unleashing the Void. Despite the government approving the team's activity, the public's response was mixed, with many not accepting the team in comparison to the original Avengers.[5]\n\nFourteen months later, the New Avengers came into conflict with Sam Wilson over the legitimacy of their team, as he was also in the process of assembling his own Avengers. The New Avengers discussed this dispute, with Yelena Belova wondering which team would be the real Avengers, and U.S. Agent answered that according to online discourse, it was not them. Winter Soldier revealed that he spoke with Wilson, but it went poorly.\n\nBelova added that Wilson had also filed for copyright over the Avengers name, which was making them lose credibility, although Ghost noted that they barely had any to begin with. Red Guardian suggested that they rebrand as the \"Avengerz\" to solve their problem, but he was ignored. They were then alerted of an unidentified craft entering Earth's orbit, so they checked the satellite footage, and discovered an extra-dimensional ship with a \"4\" on it approaching.[5]",
