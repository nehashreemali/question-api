  "content": "The Masters of the Mystic Arts are an order of sorcerers who are committed to protecting the Earth from mystical threats.\n\nThe Masters of the Mystic Arts were founded by Agamotto thousands of years ago. Following his discovery of other dimensions, Agamotto found ways to draw power from these alternate universes to create magic spells. Realizing that these dimensions could also present existential threats to Earth, Agamotto established the Masters of the Mystic Arts: a league of sorcerers dedicated to safeguarding the world from extradimensional evil.\n\nThreats the Masters were trained to combat included dark sorcerers, ghosts, demons, and dark gods that would enter their universe with malicious intent. The greatest multidimensional force to ever threaten Earth was Dormammu, ruler of the Dark Dimension, who sought to absorb Earth's plane into his own. To aid in their mission, the Masters created three sanctums in New York City, Hong Kong, and London respectively, generating a ward that kept Dormammu from passing through.\n\nThe Masters acquired the Time Stone and swore an oath to protect it with their lives, containing it within the Eye of Agamotto.[1]\n\nAnother threat that came through was the E'kolith, which started to rule Earth and make human sacrifices, although one of the Masters of the Mystic Arts managed to banish it.[2]\n\nWong had been tasked with locating and securing the Dark Sceptre by the Ancient One. An object of immense power, the Scepter had been stolen by a woman who had grown scornful against the world. Wong tracked her down to London and attempted to take the Staff from her. However, the power of the Dark Scepter proved to be strong and the woman managed to escape. Back at Kamar-Taj, Kaecilius scorned Wong for losing the woman and the scepter, but Wong insisted that with the power that the woman possessed with the Scepter, the situation should be handled more reverently.\n\nKaecilius claimed Wong's concentration on his own failings was the reason the mission was not a success. Daniel Drumm and Tina Minoru then arrived and told Kaecilius that Wong's trepidation should be a sign to be careful and heed his instincts rather than just insult him. When Kaecilius asked why they were not doing their other duties, Drumm told him the situation proved serious enough that more than one member of the order was needed to subdue the thief. Kaecilius refused and claimed that he could handle the thief himself. Wong, Drumm, and Minoru later arrived to find an unconscious Kaecilius who had been beaten by the thief, having underestimated the power of the Staff.\n\nKaecilius realized the others were right and decided to team up to stop the thief. Later at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, the group confronted the thief. In a grueling battle, with their combined efforts they were able to overpower her and claim the Scepter. Wong put it with all the other mystical objects at the New York Sanctum.[3]\n\nWhen the Bow and Arrow of Apollon were separated, the Masters of the Mystic Arts kept tabs on the relics. Jiāo'ào Zhànshì stole the bow, and terrorized a village named Guizhou in China to find the arrow. They found the arrow and destroyed several buildings within the village, prompting Karl Mordo and the Ancient One to go to Guizhou. They demanded that Zhànshì give them the bow and arrow, but Zhànshì refused and fired at them. The Ancient One deflected the arrow, surprising the Dragon Raiders and leading to a battle, which Mordo and the Ancient One easily won. The Ancient One convinced Zhànshì to hand the bow and arrow over, so it was placed safely in one of their sanctums.[3]\n\nKaecilius began to grow discontent with the truths that he was being taught by the Ancient One. Failing to find peace or acceptance in the death of his wife, he grew angry that his attempts to delve into magic that would restore what he had lost were rebuffed by the Ancient One. This disillusion reached its zenith when he discovered that the Ancient One was sustaining her life force and extending her lifespan by drawing upon the energies of the Dark Dimension, the dominion of Dormammu, a clear violation of the tenet of preserving the natural law. Reaching out to other disaffected practitioners amongst the students of the Masters, he began to indoctrinate them on the ways that the Ancient One was holding them back. They formed a group known as the Zealots, with the mission of obtaining the most guarded secrets of the Ancient One.[1]\n\nAs Wong and Karl Mordo educated Doctor Strange about the purpose of the Masters of the Mystic Arts, they discovered that Kaecilius and the Zealots had killed the protector of the London Sanctum, Sol Rama, and destroyed the London Sanctum in a massive explosion, throwing Strange into the New York Sanctum and isolating him from his allies.\n\nAs Strange explored the New York Sanctum in New York City, he found Kaecilius and the Zealots killing its protector, Daniel Drumm, and began fighting Strange. He managed to fend off the attackers and attempted to escape. However, Kaecilius trapped him and manipulated the hallways to harm Strange. During the battle, Strange managed to exile two of the Zealots using the Rotunda of Gateways and combated Kaecilius. However, as he was about to kill Doctor Strange with a Space Shard, the Cloak of Levitation appeared and rescued Strange, eventually persuading him to use the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak and immobilizing Kaecilius.\n\nAs Kaecilius was immobilized, he explained his motivations to summon Dormammu and bring the Dark Dimension to Earth to free the world from the burdens of time and death. He also explained that the Ancient One maintains her immortality by drawing power from the Dark Dimension. Suddenly, Lucian Aster appeared and stabbed Doctor Strange with a Space Shard, mortally wounding him.[1]\n\nAs Lucian Aster approached the wounded Doctor Strange to kill him, the Cloak of Levitation fought and ensnared Lucian which bought time for Strange to conjure a portal to the Metro-General Hospital to heal himself. At the Metro-General Hospital, he sought help from Christine Palmer to help him perform surgery on his wound. Strange emerged in his astral form to help Palmer in surgery, much to her surprise.\n\nMeanwhile, Aster emerged in his astral form and followed Strange to the Metro-General Hospital. Soon after, Strange and Aster fought each other in the Astral Dimension, flying wildly across the hospital but only slightly disturbing physical objects in the real world. As Strange's body started flat-lining, Palmer used a defibrillator on him, which ended up violently shocking Aster. Discovering this advantage, Strange told Palmer to increase the voltage and shock him again. As she shocked his body, Strange grabbed his body and channeled the electrical current through his astral form into Aster, which killed his astral form and his physical body.[1]\n\nAs Doctor Strange returned from the Metro-General Hospital back to the New York Sanctum, he found the body of Lucian Aster and discovered that he had killed him. He met with the Ancient One and Karl Mordo and discovered that Kaecilius had escaped from the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. The Ancient One was impressed with his defense of the New York Sanctum, declaring Strange as the new Master of the New York Sanctum. He refused and rebuffed her for calling upon power from the Dark Dimension which Mordo denied.\n\nThen, Kaecilius and the Zealots returned to destroy the Sanctum and Strange sent them to the Mirror Dimension to protect the people of New York. Mordo reprimands him for this saying that since their power comes from the Dark Dimension, their power is amplified in the Mirror Dimension. Just as the two Masters were going to lose, The Ancient One appears with the mark of Dormammu on her forehead, confirming that she was calling upon the power of the Dark Dimension. While the Masters of the Mystic Arts won, the Ancient One was mortally wounded.[1]\n\nAfter the Ancient One died in New York City, Wong, Tina Minoru, and their fellow Masters of the Mystic Arts, having learned of the destruction of the London Sanctum and the New York Sanctum, prepared to battle Kaecilius and the Zealots in order to protect the Hong Kong Sanctum. Kaecilius and the Zealots arrived via Sling Rings to Hong Kong and fought the Masters of the Mystic Arts. However, during the battle, Wong and the Masters were killed and the Sanctum was destroyed, allowing Dormammu to engulf Earth into the Dark Dimension.\n\nDoctor Strange and Karl Mordo arrive from New York City to find Wong dead and the Hong Kong Sanctum destroyed. As Kaecilius charged Doctor Strange with a Space Shard, Strange used the Eye of Agamotto to reverse time, reviving Wong, trapping Kaecilius, and undoing the destruction to the Hong Kong Sanctum and the surrounding area. However, Kaecilius and the Zealots broke free and attacked Strange and Mordo. During their confrontation, Kaecilius managed to interrupt the Eye of Agamotto before the Sanctum could be restored, thus allowing Dormammu to engulf Earth into the Dark Dimension, regardless of their efforts.[1]\n\nLeft with no other option, Doctor Strange traveled to the Dark Dimension and confronts Dormammu to bargain for Earth's protection. Angered by his proposition, Dormammu destroyed Strange by blasting him with energy. However, Strange reappeared and repeated his bargain. Confused by his reappearance, Dormammu killed the confident Strange over and over again to no avail. Strange explained that using the Eye of Agamotto, he created an infinite time loop which trapped Strange and Dormammu in the Dark Dimension forever, using a force that didn't exist in that dimension until now, which made the primordial being his prisoner. Dormammu then begged to release him from the time loop, where he agreed to spare Earth if he took Kaecilius and the Zealots to the Dark Dimension and never return.\n\nAs Strange returned to Earth, Kaecilius and his followers began turning into particles and gravitated into the Dark Dimension before it disappeared. Strange then used the Eye of Agamotto once again to reverse time and undo the damage done to the Hong Kong Sanctum and the city. Despite their victory, Karl Mordo becomes disillusioned with Strange and the Ancient One's blatant disregard for manipulating reality and disobeying the rules and departs from the Masters of the Mystic Arts.[1]\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, Doctor Strange and Wong went back to Kamar-Taj, where Strange returned the Eye of Agamotto upon realizing he was not yet worthy to wield the Time Stone's power to change the fabric of reality and time alike. Wong then reminded Strange that the New York Sanctum was still without a protector, in the wake of Daniel Drumm's death. Strange accepted his new duty, donning the Cloak of Levitation and entering a portal towards the Sanctum as its new Master.[1]\n\nAs Wong attempted to write about the conflict with Kaecilius, Stephen Strange started receiving headaches and visions of a creature named Kalkartho preparing to consume all of the energy from Earth. Strange meditated and recruited Wong to help fight it, having come up with the idea to use the Bonds of Baelzar to trap Kalkartho. The pair attempted to lure the creature away from Earth using energy from the Magenta Dimension, but it did not work, so they instead lured it to the New York Sanctum and used the Bonds to trap it in the barren Magenta Dimension, where it could feed on the Dimension's energy forever.[2]\n\nIn 2018, two members of the Masters of the Mystic Arts, Doctor Strange and Wong, were met by Bruce Banner, who had fallen into the New York Sanctum via Bifrost Bridge. He alerted them to Thanos's impending arrival to take the Time Stone and his crusade to collect all Infinity Stones. Deciding to enlist some reinforcements, Strange invited Tony Stark to the Sanctum, where he and Wong explained the history of the Infinity Stones and detailed the threat they faced. Strange and Wong explained that they had sworn an oath to protect the Time Stone, meaning that they could not destroy it no matter the circumstance.\n\nThey were soon made aware of the Black Order's arrival in New York City from the presence of a Q-Ship. The Masters of the Mystic Arts and Stark fought together against Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian. However, despite Wong transporting Obsidian to Antarctica, and Peter Parker's assistance, Strange was abducted by Maw and taken into his Q-Ship to be brought to the planet Titan. This left the Masters of the Mystic Arts heavily weakened, prompting Wong to remain in the Sanctum to guard it in Strange's absence.[4]\n\nStrange was among the victims of the Snap, thus depriving the Masters of the Mystic Arts of one of their most prominent and powerful members.[4] However, Wong, in his stead, became the new Sorcerer Supreme and took the position as Master of the New York Sanctum.[5]\n\nIn 2023, as a result of the Blip, Doctor Strange was restored to life. Strange contacted Wong and asked him to gather the other Masters from around the world to transport newly restored members of the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Wakandans, Asgardians, and Ravagers to the ruins of the Avengers Compound in New York to assist in the battle against an alternate Thanos and his army. During the battle, Wong and the Masters created Tao Mandala shields strong enough to block the missiles raining down from the Sanctuary II.[6]\n\nLater on, Wong and Doctor Strange witnessed a blizzard in Siberia come through the Rotunda of Gateways into the New York Sanctum. As Sorcerer Supreme, Wong took frequent trips to Kamar-Taj. That November, Wong found that Peter Parker was inside the Sanctum. Strange met them and asked Parker what he owed the pleasure. Parker asked him to go back in time and reverse Mysterio's actions in exposing his identity. Strange told him he no longer had the Time Stone and expressed concern about the space-time continuum regarding the recent Time Heist. However, he proposed the Runes of Kof-Kol, although Wong disagreed, telling him that the spell dealt with known and unknown realities. Strange pleaded with Wong, stating that he had used the spell in Kamar-Taj once during a party, and that Parker had been through a lot as it was. Wong reluctantly agreed, stating he wanted nothing to do with it, and departed via portal for Kamar-Taj again.\n\nStrange took Parker below the Sanctum to an ancient room with walls that were thousands of years old and were the intersection of cosmic energy currents. Strange prepared the spell, stating that the world was about to forget Parker's existence. Alarmed, Parker asked Strange to make allowances for certain people. As a result, the spell became unstable and Parker continued, stating that everyone who knew of his identity before to remember. Due to the unstable spell, a fissure in the Multiverse formed, causing a massive tremor to shake the Sanctum. Strange managed to contain the spell and store it inside an ancient relic known as the Macchina di Kadavus. Angry that Parker had caused the spell to become unstable, Strange proceeded to remove Parker from the Sanctum.\n\nSoon after, Strange detected a presence unknown to his universe and tracked it down to the sewers, finding the Lizard. Strange then used his magic to transport the Lizard into a holding cell underneath the Sanctum. After this, Strange used his Sling Ring to transport Parker and Doctor Octopus there, with Doctor Octopus put inside a holding cell also. Strange told Parker that due to the unstable spell, universe-displaced people had come through the fissure and entered their universe. He tasked Parker with finding the others and gave him a device to transport them to the cells. When Parker asked for help, Strange went off and found his friends, Ned Leeds and Michelle Jones, and brought them there. He told them to work in the undercroft and left them to investigate.\n\nLater, Strange returned to the undercroft and holding cells to use the Macchina after seeing that they had been successful in finding Electro and Sandman. When he spotted Norman Osborn with Parker, Leeds, and Jones, he transported him into a cell. Strange then proceeded to start the ritual to send the universe-displaced to their universes. However, Parker interjected and grabbed the Macchina, before using the device to put Strange in a cell. Strange walked out of it and pursued Parker outside the Sanctum, using his Sling Ring to catch Parker in portals. When that failed, he pushed Parker into the Astral Dimension but due to Parker's Spider Sense, that attempt failed also. Strange then threw the Cloak of Levitation at Parker and opened up the Mirror Dimension, where he could have control. As Strange chased Parker throughout the Dimension, he used his Sling Ring to cast Parker into a series of portals, while the Cloak tried to get the Macchina. When Parker collided the portals together, it shattered the Dimension, transporting them to the Grand Canyon, and the Macchina was dropped. Strange grabbed the Macchina and prepared to leave through a portal, until Parker used his webbing to tie Strange up, grab the Macchina and Sling Ring, and leave Strange in the Dimension.\n\nTwelve hours later, Strange was released through a portal cast by Leeds, who had used his Sling Ring, and arrived at the Statue of Liberty. Strange took possession of the Macchina and his Sling Ring again, before finding Parker and meeting his two variants, just as the Lizard had been cured and reverted to his human form. They were then attacked by the Green Goblin, who grabbed the Macchina and planted one of his Pumpkin Bombs inside of it. Strange used an Eldritch Whip to recover the Macchina, only for it to detonate, destroying the Macchina and unleashing the unstable spell, which created a dimensional rift opening the Multiverse, and causing the scaffolding of the Statue to fall. As Strange tried to seal the fissures, the Cloak left him to rescue Leeds, who had fallen. The Cloak then returned to Strange and Strange watched as infinite number of universe-displaced people started entering their universe. Parker told Strange to perform a second spell, one that would erase everyone in their universe memory's of him. Strange asked if he was sure, and Parker agreed, saying his last goodbyes as Strange performed the spell, sealing the fissure in the Multiverse, returning those universe-displaced back to their universes, and wiping everyone's memory of Parker.[5]\n\nIn late 2024, Doctor Strange had, what he thought was a dream, a vision of his variant and a girl running from a being in an unknown location. Later that day, Strange tended to a disturbance within New York City and found himself dealing with Gargantos, a one eyed tentacled being from the Multiverse.\n\nWhen Strange was knocked out, Wong arrived and fought Gargantos, only to be captured. Strange returned and freed Wong, and managed to find a way to defeat the being. Afterwards, Strange and Wong met the girl, who was named America Chavez and learned she could travel the Multiverse.[7]\n\nWong transported himself and America Chavez to Kamar-Taj and waited for Doctor Strange’s return. When Strange returned, he spoke to Wong, Chavez, and a group of Masters telling them that Wanda Maximoff had become corrupted by the Darkhold and that she had become the Scarlet Witch. Wong the. explained the Scarlet Witch’s history and commanded that Kamar-Taj become a fortress. He ordered that the students stop their training at the moment and prepare alongside their teachers to defend Kamar-Taj.\n\nRintrah then announced the arrival of the Hong Kong Master and London Master, who answered Wong’s call for backup. As the Masters got in position with their magic arrows, cannons, and mystical shields, a protective barrier was formed around the perimeter.\n\nThe Masters then watched as a large dark cloud appeared in the sky and descended above them, revealing Maximoff at the center. Strange flew up to speak with her, but failed to persuade her to stop her mission. She blasted the perimeter and continued to do so, until she used her telepathy and astral form to break a young Master’s focus, causing him to run and disrupt other Masters’, allowing for the protective shields to be let down.\n\nMaximoff then began blasting Kamar-Taj, until she was blasted herself by a fire cannon. Maximoff angrily destroyed the cannon, knocking out Sara in the process. She proceeded to throw the archers off their buildings and created fires in the courtyards. Strange and Wong told the Masters to fall back to safety as Maximoff descended upon Kamar-Taj, creating a huge blast that destroyed the foundations and killed several Masters.\n\nStrange and Wong went to see Chavez, who had been hiding in a room with Hamir and another Master. Strange then set up a trap involving the Mirror Dimension in which Maximoff fell into. However, she managed to break free, taking Hamir and the other Master out of the room, before using a reflective gong to enter. She defeated Strange and Wong easily and began taking Chavez's power until Strange leaped in the way and fell into the star-shaped portal with Chavez.[7]",
