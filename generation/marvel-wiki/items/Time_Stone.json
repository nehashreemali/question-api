  "content": "The Time Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a singularity that predated the universe, representing the element of time. It was contained inside the Eye of Agamotto and placed under the protection of the Masters of the Mystic Arts. In 2017, Doctor Strange took possession of the Stone and used it to defeat Dormammu.\n\nThe following year, during the Infinity War, Doctor Strange relinquished the Stone to Thanos in exchange for sparing Iron Man's life. Thanos then used the Time Stone during the Battle of Wakanda to resurrect Vision after he was killed by Wanda Maximoff, in order to acquire the Mind Stone. Following the Snap, Thanos destroyed the Time Stone, along with the other Infinity Stones to prevent his work being undone.\n\nIn 2023, the Avengers initiated a Time Heist in order to resurrect the lives Thanos had claimed. Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk and Ant-Man were sent back in time to Battle of New York to an alternate 2012 where Hulk successfully convinced the Ancient One to relinquish the stone. Following the Battle of Earth, where Iron Man used the Stones to kill Thanos and his army at the cost of his own life, Captain America time-traveled to the alternate 2012 to return the Time Stone.\n\nThe Time Stone is a remnant of one of the six singularities which existed before the universe. After the universe came to be, the Big Bang forged the remnants of six singularities into elemental crystals, dubbed the Infinity Stones, and hurtled them across the universe. As indicated by its name, the Time Stone holds dominion over the forces of time.[2]\n\nThe stone was found by Agamotto, Earth's first Sorcerer Supreme, who fashioned a containment device to harness its dangerous power. When Agamotto founded the Masters of the Mystic Arts, usage of the Eye became forbidden, though Cagliostro was permitted to study the artifact and eventually wrote how to control the relic in his book.[1] The Masters subsequently swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with their lives because the Time Stone ultimately became their chief weapon against mystical forces that seek to invade and destroy earth.[2][3]\n\nIn 2012, the Ancient One brought the Time Stone with her to New York City as she defended the New York Sanctum from the invading Chitauri.[3]\n\nDuring his training at Kamar-Taj, Doctor Strange began to read the Book of Cagliostro and learned of the Eye's full power. Seeking to push himself, Strange donned the Eye and opened it, revealing the Time Stone, first testing its power on his apple before using it to recreate the lost pages from the Book. He was halted by Wong and Karl Mordo who warned that the Eye's powers were contrary to the natural order of things and the slightest misuse could result in an endless temporal loop.[1]\n\nWhen the Hong Kong Sanctum was destroyed and the Dark Dimension began assimilating Earth, Doctor Strange used the Time Stone to rewind the destructive events and save Wong only to be stopped by Kaecilius before the Sanctum could be fully restored. At wit's end, Strange flew directly into the Dark Dimension to confront Dormammu, trapping the dimensional being in a time loop that Strange would only break if Dormammu acquiesced to the human's bargain. Dormammu eventually withdrew from Earth with Strange returning the Eye to its resting place in Kamar-Taj soon after where Wong causally revealed its true nature.[1]\n\nIn 2018, Bruce Banner returned to Earth to warn the planet of Thanos' imminent arrival. After meeting Doctor Strange and Wong, the three sought out Tony Stark for his aid who simply proposed destroying the Time Stone to derail Thanos' plans, to which Wong told him of the oath to protect it while Strange postulated it might be their greatest weapon against Thanos. As the four debated which action to take, Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian arrived demanding the Time Stone. While they managed to defeat Obsidian, Maw managed to abduct Strange who revealed he had placed a spell around the Time Stone so that it could only be taken from him if he wished it so.\n\nStrange then attempted to use the Stone against Maw only to be overpowered and brought aboard Maw's Q-Ship. Mid-flight, the torturer attempted to force Strange into surrendering the Stone only for him to be slain by Stark and Peter Parker. Though Strange wanted to head back to Earth, Stark convinced him Thanos would follow the Time Stone wherever they took it and that fighting him on Titan, away from any innocents, was the best course of action. Strange reluctantly agreed but warned he would sacrifice them all for the Time Stone if need be.[2]\n\nUpon arriving at their destination, the three were met by half of the Guardians of the Galaxy. As introductions were made, Doctor Strange used the Time Stone to examine fourteen million six hundred and five possible outcomes of their inevitable battle with Thanos. In all but one, they would lose. In preparation for Thanos' arrival, Strange removed the Stone from the Eye of Agamotto and sent it to hide amongst the stars.\n\nIn the subsequent battle, Thanos, while impressed by Strange's mastery of the arcane, soon deduced that he had parted with the Time Stone given that he failed to use its power against the Titan. When Thanos was on the verge of killing Tony Stark, Strange bartered the Time Stone for Stark's life. Inserting it into the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos promptly took his leave to collect the Mind Stone.[2]\n\nUpon arriving in Wakanda, Thanos effortlessly made his way through the resistance but was too late to stop Wanda Maximoff from destroying the Mind Stone. Unfazed, he simply used the Time Stone to resurrect Vision and recreate the Mind Stone, allowing him to complete the Gauntlet whereupon he was stabbed by a vengeful Thor. In spite of his wound, Thanos managed to use all six Stones to wipe out half of all life in the universe.[2]\n\nThree weeks later, Thanos destroyed all the Infinity Stones, including the Time Stone by using the Stones' powers on itself, in order to eliminate any possibility of reversing what he had done.[3]\n\nIn 2023, the Avengers initiated a Time Heist, where they used the Quantum Realm to time travel through the Multiverse and acquire all six Infinity Stones from alternate past timelines in order to resurrect  the victims of the Snap. Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner and Scott Lang were sent to May 4, 2012 during the Battle of New York, arriving in an alternate timeline.\n\nAs the stone was inside the Eye of Agamotto at this time, Banner arrived at the New York Sanctum to retrieve the Time Stone from Doctor Strange. However, he encountered the Ancient One, who revealed that she was the current Sorcerer Supreme and that Strange hadn't become a sorcerer yet. Realizing that she was wearing the Eye of Agamotto which contained the Time Stone, Banner attempted to take it by force, only for him to be ejected out his body and into the Astral Dimension.\n\nEngaging in a civil discussion, Banner insisted that the Time Stone would be returned before its absence caused any damage to the timeline, the Ancient One refused, citing that if he died and did not return the Time Stone, then the new timeline would be left defenseless against forces they would otherwise need the Time Stone to defeat before Banner revealed Strange had given up the Stone willingly. Convinced, the Ancient One surrendered the Stone to Banner.\n\nAfter successfully transporting the alternate versions of the Stones to their timeline, the Time Stone was placed in the Nano Gauntlet. Using the Gauntlet, Banner harnessed the power of the six Stones to restore the victims enacting the Blip, albeit losing the ability to use his right arm.\n\nThe six Stones were then used by Stark to kill an alternate Thanos and his army. Afterwards, Rogers used the Quantum Realm to return the Time Stone to its timeline.[3]\n\nWhile capturing Variants and pruning timelines, the Time Variance Authority seized Infinity Stones from alternate timelines, including numerous Time Stones.[4]\n\nWhen Thanos attempted to collect all six Infinity Stones, a zombie apocalypse had already claimed many heroes on Earth. This included Doctor Strange, who had sworn to protect the Time Stone. Thanos was able to collect the Stone but became a zombie in the process. He later wielded his Gauntlet in zombie form with all five collected Stones intact.[6]\n\nDuring the battle that followed, Thanos' infected mind had trouble wielding the power of the Stones at first, but he quickly adapted, testing out their power by destroying a rock with the Reality Stone and undoing the damage with the Time Stone. When Spider-Man pulled Stormbreaker from Thanos' chest, the Titan was able to use the Time Stone to heal the wound. After Thanos used the Space Stone to teleport the Mind Stone directly to him and completed the Gauntlet, Black Panther, in an act of ultimate sacrifice, tackled Thanos into Wakanda's vibranium reactor core, killing the Mad Titan.[7]\n\nHowever, the Infinity Stones were shattered in the process, releasing a hurricane of Infinity Energy[8] that nearly killed Peter Parker and Scott Lang before they were saved by the Masters of the Mystic Arts.[7] The Infinity Energy continued its destructive spread across the planet before finally being contained by Infinity Hulk in Paris.[8]\n\nDuring the Battle of Wakanda, Steve Rogers attempted to disarm Thanos by hitting an Infinity Stone with his shield. He succeeded in hitting the Time Stone, but doing so caused time to warp, sending the Avengers to the year 1602.\n\nCassandra Nova possessed a Sling Ring which had the Time and Reality Stones attached to its ends, which she obtained after killing its previous owner, a Doctor Strange variant. The Sling Ring was used to transport beings from the Void to Earth-10005.[11]\n\nAs the Infinity Stone with absolute control over time, the Time Stone is among the most powerful artifacts in all existence. Due to its power, it can only be held by beings of exceptional superhuman ability. The sorcerer Agamotto was only able to safely harness the stone's power after encasing it in a special containment device known as the Eye of Agamotto.\n\nWhen contained in a vessel such as the Eye or the Infinity Gauntlet, the Stone's power uniquely manifests as green runes of energy, often surrounding the user's arm and wrist. Manipulation of time then occurs primarily through the conjuration of a green, circular mandala of energy in the user's hand. The mandala acts as a rudimentary \"dial\", and the manual turning of the mandala with the user's hand enables them to \"scroll\" both backwards and forwards through time.\n\nThrough manipulation of the mandala, the user is able to physically control and redirect the flow of time, and can specifically select the exact area to manipulate without affecting those outside its selected range. The stone can alter targets as small as an apple or as wide in scope as the entire timeline of the Universe, to the point where Doctor Strange used the Stone to reverse the destruction of the Hong Kong Sanctum before it was consumed by the Dark Dimension, while specifically subtracting himself, Mordo and Wong from its effects.\n\nDue to the selective nature of the Time Stone's power, it could be used to individually alter the timeline of individual objects or events, reversing them to a previous state or sending the object forward into a future state. This occurs regardless of any potential breaches in causality - when Doctor Strange practiced the use of the Stone on a half-eaten apple, sending it forward in time, the apple converted to a fully-eaten, moldy state, despite Strange never physically eating the entire apple afterwards. This implies that the Stone could send objects forward to a potential future state that does not necessarily have to occur in the current timeline.\n\nNotably, this disregard for causality also allows for the spontaneous formation or erasure of matter in order to conform with the established timeline. As shown when Strange reconstructed the torn pages of the Book of Cagliostro, duplicates of the pages reconstituted from thin air, without the \"actual\" pages, or the one who currently possessed them being physically present. When reversing the flow of time around the half-eaten apple, the Stone reconstituted the eaten parts of the apple with no ill effects to Strange himself.[1]\n\nWhen within the Eye of Agamotto, the Stone could also be used to view alternate futures and timelines without physically entering them, with Doctor Strange using the Stone on Titan to find a timeline of the Infinity War in which the Avengers would emerge victorious over Thanos. When using the Stone in this manner, the user takes a meditative stance, closes their eyes, and channels the Stone's energy through their body from the Eye. To external observers, the user's head would appear to dart around wildly and supernaturally as they view different timelines. With this method, a large quantity of timelines can be viewed in only a short period of real-time, with Strange viewing a total of 14,000,605 timelines before finding a single winning outcome.\n\nHowever, the Time Stone's control over causality and probability can easily prove too much for anyone who does not have the required knowledge and ability to use it, potentially resulting in the user's death and a danger to the natural order. Misuse of the Stone's abilities could potentially result in unstable openings and breaks in the space-time continuum, spatial paradoxes, time loops, or even risk completely erasing the user from existence. Even during a small-scale application, Strange testing the Stone's capabilities on an apple and the Book of Cagliostro nearly caused a break in the space-time continuum, manifesting as an expanding mirror-like shattering of reality where multiple different timelines of Strange were visible within each \"reflection\".\n\nWith enough skill, this can be used to the wielder's advantage - the Stone can be used to deliberately loop segments of time through the formation of a literal energy loop over the wielder's wrist. Upon the wielder's death, the timeline will revert to the initial formation of the energy loop, allowing the wielder to begin a new iteration with the memory of all previous timelines. This was used by Doctor Strange during the Skirmish in the Dark Dimension[1] and before the Battle of Titan.[2]\n\nNotably, beings from, or that draw power from, the Dark Dimension, a universe without time, are to an extent, immune to the effects of the Time Stone. The Zealots were able to use their powers to subtract themselves from the reversal of the Hong Kong Sanctum's destruction in order to duel Strange and Mordo, and Dormammu himself retained his memory and awareness between iterations of Strange's time loop. Conversely and equally notably, while not affecting its ruler, the Time Stone was still able to function inside the Dark Dimension itself - essentially bringing the power of time itself into a timeless Dimension, with its powers still applying to the human Strange while inside.\n\nWhen added to the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos displays a strong level of mastery and familiarity with the Stone's capabilities, as he was able to harness its unique mandala energy interface to reverse the complete destruction of the Mind Stone and the death of Vision at the hands of Wanda Maximoff without affecting Maximoff herself, essentially being able to reconstruct an entire Infinity Stone without any visible side effects to reality.\n\nThe Time Stone can also be used in conjunction with the other Stones to expand its effects. Using the Time Stone together with the Soul Stone and the Reality Stone, Thanos is able to completely reverse and heal the fatal chest wound caused by Stormbreaker, even restoring his damaged armor, before teleporting away with the Space Stone.\n\nAs with the other Infinity Stones, the Time Stone also emits gamma radiation. Within the Nano Gauntlet, the combined radiation levels of the Stones were dangerous enough to overwhelm an ordinary human like Tony Stark, and necessitated a being able to withstand gamma radiation to use without dying, like Bruce Banner in his Smart Hulk form.\n\nWhen alongside all other Infinity Stones in a completed Gauntlet, the Stone is able to perform immensely powerful feats. In its most basic use, the Gauntlet can unleash a beam of white energy combining the power of all six Infinity Stones, which can be counteracted by a sufficiently powerful weapon like Stormbreaker. In their most powerful uses, the Stones are able to instantly kill/destroy and revive/recreate both lifeforms and inanimate objects with a simple snap of one's fingers, reducing affected beings/objects into dust or reconstituting them from thin air. This effect can be applied at a scale of the user's choosing, from only targeting a specific group to affecting life on a universal scale, able to randomly kill (and later revive) half of all life in the Universe. The sole exception to this are lifeforms sacrificed to the Soul Stone, who cannot be revived even with the power of all six Stones.\n\nTogether, the Stones are even able to destroy themselves by turning their energies upon each other, reducing them to nothing but atoms. These individual acts are enough to produce an energy surge of cosmic proportions, enough to be detected entire systems away. After changing his goals, the 2014 Thanos would further claim that the Stones are capable of both completely destroying and recreating the entire Universe in his utopic image, with an abundance of life that only knows the blessings he has given it, and nothing of the previous Universe destroyed to create it.\n\nHowever, using all six Stones for such acts draws a great physical toll on the user's body and the weapon used to control them, severely burning both with the Stones' energy. It is enough to damage the Uru-made Infinity Gauntlet, kill an ordinary human like Iron Man, and scorch the arms and bodies of more powerful users like Hulk or Thanos into uselessness. Wounds sustained in this manner are near-permanent, and cannot be healed with the Stones' power.",
