  "content": "Captain America's Shield is a vibranium shield that was extensively used by Steve Rogers. After the original shield was destroyed by Thanos during the Battle of Earth, Rogers traveled to an alternate timeline and acquired another shield, bestowing it to Sam Wilson. However, Wilson donated the shield to the Smithsonian's Captain America exhibit, where it was taken by the U.S. government and given to John Walker, the second Captain America. When Walker publicly murdered a man with the shield, it was forcibly retrieved by Wilson and Bucky Barnes, with Wilson finally deciding to use the shield for himself as Captain America.\n\nIn 1943, Steve Rogers had been rebranded as Captain America, following the successful plan to turn him into a super soldier with the Super Soldier Serum, he had been gifted with a prop shield to go on tour with, promoting war bonds to the people of America. However, when Captain America had learned that Hydra had kidnapped Bucky Barnes, and the rest of his unit, Captain America used this shield to break inside the Hydra Base Camp C3, where he rescued all the prisoners. During their mission, Captain America's shield was damaged during his fight against Red Skull, although he was still able to escape, and brought the damaged shield back with him.[2]\n\nThe second shield used by Captain America was a prototype made from the only supply of vibranium that the United States Army had available. Howard Stark presented several differing prototypes that Rogers passed over for an ordinary, circular shield on a shelf under the table. Remarking that it was a proper weight and size, Stark tried to convince Rogers it wouldn't suit his needs but Rogers insisted he'd found the shield he wanted.\n\nWhile showing off the shield, Captain America was shot at by Peggy Carter, with these bullets being deflected by the shield, with Carter happily confirming that the shield worked. The shield was then integrated into the patriotic motif of Captain America's uniform, adding the white star onto the center and making the three concentric outer circles into red and white stripes, which Captain America would wear.[2]\n\nIn his continued mission to destroy Hydra, Captain America carried the shield during all of his raids on Hydra facilities and their other missions during the war, as he and the Howling Commandos would storm the facilities, with Captain America leading and protecting all his fellow soldiers with the shield.\n\nCaptain America would also use the shield as an offensive weapon, defeating Red Skull's soldiers in combat, while he also launched the shield at his enemies, including a Hydra soldier hidden in the trees. While battling against a Landkreuzer, Captain America used his shield to smash the lock on a top hatch, before James Montgomery Falsworth threw him the bombs, which he had then used to destroy the tank, leaping to safety as it exploded.[2]\n\nIn 1945, Having tracked down Arnim Zola on the Schnellzug EB912 and traveling through the mountains, Captain America overlooked the mountains, with his shield on his back, and Bucky Barnes at his side. As the train appeared, Captain America led Barnes and Gabe Jones onto the train, and sneaked inside. Captain America kept his shield ready as they made their way through the train, only for Zola to shut the doors and separate him and Barnes, while Hydra soldiers ambushed them.\n\nCaptain America was able to block energy shots with his shield, before knocking out his attacker with a blow from his shield. With Barnes held down, Captain America was able to throw him another gun, allowing Barnes to shoot him. However, when another attack separated them again, Barnes grabbed Captain America's shield, only to be blasted off the train. Although Captain America subdued the attacker, Barnes fell from the train to his apparent death.[2]\n\nIn order to finish their war against Hydra, Captain America had ridden his motorcycle into the Hydra Headquarters. On the way, Captain America was chased down by Lindworm-5 Motorcycles, which attempted to shoot at him, only for the shield on his back to deflect the shots. Once he had taken down the motorbikes, Captain America moved his shield to the front of his motorbike, as a Hydra Mini Tank had continued shooting at him, until it was destroyed with another missile, as Captain America rode forward.\n\nCaptain America then rode his motorbike directly into the Hydra Headquarters, where he leapt off, striking a Hydra soldier with his shield in midair, while his motorbike destroyed the headquarters entrance. Surrounded, Captain America used his shield to throw at his enemies, as well as blocking shots from their Assault Weapons. Having deflected his shield off a tank to subdue a soldier, Captain America was then surrounded by the Hydra Flamethrowers.\n\nWith Captain America captured, his shield was taken by a Hydra soldier, while he was interrogated by Red Skull. However, before Red Skull could execute him, Captain America was saved by the Howling Commandos and the United States Armed Forces, who stormed the base, with James Montgomery Falsworth throwing Captain America his shield during the chaos. Captain America chased Red Skull and threw his shield, only for it to become jammed in a doorway.\n\nHaving been rescued from flamethrowers by Peggy Carter, Captain America reclaimed his shield and continued chasing down Red Skull, who was attempting to escape on his Valkyrie. Captain America was then assisted by Chester Phillips and Agent Carter, who had taken Red Skull's Coupe to help with the chase. As he neared the plane, Captain America used his shield to ensure he was not shredded by the propellers, before leaping on board the plane as it took off.[2]\n\nOnce Captain America had boarded the Valkyrie, he had then found several Hydra soldiers boarding the Hydra Parasits. Captain America proceeded to ambush the soldiers, but as he attempted to use his shield to break one soldier out of a Parasit, another knocked the shield out of his hand. Once Captain America had flown the final Parasit back on board the Valkyrie, he reclaimed his shield.\n\nStepping into the cockpit, Captain America searched for Red Skull, who tried to shoot him with a Assault Weapon, which was deflected with the shield. As they began to fight, Captain America attempted to strike Red Skull with his shield, only for it to be knocked out of his hands, and Red Skull to them use it to pin Captain America back. However, Captain America was able to reclaim his weapon, and used it to launch Red Skull into the plane's controls.\n\nOnce Red Skull got the ship back under control, he attempted to shoot Captain America with his Hydra Pistol, only for the shots to be blocked by Captain America's shield, who then launched the shield at Red Skull, knocking him into the Tesseract Cradle. While Red Skull had then grabbed the Tesseract and was inadvertently shot into space, Captain America left his shield on the ground, before then crashing the plane into the Atlantic Ocean.[2]\n\nIn 2011, the wreckage of the Valkyrie had been found by S.H.I.E.L.D., along with the frozen Captain America as well as his shield. In 2012, Captain America was recruited into the Avengers by Nick Fury, with his uniform being redesigned by Phil Coulson, and keeping to a similar theme to his shield and previous uniform. With the threat of Loki now upon them, Captain America was then ordered by Director Fury to travel with Black Widow to Germany, where Loki had been spotted, with Captain America then reclaiming his new uniform and shield for the mission.\n\nUpon arriving within Germany, Captain America had then found Loki attempting to execute an Old Man with an energy blast, only for Captain America to leap in front of the blast and deflect it with his shield. Although Loki attempted to shoot down the Quinjet, Captain America threw his shield at him, and engaged in a fight with Loki, using his shield to block Loki's Scepter. When Captain America then threw his shield again, Loki deflected it and almost defeated Captain America, until Iron Man arrived and assisted in subduing Loki, with Captain America reclaiming his shield and taking Loki into custody.\n\nWith Loki having been captured, Captain America and Iron Man had attempted to fly him back. However, on the route they were suddenly ambushed by Thor, who immediately subdued Iron Man and Captain America, before dragging Loki from the Quinjet. While Iron Man flew after Thor, Captain America took back his shield and leapt after them with a parachute. Once he had caught up to the fighting Iron Man and Thor, Captain America threw his shield at them both, only for Thor to respond by attacking Captain America with Mjølnir. However, the shield absorbed the strike, and Thor agreed to assist them.[3]\n\nIn the wake of Loki escaping from their custody, Captain America had recruited Black Widow and Hawkeye to go and stop his plans, collecting his shield before hijacking a Quinjet to fly to New York City. Upon their arrival, they witnessed a Wormhole opening above the city, and the Chitauri attacking. In order to assist the New York City Police Department, Captain America gave orders to Sergeant Silva and Officer Saunders, who scoffed a bit at a stranger suddenly shouting orders.  Moments later, a squad of Chitauri attacked their location, Rogers fighting them off quickly with his shield. Now trusting of the capable Captain, the Sergeant repeated the orders to his fellow officers.\n\nReturning to the battle, Captain America assisted Black Widow and Hawkeye to defeat the Chitauri with his shield, before they had been rejoined by Thor and Bruce Banner. The group then witnessed Iron Man flying a Leviathan towards them, as Banner transformed into the Hulk and destroyed it, with Captain America saving Black Widow from the explosion with his shield. Captain America then gave the Avengers their orders as the battle continued, before assisting Black Widow to board a Chitauri Chariot by launching her up with his shield before continuing to fight on the ground.\n\nWith the Avengers fighting the Chitauri across New York, Captain America battled them in the streets, where Iron Man flew down and fired an energy blast at his shield, which deflected the energy at the Chitauri, before Iron Man flew back up, and left Captain America to continue in his fight. Captain America was then alerted to multiple civilians being captured, as he charged into the room and launched his shield at a Chitauri who was arming a Chitauri Bomb. Following a brief brawl, Captain America saw a Chitauri use the bomb, as he used his shield to block the blast, launching him out of a window.\n\nWith the Avengers becoming overwhelmed by the Chitauri, Captain America fought alongside Thor, throwing and using his shield to fight back, until a blast from the Chitauri Staff brought him to his knees. Having picked his shield back up, Captain America then witnessed Iron Man fly a nuclear bomb through the wormhole, destroying the Chitauri Command Center and ending the invasion. Captain America then took his shield with him as the Avengers captured Loki.[3] With Loki captured, Captain America brought a STRIKE team to claim the Scepter, while he coordinated search and rescue.[4]\n\nIn 2014, two years after the Avengers parted ways, Captain America became a full-time S.H.I.E.L.D. operative, receiving advanced combat training and field experience that allowed him to effectively use his shield as an offensive weapon. While performing stealth missions alongside the subdivision STRIKE, the shield was repainted, replacing the red stripes with light blue stripes to make it less conspicuous. During the nighttime mission aboard the Lemurian Star, the shield's colors were muted.\n\nOnce Captain America had his shield on his back, he leapt out of the Quinjet and dove into the ocean, stealthy boarding the Lemurian Star. Making his way across the ship, Captain America use his shield to take down the pirates, throwing the shield at them before they could raise the alarm, and punching one pirate with the shield. As Captain America put the shield on his back, a pirate tried to shoot him, only for Brock Rumlow to shoot the pirate.\n\nWhile Rumlow and Jack Rollins focused on rescuing the hostages, Captain America threw his shield at the captain's seat, in an attempt to take down Batroc the Leaper. However, he only struck Ferdinand Lopez, as Batroc made his escape, with Captain America reclaiming the shield and chased down Batroc. Following a brief fight, Batroc convinced Captain America to fight him without the shield, which he agreed to, placing it onto his back.\n\nCaptain America was soon able to overpower and subdue Batroc without the use of his shield, and then discovered Black Widow completing her secret mission for Nick Fury. While they were talking, Batroc threw a grenade at Captain America and Black Widow, which Captain America deflected with his shield, as they dove for cover, using the shield for protection from the explosion, while Batroc was able to escape during the chaos.[7]\n\nOnce Captain America returned to his apartment, he discovered something was wrong, so he soon picked up his shield for protection as he went to investigate, only to discover Nick Fury waiting for him. However, when Fury was shot by Winter Soldier, Captain America pulled him to safety, and once Sharon Carter arrived to assist, Captain America took his shield to chase down Winter Soldier.\n\nLeaping to the building across the road, Captain America ran through the corridors chasing down Winter Soldier, using his shield to smash his way through the doorways to ensure Winter Soldier did not get away. Finding him on a rooftop, Captain America threw his shield at Winter Soldier, only for him to catch the shield with his Prosthetic Arm and throw it back, leaving Captain America stunned, while Winter Soldier escaped.[7]\n\nArriving at the Triskelion with his shield, Captain America first placed it down during his meeting with Alexander Pierce to discuss Nick Fury's apparent death and involvement with Batroc the Leaper's plans. Captain America then reclaimed the shield as he went into the elevator to leave the Triskelion, following a tense meeting with Pierce.\n\nCaptain America was surrounded in the elevator by STRIKE agents, being led by Brock Rumlow, who ambushed Captain America, taking away his shield before attempting to subdue him, using Taser Rods and Magnetic Handcuffs. However, Captain America defeated the STRIKE agents and reclaimed his shield, using it to destroy the handcuffs before protecting himself as he leapt from the elevator and fell several floors down.\n\nTo escape the Triskelion, Captain America took his motorcycle, strapped the shield to his suit, and took off. However, STRIKE agents tried to stop him by sending out a Quinjet to block his exit. Captain America used his shield then to disable it, first throwing it inside the engine, before leaping on the back and throwing the shield at the Quinjet's wings, causing it to crash, while Captain America was able to make an escape.[7]\n\nWhen Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff went to Camp Lehigh, having tracked the signal from the USB drive taken from the Lemurian Star to the Camp, Rogers took the shield with him, unsure of what they might find waiting for them in the base. Finding the doorway into the base was locked, Rogers used his shield to break open the padlock, allowing himself and Romanoff to enter and search for answers.\n\nRogers and Romanoff found a computer system, and when they logged in with the USB, they found themselves encountering Arnim Zola through a computer. Rogers kept the shield on his arm as Zola explained that Hydra had been able to secretly infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D. and had been manipulating world events. However, Zola then locked the doors to the room, as Rogers threw his shield to try and block the doors, but was too late.\n\nRomanoff then realised that the building was about to be bombed by STRIKE agents, as they ripped open a floor panel to seek cover. As the missles hit the base and destroyed Zola's systems, Rogers used the shield to protect him and Romanoff from the falling rubble. Having saved their lives, Rogers pulled Romanoff to safety while holding the shield, as they escaped before Brock Rumlow's team arrived to kill them.[7]\n\nWhile transporting Jasper Sitwell back to the Triskelion in an attempt to sabotage Alexander Pierce's plans, Steve Rogers and his allies were suddenly attacked by the Winter Soldier, who killed Sitwell and caused their car to crash. Taking his shield, Rogers was able to pull his allies to safety, before using the shield to block a grenade explosion fired by Winter Soldier.\n\nRogers was thrown off the bridge by the explosion and separated from his shield. As the Hydra soldiers surrounded him, Rogers made a run for his shield and was able to grab it in time to protect himself from mini-gun fire. Rogers hid behind the shield as he ran towards the shooter and took him down, while Sam Wilson shot at the other Hydra soldiers from the bridge, allowing Rogers to chase after Winter Soldier.\n\nRogers found Winter Soldier just as he was attempting to shoot Natasha Romanoff, Rogers was able to save Romanoff in time, and blocked a punch from Winter Soldier's Prosthetic Arm with his shield. Winter Soldier kicked Rogers away and attempted to shoot him with his machine gun, which Rogers blocked with his shield, before Winter Soldier switched to his handgun and continued shooting at Rogers.\n\nHaving managed to protect himself from these gun shots with his shield, Rogers attempted to hit Winter Soldier with his shield, only for it to be caught and wrestled away from him, as Winter Soldier struck Rogers with his own shield before attempting to throw it at him. Rogers managed to avoid the thrown shield, which became imbedded in a nearby van, and continued to fight Winter Soldier without his shield.\n\nEventually, Rogers managed to reclaim his shield, and used it to block Winter Soldier's attempt to stab him, before he managed to strike Winter Soldier's Prosthetic Arm and damage it. Rogers then unmasked Winter Soldier and revealed his identity to be Bucky Barnes. However, Winter Soldier managed to escape while Brock Rumlow's STRIKE team arrested Rogers and his allies, forcing him to drop the shield.[7]\n\nOnce Captain America and his allies were freed by Nick Fury and Maria Hill, he was able to steal his old uniform and donned his shield, as they returned to the Triskelion in order to put an end to Alexander Pierce's schemes. Having taken over the control room, Captain America informed the remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents about Pierce's allegiance to Hydra and asked them to help him fight back.\n\nAs Pierce began to launch Project Insight's Helicarriers, Captain America and Falcon ran out to the runway to attempt to stop them by hacking into their control panels, ready to fight any Hydra agents who stood in their way. While Falcon fly to a higher ship, Captain America leapt onto a lower Helicarrier and immediately began fighting the Hydra agents there, blocking their gunfire with his shield.\n\nCaptain America took out one agent with a strike with his shield, stealing his grenade and throwing it at the others, before running through the remaining Hydra agents, using his shield as an offensive weapon to strengthen his punches, while also throwing it at agents further away, while Maria Hill reminded him of how much time they had left, as Captain America successfully hacked into the first Helicarrier.\n\nWith only one Helicarrier left to hack into, Captain America was separated from Falcon by Winter Soldier, who he confronted in the control room. Although Captain America attempted to reason with him by reminding him of his true identity as Bucky Barnes, Winter Soldier did not move, forcing Captain America to throw his shield at him, as Winter Soldier used his Prosthetic Arm to block the shield.\n\nHaving caught his shield, Captain America used it to block Winter Soldier's gunshots, although one managed to hit him on the side, before Captain America struck Winter Soldier in the face with the shield, throwing him backwards. With Winter Soldier armed with a knife, Captain America continued blocking his strikes, attempting to both hack into the Helicarrier, and disable Winter Soldier's Prosthetic Arm with his shield.\n\nWinter Soldier knocked them both off the platform, as Captain America was separated from his shield. Once they fell off the next platform, Captain America attempted to run for the chip, only for Winter Soldier to throw the shield into his back. Winter Soldier shot at Captain America, only for him to use the shield to protect himself and throw the shield back towards Winter Soldier, who blocked it with his Prosthetic Arm.\n\nWithout his shield, Captain America managed to subdue Winter Soldier and hacked into the Helicarrier, taking gunshots from Winter Soldier in the process. While the Helicarrier's fired at each other, Captain America reclaimed his shield and went to the aid of Winter Soldier, who became trapped under debris. Once free, Winter Soldier tried to attack Captain America, who refused to fight and dropped his shield into the river.\n\nAs the Helicarrier fell apart around them, Captain America fell into the river, but, having been reached by the reminder of his past life, Winter Soldier dove into the water and pulled him to safety, before leaving. Captain America's shield was also recovered from the water, and when Captain America awoke in hospital, he found it by his bedside, alongside Sam Wilson who had been waiting for him to wake up.[7]\n\nIn 2015, Tony Stark created for the Avengers many new gadgets to fight Hydra. One of them was Captain America's new uniform, that possessed strong, electromagnetic panels on each of the gloves that allowed Rogers to retrieve his shield more easily.\n\nDuring the Avengers' Attack on the Hydra Research Base, Rogers and Thor noticed that the Hydra soldiers were in a particular formation approaching them. Rogers held up his shield and allowed Thor to hit it with Mjølnir; the resulting shockwave caused the operatives to be rendered unconscious.[8]\n\nWhen Ultron attacked the Avengers at the Avengers Tower, Clint Barton grabbed the shield and threw to Steve Rogers, so he could fight Ultron.[8]\n\nThe Avengers went to Johannesburg to the Salvage Yard in order to confront Ultron. After finding him, Captain America fought him using his shield.[8]\n\nDuring Captain America's fight with Ultron in the Battle of Seoul, the shield got stuck in Ultron's body and Captain America lost the shield in the street. Black Widow, pursuing the combatants on her motorcycle, noticed the shield on the ground, scooped it up, and returned it to Captain America. The shield saved Captain America from flying debris that came through the windshield of the train.[8]\n\nIn the Battle of Sokovia, Rogers and Thor used the shield and Mjølnir in tandem during their fights against Ultron Sentries. Rogers would toss the shield into the air and allow Thor to hit it with Mjolnir to increase its speed as a projectile weapon.[8]\n\nIn 2016, Steve Rogers led a team consisting of Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff to Lagos, Nigeria to stop Crossbones from obtaining a biological weapon. During the mission, Rogers used the shield to fight off Crossbones' henchmen and Crossbones himself.[9]\n\nSteve Rogers was arrested for fighting German Special Forces along with wanted criminal, Winter Soldier; his shield was confiscated. After Rogers escaped from the facility in Berlin, his shield was recovered by Sharon Carter, who met with him and returned it to him.[9]\n\nCaptain America arrived at the Leipzig-Halle Airport in uniform and carried the shield to confront Iron Man, who was trying to stop his team. However, the shield was soon removed from Captain America's grip by Spider-Man when he made an appearance, siding with Iron Man, surprising Captain America. Hawkeye fired an arrow which carried Ant-Man, placing him on the shield. Ant-Man then grew to normal size, and returned the shield to Captain America. During the ensuing battle at the airport, Black Panther scratched the shield with his vibranium claws.[9]\n\nAt the Hydra Siberian Facility in Siberia, Captain America and Bucky Barnes used the shield interchangeably during their fight with Iron Man, with Captain America using it to break off Iron Man's helmet and then to pierce his Arc Reactor, shutting down Iron Man's suit. As Captain America began to walk away with Barnes, Iron Man angrily told him that he did not deserve to have the shield, as his father had made the shield. Subsequently, Captain America dropped the shield on the ground and walked away.[9]\n\nEventually, Tony Stark repaired the scratch on the shield and stored it in his garage at the Stark Eco-Compound. In 2023, Stark brought the shield to the Avengers Compound and gave it back to Steve Rogers. During the Time Heist, Rogers brought the shield with him when he used the Quantum Realm to time travel, arriving in New York City during the Battle of New York, in an alternate 2012. He then used the shield to fight against the alternate 2012 version of himself, who also possessed a version of the shield. Despite losing the shield mid-fight, he managed to reacquire it afterwards. After meeting back up with Stark and Scott Lang, Rogers brought the shield with him to an alternate 1970 before bringing it back with him to his timeline.[4]\n\nAfter the attack on the Avengers Compound, Iron Man recovered the shield in the ruins and returned it to Captain America. During the final confrontation with an alternate Thanos, Captain America wielded the shield along with Mjølnir. Unfortunately, the shield was broken by Thanos' brute force with his Double-Edged Sword, leaving Captain America with a fractured shield. Even so, Captain America stubbornly fastened the strap on his shield and continued to use it in the Battle of Earth. After the battle, Captain America had no more use of the damaged shield.[4]\n\nWhen Steve Rogers used the Quantum Realm to travel to an alternate 1949 timeline, he acquired an alternate shield. Returning to the main timeline, a now elderly Rogers brought the shield with him, and gave the shield to Sam Wilson.[4]\n\nDespite initially accepting it from Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson went back on his decision to accept the shield, believing that he was unfit for the job. Wilson had then returned to live in his apartment and placed the shield on the guest bed, as he decided that he would give it up.\n\nIn 2024, Wilson decided to donate the shield to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum for their Captain America exhibit. At the Smithsonian, Wilson gave a speech about Rogers, before giving the shield to a government employee to place in a glass display case, which was then placed into the exhibit. Following the ceremony, Wilson and James Rhodes were approached by a Government Official, who thanked Wilson for handing over the shield.[10]\n\nUnbeknownst to Wilson, the United States Department of Defense removed the shield from the exhibit and gave it to John Walker, to whom they gave the mantle of \"Captain America.\" Walker then appeared with the shield in public as the government publicly announced Walker's new role.[10]\n\nJohn Walker, acquiring his new role as Captain America, used the shield with great skill to combat the Flag Smashers in Munich, Germany. Upon arriving, he threw the shield at Dovich, sending the Flag Smasher away from Bucky Barnes. While fighting, Barnes caught the shield, but handed it back to Walker. Walker then used the shield to protect Lemar Hoskins when he fell back onto the highway.[11]\n\nJohn Walker and Lemar Hoskins continued their hunt for the Flag Smashers and traveled back to Munich to speak with a Flag Smasher ally named Rudy. After finding out the Flag Smashers had left, they traveled to Berlin to the Berlin Correctional Facility.[12]\n\nWalker and Hoskins then travelled to Riga, Latvia where they ran into Sam Wilson, Bucky Barnes, and Helmut Zemo. They then accompanied them to the building where Wilson would speak with Karli Morgenthau. After Walker interrupted their talk and threatened to arrest Morgenthau, she escaped. While searching for her, Walker found Zemo, who was destroying vials of Super Soldier Serum, and knocked him out with the shield.\n\nWalker and Hoskins then went to the building in which Barnes, Wilson, and Zemo were staying. In a mock gesture to Wilson, Walker put the shield on the floor. He later picked it up after the Dora Milaje arrived and engaged in a fight when Walker attempted to touch one. During the fight, the shield was pinned to Walker on a table with a Vibranium Spear, forcing him to release it. One of the Dora named Yama then picked up the shield, ready to take it away from Walker, until Ayo ordered her to leave it after discovering Zemo's escape.\n\nWalker then used the shield to defend himself upon entering an abandoned building to find the Flag Smashers. After locating them, he fought them using the shield. After Hoskins was killed by Morgenthau, Walker used the shield to smash into a window.[13]\n\nEnraged over his friend's death, John Walker chased after the Flag Smashers. He brutally hit the closest Flag Smasher, who was named Nico, in the back with the shield. This caused Nico to fall onto the steps of a monument. Walker then raised the shield and slammed it into Nico's chest, repeatedly. Once Nico was dead, Walker walked away, holding the shield, which was now stained in blood.[13]\n\nWalker ran to an abandoned warehouse with the shield and was soon confronted by Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson who demanded that he give them the shield. When Walker refused, a fight ensued. Walker easily overpowered Wilson with the shield, but got more resistance from Barnes, who tried several times to steal the shield from him. At one point, the shield was thrown at Barnes, who caught it, but Walker reclaimed it soon after.\n\nAfter Walker beat down Wilson and ripped off his EXO-7 Falcon suit, he prepared to use the shield to kill him, but was stopped by Barnes. Barnes and Wilson then got the upper hand and ripped the shield out of Walker's grasp, breaking his arm in the process. Wilson took hold of the shield and slammed it into Walker's back, effectively knocking him out. After the fight, Barnes picked up the shield and dropped it before Wilson, signaling that it was his. Wilson then picked up the shield and tried to wipe the blood off.\n\nShortly afterwards, Wilson went to the Latvian GRC Resettlement Camp and cleaned the shield. He then let Joaquín Torres see the shield and then left with it, taking it back to the United States of America.[14]\n\nSam Wilson returned to Delacroix, Louisiana and put the shield in Sarah Wilson's house. His nephews, AJ and Cass, however, found the shield and tried to play with it. Later, Wilson and Bucky Barnes practiced throwing and catching the shield. Upon his first attempt, the shield got stuck in a tree, so they put mats around the tree to protect it. While Barnes threw and caught the shield with ease, Wilson struggled.\n\nWilson, having embraced the role as Captain America, exercised and practiced with the shield. After a few mistakes in which he missed the shield, he eventually was able to throw and catch the shield successfully.[14]\n\nSam Wilson, in his new Captain America suit, flew to New York City and used the shield to break one of GRC New York Headquarters's windows to allow him to get inside. He then used the shield to fight against Georges Batroc, and threw the shield once more to break another window to escape through.\n\nWilson then used the shield to knock Diego, one of the Flag Smashers, out of the pilot seat of a helicopter that he'd hijacked containing GRC members. Afterwards, Wilson threw the shield at Karli Morgenthau, Dovich, DeeDee, and Gigi knocking them to the ground on the riverbank, before Wilson stood alongside Bucky Barnes and John Walker.\n\nWilson then used the shield to block Morgenthau's attacks as he didn't want to fight her because she was being unreasonable at the moment. Eventually, Wilson used the shield to hit Morgenthau back, but Morgenthau continued and knocked the shield out of Wilson's grasp, before Wilson picked the shield up again.\n\nAfter Wilson's speech as the new Captain America, Barnes congratulated him and patted the shield as the shield had sentimental value to Barnes.[15]\n\nIn an alternate 2012, following the Battle of New York, Captain America donned the shield as he prepared to perform search and rescue. However, he was soon informed that Loki had acquired the Tesseract and had escaped. Rogers then witnessed someone identical to him on the fourteenth floor of Stark Tower, whom he believed was Loki. Despite the other Rogers claiming that he was not Loki, the two Captain America's clashed, both of them possessing a vibranium shield. During the battle, both of their shields went over the railing and tumbled onto the ground below before Rogers was rendered unconscious by his main counterpart.[4]\n\nIn an alternate 2008, the shield had been acquired by the Collector and housed inside his museum on Knowhere.[16]\n\nIn an alternate 2010, Nick Fury found the shield covered in ice.[17] Captain America later used the shield to fight against Loki and his army on the Helicarrier.[18]\n\nIn an alternate 2018, Steve Rogers became infected by the quantum virus and transformed into a zombie. As a zombie, Rogers still carried the  shield to use as a weapon and protection. Eventually, Rogers attacked Bucky Barnes on a train. When Rogers threw the shield at Barnes, Barnes caught it and threw it back, slicing Rogers in half. Barnes then grabbed the shield for himself and used it as his weapon.[19]\n\nIn an alternate 2015, in his campaign to destroy all life, Ultron killed Captain America and destroyed his shield.[20]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Azzuri donated some vibranium to the United States Army during World War II. Howard Stark used this vibranium to create Captain America's shield, which ended up lost and frozen in the Arctic.[21]\n\nIn an alternate universe, a version of Captain America's Shield was pruned by the Time Variance Authority and transferred to the Void.[22]\n\nIn an alternate universe, a photo of Captain America with the shield was made into a poster, one of which being owned by Peter Parker.[23] Steve Rogers at some point took another photo with the shield with Norman Osborn. This photo was hung in the walkway to Osborn's office.[24] He also used the shield during the Avengers Civil War.[25]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Howard Stark obtained Vibranium and used it to make a shield reminiscent of Steve Rogers' USO shield. He considered improving the design, but ultimately decided to keep it simple. Rogers asked what Peggy Carter thought, so she pulled out her gun and fired at it, declaring that it worked. Rogers used it as he led the Howling Commandos in a series of attacks against Hydra facilities. Rogers used the shield while fighting a Hydra trooper to reflect the trooper's energy blast back onto itself and send it flying out of the Schnellzug EB912. Rogers found Red Skull and chased him through his base, but Red Skull tried to close a blast door between them, so Rogers used his shield to pry it open. Rogers took the shield onto the Valkyrie and used it to fight Red Skull.[26]\n\nCaptain America's original shield was a heater-shaped shield that was made of a relatively sturdy metal that allowed Captain Rogers to rely on it as a viable weapon in battle. The outer surface of the shield was painted in an American Flag motif, with an area of blue with three white stars across the top, and a series of vertical red and white stripes running down to the point. The inner surface had the appearance of a polished brass plate and had mounted leather handles that allowed it to be held. This shield was mostly used as a melee weapon to attack enemies directly and provide some protection from gunfire and debris from explosions. After its surface was punched in by the Red Skull, Captain America abandoned the shield.\n\nAfter entering World War II as a fully recognized soldier, Captain America switched to a special, disc-shaped shield made of vibranium provided to him by the Strategic Scientific Reserve. This shield appeared to be composed of four concentric sections, with fittings on the inner surface for two leather straps that allow the shield to easily be held and worn on Captain Rogers' arm. The straps would later be replaced by an electromagnet that would connect to another electromagnet worn at the hand and forearm during the Attack on the Hydra Research Base.\n\nCaptain America relied heavily on the shield as a weapon that was balanced in both defensive and offensive capabilities. Made from vibranium, it is able to absorb and reflect kinetic energy, enabling it to withstand impacts that would break a shield made of any other material. The shield's center is also highly deflective, able to redirect flying projectiles- as demonstrated when Rogers was able to ricochet a concentrated fire of high caliber bullets from a minigun back at his enemies- and also reflect the impact of Mjølnir to cause a massive shock wave. It was also discovered to be incredibly effective at deflecting or diffusing attacks from energy-based firearms such as those developed by Hydra, Iron Man's repulsor beams, or Chitauri weaponry. The vibranium shield also demonstrated that it can be used to cushion falls from great heights.\n\nAs an offensive weapon, the shield's discus shape and vibranium composition make it powerful as both a close-quarters melee weapon and a thrown weapon. In the hands of a trained fighter like Captain America, the shield is a strong melee weapon, using the flat surface and blunt outer edge of the shield to strike enemies in vital areas. In the right hands, the shield is also an exceptional ranged weapon as its vibranium composition and broad, curved shape allow it to easily move through the air when thrown while maintaining nearly constant velocity and momentum. One of the most unique attributes of the shield is its ability to ricochet after striking a solid surface when thrown, losing very little of its momentum, allowing it to strike several targets, and, if aimed properly, return to the thrower.\n\nThe shield originally had a reflective, shiny grey appearance due to its vibranium composition. However, the shield was later painted to match the appearance of Captain America's uniform, placing a white star in the center, surrounded by blue, and making the three outer rings into red and white stripes. During modern stealth missions, the red sections of the shield would temporarily be covered with a light blue color to make it appear less conspicuous.",
