  "content": "Mjølnir[3] is a powerful enchanted war-hammer made of Uru, forged by the Dwarves of Nidavellir for the Asgardian Royal Family, and was used by Odin before he passed it down to Hela and then Thor. The hammer was used extensively by Thor as his primary weapon until it was destroyed by Hela in 2017. The broken pieces were eventually made into a tourist attraction in New Asgard.\n\nFive years after the Snap, Thor time traveled to an alternate 2013 and brought its Mjølnir into the main universe's 2023, where it was used by Steve Rogers during the battle to fight an alternate Thanos. Afterwards, Rogers time-traveled to the alternate 2013 and returned Mjølnir.\n\nIn 2025, Mjølnir reassembled itself in order to bestow power on to Jane Foster, who began operating as Mighty Thor. However, Mjølnir's power prevented any attempts to treat Foster's cancer. Following Foster's death, Thor regained possession of Mjølnir.\n\nMjølnir was forged from Uru in Nidavellir per Odin's request by the Dwarves.[1] During Odin's conquests of the Nine Realms, his eldest child, Hela, possessed Mjølnir and used it to support him in his battles until he imprisoned her in Hel and took Mjølnir back.[4] Odin subsequently placed it on a pedestal in his vault.[1]\n\nSometime before his coronation to be the king of Asgard, Mjølnir was given to Thor, as a way to help channel his powers. He showed off with it during his coronation. However, the ceremony was interrupted by a group of Frost Giants trying to steal the Casket of Ancient Winters from Odin's Vault. Thor wanted to go to Jotunheim and show the Asgardians' strength to ensure the Frost Giants would never trespass in Asgard again.[1]\n\nUsing the Bifrost Bridge, Thor, Loki, Lady Sif and the Warriors Three arrived in Jotunheim. After King Laufey mocked him, Thor used the full power of Mjølnir to kill as many Frost Giants as he could and even killed the Frost Beast.[1]\n\nAfter the battle against the Frost Giants, destroying the fragile truce between them and the Asgardians, Odin punished Thor by stripping him of his godly powers. Odin exiled Thor to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by Mjølnir, now protected by an enchantment spoken by Odin so that only a worthy person could wield its power. Both were transported to Puente Antiguo, New Mexico.[1]\n\nBy the time Mjolnir is in Earth, people have flocked to the site, holding a tailgate party around it while they futilely try to move the object. Even the Watcher informant's truck is destroyed when a length of chain is attached to it. Later, a black SUV arrives on the scene.\n\nAn \"0-8-4\" was reported, an object of unknown origin, by S.H.I.E.L.D., which Phil Coulson investigated.[2] When he arrived in New Mexico, he observed a massive crater created by Mjølnir. Coulson then called Nick Fury to inform him that he found it.[5] Elliot Randolph, an expert in Norse Mythology and a professor of the University of Seville, was contacted as a consultant.[6]\n\nWhen Thor discovered Mjølnir's nearby location, he attempted to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. quickly constructed around the hammer, but, due to his continued unworthiness, he found himself unable to lift it, and was captured. With the help of Erik Selvig, he was freed and resigned himself to his exile on Earth.\n\nLater, Loki, invisible to mortals, came to the facility where he attempted to lift the hammer, but could not.[1]\n\nWhen he seized the throne of Asgard, Loki sent the Destroyer down to the Earth in order to kill Lady Sif, the Warriors Three, and Thor. The Destroyer attacked and defeated the Asgardian warriors, prompting Thor to sacrifice himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proved him worthy to wield Mjølnir. The hammer returned to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the giant automaton.[1]\n\nThor returned to Asgard where he stopped Loki's plan to destroy Jotunheim. To do that, he had to destroy the Rainbow Bridge with Mjølnir.[1]\n\nIn 2012, when Loki reappeared on Earth, Thor came to capture him. Loki was captured by Iron Man and Captain America, but they were not willing to hand him over to Thor. Thor fought against them, but even Mjølnir was powerless against Captain America's Shield. When Thor struck the shield with Mjølnir, it created a huge shockwave that leveled the forest for hundreds of yards, leaving Thor somewhat surprised that the shield had absorbed the blow.[7]\n\nWhile in battle against Hulk, Thor used Mjølnir to knock him off his feet with a well-placed blow to the jaw. When Thor threw Mjølnir, Hulk tried to catch it only to be dragged straight down to the ground. Even with all his strength, Hulk was unable to lift Mjølnir, giving Thor an upper hand in the fight.[7]\n\nAfter joining forces with the Avengers, Thor used Mjølnir to great effect against the Chitauri. It was, however, unable to disarm the Tesseract. On the battlefield, Thor used Mjølnir to throw lightning at the Chitauri portal, bringing down a Leviathan and to simply kill potentially hundreds of Chitauri.[7]\n\nIn 2013, Thor used Mjølnir against the Marauders during the War of the Nine Realms, notably destroying a Kronan Stone Man with one hit.[8]\n\nThat same year, the Dark Elves invaded Asgard and Mjølnir was used to throw lightning at Malekith, burning the right side of his face.[8]\n\nWhen dealing with the Aether, Mjølnir's lightning managed to shatter it into shards, only for it to reform later. Mjølnir was also no match against the Kursed Algrim who simply deflected it when Thor summoned it to strike him.[8]\n\nMjølnir, however, worked greatly against Malekith on Earth, with Thor being able to deflect many of his newly acquired Aether powers. The constant shifting of the fighting between worlds caused Thor and the hammer to become separated, but at the battle's apex, as Malekith unleashed the Aether to complete his plan, Thor was able to summon Mjølnir back to his hand and use it to bury the last of Erik Selvig's gravitational devices into Malekith's chest, allowing Jane Foster to transport the Dark Elf warlord to his death on Svartalfheim.[8]\n\nFollowing the end of Malekith's campaign, Thor returned home to Asgard to speak with Odin, unaware that Loki had usurped the throne and was impersonating the All-father. During their conversation, Thor offered Mjølnir back to \"Odin\" who refused it. \"Odin\" then gave his blessing for Thor to relocate to Earth, and Thor, along with Mjølnir, was transported to London using the Bifrost Bridge.[8]\n\nThroughout 2014, Thor and Jane Foster pursued a steady relationship in New Mexico with Mjølnir by their side. On Halloween night, Thor asked Mjølnir to protect Foster whenever she was in any trouble. This resulted in Thor enchanting Mjølnir, making Foster worthy of the weapon's powers whenever she needs protection from any mortal danger.[9]\n\nLater in 2015, Mjølnir was used by Thor in conjunction with Captain America's Shield during their raid on Baron Strucker's HYDRA base in Sokovia, with Captain America holding the shield up and Thor hitting the shield with the hammer, causing a shockwave that incapacitated their enemies.[10]\n\nFollowing the battle, the Avengers organized a party at the Avengers Tower to celebrate the recovery of Loki's Scepter and the defeat of Wolfgang von Strucker. Some of the Avengers played a game to see if anyone could lift Mjølnir. Only Steve Rogers managed to move the hammer slightly, which momentarily discomforted Thor. In reality, Steve had been deemed worthy by Mjølnir, causing the slight movement, but he chose not to lift the hammer to save Thor embarrassment. However, Thor became suspicious that he was worthy.[10]\n\nRunning at super speed, Quicksilver saw Mjølnir fly past him as Thor threw it during the Battle at the Salvage Yard. Planning to use it against the Avengers, Quicksilver grabbed the flying hammer but it dragged him until he released it.[10]\n\nActing on a vision he had received, Thor used Mjølnir to recharge the Regeneration Cradle containing Ultron's incomplete biological body, resulting in the birth of the Vision. A few moments later, as the Avengers were debating whether they could trust him, the Vision easily lifted Mjølnir and casually handed it to Thor. Since the hammer had judged him worthy, Thor accepted the synthezoid as an ally and, later, advised he be allowed to continue to be entrusted with the Mind Stone.[10]\n\nMjølnir was once again used in conjunction with Captain America's Shield to create a combination attack that destroyed many Ultron Sentries as the Battle of Sokovia waged. Captain America threw his shield and allowed Thor to hit it with Mjølnir, causing the shield to fly faster as a projectile weapon.\n\nVision's ability to use the hammer was utilized during the Ultron Offensive, who of course was not expecting anyone besides Thor to use it. Vision commented that Mjølnir was \"terribly well-balanced,\" which Thor said was necessary so that its wielder did not lose momentum on forwarding swings.[10]\n\nIn 2017, Mjølnir was used by Thor when he was imprisoned in Muspelheim. He summoned his hammer to get free of his shackles and then fought Surtur's army of Fire Demons using it and dropped it inside the jaw of a large dragon, rendering it temporarily immobile. Upon returning to Asgard, after learning from Surtur that Odin was no longer there, Thor used Mjølnir to threaten the \"Odin\" impostor to reveal himself, and as he suspected he was revealed to be Loki. The two brothers went to Earth to find their father, so in order to hide it from the public, Mjølnir transformed into an umbrella.[4]\n\nThor was aided by Doctor Strange in finding Odin. After the latter located him in Norway, Thor summoned Mjølnir to him, breaking many artifacts of the New York Sanctum in the process. In Norway, before his death, Odin revealed to his sons that they had a sister named Hela who would try to rule Asgard by force after his death. When Hela arrived at their location, Thor threw Mjølnir at her, but she managed to block the attack and hold the hammer with her bare hand. Much to Thor's surprise, Hela shattered the mighty hammer.[4]\n\nBy 2025, the broken fragments of Mjølnir were made into a tourist attraction in New Asgard. They were placed in a glass containment and were protected by Einherjar who surrounded the area around it. The fragments were shown on the New Asgard Tours.[9]\n\nIn 2025, Mjølnir called out to Jane Foster, who was currently diagnosed with cancer, on a promise Thor made upon the hammer when he was dating Foster. Once at New Asgard, Foster saw the place where Mjølnir had been previously been shattered.\n\nWhen Mjølnir reacted to Foster's presence, she finally held the hammer and as long as she held it, she became the Mighty Thor, donned with Asgardian armor similar to Thor's. She used it to great effect before and during the attack on New Asgard by Gorr and his Shadow Monsters. Helping to defeat them with Mjølnir now able to separate into many pieces, seemingly the fragments that the hammer was broken into when shattered by Hela, and strike multiple enemies or targets at once. During this time Thor tried to summon Mjølnir from Mighty Thor but was unable to, despite still being worthy to wield the hammer.\n\nLater Mighty Thor, along with Thor and Valkyrie went to confront Gorr and save the Asgardian children. The trio fought to great effect, but Mjølnir briefly separated from Mighty Thor when caught by Gorr. The hammer escaped when Thor summoned Stormbreaker and along with the group they returned to New Asgard.[9]\n\nMighty Thor soon found that prolonged use of Mjølnir was making it harder for her body to fight off the cancer her mortal body was dying from. If she fought for much longer then she would die, forcing her to temporarily put the hammer down.\n\nHowever after Mighty Thor sensed that Thor was in mortal danger through Mjølnir, she decided to spring into action as the Mighty Thor one last time against Gorr. After they defeated him, Foster succumbed to her cancer and died an Asgardian death, leaving Mjølnir behind for Thor.[9]\n\nThor once again retrieved Mjølnir, while he shared Stormbreaker to his adopted daughter, Love who was able to wield the axe due to her powers from Eternity. Love designed a smiley face on Mjølnir, which Thor reluctantly agreed looked better before taking his old hammer into battle once again.[9]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Thor was presented with Mjølnir by Odin in a ceremony during which Odin declared that only people who were worthy would be able to wield the hammer's power.[11] Thor used the weapon while sparring with Loki and Sif, then used it to fight off the Jötun invasion of Asgard. A Frost Goliath killed Sif, so Loki manipulated Thor into going to Niflheim and using Mjølnir to open the Cave of Ages and release Mangog. Loki then stranded Ulik on Vanaheim, where Thor used Mjølnir to fight through several Rock Trolls, including Ulik.\n\nLoki then realized that he could not defeat Mangog alone like he wanted, so he helped Thor get to Muspelheim. Thor used Mjølnir to fight through the Fire Demons and defeat Surtur. He then took the Scabrite in the Twilight Sword and infused Mjølnir with it, allowing Thor to have the power to defeat Mangog. Thor defeated Mangog using Mjølnir and help from Odin and Loki.[12]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Thor used Mjølnir during his time with the Avengers. One day he moved in with Daryll Jacobson in Australia. During his stay there he treated Mjølnir like a child, making it a bed,[13] and made a seat at the table.[14] He would mostly keep it with him, fidgeting with it during New Zealand Documentary Board documentaries[13] and destroying a game of Connect 4 with it. Although he would occasionally leave it around the house, once leaving it on the toilet, frustrating Jacobson who didn't lift it.[13]\n\nIn 2023, the Avengers initiated a Time Heist, where they time traveled through the Multiverse into alternate past timelines in order to obtain the six Infinity Stones so that they could resurrect the victims of the Snap. Using the Quantum Realm, Rocket and Thor traveled to another reality's 2013 and went to Asgard in order to extract the Aether from Jane Foster. After Rocket successfully retrieved the Aether, Thor decided to summon Mjølnir and was overjoyed to find himself still worthy of wielding it. Thor and Rocket then returned to their timeline, bringing Mjølnir with them.\n\nAfter returning and the using the Stones to resurrect the victims of the Snap, the Avengers Compound was attacked by an alternate Thanos and his army. In order to kill Thanos, Thor dual-wielded both Mjølnir and Stormbreaker and attacked him. While Thor managed to duel Thanos effectively with both weapons, Mjølnir was knocked out of Thor's possession.[15]\n\nCaptain America, who had been deemed worthy by Mjølnir, used Mjølnir to fight alternate Thanos, combining its lightning abilities and strength in conjunction with his shield. Once the restored Avengers and allies arrived, Captain America used Mjølnir's lightning abilities to fight in the battle. During the battle, he hurled Mjølnir towards Spider-Man, who fired a web strand at it and used it to fly above the Chitauri and the Outriders.\n\nA week later, Captain America was tasked with transporting all six Infinity Stones and Mjølnir to their proper universes in order to prevent massive changes to the time-space continuum. He then used the Quantum Realm and traveled to the alternate 2013 timeline, returning Mjølnir and the Reality Stone to Asgard.[15]\n\nIn an alternate 2012, after defeating Loki in the Battle of New York, Thor, wielding the hammer, escorted him alongside Tony Stark to the lobby of Stark Tower. However, when Stark suddenly experienced a mild cardiac dysrhythmia after his Arc Reactor was disabled and collapsed to the ground, Thor used Mjølnir to send a mild electrical current to the Arc Reactor, reactivating it and saving Stark's life.[15]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Throg along with his Mjølnir were pruned to the Void by the Time Variance Authority, ending up being buried underground.[16]\n\nIn an alternate 2008, Mjølnir had been acquired by the Collector and housed inside his museum.[17]\n\nTwo alternate versions of Thor who were captured by Strange Supreme were armed with Mjølnir and battled each other with it. Before being returned to his universe, one threw his Mjølnir to Captain Carter and Kahhori. Wielding it using her Tesseract-granted powers, Kahhori used Mjølnir to battle Strange alongside the Ten Rings and Drax's Knives. However, after turning into a demonic beast, Strange crushed the hammer with his teeth, destroying it.[23]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Thor chased down Chitauri using lightning bolts summoned from Mjølnir. He then fought Loki with his weapon and obtained the Tesseract[24]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Storm gained possession of Mjølnir and became the Goddess of Thunder. Storm traveled to the Earth-625, where she used Mjølnir to repel the Cosmic Squid Monster.[19] She later used Mjølnir in battle with the Order of the Watchers.[21]\n\nThor had been entrusted with the mighty hammer Mjølnir, that was \"forged in the heart of a dying star.\" Thor's mystical hammer Mjølnir, which resembled a mallet rather than a war hammer, had a number of elemental powers. It has been stated by Odin himself that Mjølnir's power had no equal, though its power has been contested by the strength of vibranium and the power of the Infinity Stones. Mjølnir was extremely durable and, combined with the various enchantments placed upon it by Odin, it was, for all intents and purposes, indestructible. It had deflected three blasts from the Destroyer (which were able to disintegrate its targets and cause explosions) and returned a blast back to it. Thor often used the hammer as a blunt melee weapon, with almost nothing being capable of withstanding a hammer strike or throw (with the exception of Captain America's Shield), especially if enhanced by lightning.. Thor used Mjølnir for a variety of short, and long-range attacks, either by direct hits or by throwing it. It returned to Thor whenever he threw it or summoned it, regardless of the impending obstacles and distance; even traveling through realms. Whenever dropped by Thor, it assumed a fixed position from which no one could move it except for a \"worthy\" individual. Those worthy of wielding Mjølnir would find swinging the hammer nearly effortless, as Vision stated that it was \"terribly well-balanced.\" Thor also used it for directing his summoned elements, such as lightning, wind, rain, and snow.\n\nIt was later revealed that Thor's lightning abilities never originated from Mjølnir, but rather it was a tool to help him focus and hone his powers until he was able to master his power and freely wield them. However, due to Odin's enchantment, the hammer did temporarily contain all of Thor's superhuman powers during its time in New Mexico, and restored them to Thor when he became worthy, resuscitating him in the process. Furthermore, Odin's enchantment, which made it so that \"Whosoever holds this hammer, if [they] be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\" caused the hammer from then on to replicate Thor's powers for any other individuals found worthy. This was seen when Mjølnir granted Steve Rogers abilities similar to Thor's, such as enhanced strength and durability, making Rogers able to go head to head with the Mad Titan Thanos, and the power to summon lightning, as seen when Captain America used Mjølnir to strike Thanos with lightning from the sky. Mjølnir was further unknowingly enchanted by Thor to protect Jane Foster if her life was in danger. As such, Foster was later granted similar abilities when she wielded the pieces of Mjølnir; this enchantment caused Mjølnir to repair itself eight years after being destroyed by Hela and return only to Foster's hand, though those deemed worthy can still pick up and use the mighty hammer.\n\nBesides channeling or replicating Thor's abilities and its own might as a blunt force weapon, Mjølnir can also be disguised by Thor as an umbrella and grant the wielder Asgardian armor; when Foster used it, it caused a transformation by enlarging her muscles and giving her a version of Thor's armor. The restored hammer can also split into fragments and have the user wield them as projectiles. For minor purposes, the hammer can also be used as a defibrillator, as seen when 2012 Thor tried to help Tony who had suffered from a minor cardiac arrest done by 2023 Ant-Man.",
