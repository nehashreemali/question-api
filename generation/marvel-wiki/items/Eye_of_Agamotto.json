  "content": "The Eye of Agamotto is a powerful relic created by Agamotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme, as a containment device for the Time Stone. The Eye was protected by the Masters of the Mystic Arts for generations.\n\nIn 2017, the Eye was found by Doctor Strange, who used the Time Stone's power to fight Kaecilius and Dormammu and restore the Hong Kong Sanctum. The following year, Strange removed the Time Stone from the Eye and created a replica, which was destroyed by Thanos.\n\nIn 2023, the Avengers initiated a Time Heist in order to resurrect the lives Thanos had claimed. Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk and Ant-Man were sent back in time to May 4, 2012 during the Battle of New York to retrieve the Space and Mind and Time Stone, where Hulk successfully convinced the Ancient One to relinquish the stone housed within the Eye. Following the Battle of Earth, where Iron Man used all six stones to kill Thanos and his army at the cost of his own life, Captain America time-traveled to 2012 to return the Time Stone to the Ancient One.\n\nBy 2024, Strange began wearing the Eye of Agamotto once again.\n\nThe Eye was created by Agamotto as a containment device for the Time Stone, enabling him and his successors to use the stone's power without suffering the adverse effects of touching an Infinity Stone.\n\nThe Eye's mystical properties, as well as the spells and gestures necessary to use it, were studied by the mystic Cagliostro, who recorded them in his personal grimoire. It was then kept in Kamar-Taj.[2]\n\nIn 2012, the Ancient One wore the Eye as she defended the New York Sanctum from the invading Chitauri.[3]\n\nIn 2016, after being trained to be a Master and having read one of the passages in the Book of Cagliostro about the Eye in Kamar-Taj, Doctor Strange put it on and tested its power on an apple, forwarding and reversing time on the object. He then used the Eye's power on the book, discovering and reading the stolen passages about the Dark Dimension and Dormammu. However, he stopped using its power as it began creating different alternate timelines, which Wong and Karl Mordo warned against, because it could destroy the natural order.[2]\n\nIn 2017, Strange used the Eye to rewind time in Hong Kong, restoring its Sanctum, and bringing Wong back to life, until he was stopped by Kaecilius, causing all of time to stop before the Sanctum could be restored, thus allowing the Dark Dimension through. Strange flew into the Dark Dimension and activated the Eye.\n\nWhen he confronted Dormammu to parley, Dormammu killed him, but the Eye's power trapped them both in a time loop that would restart every time Strange died. Dormammu finally relented and accepted Strange's terms, withdrawing his attack on Earth and taking away his Zealots.\n\nWith Dormammu gone, Strange returned the Eye to its place in Kamar-Taj feeling he was not ready to wield it yet. Wong notified Strange that he could wear the Eye again once he learned to master it powers.[2] Later that year, Strange mastered its powers and began wearing the Eye on his person by the time he met and assisted Thor.[4]\n\nIn 2018, when the Black Order arrived in New York City for the Time Stone, Doctor Strange attempted to use the Eye against Ebony Maw, but was restrained before he could activate it. As Maw attempted to grab it, the Eye glowed with Eldritch Magic, burning his hand as Strange explained that he placed a protection spell over it that would hold even if he were killed. Frustrated, Maw decided to take Strange and the Eye to his Q-Ship, intending to torture him into giving up the Time Stone.[5]\n\nStrange used the Eye again on the planet Titan to look over fourteen million possible outcomes of the impending conflict against Thanos, claiming that there was only a single outcome where they were successful. As Iron Man, Spider-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy prepared themselves for Thanos' arrival, Strange removed the Time Stone from the Eye of Agamotto and hid both artifacts, while creating a replica Eye. After Thanos defeated Strange during the Battle of Titan, he grabbed the Eye, and noting it was a fake, crushed it.[5]\n\nBy November 2024, Strange began wearing the Eye of Agamotto once more, even though it no longer contained the Time Stone.[6]\n\nIn 2024, Strange used the Eye of Agamotto to reveal an invisible Gargantos who was hunting America Chavez through the streets of New York City.[7]\n\nIn 2023, five years after the Snap, Tony Stark devised a method to travel through time safely. In order to resurrect the victims of the Snap, the Avengers subsequently initiated a Time Heist, a mission involving traveling through the Multiverse using the Quantum Realm in order to visit alternate past timelines and acquire all six Infinity Stones and bring them to their timeline. In order to retrieve the Time Stone, Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner and Scott Lang were sent back in time to May 4, 2012, creating an alternate timeline in the process.\n\nArriving during the Battle of New York, Banner attempted to take the Eye of Agamotto from the Ancient One only to be forced out of his body and into the Astral Dimension. Banner informed her of Thanos' Infinity War that occurred in his timeline and that the Avengers needed the Time Stone within the Eye to resurrect the lives lost. However, Ancient One refused to relinquish the stone, letting Banner know that the Masters of the Mystic Arts needed the Time Stone in the future to fight against certain threats and that giving Banner the stone for him to take to his timeline would leave her timeline undefended. Banner attempted to assure her that he would return the stone when they were finished with it, but she responded that she was unwilling to take the risk and that as Sorcerer Supreme, it was her duty to protect the stone.\n\nHowever, when Banner notified her that Doctor Strange, despite being Sorcerer Supreme, had willingly given up the Time Stone to Thanos, Ancient One realized that Strange would have had a good reason for doing so. Deciding to trust in her future alternate successor, Ancient One used her magic to open the Eye of Agamotto and gave Banner the Time Stone that was held within. Shortly after, Rogers returned to the alternate 2012 timeline to return the Time Stone to Ancient One.[3]\n\nIn an alternate 2008, the Eye of Agamotto had been acquired by the Collector who housed inside his museum.[8]\n\nAs the container of the Time Stone, the Eye of Agamotto allows its wielder to use the Infinity Stone's power without having to physically touch it. The Eye itself is usually closed and must be opened via sorcery in order to access the stone. Eldritch Magic is shown to be one of the ways of tapping into the stone's power to harness it in the form of time manipulation spells.\n\nEmpowered by its Infinity Stone, the Eye has tremendous time-based powers, able to control the flow of time on a small or massive scale. On a smaller scale, the Time Stone allows the user to turn something back to its previous state or accelerate its time in order to apply changes that have not yet happened. At a large scale, the stone can rewind time to undo entire events, even to the point of bringing the dead to life, by going to a point prior to their death. If the user is interrupted while rewinding time, time freezes until the user resumes the spell.[2]\n\nThe Eye's powers of reconstruction are strong, but not perfect. While the prodigiously gifted Doctor Strange was able to reconstruct the stolen pages of the Book of Cagliostro, he was unable to make the reconstruction \"real\", only revealing what had once been there.[2] However, full reconstruction is possible for wielder's of sufficient skill such as Thanos who, with the Time Stone, was able to recreate the Mind Stone after it was destroyed by Wanda Maximoff while simultaneously resurrecting Vision.[5]\n\nThe Ancient One was able to use the Eye to peer through time to a limited extent and gain a degree of awareness of possible futures, suggesting that in addition to the Eye's control over the flow of time, it can also be used to grant a sorcerer a degree of clairvoyance should said sorcerer have the necessary knowledge.[2] Doctor Strange later gained this ability, using the Eye to glimpse 14 million futures where he and his allies were defeated by Thanos, against one possible victory.[5]\n\nThe Eye can also be used to set up a time loop, resetting its state and repeating an event infinitely until the wielder halts the process. It appears skilled sorcerers, or perhaps users of powers from the Dark Dimension can, to an extent, subtract themselves to the effects of the stone, stopping the time reversal affecting oneself or noticing that one is stuck in a time loop.\n\nWong and Karl Mordo have noted that the Eye acts against the natural order of the universe and is extremely dangerous. If mishandled, the Eye can very well kill its wielder. With Wong's approval, Strange put it back on its pedestal until such time as he learned how to properly harness its power.[2]\n\nAfter Strange removed the Time Stone from the Eye and gave it to Thanos in order to spare Tony Stark's life, it no longer has its time-based powers.[5]",
