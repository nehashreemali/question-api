  "content": "The Arc Reactor is a power source designed by Howard Stark, Anton Vanko and Obadiah Stane[1] to replicate the Tesseract's energy. After the Tesseract's energy had been harnessed by Hydra during World War II, Stark studied the Tesseract attempting to do the same. Limited by the technology at his disposal, Stark and Vanko used his research on the Tesseract to create the Arc Reactor. Intended to be the first stage of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., the Arc Reactor remained generally inactive until Tony Stark was able to miniaturize it and power his Iron Man armors.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, Howard Stark studied the Tesseract and intended to harness its energy, having developed the idea of providing a limitless power source that could provide clean, renewable energy for the future of mankind.[5] By 1947, Howard Stark made the blueprints for a Palladium core that he could use for his reactor. When Whitney Frost ambushed Jason Wilkes at Howard Stark's Estate, she saw Stark's Palladium core schematics and was impressed by the idea, considering Stark a certifiable genius.[6]\n\nUnable to harness its power, Howard used his research on the Tesseract to create the first Arc Reactor, which Howard began to develop alongside Anton Vanko, and Obadiah Stane.[1] However, Howard considered the reactor to be simply \"the first step\" to a much bigger project.\n\nWhile Howard saw the Arc Reactor as a means to create a new, cleaner method to replace nuclear power, Anton saw it only as an idea that he could sell to make a fortune. Due to this, Howard accused him of espionage and had him deported back to Russia, an event that later motivated his son, Ivan Vanko, to use the Arc Reactor technology to seek revenge on Tony Stark for his family ruining their lives.\n\nEventually, a large Arc Reactor for industrial energy production and distribution was created to power Stark Industries Headquarters in Los Angeles. Howard developed a theoretical new element that would prove key to completing the perfect Arc Reactor based on the Tesseract. However, he was unable to synthesize it due to being limited by the technology available at the time, and the Arc Reactor project soon hit a standstill.[5] Knowing that he would be unable to truly harness the power of the Tesseract or create the perfect Arc Reactor in his lifespan, Howard left a blueprint of his theoretical new element hidden within a model of the 1974 Stark Expo, along with a recorded message to his son with clues about the Stark Expo model's true nature, hoping that he would rediscover it and finish his work. This message, along with his original research, were left in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody so they could one day give them to Tony, while the Stark Expo model was left at Stark Industries.\n\nIn the years after Howard's death, the Arc Reactor project became a non-priority to the company, as it was steered mainly towards producing weapons, with then-acting CEO Obadiah Stane dismissing the clean energy project as a \"publicity stunt\".[7]\n\nWhen the Ten Rings attacked and captured Tony Stark in 2008, a bomb exploded near Stark, causing shrapnel to enter his body near his heart, threatening his life. Dr. Ho Yinsen removed most of the shrapnel but some were embedded too close to his heart, so he created a way to stop the shrapnel by using a powerful electromagnet and a car battery. However, Stark knew that the weak car battery would not keep him alive for long. As such, he adapted the design of the large Arc Reactor that powered his factory and created a miniaturized version that could fit in his hand and fit into his chest.\n\nThrough the miniaturized Arc Reactor, Stark decided to create a suit of armor with his chest piece as its power source in order to escape from the Ten Rings' captivity with Yinsen's help. After creating the suit, Stark escaped, but Yinsen was killed by the Ten Rings. Despite the loss of a good friend, Stark was able to escape from the Ten Rings and was rescued by the United States military, which was led by his best friend James Rhodes.[7]\n\nUpon his return to America, Stark suggested that Stark Industries should focus on the Arc Reactor once again. Obadiah Stane remained skeptical about until he saw the miniature reactor in Tony's chest. Stark used his A.I. system, J.A.R.V.I.S., to create a much more powerful version of the miniaturized Arc Reactor to keep him alive.\n\nAfter creating his second Arc Reactor, Stark had his closest friend Pepper Potts help him remove his first one before putting the new one into his chest, which she did successfully. Stark then gave his first Arc Reactor to Potts to incinerate. Meanwhile, Stane continuously pressured Stark to let him patent the miniature Arc Reactor so he could pitch it to investors in order to keep the company afloat, but Tony refused to.\n\nStark decided to make a new suit of armor, which he would later dub them as Iron Man suit, as he used his modified Arc Reactor to power it independently. Once the suit was made, Stark decided to take it out for a test flight around the Los Angeles area. Stark's test flight was successful until he arrived back home, as he had J.A.R.V.I.S. powered his suit down, which caused him to crash all the way down to his workshop at his estate.\n\nWhile recovering from his test flight, Stark opened the present that Potts left for him while he was building his second suit, as she framed his first Arc Reactor in a glass container with the message \"Proof That Tony Stark Has a Heart\", which touched him. Stark then decided to make a third suit as he had J.A.R.V.I.S. paint it red and gold. After it was finished and saw the Ten Rings on the news, Stark used his Arc Reactor to make a blast of energy as he shot around his workshop.[7]\n\nOnce he put his armor on, Stark with his Arc Reactor flew all the way to Gulmira to battle the Ten Rings. Stark was able to stop the Ten Rings and left Gulmira, but not before the United State Military attempted to kill him. However, Stark was able to talk to Rhodes and convinced him to help him get the United States Air Force to stand down.[7]\n\nAfter seeing Stark battling the Ten Rings on the news, Stane stole the first suit of armor that Stark made from the Ten Rings, after they recovered it following his escape, as part of his project. Stane also commissioned William Ginter Riva and other Stark Industries scientists to duplicate the miniature version of the Arc Reactor so he could power his own suit. Unfortunately, Potts found out what Stane was up to and discovered that he was the one who organized Stark's kidnapping at Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, the Stark Industries scientists were unable to replicate the Arc Reactor, believing that the technology was not yet possible. Stane admonished that Stark was able to do it himself in a cave using even less resources. Realizing that none of the scientists at Stark Industries had skills that matched Tony's, Stane stole the Arc Reactor from Stark's chest to power his Iron Monger Armor. Stark was able to get to his first Arc Reactor before he died of a heart attack and put his third armor on to confront Stane and save Potts from getting killed.[7]\n\nTony Stark arrived at Stark Industries Headquarters, where he was warned by J.A.R.V.I.S. that his first Arc Reactor was not supposed to perform well with sustained flight. Stark understood, but knew what he had to do. He finally found Iron Monger, who was using Stark's stolen Arc Reactor, and they engaged in a battle. When Stane picked up a family's car, Stark redirected all the energy to his Arc Reactor to blast Stane with a huge amount of energy. Unfortunately, upon catching the car and saving the family inside it, the suit's power level reduced to nineteen percent.\n\nDespite his power struggle, Stark decided to fly upwards as high as he could. This forced Iron Monger to succumb to the icing problem, making his Arc Reactor fail and sending him falling down to the surface. This drained Stark's Arc Reactor, forcing him to run on emergency backup power. Stark safely utilized a guided fall to return. Upon landing on the roof of the Arc Reactor building at Stark Industries Headquarters, he tried to remove his suit before his chest piece failed for good, only to find that Stane survived. This forced Stark to have Pepper Potts overload the main Arc Reactor, sending a beam of energy into the sky and killing Stane. Although Stark's reactor lost power, he survived.[7]\n\nMeanwhile, Ivan Vanko and his father, Anton Vanko, a former business partner of Stark's father, saw Tony's confession that he was Iron Man on television the next morning. Vanko used his father's schematics to produce a replicated version of the miniaturized Arc Reactor, although the replica was lower in energy output.[5]\n\nSeveral months later, after revealing his identity, Stark built a fourth suit and a third Arc Reactor for it. However, Stark found out that the Palladium cores from the Arc Reactor were slowly poisoning him as they burned through them, which was accelerated by his continued use of his Iron Man armors. Also, Stark had built backup Arc Reactors in the first three suits that he already made so they were able to function without his personal one in his chest.[5]\n\nDuring a race Stark participated in, he encounter Ivan Vanko, who went by Whiplash, and fought with him in equal battle because of their suits and Arc Reactors. Despite this, Stark was able to defeat Whiplash and arrested him for his actions.[5]\n\nFor the Hammer Drones, Vanko improved the design, which he also used for his Mark II, which he planned to use for his battle against Iron Man.[5]\n\nTony attempted to fix this completely by finding a possible substitute for Palladium, without success. After finding out about this, Nick Fury gave Tony his father's original research regarding the new element which would complete the reactor. With it, and after finding the blueprints within the Stark Expo model, Tony was able to synthesize the element. This created the \"perfected\" version of the Arc Reactor Howard originally envisioned, and also saved Tony's life.[5]\n\nEventually, Tony Stark decided to continue his father's ideals to use the Arc Reactor to provide clean energy for the world. In order to capitalize on this ideal, Tony Stark created a redesigned Industrial Arc Reactor to power the newly built Stark Tower in New York City. The tower was completely removed from the city's power grid and ran entirely from the Arc Reactor in order to make Stark Tower a \"beacon of self-sustaining clean energy\" and show the world the capability of Arc Reactor technology on a large scale. Even though it was only a prototype, the building was capable of maintaining itself for an entire year.[8]\n\nErik Selvig later used Stark Tower's Arc Reactor to power the Tesseract Accelerator and activate the Tesseract's full power and open a wormhole to the Sanctuary. Although J.A.R.V.I.S. shut down the Arc Reactor, it was already too late as Selvig's device had become self-sustaining.[8]\n\nFollowing the battle on the Norco, Tony Stark studied Extremis in order to cure Pepper Potts, and used a variant to survive his shrapnel removing operation, which included an magnet powered by an Arc Reactor collecting the shrapnel. No longer requiring an Arc Reactor in his chest, he later drove to the ruins of his mansion and threw the Arc Reactor to the ocean.[9]\n\nFollowing the Avengers' mobilization in order to partake in the War on Hydra, Tony Stark created Iron Man armors that had built-in Arc Reactors in them, as he no longer required one in his chest.[9][10]\n\nIn 2016, during the clash of the Avengers, Iron Man and War Machine pursued Captain America and the Winter Soldier. The Falcon also flew after the two, so War Machine asked Vision to disable the EXO-7 Falcon suit with his laser beam. However, Vision missed Falcon and hit War Machine's Arc Reactor, shutting his armor off and causing him to crash, resulting in spinal injuries leading to partial paralysis.[11]\n\nLater, in the Hydra Siberian Facility, Iron Man fought against Captain America and the Winter Soldier. During the fight, the Winter Soldier tried to remove Iron Man's Arc Reactor with his prosthetic arm, only for Iron Man to blast out a Unibeam, which disintegrated the arm. Captain America then used his shield to disable Iron Man's suit by destroying the Arc Reactor.[11]\n\nTwo months later, a set of Arc Reactors was transported from the Avengers Tower to the Avengers Compound on a cargo plane. During the transition, the Vulture hijacked the jet in order to steal the cargo, but Spider-Man prevented him from doing it, causing the vehicle to crash-land on Coney Island. On the ground, the Vulture tried to fly with the Arc Reactor container, only to cause the Vulture's damaged Exo-Suit to explode, damaging the Arc Reactors as well.[12]\n\nIn 2018, Stark used an improved Arc Reactor at Greenwich Village to battle two members of the Black Order. However, Stark had to travel to space to rescue his close friend Spider-Man and his new ally Doctor Strange from a Q-Ship. Stark was able to save Spider-Man and tried to send him home before getting on board the ship to rescue Strange.[13]\n\nAfter rescuing Strange with help from Spider-Man, who stowed away, and meeting the Guardians of the Galaxy, Stark used his Arc Reactor to battle Thanos. However, during the fight, Stark almost had his Arc Reactor and his armor ripped off of him. Strange then stopped Thanos from killing Stark, as he told the Mad Titan to spare him in exchange for the Time Stone.[13]\n\nBy 2023, Stark had constructed a new Arc Reactor. During the battle against an alternate Thanos and his army, Stark used the Infinity Stones to wipe them out, sacrificing himself in the process. Following his death, his Reactor shut down.[14]\n\nA week later, Pepper Potts sent Tony Stark's first Arc Reactor adrift in the lake at the Stark Eco-Compound during Stark's funeral.[14]\n\nIn 2024, following a rift in the Multiverse, five villains from other universes who fought their respective iterations of Spider-Man were transported into the main universe. When Peter Parker brought them to Happy Hogan's apartment, he opened a Stark Industries Fabricator with an Arc Reactor inside it, which Max Dillon noticed, becoming amazed by its energy.[15]\n\nHowever, when Norman Osborn's alter Green Goblin showed up and convinced the uncured villains to turn against Parker, his aunt, and Doctor Octopus, Electro seized the Arc Reactor from the Stark Industries Fabricator and took it into in his possession. Dillon then built a new Electro suit and used the Arc Reactor as its core.[15]\n\nShortly after watching a livestream from Peter Parker, Electro arrived at the Statue of Liberty as he used the Arc Reactor to blast electricity and energy at the Amazing Spider-Man and the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Electro continued to use the Arc Reactor to battle the three Spider-Men.\n\nHowever, Doctor Octopus arrived and removed the Arc Reactor from Electro's chest and put his cure in its place. After setting a cured Dillon down with his tentacles, Octavius looked at the Arc Reactor and appreciated that the power of the Sun was in the palm of his hand.[15]\n\nIn an alternate 2012, Tony Stark helped Scott Lang temporary disable the alternate 2012 Stark's Arc Reactor so that they could steal the Tesseract. The disabling of the Arc Reactor caused the 2012 Stark to go into cardiac arrhythmia. However, Thor hit the Arc Reactor with Mjølnir and managed to reactivate it, saving the younger Stark's life.[14]\n\nIn an alternate 2010, Tony Stark, clad in his Mark IV armor, sat with Nick Fury at Randy's Donuts and discussed the Avengers Initiative. In the middle of the discussion, Natasha Romanoff injected him with lithium dioxide to abate the palladium blood poisoning caused by his Arc Reactor. However, Hank Pym, who hid himself in the needle, entered Stark's body and ruptured his organs, killing him.[16]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Tony Stark used the Arc Reactor to power his Mark VII Iron Man Armor during the Battle of New York. However, he could not make it make back through the wormhole before it closed at the end of the battle. This led to him landing on Sakaar. While on the planet, Stark used a charge from his Arc Reactor to fry the Grandmaster's Obedience Disk and escape, as well as to power his new Sakaarian armor. During the Sakaar Grand Prix, Stark used an energy boost from his Arc Reactor to increase the speed of his race car and win the death race. In the process, the race car became surrounded by glowing blue energy.[17]\n\nTony Stark used the Arc Reactor to power his Iron Man armor and used it to power the suit's laser beams. He spent months working on the armor before testing it in the desert. Meanwhile, Iron Monger had copied the design of the armor, having created his own, which also utilized the Arc Reactor. He used it to burst through the ground to ambush Pepper Potts, who had just discovered that he had created a copy. Iron Man flew in for the rescue and the two fought, Iron Man at one point using the Arc Reactor to fire a Unibeam at Iron Monger and soon managed to defeat the Iron Monger.[18]\n\nIn an alternate universe, the ARK Reactor was created by Stark Industries as a renewable energy source in order to get climate activists to stop pressuring the company. It powered Stark Industries Headquarters and was held in a large room. However, Stark Industries stopped making breakthroughs in the technology, so they abandoned it altogether.\n\nTony Stark was kidnapped by the Ten Rings, who demanded that he recreate the Jericho missile. Instead, Stark used palladium from the weapons that the Ten Rings had in order to create a miniaturized ARK Reactor. Stark explained how it was able to produce energy while Yinsen installed the ARK Reactor in his chest to keep the shrapnel from a Stark Industries Fragmentation Shell away from his heart. Stark and Yinsen then built a suit of armor which could be powered by the ARK Reactor for Stark to wear. Stark used the ARK Reactor-powered armor to escape captivity.\n\nObadiah Stane went to the room where the large ARK Reactor was stored to discuss Stark's plan to end weapons manufacturing. Stark suggested that they invest time resuming Repulsor technology, leading Stark to realize that someone had told Stane about his miniaturized ARK Reactor. Stark showed the ARK Reactor to Stane. Stark then returned home and asked J.A.R.V.I.S. to scan the ARK Reactor and give him recommendations for upgrades. J.A.R.V.I.S. initially could not, reminding Stark of his intention to keep himself alive. However, J.A.R.V.I.S. eventually provided a list of recommendations, which Stark used to build a new ARK Reactor using the Series IX CNC Combo machine. Stark then had his assistant, Pepper Potts, install the new ARK Reactor. She took the old one and, despite Stark's instructions to throw it out, had it preserved with a frame declaring it as \"Proof That Stark Has a Heart\".\n\nStark used the ARK Reactor to power a new armor and tested it, exerting the capacity of the reactor's power. The armor shut down, and J.A.R.V.I.S. reminded Stark that the ARK Reactor needed to have sufficient capacity to power both the suit and the electromagnet keeping shrapnel away from his heart. Stark fixed the problem in the design for his third armor, which was powered by the ARK Reactor. He used the armor to attack the Ten Rings in Gulmira.\n\nAs Stark continued to work on another armor, Stane arrived at his mansion and used a Sonic Taser to temporarily paralyze Stark, stealing his ARK Reactor as Stane's engineers were unable to miniaturize it themselves to power his own Iron Monger Armor. Stark struggled to reach the encased old ARK Reactor and used it to power his Mark III armor as he proceeded to fight Stane.\n\nA fight broke out in the ARK Reactor building at Stark Industries Headquarters, causing the core to become breached and the building to evacuate. The ARK Reactor began to meltdown, so Potts prepared to overload the ARK Reactor and discharge the excess power while Stark fought Stane. However, the circuit was incomplete, so Stark returned to the ARK Reactor building from the fight and completed it. However, before Stark could clear the roof, Stane attacked again. Stark told Potts to discharge the energy, sending a burst that killed Stane. The following day, Stark had engineers at the company work nonstop to repair the ARK Reactor. As Stark prepared for his press conference about the battle, he found himself continually touching the ARK Reactor in his chest.[3]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Stark Industries invented the ARK Reactor as a publicity stunt to “appease the hippies”, and it was installed in a building at the Stark Industries Headquarters. Further development was shut down due to it not being cost-effective.\n\nIn 2008, Tony Stark secretly invented a miniature version after being kidnapped by the Ten Rings, instead of the Jericho missile that the they wanted him to build. With the help of Ho Yinsen, he deconstructed several old weapons gathered by Abu Bakar and extracted the Palladium. Once they finished, Yinsen was stunned by the power of the ARK Reactor. Yinsen then installed the device in Stark's chest to prevent the shrapnel from reaching his heart, replacing the crude device that was there before.\n\nThey then began working on the Iron Man Mark I Armor. Once it was complete, he used the ARK Reactor to power it and escape the base. However, after escaping, he realized that it used up almost all of the power in the ARK Reactor. He exited the armor and began wandering the desert. After Stark was found and returned to the United States, he and Obadiah Stane talked near the ARK Reactor building at the Stark Industries headquarters and suggested Stark Industries focused on the Repulsor technology instead of weapons manufacturing.\n\nStark then went to his mansion and asked for J.A.R.V.I.S., his A.I. assistant, to help him build an improved version of the miniature ARK Reactor. After a little resistance, J.A.R.V.I.S. quickly designed it and began creating the parts. Stark could not install it himself, so he called Pepper Potts, his human assistant, into his workshop to help him. Despite her concerns, she completed the operation without issue. She held onto the old ARK Reactor despite Stark's suggestion that she throw it out. As he worked on the improved ARK Reactor, he also worked on the Iron Man Mark II Armor, which utilized the ARK Reactor in its power and repulsor systems. Days later, Potts came back into his workshop, gifting him his old arc reactor with the message “Proof Tony Stark Has a Heart”. After a test flight in the Mark II Armor, he made the Iron Man Mark III Armor, which solved many of the Mark II's problems, and it was more combat-oriented than the Mark II.\n\nLater, in the lab under the ARK Reactor building, Stane had engineers work on making him the Iron Monger Armor. However, they struggled with miniaturizing the ARK Reactor. Enraged, he met with Stark at Stark's mansion. Stane used the Sonic Taser to cause Stark to go motionless so Stane could remove the ARK Reactor from Stark's chest. Stane left him for dead as he returned to the lab. Stark struggled to workshop and did his best to grab the old ARK Reactor. After knocking over his old ARK Reactor, he managed to get in position so his robot could install it. Meanwhile, Stane returned to his lab and placed the ARK Reactor in his Iron Monger Armor.\n\nJames Rhodes rushed to his workshop, worried, but he found Stark getting the old ARK Reactor installed. The two then drove to the Stark Industries Headquarters as Stane, now in his Iron Monger Armor, battled Phil Coulson's team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and Potts. Stark called Potts and she went up top to meet him outside of the ARK Reactor building.\n\nThe two armored men battled, accidentally cracking the housing of the giant ARK Reactor. The two continued to fight as Stark guided Potts through safely discharging the power so it did not melt down. The armored men returned to the top of the ARK Reactor building as they dueled, which gave Stark a plan. Potts released the energy, causing both of the armors to deactivate; however, Stark's ARK Reactor still had some lingering power. Iron Monger hung onto the ledge and Stark attempted to pull him up. However, Iron Monger let himself fall into the ARK Reactor, vaporizing him. Iron Man escaped the collapsing roof of the ARK Reactor building and returned to the ground.[4]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Ho Yinsen built the Arc Reactor and placed it inside Tony Stark's chest to prevent the shrapnel from entering his heart. Stark then used the reactor to develop the Iron Man Armor to break out of captivity. He did so and flew away.\n\nRealizing the power that was bestowed upon him, Stark developed two more armors and used the final one to attack Maggia and A.I.M. to destroy their weapons. During these missions, Stark routinely used his chest piece to create a powerful blast, having notably destroyed the Nefaria Compound's power generator. He then had to fight Iron Monger, who had an Arc Reactor of his own. In the end, Pepper Potts was forced to overcharge the large Arc Reactor powering Stark Industries Headquarters in order to kill Stane.[19]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Tony Stark built a miniaturized Arc Reactor, based on the large Arc Reactor that powered Stark Industries Headquarters, and put it in his chest. He used the Arc Reactor to power the Mark I Armor, which he used to escape from the Ten Rings. He built new suits of armor and used the Arc Reactor to power them, making the technology far more advanced than any of his competitors. The Arc Reactor was able to restore power to Stark's heart in the event of a failure.\n\nObadiah Stane needed a power source to fuel his version of the armor, so he stole Stark's Arc Reactor. Stark used another Arc Reactor to power his armor and went on several more missions. Stark fought Stane and tricked him into standing over the large Arc Reactor at Stark Industries Headquarters, as Pepper Potts caused it to create an electromagnetic pulse, disabling the armor and allowing Stark to defeat Stane.[19]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Tony Stark used an Arc Reactor to power his Mark III Iron Man armor.[20]\n\nIn an alternate universe, a civilian was able to create an Iron Man armor and embedded it with an Arc Reactor. Stark then took the armor on a test run, where he was attacked by, and defeated, Iron Monger Armors that were powered by Arc Reactors.[21]\n\nUsing the Arc Reactor in his body to power the Iron Man Armor: Mark VI, Iron Man chased down the Hammer Drones at the Stark Expo. Meanwhile, War Machine used the reactor in his Mark I armor to fight the drones. Eventually, the drones were defeated.[22]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Iron Man had to fly upwards to catch falling Arc Reactors. These Arc Reactors gave his armor more power. However, he eventually ran out of Arc Reactors and lost power, causing him to fall.[23]\n\nIn another universe, the Arc Reactor powered Iron Man's Mark VII Armor. When Iron Man flew into energy sources while fighting the Chitauri, his Arc Reactor could produce a unibeam.[24]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Iron Man used his Arc Reactor-powered armor to help Thor during the Chitauri Invasion.[21]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Iron Man used his Arc-Reactor powered armor to calibrate the Iron Man armor and rescue several passengers from an exploding Air Force One.[25]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Tony Stark had an Arc Reactor in his chest in order to save his life. This reactor doubled as an energy source for his suits of armor. In some cases, the Arc Reactor was built into the suit so people like Iron Patriot could use it.[26]",
