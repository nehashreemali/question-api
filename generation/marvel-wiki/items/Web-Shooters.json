  "content": "The Web-Shooters are a pair of wrist-mounted mechanical devices developed and used by Spider-Man to project Synthetic Webbing.\n\nThe Web-Shooters and web formula were designed and built by Peter Parker himself using homemade materials and chemicals found in typical high school level chemistry classes.[1] Shortly after he gained his powers, Parker then started using them to fight crime in New York City. When Tony Stark met Parker to recruit him for the Battle at Leipzig-Halle Airport, Parker used the web-shooter to web Stark's hand to the door handle before awkwardly helping him remove the webbing.[2]\n\nIn 2016, Tony Stark created new Web-Shooters for Peter Parker after the web-slinger been recruited to help him. A holographic Spider-Signal was added to the shooters along with communication options. Spider-Man used them during the Battle at Leipzig-Halle Airport at the Leipzig-Halle Airport in Germany, most notably to snatch away Captain America's Shield. He then employed them against Falcon and Winter Soldier, webbing them to the floor of the airport terminal. As he dueled with Captain America, he used the Web-Shooters to keep him off balance until Captain America broke out of the webbing. When Ant-Man used the Pym Particles to become Giant-Man, Spider-Man used the Web-Shooters to save War Machine from crashing into a fuel tank. He then used them to tangle Ant-Man's legs, allowing Iron Man and War Machine to knock him down.[2]\n\nMonths later, Parker used the Web-Shooters to stop a robbery from the Criminal Avengers and in an attempt to apprehend them. He then used them to try and apprehend Vulture, but was unsuccessful in doing so. He then used them when he was stuck at the Damage Control Deep Storage Vault and to rescue Liz Allan at the Washington Monument after the elevator had fallen due to a Chitauri Energy Core burst. After the Staten Island Ferry was cut in half due to Vulture's intervention, Parker used his Web-Shooters to hold both sides upwards, but was aided by Iron Man. After this incident, Stark confiscated the Web-Shooters along with the suit.[1]\n\nAfter Tony Stark confiscated the upgraded Web-Shooters, Peter Parker reverted to using his original homemade ones. After attempting to equip them, he was blindsided by Shocker, and struggled to defend himself without his webs. However, Ned Leeds was able to recover the Web-Shooter and used it to restrain Shocker, allowing Spider-Man to recover his Web-Shooter and defeat Shocker. Using the old Web-Shooters, he attempted to thwart's Vulture's hijacking of the Stark Cargo Plane and then to save Vulture from his exploding suit.[1]\n\nAfter successfully capturing Vulture, Tony Stark returned the Web-Shooters he had created to Peter Parker.[1] Two years later, the Web-Shooters were used by Parker to open up his school bus's window in order to investigate the arrival of a Q-Ship in Greenwich Village. He then used them to combat Cull Obsidian and throw a destroyed car at him. Parker then used them to help him chase after Ebony Maw who had captured Doctor Strange.\n\nAfter Parker and Tony Stark had infiltrated the Q-Ship, Parker used them to rescue Strange after he and Stark had devised a plan to rescue him from Maw. After landing on Titan, Parker used them to defend himself against Mantis, who he thought was a threat. He then used them against Thanos to pull him down in order to obtain the Infinity Gauntlet, and later to rescue an unconscious Star-Lord, Drax, Mantis, and Nebula.[3]\n\nIn 2023, when Parker was resurrected, he used the Web-Shooters to fight in the battle at the destroyed Avengers Compound. He used them to swing from Giant-Man, pull back an alternate Cull Obsidian from attacking Iron Man, and to combat the Outriders.[4]\n\nIn 2024, Parker used the Web-Shooters in Venice, Italy to attack the Hydro-Man illusion. He tried to fire a web at Hydro-Man, but it passed right through him. Therefore, Parker decided to instead focus on preventing as much damage to the city as possible. A bell tower then collapsed due to Hydro-Man's destruction, so he utilized his Web-Shooters to keep the bell tower from falling and hurting many civilians.\n\nAfter accidentally calling a drone strike while in Austria on Brad Davis, Parker had to use the Web-Shooters to disarm the Stark Industries Combat Drones and prevent it from harming Davis. When Molten Man attacked the Prague Carnival, Parker had to employ his Web-Shooters to defeat Molten-Man, which eventually succeeded. During the Ambush in Berlin, the Web-Shooters were used by Parker as he tried, but failed, to attack Mysterio within the never-ending illusions.[5]\n\nUsing a Stark Industries Fabricator, Peter Parker created two new Web-Shooters with increased taser voltage that were integrated into his new Upgraded Spider-Man Suit. During the Battle of London, Spider-Man used these Web-Shooters to fight Mysterio and his drones, which were used to destroy Tower Bridge. Spider-Man utilized his Web-Shooters to swing around and avoid the drones that were chasing him, and also used them to web up the drones and destroy them.[5]\n\nIn an alternate reality, Peter Parker used the Web-Shooters to make a base of six vehicles suspended by high rise buildings above New York City. Parker then used them to get the train moving at the Grand Central Terminal and to fight against Wanda Maximoff in Camp Lehigh, New Jersey.[7]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Peter Parker built two wrist-mounted Web-Shooters to use while operating as the Amazing Spider-Man. After being transported through the Multiverse into the main universe, he met two other Spider-Men and used his Web-Shooters to fight Electro and Lizard during the battle on the Statue of Liberty.[6]\n\nWeb Selection: The upgraded Web-Shooters provided by Tony Stark are capable of dialing different web profiles at Peter Parker's command. The different combinations can be activated either by voice command or by a gesture, and each web-shooter can seemingly utilize different selections at a time.",
