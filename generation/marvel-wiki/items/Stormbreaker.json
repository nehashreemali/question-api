  "content": "Stormbreaker is an enchanted ax of Dwarvian manufacture, forged from Uru on Nidavellir with the ability to summon the Bifrost. Following Mjølnir's destruction, the weapon was forged by Thor in order to defeat Thanos.\n\nStormbreaker was designed by the dwarves of Nidavellir to be the greatest weapon in Asgard's history, designed for their king and capable of summoning the Bifrost Bridge on its own. However, it was never forged, and the dwarves had been pushed to near-extinction by Thanos, with Eitri as the sole survivor.[1]\n\nIn 2018, Thor, Rocket, and Groot went to Nidavellir to forge a weapon. Upon arriving, the typically lively forges of Nidavellir were cold and barren, littered with broken parts. Eitri appeared before them and learned that Thor needed a weapon, so he decided to forge Stormbreaker.\n\nWith Thor and Rocket's help, Eitri opened the cage around Nidavellir and re-lit the forge, melting down ingots of Uru and pouring it into a mold. He then shattered the mold, revealing the ax's blade and weight, but misplaced the handle for the weapon. Seeing that Thor was close to death after taking the brunt of the power, Groot decided they could not wait for Eitri to find or create a metal handle; he grasped the red hot pieces of metal with one of his arms and then cut the arm off to serve as the handle, truly finishing Stormbreaker. The weapon then revived Thor.[1]\n\nStormbreaker was used by Thor to summon the Bifrost Bridge to Wakanda. It was then used during the battle against the Outriders, augmenting Thor's own lightning massively. It was also used to destroy the Outrider Dropships and the remaining Threshers.\n\nNotably, it was the only weapon to severely injure Thanos by impaling him in the chest soon after the Infinity Gauntlet was completed. However, Thor intentionally aimed for Thanos' chest, which allowed Thanos the chance to activate the Infinity Gauntlet and eliminate half of all life in the universe. As Thanos teleported away in a wormhole, Stormbreaker fell out of his chest and to the ground, smeared with his blood.[1][2]\n\nThor then took Stormbreaker with him to the Avengers Compound. Three weeks later, Stormbreaker was summoned to Thor's hand in order to test Carol Danvers's resolve. When she did not flinch, Thor smiled.[3]\n\nThor then brought Stormbreaker with him on the Benatar to Planet 0259-S. There he used Stormbreaker to cut Thanos' left arm off and to decapitate him.[3]\n\nThor brought Stormbreaker with him to New Asgard. He placed Stormbreaker against a wall in his hut and it remained unused as Thor became depressed, overweight and drunk.[3]\n\nIn 2023, Stormbreaker was used for the first time in five years during the battle against an alternate Thanos at the ruins of the Avengers Compound. Thor dual-wielded both Stormbreaker and an alternate version of Mjølnir, using them to great effect in the battle. However, Thanos gained the upper hand, catching Stormbreaker when Thor summoned it and nearly forced it into Thor's chest. In the later stages of the battle, Thor used Stormbreaker to battle the combined forces of alternate versions of the Outriders, Chitauri, Sakaarans, and the Black Order. At one point, Steve Rogers wielded Stormbreaker, but Thor quickly switched the weapons. After the battle ended, Thor joined the Guardians of the Galaxy and took Stormbreaker with him.[3]\n\nStormbreaker was used by Thor during his time as a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. After he had lost weight and was again at his physical peak, Stormbreaker was brought on various adventures. In 2025, they went to Indigarr and Thor set Stormbreaker up in dirt as he meditated on a hill. After Thor was asked to assist in the fight against the Booskans, Thor took Stormbreaker out of the dirt and used it to fly down to the ground.[4]\n\nStormbreaker was handed over to Love, once Thor adopted her and discovered her cosmic powers.[4]\n\nDuring the Battle of Wakanda, Thor wielded Stormbreaker against a zombified Thanos. Although Thor struck the Mad Titan in the chest, Stormbreaker had very little effect. After Thanos' retaliating strike, Spider-Man grabbed Stormbreaker with his Synthetic Webbing and threw it at Thanos who then destroyed the axe with a blast from the Power Stone.[5]\n\nFive years later, Wanda recreated Stormbreaker for zombie Thor to wield against Infinity Hulk. However, Infinity Hulk was able to destroy it.[6]\n\nStormbreaker is able to focus and enhance Thor's powers. Due to it being composed of Uru, the weapon is nigh-indestructible and able to withstand energy blasts created by the Infinity Stones. It is also able to channel dimensional energy and summon the Bifrost Bridge, which enabled Thor to teleport himself, Rocket, and Groot to Wakanda. Like Mjølnir before it, Stormbreaker will return to Thor's hand when summoned and strikes his opponents with massive force. It can glow with an otherworldly blue flame that crackles with electricity and seems to have the ability to home in on a target if Thor wills it. In addition, the weapon allows the user to fly effortlessly while using it, unlike Mjølnir, which required the user to spin it at great speed to lift them off the ground. Unlike Mjølnir, however, the weapon is not enchanted to prevent those deemed \"unworthy\" from holding it, making anybody with sufficient strength capable of using the weapon. An alternate version was wielded by Spider-Man against Thanos with the superpowered teenager being able to fling the axe at the Mad Titan after using his Synthetic Webbing to pull Stormbreaker into his hand. Stormbreaker can also be summoned by those worthy of lifting Mjølnir, as shown when Captain America, who was previously proven worthy of wielding the hammer in his fight against past Thanos, summoned Stormbreaker by mistake some moments later during the Battle of Earth.\n\nDue to its increased size and mass, having both the blade of an ax and the head of a hammer in its construction, as well as sporting an elongated handle enabling the weapon to be wielded two-handed, it is a notably more potent melee weapon than Mjølnir. Eitri even went as far as to say Stormbreaker was meant to be the strongest weapon in Asgard's history. As such, it is one of the few able to grievously wound Thanos, who faced off against the combined might of Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Drax, Star-Lord, Mantis, and Nebula while suffering nothing more than a tiny scratch on the cheek. Thanos himself mocked Thor for not aiming for his head, indicating Stormbreaker would have been capable of killing him instantly. The ax is so powerful that it was even able to quickly slice through and overpower the beam from all six Infinity Stones unleashed by Thanos, although he was caught off-guard and could have repelled the attack by other means. It is also capable of healing severe wounds, as shown by it fully healing a sun-damaged Thor.[1]",
