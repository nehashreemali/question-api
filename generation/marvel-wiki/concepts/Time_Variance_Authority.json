  "content": "The Time Variance Authority (TVA) is a bureaucratic organization created by He Who Remains and located outside of time and space that originally served as a temporal law enforcement agency, tasked with preserving the Sacred Timeline by preventing the creation of alternate timelines. Following Loki's decision to destroy the Temporal Loom and allow the Multiverse to flourish, the TVA shifted its focus to monitoring the Multiverse and tracking down Variants of He Who Remains.\n\nEons ago, a Variant of He Who Remains lived on Earth in the 31st century. One day, he discovered the existence of alternate universes that were stacked on top of each other. At the same time, other Variants of himself were learning the same thing, leading them to eventually make contact with one another. The Variants shared knowledge and technologies from their respective universes to improve the others. However, certain nefarious Variants saw the new universes as new lands to conquer, leading to a Multiversal War. The Variants battled each other to preserve their universe and annihilate the others. At one point, He Who Remains encountered Alioth, a creature created from the several tears in reality with the ability to consume time and space itself. He weaponized Alioth's power to put an end to the Multiversal War before isolating the Sacred Timeline and creating the Time Variance Authority to manage the flow of time and prevent any alternate timelines.[1] He recruited Variants to work for him,[2] with Ravonna Renslayer as his general and trusted second-in-command. Upon reaching an era of peace, He Who Remains ordered Miss Minutes to wipe every TVA personnel's memories of him before making them believe that they were created by the Time-Keepers to protect the Sacred Timeline.[3]\n\nA Variant of Loki was blasted through a Timedoor into the TVA's office and rushed to find Mobius M. Mobius and Hunter B-15, claiming that someone was coming. However, Mobius and B-15 had no memory of Loki,[1] and eventually realized that he was a Variant, prompting them to chase him alongside several Minutemen. Loki pled with Mobius, who did not remember him, so Loki jumped off the ledge into a mail cart, which crashed into another room. Loki assured everyone that it was alright as the mail cart left and asked if Casey remembered him while the TVA sent out a notice about Loki fleeing to all personnel. Casey called out that he had found the intruder, but Loki then time slipped away.[4]\n\nLoki time slipped in front of Ouroboros and asked how he would be able to fix his time slipping. Ouroboros first insisted that it was impossible to time slip in the Time Variance Authority Office, so Loki phrased the question as a hypothetical. Ouroboros told Loki that someone at the time period he wanted to be in would have to use a Temporal Aura Extractor while Loki pruned himself. Loki had Ouroboros make and hold onto an extractor, when he suddenly time slipped back to his present.[4]\n\nThe Time Variance Authority propaganda told of countless timelines battling one another for dominance across the Multiverse in a cataclysmic war lasting for eons and nearly destroying existence. To prevent this, the Time-Keepers brought peace and order to the Multiverse by arranging the timelines into a single \"Sacred Timeline.\" In order to preserve the timeline's proper flow, the Time-Keepers then created the Time Variance Authority to police the Multiverse from Variants who create Nexus events. If these events were left unchecked, the timeline could branch off and lead to another Multiversal War.[5] He Who Remains created this propaganda to give TVA workers purpose and dogma to cling to, and Miss Minutes helped spread it for centuries.[1]\n\nIn an alternate version of 2012, an alternate version of Loki was able to acquire the Tesseract and escape, eventually landing in the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. Seconds later, a Time Variance Authority unit led by Hunter B-15 arrived and apprehended Loki for disrupting the Sacred Timeline before pruning the alternate timeline. Loki was brought to the TVA Office and went through a Variant process before he was brought into the TVA courtroom to stand in front of Judge Ravonna Renslayer. She asked Loki if he was guilty or not, to which he denied doing any crimes against the \"Sacred Timeline\". Loki then tried to use his powers, before he was told that magic doesn't work in the TVA. Renslayer sentenced Loki to be reset, but before he was taken away, he was saved by Mobius M. Mobius who convinced Renslayer that the TVA could use Loki to their advantage.[5]\n\nLoki was recruited to work at the Time Variance Authority. Mobius M. Mobius instructed him to learn about the TVA and Loki worked at an office, where he read through TVA files and watched training videos. Miss Minutes tried to quiz Loki on what he learned, but was unsuccessful. Loki was then asked by Mobius to accompany him, Hunter B-15, and other Minutemen on a mission. After causing the TVA to fail their mission, Loki was tasked by Mobius to go over each and every one of the Variant's case files. By reading a file on Ragnarök, Loki figured out that the Variant was hiding in apocalypses.[6]\n\nLoki, Mobius M. Mobius, Hunter B-15, and other Minutemen went to Haven Hills, Alabama in 2050 to find the Variant. During the mission, Loki met the Variant and was too late to stop her from setting off numerous Reset Charges that fell through Timedoors and landed at different points throughout the Sacred Timeline. However, the TVA was able to stabilize the Sacred Timeline by pruning the branched timelines.[6]\n\nUpon being taken to the Time-Keepers' chamber, Loki and Sylvie confronted the Time-Keepers. When Laufeydottir threw her sword at one of them, its head fell off, and the two discovered that the Time-Keepers were actually androids.[7]\n\nLoki and Sylvie enchanted Alioth in the Void, causing him to leave his post.[8] They then were able to access the Citadel at the End of Time, where they were met by Miss Minutes and then He Who Remains. He Who Remains told Loki and Laufeydottir about his Variants, the Multiversal War, and why he created the Time Variance Authority. He Who Remains offered them two options; kill him and risk starting a new Multiversal War or take over the Time Variance Authority. Loki wanted to think it through, but Laufeydottir, in a fit of revenge, pushed Loki through a Timedoor and killed He Who Remains. As soon as he died, dozens of branch timelines began to form.[1] This caused the TVA to start experiencing power surges.\n\nLoki suddenly appeared in the TVA office and found Casey, relieved that Casey remembered him. He realized that he had previously been in the TVA's past and asked where Mobius M. Mobius and Hunter B-15 were, but disappeared before Casey could take him to them. Casey approached Mobius and B-15 and told them what had happened, but they were interrupted by Hunter X-05, who told them that the new Judges' Council wanted to see them in the War Room while Loki appeared and disappeared again in front of Casey.[4]\n\nIn the War Room, the Judges' Council finished questioning Hunter D-90 and brought in Hunter B-15 and Mobius M. Mobius, listening to a recording of Loki telling Mobius the truth about him being a Variant. Gamble demanded the truth and Dox insisted they hold the meeting exactly according to protocol. B-15 managed to convince Gamble to end all pruning, effective immediately. Loki suddenly appeared in the War Room, using Hunter X-05's Time Stick to reveal that the mural in the room of the Time-Keepers was covering a wall decoration depicting He Who Remains' face. Loki declared him to be the true creator of the TVA and that he would be returning.[4]\n\nMobius took Loki out of the room, and Loki explained that he was getting pulled between the past and present. Mobius brought Loki to Ouroboros, who at first did not believe that Loki could be getting pulled between times, since the phenomenon, which he called \"Time Slipping\", was not possible within the Time Variance Authority Office. However, as Loki spoke to his past self, Ouroboros in the present realized that it was in fact possible and explained that Mobius needed to use a Temporal Aura Extractor to pull Loki out of the Temporal Loom while Loki pruned himself.\n\nLoki returned to the present, when Ouroboros learned that the TVA had been experiencing power surges. As Mobius and Loki explained that they were allowing the timeline to branch now, Ouroboros realized that the branching was overloading the Temporal Loom, causing power surges. Once Ourboros' fears were confirmed, Loki asked how to stop the meltdown, and B-15 refused the option of pruning the branches. Ourboros told them the only other option was to close the blast doors to protect the TVA while he figured out how to retrofit the Temporal Loom to handle all of the branches.\n\nMeanwhile, Dox started to raid the armory, and Hunter D-90 rushed downstairs to tell B-15, Mobius, and Loki. B-15 left to handle Dox with D-90. Loki time slipped to the future while Ouroboros prepared Mobius. Mobius confronted the Temporal Loom and approached the device to attach the Aura Extractor. Mobius waited as long as he could before going back, and Ouroboros started to close the blast doors. Mobius nearly did not make it, but Loki was pulled through at the last moment and pushed them both inside. Loki then told Mobius that they needed to find Sylvie Laufeydottir.[4]\n\nDespite Ouroboros' efforts, the Temporal Loom overloaded and the Time Variance Authority Office was evacuated as Loki time slipped into the future. Realizing he did not have a Time Stick to prune himself with, he rushed through the office, looking for one. The TVA lost significant power, and Loki ran out of time. He heard a phone ring and went to it, finding Sylvie Laufeydottir in an elevator before he got pruned[4] by his future self.[3]\n\nLoki finally learned to control his Time Slipping, traveling back initially in order to attempt to fix the Temporal Loom before realizing it was ultimately useless. Even when successful in enlarging the rings to allow for increased throughput, it was doomed to fail, given the infinite branching timelines. He eventually slipped back into the moment before Sylvie Laufeydottir killed He Who Remains. After numerous more failed attempts, he was finally told by He Who Remains the Loom was a failsafe to preserve the Sacred Timeline. With this new information, Loki finally knew his new purpose. Time slipping once more, he walked out the blast doors and used his powers to destroy the loom, grabbing timelines as he ascended. He finally sat down on the remains of the throne at the Citadel at the End of Time, weaving the infinite branches together. The TVA switched to hunting the Variants of He Who Remains, while Mobius finally went to see who he truly was, observing himself playing with his sons.[10]\n\nA Hero of the Multiverse chose to use the Infinity Stones to alter the fates of their allies. The TVA was alerted to the continuity error and sent Miss Minutes to handle the situation along with a desk and Chrono Monitor. There, she was confronted by the Hero and Watcher. She noted that timelines had been getting tangled, increasing continuity errors. Miss Minutes suggested that they should prune the branch, but the Watcher interrupted and explained that they were the Hero of the Multiverse. Miss Minutes then decided to recruit the Hero to the TVA, using the Chrono Monitor to introduce the Hero to Deadpool, who she said would be the Hero's new coworker. Miss Minutes then used a Timedoor to take the hero to the Time Variance Authority Office so they could begin their training.[12]\n\nMembers of the Guardians of the Multiverse came into contact with the TVA and stole several reset charges.[13]\n\nTime Variance Authority personnel have access to an extensive array of technology at their disposal that gives them the ability to apprehend Variants and fix any changes made to the timeline.\n\nTime Variance Authority personnel are usually equipped with a variety of weapons that help them apprehend Variants.\n\nThe Time Variance Authority maintains files on different Variants and events. They also have a number of propaganda posters and videos they display.\n\nThe Time Variance Authority files are stored in the archives section of the Time Variance Authority Office.",
