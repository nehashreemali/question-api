  "content": "The Super Soldier Serum is a chemical solution originally created by Abraham Erskine. The serum, formulated to enhance the human body and mind, was intended to be utilized by the United States Armed Forces during World War II in order to transform Allied soldiers into super soldiers.\n\nOver the decades, it has been recreated by several parties, most with a considerable degree of success. It is notably responsible for the physical enhancement of Johann Schmidt, Steve Rogers, Bucky Barnes, Isaiah Bradley, Alexei Shostakov, Bruce Banner, Emil Blonsky, Karli Morgenthau, and John Walker.\n\nAbraham Erskine began developing the Super Soldier Serum in 1930 while still in Germany.[1] In 1931, Wilfred Malick delivered the key ingredient used to create the serum to Hydra.[2] In 1940, after World War II had begun, a prototype version of the serum was tested on Johann Schmidt, turning him into Red Skull in the process.[1] However, the formula wasn't ready for use at the time, and the serum's effects affected Schmidt's personality drastically.[3] Schmidt's transformation did not go as planned because his serum lacked radioactive exposure, causing the burning away of the skin and tissue surrounding his skull as well as leaving an unpleasant red scab on his nasal cavity.[4]\n\nWhen Abraham Erskine escaped to the United States of America, he joined the Strategic Scientific Reserve and perfected the serum. As a result, the SSR started Project Rebirth, an initiative to use the serum and transform Allied soldiers into super soldiers. In June 1943, using Stark Industries injection tubes and vita radiation to unlock the serum's potential, Erskine successfully used the serum on Steve Rogers, curing his ailments and increasing his physicality. Unfortunately, Erskine was killed by Heinz Kruger who tried to steal the last vial of the serum but was stopped by Rogers. Knowing that the only hope to recreate Erskine's formula was locked in Rogers' genetic code, the U.S. government took blood from Rogers, as the last remnants of the serum remained in Rogers' DNA.[3]\n\nIn October 1943, Hydra captured numerous American soldiers and sent them to work at the top-secret weapons facility in the Austrian Alps. When the prisoners were too weak to work, Arnim Zola used them as test subjects in his quest to recreate the serum. Bucky Barnes was injected with the serum and survived, although Zola abandoned his work and fled when Rogers stormed the facility, liberating Barnes.[3][5]\n\nDuring the first icy months of 1945, Rogers and Barnes led an attack on the Hydra train that was transporting Zola to another base. During the fight, Barnes fell from the train and fell several hundred feet below. However, due to the serum, Barnes was able to survive the impact, albeit losing his left arm in the process.[5]\n\nFollowing Steve Rogers' performance in World War II, many nations attempted to create their own super soldiers. During the Cold War, the two superpower nations, the Soviet Union[6] and the United States of America attempted to recreate the serum. Having produced several different versions, the United States Armed Forces used African-American soldiers as test subjects, lying to the men that they were being given tetanus shots. With the U.S. now in possession of a troop of super soldiers, the men were sent on combat missions.[7] During the Korean War, Isaiah Bradley was deployed by his superiors to eliminate Winter Soldier, though both super soldiers survived the encounter.[8]\n\nHowever, out of all of the different serum versions they had created, only one was sufficiently recreated, which had been solely administered to Bradley. The other test subjects, who had received the imperfect variants, found themselves becoming unstable and dying. No longer able to perform their combat duties adequately, they were quickly captured by enemy forces and placed in a POW camp. Realizing that their unethical experiments on African-American men could come to light, the U.S. Armed Forces decided to destroy the POW camp with an air strike to eliminate the super soldiers and hide the evidence. Wishing to save his friends, Bradley single-handedly infiltrated and liberated the camp, freeing his fellow super soldiers and returning them to their base.\n\nAs punishment for his actions, Bradley was imprisoned by his government for thirty years. Additionally, the soldiers whom he had saved quickly died, having succumbed to the side effects of the imperfect serum given to them.[7] During his imprisonment, Bradley's blood, which contained traces of the serum, was constantly extracted by various organizations, including Hydra[8] and the CIA.[9]\n\nDuring the later years of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was able to perfectly recreate the serum and administered it to Alexei Shostakov. However, as they were only able to accomplish this feat once, this left Shostakov as the Soviet serum's sole recipient. As the Soviet Union's official super soldier, Shostakov was sent on missions as Red Guardian.[6]\n\nBy December 1991, Howard Stark managed to recreate the Super Soldier Serum, prompting Hydra to send Winter Soldier to assassinate Stark and his wife Maria and retrieve the serum. This serum was injected intravenously without Vita Radiation or a Rebirth Pod, and was used by Hydra to convert their most elite death squad into Winter Soldiers. The serum granted its user more strength than Hydra's previous version, as one subject, Josef, was shown to overpower and send Winter Soldier flying during a sparring match.\n\nHowever, this version of the serum had a mental side effect, giving the Winter Soldiers an increase in aggression and making them uncontrollable. They soon turned on Hydra and thus were incapacitated and placed in cryostasis.[10] Deeming Stark's serum to be a failure, Hydra recruited Dr. Wilfred Nagel to recreate the serum. Before Nagel could finish his work, Hydra had been disbanded.[9]\n\nIn 2005, General Thaddeus Ross was commissioned to recreate the serum in order to create new super soldiers for the United States Armed Forces. In order to recreate the serum, Doctor Bruce Banner, a renowned scientist specializing in the fields of biochemistry, nuclear physics and gamma radiation, was recruited into the project. However, General Ross chose not to divulge the serum's true properties to Banner, instead informing him that the serum he was tasked to recreate had been designed to prevent radiation poisoning.[11]\n\nBanner chose to substitute the original serum's vita radiation with gamma radiation, believing it held the secret of unlocking the original serum's formula.[12] Unaware that it was a recreated Super Soldier Serum, Banner injected himself with it and was doused with an overabundance of gamma radiation, causing Banner to transform into a large, green-skinned being that soon became known as the \"Hulk.\"[11]\n\nIn May 2010, under the orders of Thaddeus Ross, a variant of the serum had been recreated and was given to Emil Blonsky through multiple deep tissue and bone marrow injections, transforming Blonsky into a super soldier. However, this version of the serum had several side effects, including both physical and mental deterioration, such as a protruded spine and aggression. After Blonsky was given a transfusion of Hulk's blood by Samuel Sterns, it mixed with the serum in his system and mutated him into the \"Abomination.\"[11]\n\nBy 2013, Hydra had access to an imperfect variant of the Super Soldier Serum, which they combined with Extremis, gamma radiation and Chitauri technology to create the Centipede Serum.[13]\n\nFollowing Hydra's disbandment, Wilfred Nagel was recruited by the CIA, who wished for him to recreate the serum. Nagel was able to make significant strides in his endeavors, as the CIA possessed samples of Isaiah Bradley's blood. By 2018, Nagel managed to isolate the trace elements of serum in Bradley's blood to recreate the serum that had been given to him, but modified it so that its users did not undergo any physical changes, along with being able to self-inject the serum without the need for a machine such as the Rebirth Pod.\n\nHowever, before he could synthesize it, Nagel was turned to dust as a result of Thanos' Snap. Five years later, he was resurrected in the Blip, only to find out that the CIA had terminated their super soldier program. Nagel then moved to Madripoor, where the Power Broker provided him with the resources to synthesize the serum.[9]\n\nBy 2024, Wilfred Nagel had successfully created twenty vials, although they were stolen by Karli Morgenthau, who used the serum on herself and gave seven other vials to certain members of the Flag Smashers.[9]\n\nMorgenthau hid the remaining twelve vials of the serum with the intention to create more super soldiers. However, while trying to flee from John Walker, Morgenthau was ambushed by Helmut Zemo, who destroyed eleven vials before being knocked out by Walker.\n\nAs Morgenthau fled, Walker found the sole remaining vial and later injected himself with it, becoming a super soldier.[14]\n\nIn an alternate universe, the Hydra attack on Project Rebirth resulted in Steve Rogers being severely injured and thus unable to take the serum. After killing Heinz Kruger, Peggy Carter decided to complete the experiment herself as power levels were dropping and nobody else available was capable of taking the serum. She became the super soldier Captain Carter while Rogers became the Hydra Stomper instead.[15]\n\nIn an alternate universe, Obadiah Stane revealed Howard Stark's work on recreating the Super Soldier Serum to Hydra through contacts in the Soviet Union in exchange for them killing the Starks so that he could become the head of Stark Industries. However, while Winter Soldier ambushed the Starks and got the serum, Red Guardian prevented him from killing the Starks.\n\nIn this universe, Stark had only created three batches of the serum rather than five, two of which were destroyed in the scuffle between Winter Soldier and Red Guardian. Red Guardian later destroyed the last of the serum in order to keep it out of Hydra's hands.[16]\n\nThe serum's general effect is to enhance and perfect the recipient physiology as well as emphasizing key personality traits, which can be a liability if the recipient has negative psychological traits.\n\nAfter a series of microinjections into the subject's major muscle groups, it causes immediate cellular change and increases in cell division and cell density through synthetic protein complex's, enhancing the subject's metabolic processes at a rate four times that of an average person, and further augmenting the effects of the recipient's dopamine, testosterone, adrenaline, along with various other endorphins and hormones, to further amplify physical and mental performances, healing abilities, in addition to a greater resistance to toxins and pathogens. Effectively granting an enhanced and perfected physiology with superhuman physical abilities and enhanced mental processes.\n\nAbraham Erskine's original serum worked more effectively when the recipient's body was saturated with Vita radiation, as it stimulated growth and accelerated the changes toward the body's final enhanced condition within a minute, although not without pain. Gamma radiation works similarly but the results are apparently significantly higher and more mutagenic, as substituting vita radiation with gamma radiation when testing his own version of the serum on himself caused Bruce Banner to become Hulk.\n\nSubsequent versions of the serum made slight adjustments and improvements in their effectiveness, storage requirements and administration. Not much is known about Arnim Zola's version given to Bucky Barnes but it did not seem to enhance his personality traits, it only augmented his physicality and made him more durable than most of the other super-soldiers. The version used on Emil Blonsky required cold storage, was preliminarily irradiated with Vita-rays and granted a regenerative healing factor, allowing Blonsky to completely recover and heal his entire broken skeleton within a matter of hours, while Steve Rogers on the other hand took at least a day or more to heal from small ballistic wounds.\n\nHoward Stark's version did not need Vita-rays and made their recipients physically more powerful than Zola's serum, as Josef was able to overpower Barnes during a sparring match. This version caused excruciating pain in their recipients when first administered. These Winter Soldiers suffered serious mental side effects, as they were shown to be extremely violent and unruly, killing many Hydra soldiers and the scientists that handled them. Unable to be controlled, they were placed in suspended animation until they were found and killed by Helmut Zemo.\n\nWilfred Nagel's version is the most advanced to date, perfected to the point of having no negative side effects after being fully integrated in the person's system and being reduced to a single-dose 10ml vial. Likewise, it no longer requires cold storage or appliances such as a Rebirth Pod and thus can be self-administered. It grants enhancements without any visible change to their physical form, hinting at a more optimized cell density augmentation. However, this version still causes excruciating pain in their recipients while the user is adjusting to the enhancements.",
