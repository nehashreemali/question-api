  "content": "Extremis is an advanced form of genetic manipulation created by Maya Hansen and Aldrich Killian, using nanotechnology. It grants the human body the ability to heal and regenerate from physical damages, deformities and even psychological damages. This also includes the regrowth of severed limbs in a very short timespan, various physical enhancements as well as an exothermic ability.\n\nExtremis was created by Maya Hansen in 1999 and first tested on plants, with Tony Stark providing additional aid through a formula he deduced to help reduce the volatility. Hansen and Aldrich Killian later upgraded Extremis thanks to A.I.M. providing additional funding for it to begin experimental testing on human subjects. A.I.M. recruited amputees and other disabled people for the trials, most notably victims of military operations.[1]\n\nSuccessful transfusions of Extremis cured their disabilities, after which they were convinced to work for A.I.M. as assassins and soldiers. However, the subjects whose bodies rejected the treatment exploded since the glitch in the code was not completely neutralized.[1]\n\nAt the end, most, of the Extremis Soldiers, were killed by the combined forces of Tony Stark, James Rhodes, and J.A.R.V.I.S.[1]\n\nExtremis was also used as the main component of the Centipede Serum, designated by the Centipede Project, that combined it with gamma radiation, a variation of the Super Soldier Serum and the Chitauri technology for injection in an effort to create their own super soldiers. Mike Peterson, after recovering from being knocked out by the Night-Night Gun, discovered that he was now stabilized.[2]\n\nThe Extremis component was stabilized when Centipede recruited Chan Ho Yin, using his fireproof platelets that prevented him from being burned by his own pyrokinesis.[3]\n\nAs a part of the Centipede Device, John Garrett received Extremis which helped to keep him alive[4] along with the addition of the DNA of Jiaying, an Inhuman with regeneration and longevity powers.[5]\n\nHowever, as Garrett's body weakened, he lost the other abilities that came with it as the serum was the only thing that was keeping him alive. After GH.325 was added to the serum, Garrett's life was saved,[4] and he gained increased regenerative abilities that almost instantly healed from more than a dozen gunshots, and despite Deathlok stomping on Garrett's chest with his cybernetic leg, an injury which should have been fatal, Garrett was able to heal enough to survive. However, Garrett's body was nearly completely destroyed, forcing him to use the Project Deathlok Installer to replace his body parts with all the top level prosthetic parts that Ian Quinn had designed. This victory was short-lived however as Garrett was extinguished by Phil Coulson with the Peruvian 0-8-4.[6]\n\nAs a part of the Centipede Serum, Extremis was injected into Quake. The serum boosted Quake's powers to the point that she was able to blast Graviton into space, killing him and saving the world.[7]\n\nYears after the Battle on the Norco and the deaths of Aldrich Killian and Maya Hansen, Princess Shuri from Wakanda began investigating Hansen's research on Extremis and grew fascinated at the concept since it successfully enabled regrowth of lost body appendages even though some of the subjects exploded. Shuri ultimately concluded that the use of Extremis still had potential.[8]\n\nIn 2024, one of the Extremis users participated in the Golden Daggers Club's underground tournament in Macau, China, hosted by Xu Xialing and Jon Jon.[9]\n\nBy 2026, some Extremis samples were obtained by the Skrull Resistance for research to enhance the Skrulls' abilities.[10] Gravik received the upgrade and healed from a stab wound from Talos in moments.[11] He also healed rapidly from being shot several times by Nick Fury, including having part of his face blown off.[12]\n\nUsing Rosa Dalton's knowledge, G'iah secretly used the Super Skrull Machine to give herself Extremis. After being exposed as a spy and shot in the chest, Extremis healed G'iah's wound, saving her life.[12]\n\nDuring the Duel at New Skrullos, Gravik used his Extremis to heal his injuries from the fight. However, G'iah blasted him through the gut with one of Captain Marvel's photon blasts, killing him as even Extremis couldn't heal such a wound.[13]\n\nExtremis enhances the user's physiology by rewriting their DNA. It harnesses the body's bio-electricity and uses it to activate parts of the brain that govern repair and chemically recode them. This can allow Extremis to hack into the basic operating system of living organisms. If the user's body chooses to accept it, they will gain regenerative healing abilities, enabling to heal all wounds, including previously amputated limbs or even physiological damage. When regenerating lost body parts, the wounds take on the appearance of burning embers while growing back the limb in a matter of minutes, and then cools into regular flesh, blood, and bone. Extremis also enhances physical performance, granting superhuman strength, reflexes, and overall higher resilience.\n\nAdditionally, normal Extremis users gain the ability to generate extreme amounts of heat through a complex metabolic process, with temperatures of up to several thousand degrees Celsius. Extremis users are able to consciously control the amount of heat expelled from their body, causing the area of their body generating it to glow intensely, superheating their tissues, blood vessels and nerves, while outlining them inside the body. This effect has been shown to be unstable in the event of an Extremis overload, burning the flesh and causing an explosion. Trained Extremis users can focus and conduct heat through a single area of their body such as their arms or hands, and even emit fire from their mouths, though it would seem that only the most disciplined of Extremis users can perform this feat. Certain users also demonstrated the ability to conduct heat through other objects with physical contact, allowing them to superheat targets by touching them.\n\nThrough a combination of superhuman strength and a focus of extreme heat conduction through their arms and hands, Extremis users can strike through and destroy a majority of metal structures on contact. Due to this, they are able to overpower and burn through the metal alloys that are used in most Iron Man armors, easily destroying many of the suits in combat.\n\nExtremis users can be easily recognized through thermal imaging as they have a much higher heat signature. They can also be identified when their pupils glow while using their powers. Extremis does not make its users entirely invincible, as direct wounds through the chest, such as a uni-beam, will be lethal, destroying the victim's heart and therefore cutting off blood flow to the brain. When the body is regenerating, it is fragile and can be destroyed with a powerful enough force such as a repulsor shot. Destroying the users' brains and major organs through incineration has also been shown to be fatal.\n\nThe main weakness of Extremis is the possibility that its user's body will reject the serum upon initial injection, or that the serum may become unstable within the user if they fail to properly regulate their usage of it. Extremis users are able to consciously control the amount of heat expelled from their body, but this effect has been shown to be unstable in the event of an overload within. If the virus is not accepted by or regulated in the human body, the metabolic process which causes the user to generates excessive heat and the bio-electricity harnessed by Extremis will overload. As a result, the users will rapidly build up energy and force, cumulating in a massive explosion and powerful shockwave. The resulting explosion is an excess of 3,000°C and instantly vaporizes the Extremis user's body, along with anything within a certain proximity, leaving behind shadow-like marks. A.I.M. created several terrorist attacks on United States soil to cover up the explosions caused by Extremis test subjects.",
