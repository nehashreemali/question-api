  "content": "Vision was a synthezoid made from vibranium, created by Ultron with the help of Helen Cho, and given life by the powerful artifact known as the Mind Stone. Originally conceived as the perfect form for Ultron, the body was taken by the Avengers before Tony Stark and Bruce Banner proceeded to upload the remnants of Stark's personal A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. into it. Upon his birth, Vision declared he was neither Ultron nor J.A.R.V.I.S., but one that would fight with them to protect humanity. Vision then joined with the Avengers in the Battle of Sokovia, using his powers to prevent Ultron from transferring his consciousness to the internet, and allowing the Avengers to successfully put an end to his plan.\n\nIn the wake of the Ultron Offensive, Vision became an official member of the Avengers under Captain America's leadership. However, tension between these Avengers rose following the creation of the Sokovia Accords, as Vision saw the equations regarding the number of threats related to their actions as the reason for them to allow oversight of their actions. This led to a conflict, as Captain America had decided to oppose the Sokovia Accords in order to protect Winter Soldier, who was being framed by Helmut Zemo. Vision was forced to side with Iron Man to bring Captain America and his allies to justice. During their conflict, Vision was involved in a battle which concluded when Vision inadvertently shot War Machine out of the sky, while the Avengers were torn apart by their conflict.\n\nVision then quietly left the Avengers in order to rebuild his relationship with Wanda Maximoff. However, Vision was soon attacked by the Black Order, who were attempting to steal the Mind Stone from his head under the orders from Thanos. Having been rescued by his allies, Vision agreed to have the Mind Stone removed from his head and destroyed, as they traveled to Wakanda to enlist the help of Shuri. Their attempts were unsuccessful, as the Black Order attacked Wakanda, while Corvus Glaive was able to force the wounded Vision into the open. As Thanos arrived, Vision convinced the devastated Wanda Maximoff to destroy the Mind Stone, killing him, only for Thanos to use the Time Stone to then resurrect Vision and rip the stone from his head, killing him for a second time as Thanos claimed his victory.\n\nVision's corpse was taken by S.W.O.R.D. and disassembled in an attempt to weaponize his remains. Vision's body was then reassembled in a white form and reactivated through a sample of Maximoff's Chaos Magic, and was employed by S.W.O.R.D. as their sentient weapon. Initially programmed to eliminate Maximoff and another Vision, Vision's memories were restored, prompting him to flee.\n\nDuring an attempt to create a more powerful body, Ultron manipulated Doctor Helen Cho to use the Regeneration Cradle for the creation of his new body. Under the control of the Scepter, she used the machine to create the body, combining artificial organic tissue with vibranium supply that Ultron bought from Ulysses Klaue. He later broke the Scepter to claim the jewel, so he could use its power to evolve into a perfect body. When the Avengers arrived aiming to stop him, Ultron was forced to flee before he could finish uploading his mind into the body, knocking out Cho and killing her staff in the process while his only allies, the Maximoff twins, betrayed him upon realizing his genocidal intentions.\n\nDuring a chase through the streets of Seoul, the Cradle was juggled around until it was recovered by the Avengers and taken to Avengers Tower in New York City. Upon examination, Tony Stark chose the idea of repurposing the body rather than destroying it like the team desired as it would be a more beneficial choice. He convinced a reluctant Bruce Banner to help him and together, the pair then uploaded the recently recovered J.A.R.V.I.S. A.I. into the body.[1]\n\nAs the procedure of installing J.A.R.V.I.S. neared completion, Captain America, Quicksilver and Wanda Maximoff returned to the Avengers Tower and a violent dispute erupted. At the last moment, Thor arrived and sent lightning from Mjølnir into the Cradle. The surge in power sped up the development process, bringing the body to life. The being was initially confused and attacked Thor who defended himself by launching his attacker through the air; however, the being paused and calmed down seconds later.\n\nThe synthetic being then took some time to examine his reflection before apologizing for its actions and then offered its gratitude to Thor before adopting elements of the god of thunder's look, unveiling its ability to generate synthetic cells on him by producing a cape and gauntlets. Thor explained to the Avengers that the being's powers were created by the Mind Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones with powers that can transcend both time and space.\n\nThor went on to point out that the gemstone which was implanted at the center of the synthetic's forehead was indeed the source of their troubles and the solution. Captain America and the other Avengers were then understandably concerned, but the newly anointed \"Vision\" explained that he was not a child of Ultron. Vision then declared he was not Ultron or J.A.R.V.I.S., rather he was something altogether new and, unlike Ultron, had a deep abiding respect for life.\n\nAlthough Bruce Banner remained skeptical as to which side Vision was on, to which the synthetic explained that he was on the side of life, he went on to say that Ultron was waiting for them in Sokovia. He then stated that Ultron would now spread his furious rage across the globe. Finishing, he casually lifted Mjølnir and offered it back to Thor, much to the bewilderment of everyone in the room. This action alone was enough to convince them that Vision was not hostile.[1]\n\nAs they prepared to depart for the upcoming battle, with many of the team getting their weapons and uniforms ready, Vision took time to speak to Thor on the outside of Avengers Tower away from the rest of the team. While Tony Stark spoke to his team, he mentioned that Ultron was waiting for him; as he walked past, Vision confirmed this by reminding him that Ultron hated him the most out of the rest of the Avengers.\n\nVision was present alongside the Avengers in addition to Quicksilver and Wanda Maximoff while Captain America began his speech on what they would face upon their arrival in Sokovia, and that there would undoubtedly be consequences. Vision listened as Rogers explained exactly what Ultron's plan would be, noting that their main priority would be evacuating the people of Novi Grad before they engaged with his seemingly unstoppable Ultron Sentry army.[1]\n\nIn Sokovia, as Ultron unleashed his army of Ultron Sentries upon the city of Novi Grad. While Captain America organized the evacuation of the city, Vision confronted his creator as the activation for the drill emerged from the ground. Ultron expressed his sorrow at seeing that the Avengers had taken everything from him, even his own body that he designed.\n\nVision pleaded to Ultron that he could change all this on his terms, to which Ultron simply replied by attempting to strangle Vision. Vision took the opportunity to hack into Ultron's programming and disable his ability to enter the internet, as Tony Stark had said that doing this would ensure that Ultron would be unable to escape by transferring his mind through the internet, therefore forcing him to only use his other bodies to continue living during the battle.\n\nWhile the attempt was successful and Ultron from this point on was trapped in the city and unable to transfer his mind elsewhere, the process incapacitated Vision, rendering him unconscious. Having discovered what had just happened to him and in a fit of rage, Ultron slammed the synthetic into the ground before activating the key and raising Novi Grad high into the sky, promising to destroy the earth as revenge for losing his own vision of the future.[1]\n\nDespite his nearly fatal battle with his creator, Vision was able to recover. Exploring the battlefield, Vision discovered Ultron was attempting to beat Thor to death. Thor distracted the robot with an overlong speech, allowing Vision to strike Ultron away with a hit from Mjølnir before returning it to Thor. The pair took a moment to discuss the weight and balance of the mighty hammer as he returned it to Thor.\n\nVision and Thor destroyed several more of the Ultron Sentries before gathering alongside the rest of the Avengers inside the church, where Iron Man informed them that their mission would be to protect the key at all costs, if it was activated, then the entire city would be dropped to Earth and all human life would be wiped out in the explosion. Ultron confronted the Avengers as he assembled a massive armada of his drones and unleashed them upon the team.\n\nA great battle between the Avengers and Ultron's army ensued with Vision contributing greatly by dismembering the Ultron drones using his density-altering powers, working in considerable tandem with the other Avengers as they prevented Ultron and the drones from reaching the activation device. Despite the overwhelming numbers of the Sentries, the combined strength of the Avengers pushed them back and reduced their numbers significantly.\n\nUltron intervened directly and found himself grappling with Vision, the two engaging in a midair struggle. Here, Vision unveiled his ability to fire a beam of energy from the Mind Stone and blasted Ultron away. Soon, Thor and Iron Man joined him as they unleashed beams of lightning and repulsor blasts respectively against Ultron, slowly melting away his shell before they stopped. Weakened and damaged, Ultron was soon punched away by the Hulk.\n\nWith Ultron's main body seemingly defeated, the remaining Sentries attempted to flee out of the city, which would allow Ultron to live on through them. Under Iron Man's order, Vision joined War Machine in destroying the remaining Ultron drones, using both physical force and beams from the Mind Stone subdue the remaining robots. Watching Vision's sudden and effective attack in the battle, War Machine was left stunned.\n\nAs the Avengers made their way to the Lifeboats to evacuate, Ultron attacked once again, killing Quicksilver. Driven into the rage, Wanda Maximoff abandoned her duty of watching the key and destroyed Ultron's main form, allowing one of his few remaining drones to activate the key and drop Novi Grad out of the sky. As Iron Man and Thor prepared to destroy the city, Vision flew to Maximoff's aid, taking the girl in his arms before flying her out of danger.[1]\n\nBy the end, Ultron was able to escape by downloading himself into one final drone body. Vision confronted the drone as it was pulling itself out of the crater where Novi Grad once stood, and pointed out that Ultron was afraid of death as he was the last of his kind. The robot mocked Vision, claiming Tony Stark wanted a savior but settled for a slave.\n\nDespite it being meant as an insult, Vision did not deny that Stark meant him as a slave, noting that they were both disappointments. Vision stated that the Humans are odd, thinking that order and chaos are opposites and that they try to control what cannot be, but they have grace in their failings, something that Vision believed Ultron missed during his own analysis of the human behavior, which led him to try to wipe them out in his own apocalypse.\n\nUltron then claimed that the humans were doomed; although Vision sorrowfully agreed to this statement, he proclaimed it a privilege to be among humanity for as long as they would last. Ultron responded by calling Vision unbearably naïve, but Vision just simply smiled and countered by saying that he had only been born yesterday. Angered, Ultron attempted to attack, only for Vision to destroy him completely with an energy beam, thus ending the threat of Ultron.[1]\n\nVision was recruited formally into the Avengers once the Battle of Sokovia ended, and traveled to the Avengers Compound along with the other chosen members including Wanda Maximoff, Sam Wilson and James Rhodes, beginning their training under the leadership of Captain America and Black Widow.[1] While Vision did not always accompany the team on every mission due to his appearance, he continued to advise the team due to J.A.R.V.I.S.' mind while being ready for battle.[2]\n\nShortly after moving into the Avengers Compound, Wanda Maximoff was still grieving the loss of her brother Pietro, and would watch sitcoms in her bedroom to comfort herself. When she sensed Vision on the other side of the wall, he entered and apologized for intruding, but she asked him to sit next to her so he could accompany her in watching sitcoms.\n\nAs Wanda watched the sitcoms, Vision encouraged her to open up about her traumatic past, learning from Wanda that the trauma that is deeply engrained in her life would always find a way back into her consciousness. Vision shared that due to being an artificial creation of life, he was unable to grasp the knowledge of what loss, sorrow, or grief is, for he never had any real familial connection. When Vision stated that grief is love persevering, he and Wanda began to form a close, emotional bond, and in turn, she started to develop strong feelings for him. They then continued to enjoy watching sitcoms together.[5]\n\nWhile Vision was admiring a butterly as he flew around the Avengers Compound, the Avengers were called to a small town in Europe to deal with Ultimo, a giant robot created by Hydra out of Ultron parts. Initially, the team struggled against the robot, but they were quickly able to work together to defeat Ultimo, with Vision teaming up with War Machine.[6]\n\nIn June 2016, having learned that Tony Stark had arrived in the Avengers Compound, Vision phased through Wanda Maximoff's bedroom wall to inform her and Steve Rogers of this, with Maximoff berating him for phasing through the wall rather than using the door. Vision apologized and noted that Stark had brought the Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross with him.\n\nVision joined the rest of the Avengers as Ross explained that in the aftermath of their recent mission when Crossbones caused several civilian deaths, as well as the devastating consequences of the Avengers actions during the Battle of New York and the Ultron Offensive, the United Nations created the Sokovia Accords which would give them control over the Avengers actions, aiming to ensure less civilian casualties and property damage in the future.\n\nHaving sat down with the other Avengers to discuss the Accords, Vision listened as Sam Wilson and James Rhodes each argued for and against the concept. Vision accepted the terms, recalling that in the eight years since Stark became Iron Man, a domino effect has taken place where more enhanced individuals have made their presence known and the number of enhanced individuals has grown. The Avengers opened the door for others to challenge them, and the Accords would be a safety measure to prevent a future catastrophe.[2]\n\nAs the Avengers were now on the hunt for the Winter Soldier abroad, Wanda Maximoff and Vision stayed behind at the Avengers Compound. Vision tried to make her comfortable, attempting to cook her a meal, which failed since Vision had never eaten anything before. The two discussed their abilities and how they viewed themselves, with Vision noting he did not fully understand the Mind Stone that gave him his power. However, he did add that he would hope to understand it completely one day, so he would no longer fear it.\n\nDespite their pleasant conversation, when Maximoff tried to leave, Vision stopped her, telling her that she was confined to the facility for her own safety. Although, Maximoff tried to tell him that she could look after herself and did not need protection, Vision further explained that the protection was not just for her, telling her that after her mistake in Lagos, she was confined to the facility for a reason of safety at the request of Tony Stark. Maximoff then turned to Vision, asking him what he wanted out of her confinement in which Vision promised that he only wanted the rest of the world to look fondly at her like he did.[2]\n\nWhen the situation involving the Sokovia Accords aftermath got worse, Steve Rogers sent Clint Barton to rescue Wanda Maximoff from the Avengers Compound. Barton set off an explosion outside to lure Vision out to investigate while he greeted his friend and explained the situation to her, though Maximoff remained nervously hesitant.\n\nWhile Maximoff considered if she should leave or not, Vision returned and greeted Barton, noting that he should not be there. Taking a lighter stance on the situation, Barton joked that everything had clearly gone wrong since the moment he retired from the Avengers. While they spoke, Vision soon fell into Hawkeye's electric arrow trap which caused him to become trapped by an electric net while Barton tried to make his way outside.\n\nEventually, Vision escaped the trap by shooting the arrow, and Hawkeye tried to fight back against Vision to no avail, turning his bow into a bow staff to fight with. Despite his best efforts, Barton proved that he was no match for the vibranium-armored Vision, who used his powers to dodge all Barton's attacks before quickly restraining him and reminding him that he could not overpower him and should surrender before the situation got worse.\n\nHawkeye, however, remained confident and noted that although he could not overpower Vision, there was somebody else who could. Much to Vision's horror, Maximoff then used her own powers to control the Mind Stone and forced Vision to phase, making him free Barton. Despite Vision trying to reason with her, Maximoff used her powers to slam Vision through the facility and deep underground, allowing Barton and Maximoff to then escape.[2]\n\nVision was the last of the Avengers to arrive at the airport on Iron Man's side as the teams clashed; when he arrived, Vision created a warning line by firing a beam from the Mind Stone on his forehead in front of Captain America's team. He tried to talk and reason with Rogers to convince him to surrender, noting while Rogers believed he was doing the right thing by going against the Sokovia Accords, he should surrender.\n\nKnowing that his own power was too great compared to his friends, Vision kept in midair during the clash, as he did not want to hurt any of his former comrades and only planned to take them into custody alive. He did, however, attempt to shoot Falcon down to the ground, but was stopped by an electric arrow fired by Hawkeye. Vision watched from the air to ensure that nobody escaped the battlefield without being captured by him first.\n\nWhen Ant-Man transformed himself into Giant-Man, Iron Man's team momentarily focused on Giant-Man rather than capturing Captain America and the Winter Soldier. While Giant-Man wreaked havoc, Vision finally intervened when Giant-Man kicked an airport bus towards Black Panther, Vision quickly blocked the bus with his vibranium body and then smashed his own body hard into Giant-Man's chest, causing him to fall backward into an airplane.\n\nVision, seeing Captain America and Winter Soldier try to escape to a Quinjet, became transparent, moving through Giant-Man, and used his Energy Blast to bring down a watch tower, trying to cut off their escape. However, he discovered it was kept in the air due to the intervention of Wanda Maximoff, who used her powers to stop it falling until War Machine used a sonic blast to subdue her, causing the tower to fall although Rogers and Barnes managed to escape.\n\nRather than going after the escaping fugitives, who were negotiating with Black Widow over if they could pass or not, Vision instead went to the aid of Maximoff, who was still recovering from War Machine's sonic blast. Holding her, both Maximoff and Vision apologized to each other for being on opposing sides and for their previous actions against each other at the Avengers Compound. Vision said to Maximoff that the situation was a catastrophe, just as he predicted it would be when he first heard Thaddeus Ross explaining the concept of the Sokovia Accords to them all only a few days early.\n\nInterrupted their conversation, War Machine asked for assistance to stop the Falcon, who was shooting at him to try and ensure that both Captain America and the Winter Soldier escaped safely. Distracted by talking with Maximoff, Vision looked up and unleashed an Energy Blast aimed at Falcon, but Falcon saw the blast coming and moved out of the way and instead it struck War Machine directly in his power core, causing him to plummet to the ground.\n\nDespite the best efforts of Iron Man and Falcon to save him, they were not fast enough and War Machine crashed into the ground below. Vision soon flew to Rhodes' location beside Stark and an unconscious Wilson to see him unconscious and paralyzed, with F.R.I.D.A.Y. noting that there was still a faint heartbeat. Seeing this, Vision was mortified and began questioning himself more about what he was and how this accident could have happened.[2]\n\nWith the fight having now concluded, Vision was at the Avengers Compound, checking on James Rhodes' state while his spine was x-rayed. Tony Stark asked how Vision could make a mistake like that, and Vision admitted he was distracted. Vision stayed with Rhodes while Stark spoke with Natasha Romanoff.\n\nWhile Stark dealt with Captain America, whose team was locked up at the Raft under the orders of Thaddeus Ross, Vision remained behind, fearful that he could make another near fatal mistake. Vision spent time at the Avengers Compound where Rhodes had started to recover, sitting in front of the chess board, considering the future of the Avengers.[2] When Stark gave Peter Parker the chance to join the Avengers, Parker was offered the room next to Vision's.[7] Vision decided to move with Wanda Maximoff to Scotland and the two started a secret life together, while Vision lived a double-life at the Avengers Compound. Despite the circumstances of the splitting of the Avengers and Vision and Maximoff belonging to different teams, they had secretly been dating for two years since the Avengers Civil War. When Vision would stay with Maximoff, he would take a human form and turn off any trackers, so the two could be with each other in peace.[8][9]\n\nTwo years later, in May 2018, Vision began to feel an alert from the Mind Stone in his forehead. Maximoff became concerned and asked if it was the Stone in which Vision replied that it was as if it was speaking to him. He asked Maximoff to use her powers and tell him what she felt. She claimed that all she felt was him and the two embraced each other.\n\nDuring a walk, Vision suggested the idea of running off and starting an official life together, running away from all their responsibilities. Maximoff was unsure of the idea, given their promises made to their own separate teams. He told her that those were promises they made to other people - not to one another. Vision was unsure of the words to use convince her and began stuttering, but Maximoff assured him by affirming that their relationship would work. He then asked her to stay with him. Before she could give him an official response, they turned and saw an SBN news report about an attack on New York City by Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian.[8]\n\nWith the report that Tony Stark had gone missing, Vision, having lately felt as the Mind Stone was warning him about something, realized that the aliens who attacked New York were coming after the Mind Stone from his forehead. Vision told Maximoff that he had to leave Scotland immediately, but Maximoff was reluctant to let him leave because she knew his life would be put at significant risk if the news report was true. Moments before he was about to reply to her, Vision was then suddenly stabbed by Corvus Glaive and attacked by Proxima Midnight. Once Maximoff was knocked away, Vision's internal systems began to fail. Glaive quickly seized the chance to put his spear against the Mind Stone in an attempt to painfully extract it from Vision's head.\n\nAfter her recovery, Maximoff got up and attacked both Glaive and Midnight. Maximoff attempted to escape with Vision and temporarily hide from Glaive and Midnight where Vision informed her that the blade he was stabbed with stopped him from phasing and that his systems were failing. The two were quickly found by their ambushers where Maximoff had begun combat with Midnight below, Vision began to fight Glaive where he and Glaive pinned each other against buildings. Vision became enraged after Glaive tried to reason with him by bargaining Maximoff's life in exchange for the Mind Stone, so he threw Glaive onto a church where the two further engaged in combat.\n\nUnfortunately, Vision became subdued after Glaive used his glaive to deflect a beam that Vision fired from the Mind Stone which allowed Glaive to continue his attempts to extract the Stone. Maximoff immediately came to Vision's aid, and attempted to escape with him again by flight until the two were blasted out of the air by Midnight and thrown down into a metro station. Vision, unable to escape after being critically wounded, told Maximoff to run for her own safety, but she refused. With Vision at his weakest and Maximoff struggling to both keep Vision safe and hold her own at the same time, Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon arrived just in time to save them.[8]\n\nHaving reunited with his allies, Vision and Wanda Maximoff were taken back to the Avengers Compound, where they interrupted James Rhodes' meeting with Thaddeus Ross. With the wounded Vision being helped to stand by Sam Wilson, he witnessed Rhodes turning his back on Ross and the Sokovia Accords, agreeing to help them in their new conflict, as the remaining Avengers also reunited with Bruce Banner, who had also returned.\n\nWhile at the Avengers Compound, Banner discussed how to fix Vision's internal parts and what to do with the Mind Stone. Vision suggested that Maximoff should destroy the Stone since her power was the only capable force that could eliminate it, as her powers also came from the Infinity Stones. Maximoff refused, calling it too high of a price to pay. Vision, however, reminded them that Thanos had already threatened half of the universe and insisted his one life is worth saving millions.\n\nDespite hearing Maximoff's decision, Vision still countered with any plans his teammates would propose, telling them they cannot take a chance with one life with half of the universe being at stake. Banner then told that Vision was made up of a variety of sources besides the Mind Stone such as J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony Stark as well as himself and that perhaps if they could remove the Stone, then most of Vision himself would be left. Banner, however, told them that he was unable to do the extraction. Steve Rogers then told that he would know a place where Vision could have the treatment done.\n\nWhen arriving in Wakanda, Vision was examined by Shuri, who told them that she could extract the Stone from Vision's head without losing too much of his conscious. While she knew what to do, she needed a significant amount of time to do it since Vision's internal nerves could be easily damaged during the procedure. As two trillion neurons connected the Mind Stone to Vision's processing neural network, Shuri needed to remove those trillions of connections and reroute them so the Mind Stone could be safely removed and destroyed without damaging Vision. Later on, however, Okoye reported that multiple space ships were descending for Wakanda. Black Panther and Rogers' team readied up for battle so they could spare time for Vision being freed from the Stone.[8]\n\nDuring the Outrider onslaught, Wanda Maximoff stayed beside Vision during his treatment. However, she was forced to join the battlefield when she saw her teammates being gradually overpowered. Seeing that Maximoff had left Vision's side, Proxima Midnight signaled Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian to retrieve the Mind Stone from Vision.\n\nWhile still being examined, Vision noticed that Shuri and her guards were attacked before the Stone's extraction from his body could be complete. After Shuri was tossed aside, Vision furiously attacked Glaive and was thrown into the battlefield, but Glaive cunningly stabbed him with his glaive again and he was left severely wounded once more. Steve Rogers and Bruce Banner came to his aid as Maximoff had entered combat with Midnight. Despite being told to escape, Vision rescued Rogers from being killed by Glaive and was reunited with Maximoff.[8]\n\nUnfortunately, their victory was short-lived as Vision winced when the Mind Stone warned him that Thanos himself had arrived at Wakanda. Rogers, Black Widow, Falcon, Black Panther, Okoye, War Machine, Winter Soldier, Groot, and Rocket all attempted to stop Thanos, despite Vision being aware that their attempts were futile. Alone with Maximoff, Vision told Maximoff that she had no other choice but to destroy the Stone. Knowing it would destroy him, Maximoff refused. Vision comforted and reasoned her, telling her that he knew the choice she had to make was not fair but that half the universe was presently in danger and they were out of time. He promised she would never hurt him and assured to her that as she would use her powers he would only feel her.\n\nMaximoff tearfully unleashed a stream of energy into the Stone as the other Avengers tried to stop Thanos in a futile effort. As Thanos began to draw closer, Maximoff unleashed two streams of energy into the Stone from both of her hands as Vision softly tried to comfort her by telling her that it was all right while she was breaking down in tears. As she began to break the Stone, Vision spoke to her as she was killing him and let a whispered remark as \"I love you\" to Maximoff as he was dying. Maximoff then successfully shattered the Mind Stone and destroyed Vision along with it in an explosion.\n\nDespite Vision's sacrifice, Thanos used the Time Stone to reverse time and restore Vision back into existence to be able to retrieve Vision's stone. Maximoff, horrified, attempted to stop him, but Thanos subdued Maximoff and lifted Vision from the ground with a single hand. Powerless to do anything to stop Thanos after his several injuries beforehand, Vision could only watch while Thanos ripped the Mind Stone out of his head, immediately shattering part of his synthetic head and draining all life from him. This effectively killed Vision once and for all. Tossing Vision's colorless and lifeless body aside, Thanos inserted the Mind Stone into his now completed Infinity Gauntlet.\n\nDespite Thor's last attempt to defeat Thanos, Thanos survived being impaled by Stormbreaker and quickly used the Infinity Gauntlet to eradicate half of all life in the universe with the simple snap of his fingers. After Thanos escaped Wakanda, Maximoff mournfully sat next to Vision's dead body until she disintegrated into dust. Rogers and the original Avengers all gathered around Vision's body in defeat.[8] Following his death, Vision's corpse was brought back to the United States of America, where it eventually fell under S.W.O.R.D.'s possession. For the next five years, Vision would be experimented upon under supervision of Acting Director Tyler Hayward after countless attempts to bring him back online as a new sentient weapon, but to no avail each time as they could not find a sufficient power source.[5]\n\nIn 2023, after being resurrected in the Blip, Wanda Maximoff exacted vengeance on the Mad Titan, unaware that he was not the Thanos who had killed Vision but rather a variant Thanos who had come to their timeline from an alternate 2014. During their fight, she very nearly succeeded in killing him. Maximoff was the only one to come close to killing Thanos single-handedly during the Battle of Earth due to her vengeance for Vision's death. Later, Maximoff and Clint Barton mourned Natasha Romanoff and Vision in private by the lake of the Stark Eco-Compound. Barton wished there were a way he could tell Romanoff that they won, but Maximoff assured him, albeit indirectly, that both Romanoff and Vision knew in their sacrifice that they would win.[10]\n\nIn 2023, two weeks after the Blip, Wanda Maximoff entered S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters and was shown Vision's dismembered body by Hayward. Unable to feel any life in his remains, she left without further incident.[5]\n\nVision's body was reassembled by S.W.O.R.D. and was transported to the S.W.O.R.D. Retreat Base outside of Westview, New Jersey. Using traces of Chaos Magic found on their dismantled S.W.O.R.D. Drone, Vision was reactivated as White Vision.[5] Hayward deployed Vision to terminate Maximoff and the Vision she created in the Hex. Inside Westview, an intense fight ensued between the Hex Vision and the White Vision. However, at a stand still, the Hex Vision managed to restore Vision's memories to White Vision. With his memories restored, White Vision declared that he is the true Vision and flew away from Westview in order to process what just happened.[11]\n\nAt the end of the 2023–2024 school year, students at Midtown School of Science and Technology paid tribute to the fallen Avengers (including Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff, Steve Rogers, and Vision) when most of the world had no knowledge that Vision was reactivated as White Vision.[12]\n\nAccording to Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, Vision's personality is an amalgam of their own, Ultron's and J.A.R.V.I.S.' and an unknown amount of variables derived from the Mind Stone. Vision is a polite, calm, and thinking being, in a similar manner to J.A.R.V.I.S., shown when he apologizes to the Avengers and the twins after just being brought to life. Unlike Ultron, he values all forms of life. He is also shown to be blunt when Vision told Stark that Ultron hates him the most. He prefers to reason with his enemies, and will only attack when threatened. However, when he was first created, Vision lunged at Thor, who was the first person he saw, though only because he felt confused about his surroundings as he glanced around.\n\nWhen Vision encountered Ultron for the final time, both admitted that they cannot understand humans, whom they view as doomed to die out. However, Vision can see the beauty in humanity, due to their potential and imagination, and was happy to serve alongside them. He also regretted having to destroy Ultron, recognizing the latter as \"unique\" and \"in pain\", but he ultimately knew that it was necessary, given the great threat that Ultron posed to humanity. Vision showed a great desire to directly protect life, shown when he defended humans from Ultron and his forces, and when he personally saved Wanda Maximoff from Novi Grad's destruction, as it was blown up by Thor and Iron Man.\n\nVision frequently struggles to understand human behavior; due to being a non-human sentient life-form; as such he tends to come off as awkward or uncomfortable to others, such as when he casually phased through a wall and interrupted a talk between Rogers and Maximoff instead of using a door. He makes judgments based on logic and treats choices as equations, and makes decisions based on what his calculations deem as the best choice or the lesser of two evils. This is best seen when he agrees to the Sokovia Accords by analyzing the relationship between the Avengers and threats to the world as an algorithm which describes the correlation between both concluding that oversight was a good idea. Despite that, Vision continuously attempts to improve his understanding of the human mind and therefore attempted to open up to Maximoff and comfort her over her fears over her powers.\n\nDespite his feelings towards Maximoff, the events leading up to and during the Avengers Civil War make it clear he was more loyal to Tony Stark and the people of Earth than to her. As a result of his supercomputer brain, he followed the most logical options available immediately being able to see the Accords as the path of least resistance when it came to helping the people of the world. Much like Stark, he was very pragmatic and selfless should the situation call for it suggesting the destruction of the Mind Stone as a way to prevent Thanos from completing his goals in spite of such an act potentially costing Vision his own life, insisting that one life couldn't stand in the way of defeating Thanos.\n\nBefitting his status as one of the few capable of wielding Mjølnir, Vision was capable of great mercy, outright stating he did not wish to kill Ultron in his first few minutes of life. He again displayed this attitude during the Avengers Civil War, acknowledging that Rogers and his faction believed themselves to be in the right while also taking great care to limit his powers so as to minimize any harm that might befall the rogues, even comforting Wanda Maximoff after she fell.\n\nAfter the Avengers conflict, Vision reached out to Maximoff over the next two years in an attempt to mend their relationship. Vision began to grow intense feelings for Maximoff during their time together, and he would develop a human form and even turn off his trackers so he could be with her. Vision even bought a plot of land for Maximoff and himself where they would \"grow old in\", showing how much he felt for her. During his sacrifice, where Maximoff had to destroy the Mind Stone before Thanos could seize it, he tenderly comforted her and told her that she would never hurt him. While she was breaking down into tears as he was dying, he uttered his last words which confessed to her that he loved her, showing his evolution in human understanding to where he could understand what it means to love someone and to be able to openly express that in his last moments.",
