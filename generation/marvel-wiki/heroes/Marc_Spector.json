  "content": "Marc Spector is a former United States Marine and mercenary with dissociative identity disorder. During his childhood, Spector's brother Randall drowned in a cave while they were playing, starting a strenuous and spiteful relationship with his mother, who frequently abused him. To find comfort within himself, Spector's psyche formed an alter known as Steven Grant, who had no memory of Spector's trauma. While he was on a mission in Egypt, Spector was shot by his partner Raul Bushman, but he was saved by Khonshu, who transformed him into his Avatar and the vigilante Moon Knight. Soon after, he fell in love with and married Layla El-Faouly. Following his mother's death, the Grant alter resurfaced and relocated to London to become a museum worker, with Spector occasionally taking over the body to operate as Moon Knight.\n\nGrant found himself in the middle of a conspiracy where a cult led by Arthur Harrow intended to release Ammit, so he teamed up with his wife and Spector to stop him. Whenever Grant summoned his suit, he took the form of Mr. Knight. During their search for Ammit's tomb, Grant had complications with Spector, with the latter wanting to disappear after they defeated Harrow. Arriving at the tomb, Spector was shot and killed by Harrow before being transported to the Duat. As Grant discovered Spector's traumatic past, he fell into the Duat, resulting in Spector being able to pass on to the Field of Reeds. Spector was able to rescue Grant by sharing his balanced heart with him, and returned to life through the Gates of Osiris. Reuniting with Khonshu, Moon Knight and Mr. Knight, along with El-Faouly and help from their mysterious third alter, managed to defeat Harrow and prevent Ammit from enacting her judgment worldwide. In exchange for defeating Ammit, Spector and Grant were freed from Khonshu's servitude. However, their third alter, Jake Lockley, began fronting and continued to serve Khonshu as his Avatar, executing both Harrow and Ammit.\n\nMarc Spector was born into a Jewish household, to Wendy and Elias Spector on March 9, 1987 in Chicago, Illinois.[7] He later had a younger brother named Randall. As a way to say goodbye to his mother, Spector often said \"Laters, gators\". Growing up, Spector and Randall maintained an amicable relationship, and would frequently masquerade and enact scenes from the adventure film Tomb Buster, with Spector usually playing the role of the film's protagonist, the explorer Dr. Steven Grant.[1]\n\nIn 1996, during a family barbecue, Spector mocked Randall Spector's drawing of a goldfish for having only one fin. While Elias Spector was building a shed, Spector urged his brother to explore a nearby cave before dinner, which they frequently visited in order to reenact more scenes of Tomb Buster. They received permission from their mother Wendy Spector, who reminded him to look after his brother before saying his signature goodbye.\n\nWalking to the cave, they continued to act in character as Steven Grant and Rosser from Tomb Buster. Before entering the cave, it started to rain; Randall expressed hesitation to go into the cave due to their mother warning them not to go when it was raining, but Spector ignored him. Unfortunately, as they entered the cave, the rain only intensified, and further escalated into a heavy downpour. The cave began rapidly flooding with rainwater, trapping the children. While Spector was able to escape, Randall helplessly drowned, with Spector unable to save him.[1]\n\nDuring Randall Spector's shiva, Spector went downstairs to join the other mourners, but when the grieving Wendy Spector saw him, she immediately blamed him for his brother's death. As she furiously yelled at him in front of their other family, the upset Spector ran back upstairs. This began a strained relationship between Spector and his mother, as she initially grew reclusive from Spector, blaming him for Randall's death, and later deluding herself into thinking Spector planned it out, which caused Wendy to become abusive over time.\n\nOn Spector's tenth birthday in March 1997, Elias Spector gave him a cake and sat down with him. Spector asked if his mother was coming, but his father told him that she was not well, but promised she would get better, making an excuse to justify her refusal to celebrate. Spector blew out the candles on his cake, missing one, and simply sat in sadness as his father blew out the remaining candle. As the years went by, the relationship between Marc and his mother escalated to domestic abuse, both verbal and physical, which was only made worse when she resorted to substance abuse.\n\nOn Spector's twelfth birthday in March 1999, a drunken Wendy sat next to Spector, claiming that he had always hated his brother and that she should have known that he would kill him. Spector then left the table and ran up to his room, upset. He locked his bedroom door to keep his mother out, but she followed him and started banging on the door, demanding that he open it in a drunken fit.\n\nFearful of his mother, Spector was crouched into a corner, where he began telling himself that Wendy was not his mother. Wanting to find comfort, the trauma of his mother's abuse resulted in Spector developing dissociative identity disorder, creating the alter, of a polite British boy named \"Steven Grant\", after the character from Tomb Buster, who was unaware of his brother's existence. After fronting, Grant told himself that the room was a mess and that he should clean it up for his mother. Eventually, Wendy pushed open the door, telling \"Spector\" that he should be punished, grabbing a nearby belt to whip him. Spector then began fronting again, so that Grant would not be the one that was punished and would have a chance to live a normal life, taking the physical abuse from his mother. Since Spector fronted to shield Grant from his mother's abuse, this convinced Grant that their mother was kind and loving, contrary to the reality that she was abusive and hated him.[1]\n\nOver time, Spector's rage and aggression manifested into a third alter named Jake Lockley, who had a ruthless demeanor and spoke Spanish as his default language. However, neither Spector nor Grant were aware of Lockley's existence.[6] As Spector grew into a teenager, he immediately took the chance and left home. On the neighborhood street outside their home, his father begged him to stay, saying that his mother would get help, and that he could not lose another son. Spector expressed his anger at his mother, stating that Elias should have helped her years ago, and explained that was why he had to leave.[1]\n\nUpon leaving his abusive family home, Spector had no need for the others to front and thus was able to keep front under his control. Spector went on to join the United States Marine Corps. However, Spector entered a fugue state that caused him to go AWOL, leading to him being discharged. With limited options, Spector decided to become a mercenary, working under his former commanding officer, Raul Bushman.[1]\n\nIn 2018, Spector survived the Snap and, in December of that year, was issued a new passport.[7] In 2022,[8] Spector worked alongside Bushman and Abdallah El-Faouly on a mission at a dig site in Egypt; however, Bushman became greedy and executed all the archaeologists with them. Spector unsuccessfully attempted to save them, but was shot by Bushman.[9] Having been left for dead by Bushman, Spector dragged himself to a nearby temple, laying at the foot of a statue. Wishing the pain to end, Spector prepared to shoot himself. However, he was stopped by Khonshu, the Egyptian God of the Moon who resided in the temple.\n\nSpeaking to Spector, Khonshu said that it would be a waste to throw his life away and offered Spector to be his avatar, to punish those who had done evil, stating that he was intrigued by Spector's mental state. Seeing himself as nothing more than a killer, Spector agreed to Khonshu's terms and was granted divine empowerment, allowing him to summon a ceremonial suit as he became the vigilante known as Moon Knight. As Moon Knight, Khonshu used Spector to exact his vengeance on murderers, predators, and other evil-doers, causing Spector to amass a large body count that eventually began to weigh on his conscience. Those victims included one from Dubai, two from Gabon and two from New York. Throughout his servitude to Khonshu, Spector deemed his healing powers a curse, often wishing he would fail and that one of his victims would kill him instead.[1]\n\nHaving a guilty conscience for what happened at the dig site, Spector met Abdallah El-Faouly's daughter, Layla El-Faouly, and tried to tell her what happened on the night her father was killed, but could never bring himself to do so.[9] Eventually, Spector married El-Faouly, and they went on many adventures to find Egyptian relics, such as the Scarab of Ammit. Spector also informed El-Faouly that he no longer spoke to his parents, specifically his mother, although he did not tell her why. Spector later assumed that Khonshu was interested in choosing El-Faouly as his new Avatar, and decided to abruptly leave her, leaving unsigned divorce papers to her.[10]\n\nIn early 2025, Spector was contacted by Elias Spector for the first time in years, and was told that Wendy Spector had passed away, asking him to come to her shiva in Chicago. Spector traveled to Chicago, but stood outside the Spector Residence drinking alcohol from a hip flask, unable to bring himself to enter his old house. His father noticed Spector from inside and gestured for him to come in, but Spector shook his head before walking away, muttering that he would not give his mother the satisfaction of having him mourn her.\n\nDespite this, Spector proceeded to have a breakdown over his resurfaced trauma, kneeling on the street and hitting his kippah to the ground. He then muttered apologies as he blamed himself for Randall Spector's death and cradled his kippah, weeping in psychological pain. Spector could not withstand recalling his childhood memories, so his eyes rolled backwards, allowing Grant to front. Grant was confused as he found himself in an unfamiliar neighborhood.\n\nHe spoke to himself when he believed that he had gotten lost \"again,\" saying the British slang \"bollocks.\" Grant then picked up his phone, thinking that he was calling his mother and told \"her\" about his current situation, chuckling about how foolish his supposedly was. Continuing to talk while journeying off, Grant described his location as a resemblance to Mayfair and noted that the cars were driving on the \"wrong side\" of the road, believing that he lived in London. From their mother's death onward, Spector and Grant's lives started intertwining with each other.[1]\n\nGrant eventually relocated to what he believed was his hometown of London, England and began doing research on Egyptian mythology, ultimately becoming a massive genius in the subject who was qualified enough to educate people. He gained employment as a gift shop worker at the National Art Gallery. He moved into an apartment with a pet one-finned goldfish named Gus, and during his time at the museum, Grant was often mistreated by his boss Donna Kraft and neglected by the security guard J.B. Grant desired to be a tour guide, but Kraft disregarded his hopes.[5] This made him often imagine himself killing Kraft out of frustration.[10] He also made acquaintances with the street performer posing as a golden living statue Bertrand Crawley, having conversations with him from time to time, though Crawley did not respond to him. Additionally, Grant spent his time as a vegan.\n\nUnbeknownst to Grant, Spector and Lockley would front when he fell asleep to operate as Moon Knight during the night before returning to the apartment, which would leave Grant feeling tired when he woke up. Additionally, Grant would occasionally regain control of the body before Spector could return home, leading Grant to believe that he was suffering from sleepwalking. These strange occurrences led Grant to strap his ankle to a wooden post whenever he went to bed to prevent him from leaving, as well as applying a sand circle around his bed and tape on his door so that he could verify in the morning whether he had left.[5]\n\nSpector, however, was aware of Grant's actions and removed the ankle restraint and the tape on the door, as well as avoiding the sand, to continue performing tasks for Khonshu. When he would return, he would reapply the tape and the restraint in order to prevent Grant from discovering the truth.[10] On one occasion, while Lockley was in control, he asked Grant's co-worker Dylan out for a date to the best steak restaurant in town.[11][5]\n\nOne morning, Grant woke up from bed in his apartment. Looking around at first, Grant flipped over his sheets, seeing his ankle restrained to his bedpost. Grant undid his restraint and got out of bed, looking at the sand ring around his bed to see if anyone moved through it. Seeing no new footprints, Grant walked through the ring to the front door, checking if anyone disturbed the tape on the crevasse of the doorframe.\n\nGrant took off the tape and threw it into a nearby trashcan before feeding his pet goldfish Gus. Grant tried to call his mother Wendy Spector, though he ended up on voicemail. In his ensuing message, Grant mentioned receiving her postcards, placing them on Gus' tank while jokingly claiming that Gus was upset he could not go anywhere special. Grant freshened himself up, mentioning to his mother that he still woke up feeling like he got hit by a bus before leaving his apartment.\n\nExiting the apartment building, Grant stopped his voicemail message to briefly comment on an old man still selling his brushes and brooms in front of Grant's doorway. Grant ended his voicemail as he walked down the street, spotting his bus passing by, forcing Grant to give chase. On the bus, Grant was awoken by a man whose backpack he was resting his head on before awkwardly watching a woman read a newspaper, much to her annoyance.[5]\n\nGrant arrived at his job at the National Art Gallery late for the third time this week, noticing on the banners outside that there were seven of the Ennead instead of nine. He then spotting a girl in a primary school uniform sticking her discarded chewing gum in a hole on a model of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The girl responded that there was nothing inside the pyramid, prompting Grant to agree in a way direct her toward a sarcophagus, though not before removing the gum from the model while she was not looking.\n\nGrant explained that a metal hook would suck out all of the organs of a person inside a sarcophagus apart from their heart, saying that it was left there for judgment in the Underworld to see if it was worthy to pass through to the Field of Reeds. The girl asked if it sucked for Grant to have been rejected himself, though Grant said that would not make sense since he was not dead. Grant slowly began pondering if he truly was dead, as his boss Donna Kraft got his attention by calling him \"Stevie\" and asking him to help her carry some boxes over to a counter.\n\nGrant was reprimanded by Kraft for trying to be the tour guide again, calling him \"Stevie,\" though Grant clarified his name as he put on his nametag. Kraft called Grant useless and told him to do his job, to sell gift shop merchandise to children, before walking away, leaving Grant alone to set up a display of items.\n\nWhile he worked, Grant was approached by Dylan, who inquired about how the sugar trade was, and Grant answered that he did not know what it had to do with Egypt since those snacks did not exist back then. Dylan then questioned if Grant was still available for their steakhouse date tomorrow night at seven. Grant, confused, asked if she was asking him out, much to Dylan's amusement, telling him she would see him later. Kraft, impressed by his apparent date, inquired what a vegan like Grant would eat at a steakhouse. Grant told her that he would eat salad and bread, much to her annoyance as she sarcastically called him a \"real catch\" and left.\n\nGrant later began helping Kraft with inventory in the back room, carrying a box of plush toys of Taweret, which reminded himself about an error in the advertisements outside the museum, causing Kraft to ask if that was why he was once again late before telling Grant that he was on inventory duties for the week for being late so often.\n\nGrant tried to explain that the banner was missing some members of the Ennead, prompting Donna to remark that he wasn't going to be a tour guide if that was what he was trying to do. Briefly heartbroken by this, Grant continued by stating that the Ennead had nine gods rather than seven, though Donna became fed up by him, ordering him to just leave her be. Complying, Grant left the room, fumbling with a poster on the way out.\n\nAt the end of his shift, Grant headed for the exit of the museum, bidding the security guard J.B. goodnight. J.B. replied back to Grant, calling him \"Scotty,\" much to Grant's bewilderment, who corrected him by stating that that his name was Steven with a \"V\" in it. Steven then left the museum for the night.[5]\n\nGrant, while eating a snack, met up with Bertrand Crawley, a street performer posing as a golden statue on a bench. Grant confided with Crawley about his constant sleep problems, mentioning he would actively try to stay awake at night to circumvent them before tipping him a package of pralines in his hat. Grant would bring up his upcoming date with Dylan that he did not recall setting up, when a pair of tourists asked Grant to take a picture of them with Crawley.\n\nGrant politely complied to take their picture, reminding them to tip Crawley after taking it. Grant resumed his conversation once the tourists left, saying that if he wanted to have a girlfriend, he would stop having to wear ankle restraints in his bed, noting it was a red flag in a relationship. Finishing his snack, Grant thanked Crawley before bidding him farewell, placing a tip in his hat as he walked away.[5]\n\nReturning to his apartment, Grant prepared himself for bed. Grant first filled in the footstep he made in his sand ring around his bed, before placing a piece of tape on the crevasse of his doorway and locking the door firmly shut. Grant then went and studied various books regarding topics related to the Ennead, including the rift between god and man.\n\nAfterwards, he entered bed, where he put his right ankle in a restraint locked to the bedpost. Grant turned on the Staying Awake audio program, fiddling aimlessly with a Rubik's Cube while lying in bed. While in bed, Grant fell asleep or lost front.[5]\n\nWithout any warning, Grant suddenly awoke amidst a meadow in the Alps of Austria with a broken jaw. Grant, caught aback by the situation, attempted to fix his jaw, which mysteriously healed nearly instantaneously. Getting up from the ground, Grant looked around in confusion and panic, spotting a nearby village when a voice demanded he go back to sleep, retorting that Grant wasn't supposed to be here.\n\nGrant agreed with the voice, asking where he was, though the voice only told Grant to surrender his body to Marc, much to Grant's confusion. The voice lamented that \"the idiot\" was still in control, prompting Grant to feel around his jacket until he uncovered a mysterious scarab in his pocket. Looking at the scarab, Grant felt a presence behind him, and when he turned around, he found himself staring at a castle directly behind him.\n\nGrant spotted a guard looking down at him from a window higher up. Grant awkwardly waved toward the guard, who returned the gesture. Another guard then peered out of the window with a rifle, admonishing the first guard for his hesitance. The two guards opened fire on Grant, prompting the voice to tell Grant to run.\n\nRunning through the meadow, Grant was chased by additional guards on the ground as he then entered the nearby village. Grant narrowly avoided another pair of guards in an alley, before finding himself entering a crowd of people assembling in a nearby square. Grant quickly pulled the hood of his sweatshirt over his head as he passed by another guard, narrowly avoiding detection.\n\nAt the square, Grant witnessed the arrival of Arthur Harrow as the crowd parted for him to walk through. Harrow stood at the front of the crowd at the base of a statue, while Grant watched as he requested people to come up to be judged by the Staff of Ammit and the tattooed scale on his arm. Grant observed a young man step forward, who was thanked by Harrow for volunteering to be the first, as he was then judged to be a good person.\n\nSeveral guards began to appear from behind the crowd, forcing Grant to enter deeper into the crowd and closer toward Harrow. An older woman stepped forward next for judgement, and Grant watched as she was judged negatively, despite her insistence that she had been good her whole life. Harrow apologized, but informed her of the staff’s ability to judge the future of its victim as well. Then, the woman's life force was absorbed from her body, killing her instantly and shocking Grant as her body was promptly carried away by other followers.\n\nA guard informed Harrow that someone interrupted their exchange and that the perpetrator was potentially still nearby. Harrow announced to the crowd in ancient Egyptian, who responded by kneeling, though Grant was outed as a result of his unknowingness to comply. Harrow recognized Grant, calling him a mercenary, though a confused Grant assured him his name was Steven Grant, a gift shopist from London.\n\nHarrow requested Grant to hand over the scarab, and though Grant was willing to comply, the voice impeded his attempts to surrender the scarab to Harrow. After several failed attempts to hand over the scarab, Grant was physically forced by the voice to walk away as Harrow ordered his followers to subdue him. Grant was wrestled through the crowd toward a storefront, where a few guards and a shopkeeper ripped the scarab out of his grasp. Grant suddenly found himself blacking out another alter took front, killing his attackers around him.[5]\n\nGrant then regained his senses as he stood over the bodies of his attackers while the voice remarked that the idiot was back. Grant realized he now had the scarab back in his blood-soaked hand, and began to run away as Arthur Harrow and his followers approached him. The voice scolded Grant not to drop the Scarab of Ammit, who complied as he hijacked a parked cupcake delivery van nearby and raced out of the village.\n\nAfter racing out of the village using his delivery van, Grant was ambushed by Harrow's followers and eventually, temporarily overwhelmed. Just as Grant blacked out, Spector or Lockley took front and defeated his assailants using his powers. However, as soon as his enemies were defeated, Grant temporarily took control over the body as he was unable to escape his enemies.\n\nThis forced Spector or Lockley to take control over the body again, with Spector or Lockley managing to defeat his enemies once again to drive back to safety. However, before he could do so, he was once again taken back over by Grant, who irresponsibly threw his own weapon at his enemies in a panic, much to the voice's dismay.\n\nAfter being cornered by Harrow's followers, Grant tried to peacefully surrender to them. However, before that could happen, logs from a lumber truck that had fallen onto its side further up the mountain fell down upon them. As the lumber came crashing down on him, all of a sudden, Grant blacked out.[5]\n\nGrant woke up in his apartment in bed and laughed to himself, believing he had just had a nightmare and that he was not in harms way. He then got himself up out of bed and ready for the next day. However, his preparations came to an abrupt stop when he noticed that Gus, who originally only had one good fin, suddenly had two. Upon taking the fish to a pet shop to ask about the anomaly, he was told by an annoyed clerk that he had already been there looking for a one-finned goldfish not long ago, much to Grant's confusion.\n\nRemembering his date with Dylan, he quickly got changed into nice clothes and cleaned himself up. When he arrived at the restaurant, she didn't show. A waiter came to get his order before he decided to call her and found out that he had missed his date with her two days ago.\n\nDylan told him to lose her number and hung up abruptly. Grant then asked the waiter what day it was and was shocked to learn she was right that he had missed their date completely. Saddened, he stayed and ordered steak, despite being a vegan.[5]\n\nAfter eating, Grant returned to his apartment, and ate the chocolates that he had bought for his date. He then fed Gus and commented how he still couldn't believe he had missed his date.\n\nGrant then found something hidden behind a plank of wood that was sticking out. There, he noticed a key and a cellphone, which sparked Grant's curiosity as he never remembered to own those items. Hence, the suspicious Grant opened the phone to see whose it was. Upon inspection, Grant discovered that the phone had been used to interact with a woman named Layla El-Faouly and a man named Jean-Paul Duchamp.\n\nSuddenly, Grant received a call from El-Faouly, who angrily told him that she had been contacting him for months. However, upon discovering Grant's different accent, Grant was asked about why his accent was different. This made a confused Grant ask Layla who she thought he was, through which he discovered that Layla knew him by the name of \"Marc.\" Grant then heard the voice calling for him, but he did not find anyone at his apartment, although he noticed how his reflection in the mirror seemed to move on its own.\n\nGrant then heard the voice get louder and he fled from his apartment and into the hallway. He ran to the elevator and watched as a beaked mummified creature lunged towards him and tried to open the elevator. However, Grant then saw that it was only an elderly woman. He greeted her, awkwardly, and was surprised that they were back on the fifth floor when she got off. When he turned around, the creature was behind him.[5]\n\nGrant screamed in fear only to wake up on a bus. Embarrassed that he was caught screaming in front of the passengers, he got off at the next exit, but not before seeing the same creature on the sidewalk. When Grant got off, he saw that Arthur Harrow was in the bus as well and realized that what he had experienced wasn't completely fake.\n\nHe went to his job at the National Art Gallery and then asked his coworker, J.B., to watch out for anyone sketchy. Grant then noticed someone who was on the bus with walking into the Egyptian exhibit, leading Grant to follow the man, ignoring his boss, Donna Kraft. A few moments after Grant entered the exhibit he was approached by Harrow who was surprised that Grant actually worked there.\n\nScared by Harrow's arrival, Grant attempted to escape, only to be stopped by more Disciples of Ammit. After Grant gave up the escape and stood still for a moment, Harrow attempted to read Grant's scales only to be shown that there was chaos in him and therefore the scales could not make an accurate judgement. After Harrow said this, Grant ran off after being let go by Harrow, who told the disciples to stand down.[5]\n\nThat night, Grant restocked the gift shop's inventory alone in discontent. Later, the lights of the National Art Gallery turned off and Grant prepared to leave for the night, though he stopped when he heard the sound of a howling dog echo through the halls of the building. Grant wandered through the museum to try and find the dog, paying no attention to various phenomena occurring around him.\n\nBefore long, Grant found himself in an open hallway, where the shadow of a monstrous creature on the wall could be seen closing in. Terrified, Grant hid behind a display case when Arthur Harrow got onto the museum loudspeakers, ordering him to give up the Scarab of Ammit or else he would be torn apart. Grant took off his satchel and threw it away from him as a distraction, prompting the creature to lunge out and attack it.\n\nGrant attempted to sneak away, though he accidentally bumped into a vase on display. Grant managed to catch it before it fell, though the sound he made alerted the creature, which gave chase to Grant as he ran through the halls of the museum in terror. Grant ran into a side hall, where he threw down a shelf to distance himself from the creature, though the creature simply leaped over it.\n\nGrant frantically used his badge to try and open a locked bathroom, and though he couldn't open the first one in time, he managed to enter the second one adjacent to it, locking himself in it as the creature relentlessly tried to break down the door. Spector began to converse with Grant as his reflection in the mirror began to act independently from the rest, telling him to let him take control.\n\nGrant at first refused, too panicked to do anything, though Spector managed to get his attention, saying that he wasn't going to die and that he had to let Spector save them. Grant finally agreed to Spector's request as the lights of the bathroom began to flicker and hieroglyphics flashed on the walls. Grant began to relinquish the front to Spector who summoned his suit when the jackal creature finally broke down the door and tackled him.\n\nUnfortunately for the creature, Moon Knight had successfully emerged and proceeded to ruthlessly beat the creature to death, dragging it back into the bathroom when it attempted to flee. After pummeling the helpless creature with his fist, Moon Knight stood victorious over its body before exiting the destroyed bathroom.\n\nAfter beating the jackal, Spector left the bathroom and walked through the museum. He then noticed a security camera and glared at it, before leaving to go to Grant's apartment. When he returned, he gave the body back to Grant.[5]\n\nThe next morning, Grant woke up in his bed in a panic, alarmed and having heard the fight in his dreams. He ran out of bed, only to fall on the floor having forgotten his ankle was chained to the bed. He then went to his bathroom and demanded that Spector talk to him from the mirror, but didn't receive any response.\n\nGrant then got ready and went to the National Art Gallery, finding it under criminal investigation due to the bathroom being destroyed. He went to see J.B. who showed him the security footage and Grant saw Spector looking at the camera before leaving. Grant then was called into meet with the Gallery's director, Dornfeld, learning he was fired for what happened. He then gave over his name tag and left the Gallery.\n\nGrant then went to speak with Bertrand Crawley and explained his predicament to him. Afterwards, Grant gave Crawley a hug thanking him for listening and walked away.[10]\n\nDetermined to learn more about Spector, Grant went to several storage units throughout the city and was unsuccessful in finding Spector's unit. The last one he went to was the Central London Storage and he was fortunate to have found it. The clerk led him to the unit and gave him access to it.\n\nInside, Grant saw a cot, a gym bag, and a mirrored wall. He looked in the bag and found Spector's passport, another hand gun, and the Scarab of Ammit. He accepted that what he experienced was real, but was still shocked.\n\nHe then looked at the mirrored wall and spoke with his \"reflection\", which was Spector, who introduced himself as an American mercenary and the current avatar of the Egyptian god of the Moon, Khonshu. Not believing this, Grant told Spector to leave him alone. Spector told Grant to lay down on a cot that was there and let him handle the situation, but Grant refused and snatched the bag.\n\nHe then left the storage unit, and saw the lights in the building hauntingly flashing towards him. Grant ran away terrified into another hallway only to be confronted face to face with Khonshu, who told him to hand over the bag. Grant screamed in fear and then fled outside the building.\n\nGrant then stumbled upon Layla El-Faouly, who told him to hop onto her scooter bike. She told him she was Spector's wife and was unaware of Grant's existence. Grant was surprised he was married and El-Faouly interrogated him for his accent.\n\nGrant led her back to his apartment, but Spector told him she shouldn't be there. As she looked at Gus, Spector looked at Grant through the tank's reflection. El-Faouly then showed Grant the divorce papers that he had sent her, but Grant responded that he would never do that. Confused, she continued to press on why he was using an accent and what was happening, before she found the Scarab.\n\nBefore they could finish, they were interrupted by two Metropolitan Police Service officers Bobbi Kennedy and Billy Fitzgerald. The two barged their way inside and interrogated Grant on his identity, telling him he was a thief.[10]\n\nThe officers took Grant into custody and drove him to an abandoned part of the city, while telling him about Spector's actions. Once they parked, they revealed that they were Disciples of Ammit. Alarmed, Grant called for help, but was then met by Arthur Harrow, who told him to walk with him. Khonshu appeared behind him and told Grant to kill Harrow.\n\nGrant was led by Harrow into the village consisting of his disciples. As they walked, they passed various people who Harrow talked to. Grant looked up and saw Khonshu sitting on a rooftop watching them.\n\nGrant was then led by Harrow to a dining area, where Harrow introduced him to Victor, who had cooked the soup.\nHarrow revealed that he was Khonshu's former avatar until he chose to follow Ammit instead, in the hope of preventing future harm rather than simply carrying out vengeance. He explained that he wanted to use the scarab to find Ammit's tomb and resurrect her, so she can purge humanity of evil by wiping out everyone who has or will commit evil deeds.\n\nWhen Grant pressed Harrow on the moral implications of his plan, as that would include children getting killed, Harrow threatened him with the Staff of Ammit. The disciples present walked closer in to interrogate Grant, making him feel uncomfortable. Harrow repeatedly pressed him on the location of the scarab in which he was unable to answer.\n\nTo his surprise, Layla El-Faouly arrived and revealed she had it. El-Faouly then told Grant to summon the suit, of which he didn't understand what she was referencing. She then told him to follow her, and Harrow summoned another Jackal to go after them. After being trapped inside an upper room, Grant was thrown out of the window by the jackal, which was invisible to all except Grant.\n\nAs he fell, Khonshu told him to summon his suit and he did, landing on the ground as Mr. Knight. In a reflection, Spector asked Grant what he was wearing. Grant was then attacked by the jackal who overpowered him and El-Faouly, who had come outside to help.\n\nAs Grant was thrown against a car by the jackal, El-Faouly realized that he needed help. She tried to assist Grant, but the jackal overpowered her. Grant hit the jackal with an object, but the two were both knocked to the ground. After he got up, Grant managed to punch the jackal away temporarily, excited about doing so. However, he was suddenly hit by a car. As Grant recovered and used a nearby bus for support in getting back up, Spector urged him to let him take over to prevent innocents from getting hurt.\n\nGrant gave in and Spector became the Moon Knight. He turned around and pulled out his Crescent Blades. He got the jackal's attention and forced it to chase him on top of rooftops. He then leaped onto another rooftop and tricked the jackal to jump on a steeple, killing it instantly.\n\nSpector watched it disintegrate, before realizing that he didn't have the scarab, much to his frustration. He then told Grant in a reflection that he would take control for now, before angrily smashing the mirror to get Grant to stop affronting him.\n\nKhonshu arrived and approached Spector. He threatened to claim El-Faouly as his next avatar should Spector fail to stop Harrow. Spector told him that wouldn't happen and Khonshu promised that he would protect him. He then sent Spector to Egypt.[10]\n\nSpector was brought to Cairo, Egypt by Khonshu so that they could find the tomb of Ammit before Harrow could. He sat shirtless on the floor next to his bed and finished off a bottle of alcohol, bloody knuckles and broken mirrors insinuating that Spector had another fight with Grant.\n\nHe stood up and proceeded to go to the window. He opened the blinds, and found himself staring at the Egyptian pyramids.[10]\n\nSpector then went exploring Cairo and found Disciples of Ammit spying on him. He ran after them over rooftops until he caught up to them. He facetiously asked them what they were doing, whether fighting or dancing, as one of them made a excessive movement with his feet on the ground.\n\nSpector then engaged in a hand to hand combat with them, kicking away their weapons in the process. As he fought, he caught sight of Grant in one of the men's knives' reflection who to begged him not to kill them.\n\nHowever, he then suddenly lost control as Grant fronted. When Spector regained consciousness, he was inside a taxi on the streets. Confused, he saw two of the disciples staring at him through the window who attempted to flee upon seeing him. Spector ran out of the taxi, with the taxi driver yelling at him to pay, and chased after them through an alleyway.\n\nHe grabbed one of the two and demanded an answer, before losing his control to Lockley. When Spector regained consciousness, he was on top of another rooftop having murdered other older of the two. The young punk looked frightened, and attempted to back away from Spector while his friend was lying dead on the floor. Spector asked Grant what he had done, thinking that he had fronted to murder the man, but Grant insisted that it wasn’t him— insinuating that a third alter had instead fronted.\n\nSpector looked at the young punk, and was told by Khonshu that he would talk if he took him to the ledge. Spector grabbed him and held him over the cliff by the teen’s scarf. He demanded to know where Arthur Harrow was, but the young punk refused to tell him and used his knife to cut his scarf and commit suicide, pledging his allegiance to Ammit as he did. Spector looked down at his body in horror as Khonshu told him he thought he would have talked.\n\nSpector then spoke with Khonshu, asking him if he had any good ideas on what to do next regarding Harrow. Khonshu told him he had a bad one, in which he would send out a signal to the Ennead that they wouldn't ignore. Spector watched as Khonshu then teleported to the Moon and created an eclipse in broad daylight.[3]\n\nSpector then met Khonshu down in the streets and was told by him about the Ennead Council. Khonshu told him that despite the avatars being scattered all over the world, they would be able to attend the Council. Spector asks how that worked, and Khonshu told him a portal opened up anywhere in the world so they could enter. A portal then opened up behind Spector and Khonshu walked away, telling an uncertain Spector that he would be there.\n\nSpector then entered the portal and found himself entering the Great Pyramid of Giza. Grant expressed his excitement through a reflection on the wall that they were there. As Spector entered the Chamber, he looked around and saw various seats on a ledge above.\n\nSpector then was met by a woman named Yatzil, who recognized him as Khonshu's avatar. She told him that she was Hathor's avatar and that she and Khonshu were friends, as he liked her music. She then told him what to do when the Council began.\n\nSpector watched as various people walked into the room and were introduced as avatars of Horus, Isis, Tefnut, and Osiris. As Hathor began the Council meeting, Spector then became possessed by Khonshu, who spoke through him, presenting his purpose. He called upon the judgement of Arthur Harrow for conspiracy to liberate the deity Ammit.\n\nThe Ennead then summoned Harrow to the Chamber of the Gods. Harrow explained to them that he was just visiting the desert and that it was Khonshu who had been searching for Ammit's tomb since his own service to the god. When Khonshu tried to punch Harrow via Spector’s body, he was stopped by Osiris. Harrow also revealed to the gods that Khonshu's avatar was mentally unwell; he didn't even know his own name — he has a marriage certificate under the name Marc Spector, but employment records under the name Steven Grant.\n\nSolidifying his case, Harrow stated that Khonshu is taking advantage of a deeply troubled man, the same way Khonshu abused him and the way he conspires to abuse this court. Harrow implores the gods to take action against Khonshu. Horus released Spector from Khonshu and asked if what Harrow said was true to which he agreed.\n\nWith that, the Ennead concluded the meeting, letting Harrow leave. Afterwards, only Spector and Yatzil were left in the Chamber. She walked up to him and gave him advice on how to find Ammit's tomb. She told him to look at a black market to find Senfu's sarcophagus where he might find clues on how to reach the tomb.[3]\n\nSpector went to the black market in Cairo and approached a local vendor, asking him for Senfu's sarcophagus. The man became wary and ignored him because of the sensitive question. Spector was then met by Layla El-Faouly, who told him since he wasn't Egyptian, he wasn't having success in asking questions. She told him that she knew where they could find it and told him to come with her.\n\nSpector then sat across from El-Faouly on an Egyptian boat that took them to the place that had the sarcophagus. As they rode on the boat, El-Faouly told him she could have helped him with his dissociative disorder and he apologized for pushing her away. When he recognized the music being performed, he smiled and told her it reminded him of their wedding.\n\nWhen they docked, Spector and El-Faouly noticed that another boat had spied on them. They deduced that the people on board were Disciples of Ammit. They proceeded to ignore them and walk forward. El-Faouly told Spector that his fake alias would be Rufino Estrada and that they were back from their honeymoon in the Maldives.\n\nThey were then met by Bek, who was pleased to see El-Faouly and was introduced to Spector. Bek took them up to the arena where they saw Anton Mogart jousting on horseback. Mogart then ended the practice and came over to see them. He reacquainted with El-Faouly and met Spector.\n\nSpector and El-Faouly were then led to the sarcophagus and both examined it. However, Spector and El-Faouly were unable to decipher the translations. When Mogart asked them what they wanted there, Spector told El-Faouly he needed time, and she went out to distract them.\n\nWhen she had left, Spector spoke to Grant, who told him he wouldn't help since he wasn't in control. Spector urged him to help and ignored Grant's arguments about their deal. Fortunately, Grant gave in and looked at the translations. However, due to the awkward nature of Spector seemingly arguing with himself, Mogart and his men eventually entered.\n\nSpector immediately grabbed a gun off of one of Mogart's men, but gave it up after they had aimed guns at him and El-Faouly. As they stood in Mogart's custody, Mogart told them that they had company. Spector then watched as Arthur Harrow and his followers approached.\n\nHarrow confronted them, and taunted Spector by speaking to El-Faouly. He told her that Spector was keeping a secret from her that was about her. She looked at Spector, who shook his head, and glared at Harrow. He then watched as Harrow walked up to Mogart and showed him his Staff of Ammit, before revealing its powers, destroying the sarcophagus. Harrow then left them.[3]\n\nSpector, at Khonshu's urging, became Moon Knight, and descended from above an upper building to confront Anton Mogart's men. They were startled at this and began firing their guns.\n\nMoon Knight then shielded Layla El-Faouly within his suit from the gunfire. When he deemed it safe, he let her go, and fought off the men. As she ran out of the arena area, Moon Knight proceeded to engage in a fight with the men.\n\nMoon Knight fought them in the arena, coming out victorious. He used his Crescent Blades on them, kicked and punched them, and broke one man's arm. As more men entered armed with weapons, Moon Knight continued to fight.\n\nDuring the fight, Moon Knight suddenly switched to Mr. Knight. He then held his hands up and called for a ceasefire, as Grant didn't want to continue to fight. This was unsuccessful as the men took this to their advantage and impaled him in the back with their jousting sticks.\n\nGrant then immediately let Spector take control as Moon Knight. As Moon Knight fought off the men while trying to get the sticks out, he used them to his advantage and struck the men with them, knocking them to the ground. He then snapped the sticks in half and walked away.\n\nMoon Knight then saw El-Faouly enter the arena, and ran to her, as Mogart was attempting to run over both of them on horseback. He ran to her in time and threw a Crescent Blade at Mogart, causing him to fall off his horse and fatally wounding him.[3]\n\nAfter escaping, Spector and Layla El-Faouly escaped into the desert. With El-Faouly driving, Spector changed his shirt for another one. He was pressed on the secret that he had been keeping, but he brushed it aside stating that it was just cause for division. She thought that he had not been telling her everything and he told her not to worry about it, as she didn't need to know everything.\n\nThey stopped in the sands of the Siwa Oasis and began inspecting the map. As they did, Spector became frustrated and El-Faouly suggested he summon Grant for help. Initially, Spector refused, but gave in and tore the side mirror off, walking away to do so.\n\nThey switched quite easily, and Grant then assembled some of the sarcophagus fragments into a star map, revealing it to be two thousand years out of date. El-Faouly approached him and smiled that he was able to help them.\n\nKhonshu then appeared and told Grant to follow his lead. Grant was then transformed into Mr. Knight as Khonshu used his powers to briefly turn back the night sky to the correct night, allowing Grant and El-Faouly to pinpoint the location of Ammit's tomb using the constellations. However, Khonshu paid the price for abusing his power and was imprisoned in stone.\n\nDue to Khonshu being imprisoned in stone, his powers given to Grant and Spector were stripped away. This impact of losing the superhuman powers had an effect on Grant, who fell to the ground unconscious.[3]\n\nSome minutes later, Grant regained consciousness and found Layla El-Faouly looking at an armored truck that had just exploded by way of flare. Not knowing what had happened, he approached her, and she turned around to see him, dismissing what she had just done to save them.\n\nIn the morning, they set out again to the location of the tomb. As El-Faouly drove them, Grant spoke to Spector from the side mirror, who told him that he remembered their deal about going away once Khonshu was gone. El-Faouly interjected stating to Grant that she needed to have a voice in the matter since Spector was her husband. Grant then became startled as she stopped the vehicle suddenly as the path had become too narrow ahead.[9]\n\nGrant and Layla El-Faouly then walked on foot through the narrow gauge and made it to a larger opening. They found an abandoned campsite that the Disciples of Ammit had used, along with their camels. Grant said hi to one of them as they explored the camp.\n\nEl-Faouly told Grant to look into the tents for anything helpful. As she went in one, he went into another and looked around. When he came across a small mirror, Spector got onto him, telling him that he noticed Grant and El-Faouly's growing affection. He told Grant that she was his wife and that if he did anything, he'd throw their body off a cliff.\n\nWhile preparing their harnesses to descend down, El-Faouly remarked that Grant smelled like Spector and moved in to kiss him. Grant interrupted her by revealing that the reason Spector abandoned her was because Khonshu threatened to make her his next Avatar. She told him that it wasn't Spector's choice to make.\n\nGrant then proceeded to lean in and kiss El-Faouly. She smiled and then as he made a joke, she jumped down. As he looked down, Spector punched him in the face in retaliation for him kissing his wife.[9]\n\nGrant then stumbled and fell into the tomb. He approached Layla El-Faouly and as she spoke about her father, complimented her that he would have been proud of her.\n\nAs they walked further into the tomb, Grant deduced that it was built in the shape of the Eye of Horus and from that figured out where Ammit's ushabti was most likely located.\n\nWhile moving forward, Grant noticed that a hallway was filled with bones and viscera, and decided to jump on the rafters to look for an alternate route. Before El-Faouly could follow, an undead Heka Priest brought Billy Fitzgerald into the room and sacrificed him, forcing El-Faouly and Grant to run from the creature in separate directions.\n\nGrant approached the resting place of the pharaoh, and noticed Macedonian writing, revealing that this was the lost tomb of Alexander the Great. Grant opened the sarcophagus and, figuring the ushabti would be hidden from looters, reluctantly forced his hand down Alexander's throat to recover the idol.\n\nShortly after the ushabti was recovered, Grant looked at, proud that he had found it before anyone else could. As he prepared to figure out what to do next, he was met El-Faouly. Upon seeing her, he held up the ushabti and told her that they had succeeded.\n\nEl-Faouly ignored this and angrily demanded to speak to Spector. This caused Grant to be confused and for Spector to jump to front, who tried to get El-Faouly to run before the Disciples of Ammit arrive, but she wouldn't leave until they talked. Eventually, he told El-Faouly the truth about her father Abdallah El-Faouly and his own role in his death.[9]\n\nBefore they could continue, Arthur Harrow and his followers came inside. Layla El-Faouly told Spector to come with her to leave, but he held his ground and told her to go. Knowing that he had no powers, he still tried to fight. He picked up Alexander the Great's axe and defeated two men.\n\nIn response, he was shot in the chest twice by Harrow, and stumbled backwards into the water. He looked up at the ceiling as he felt as if he was drowning and couldn't come back to the surface.[9]\n\nAfter passing away on the shallow temple pond, Spector's soul began sinking deeper into a dark abyss, still as a lifeless body. Suddenly, he was brought towards a shining, bright, white light that transported him to the Duat, the Egyptian underworld. In there, Spector woke up sitting on a wheelchair in the Putnam Psychiatric Hospital common room, heavily sedated. He was watching his favourite film Tomb Buster on the television before his wheelchair was pulled away by Billy Fitzgerald.\n\nThis gave Spector an opportunity to observe his surroundings, where he watched Bertrand Crawley hosting a bingo game, with some of the patients playing included recreated people he knew, such as Donna Kraft. The orderlies also consisted of Bobbi Kennedy and Bek, with the latter complimenting a patient's drawing that resembled Khonshu. Finally, Spector was placed in front of a translucent window with bars outside, and he could almost see his reflection. Notably, a goldfish resembling Gus was set near him.\n\nFitzgerald pulled on the brakes on Spector's chair and calmly assured to him that he was at his favourite spot. The struggling Spector was then approached by Layla El-Faouly, who was also a patient in the hospital. El-Faouly told him that she changed the movie for the fifth time this week while pasting photos and drawings themed with Egyptian mythology on a whiteboard. Spector, confused, tried to speak, but he only moaned, making El-Faouly think she startled him. She then noticed on the bingo paper on Spector's lap that they had an I-2 as announced by Crawley, making them the winners.\n\nAfter El-Faouly left swearing that she would share the prize with him, he noticed his reflection. Spector looked at his reflection and tried to call out for Grant, but he was not present. He attempted to walk towards the window, but the ankle restraint to the chair caused him to fall to the ground. Fitzgerald helped carry Spector back onto the wheelchair, saying that he cannot keep doing this, and a bewildered Spector found that he himself had dropped an action figure that was designed almost exactly like Moon Knight's Suit.\n\nAfter the sedation began to wear off again, Spector was sent to the office of Doctor Arthur Harrow, a psychiatrist who reassured him that he was aware of Spector's supposed difficulty in differentiating reality and his imagination, implying that everything he experienced as Khonshu's Avatar was all a delusion. Harrow showed him his copy of Tomb Buster, while Spector's vision was a blur. As the therapist continued to complement the movie, Spector distinguished his surroundings. He did not answer Harrow when he asked about the similarity between the lunar god theme in the film and Spector's statement to have served one.\n\nSpector's vision finally cleared up, and he tried say that someone might have sedated him, but Harrow responded that he was in this state due to his behavior, but the effects would wear off. While Harrow explained his philosophy about living in a psychic world, Spector took glances at Harrow's cane, a reflection of Harrow's shoes in a mirror and a fly on his hand. He uttered an attempt to say that everything reminded him of the living world, though Harrow assumed he meant his past and Steven Grant, the mention of his name surprising Spector.\n\nHe did not listen to Harrow's statement about their sessions where he was often agitated by direct questions, since he stared at a miniature sculpture resembling Ammit, a painting of the Alps of Austria, Harrow's face, a glass lanky pyramid, the Tomb Buster copy, Harrow's cane and reflection of his shoes. When Harrow told him that he could not help him if he did not help himself, something similar to the real Arthur Harrow's last words to him, Spector recollected his thoughts and mistook Doctor Harrow for the actual one, saying that he shot him.\n\nFrightened and panicked, Spector repeated his words and tried to stand up, but he fell to the ground due to the sedatives, drooling. He ignored Harrow's pleas to calm down and crawled away, noticing ancient Egyptian themed items and shouting at Harrow to stay away. When he stood up again, he felt drowsy and collapsed before continuing to stumble to the door. Spector desperately tried to use the knob and demanded the sympathizing Harrow to unlock the door.\n\nHe then broke the window on the door with his elbow and exited the room, only to be grabbed back inside by Fitzgerald and Kennedy. Spector punched Fitzgerald in the stomach and bit Kennedy's hand, allowing him to run outside. Sprinting through the hallways with hardly any effect from the sedatives, Spector turned another corner to see the place rocking sideways and Egyptian-reminiscent lanterns flickering momentarily. He shook his head and ran once more, finding a room to hide in as the two orderlies passed Spector's spot.[9]\n\nInside the room, Spector noticed a blue sarcophagus and heard someone inside trying to get out and screaming for help. Spector proceeded to remove the casket to reveal a horrified, physical form of Grant, separated from his body. Grant breathed heavily and frantically climbed out, and as soon as they met eyes, the two overjoyed alters embraced each other. They were both appalled by the current situation, and Grant questioned how they were possibly separated.\n\nSpector was joyous when Grant confirmed that the last thing he remembered was Arthur Harrow shooting them, and Spector led the puzzled Grant outside the room. Spector walked somewhat stealthily and they noticed in another room a red sarcophagus with the person inside silent yet trying to push the casket open. Unbeknownst to Spector and Grant, that person was Lockley, their mysterious third alter. The pair ignored it and steadily approached the doors, until a shadowing figure was visible through the opaque door window. The doors opened to reveal Taweret, who lightheartedly greeted them, but they screamed at the top of their lungs in fear, with Grant grabbing onto a trolley of towels.[9]\n\nSuddenly, the screaming Spector, who had a bruised face, found himself sitting in Doctor Arthur Harrow's office. He was told that he did not shoot Spector, but rather his mind was oscillating between sense and nonsense. Harrow elaborated that he was supposedly switching between the \"reality\" that he was a patient in Putnam Psychiatric Hospital and a \"fantasy\" where he was a superhero. Spector accused Harrow of not really being a doctor, and Harrow asked if that was why he kept starting imaginary fights in the hospital.\n\nHarrow began question about Spector, inquiring how he arrived here, but Spector turned the question the other way around and asked Harrow how he got here, to which he answered that he rode a bus. The therapist explained that, according to Spector, he was somewhere oddly reminiscent of the office, except he was in Egypt and that he was with a rhinoceros, but Spector clarified that it was a talking hippopotamus, referring to Taweret. Spector was then asked if that sounded like sense or nonsense, and he answered nonsense as a question.\n\nSpector listened to Harrow admitting how he find this encouraging, how Spector's struggling mind would build shelter for different aspects of himself from his most traumatic memories. He gave examples such as a castle, maze or library, and Spector added a psychiatric ward, determining that the ward he was in was an organizing principle. Harrow took interest in Taweret as she could help Spector and Grant open up to each other, then he and the hospital would finally understand what Spector was talking about when he mentioned a little boy in an implied previous session.\n\nSpector deducted that he was referring to Randall Spector, prompting him to lean forward with conflicted expression and thank him. He claimed to have felt really great before grabbing the sharp, glass, lanky pyramid figure and praised how the hospital must have been paying a lot of money, declaring how he supposedly felt like a million dollars. He pretended to try and leave, but then he was grabbed by Billy Fitzgerald and Bobbi Kennedy.\n\nSpector thrashed around in their grasps as he tried to direct the object to Harrow, yelling he was not a real doctor and that he was going to release Ammit and destroy everything. While Harrow tried to assure Spector that he was not his enemy, Spector did not relent until he was injected in the neck with another sedative by Kennedy, driving him to yell out as he began to lose consciousness.[1]\n\nAt that moment, Spector was sent back to the hallway with Grant, both screaming in fear at Taweret. By the time they settled, Spector called the medicine amazing. Grant confirmed Taweret's question if Spector was always so intense, and when she asked if they were twins, Spector denied it, but Grant verified it to be sort of correct. Spector mentioned that he thought he had been shot to death, so the cheery Taweret clarified that they were actually dead, much to their surprise.\n\nThey watched as Taweret opened a parcel with a speech, welcoming them as gentle travelers to the Duat, which Grant recognized out loud as the Egyptian underworld. He elaborated to Spector as to who Taweret is, the goddess of women and children who would guide them to the afterlife, astounding Grant. Spector then asked if the Putnam Psychiatric Hospital was the afterlife, but Taweret explained that this was one of the afterlives, mentioning the Ancestral Plane as an example. While Taweret tried to find the words in her parcels to say, Spector was struggling to process he was deceased.\n\nTaweret spelled out how the Duat reshapes a human soul's view of the realm into something more recognizable, commenting that this was the first time she had seen it as a psychiatric ward. Grant questioned why they were seeing an asylum, to which Spector answered that they were insane. He believed they were merely insane, since he was seeing a talking hippopotamus, a talking dead bird, Grant was outside his body, and now they were in the afterlife.\n\nSpector began to accept Doctor Arthur Harrow's diagnosis that he was delusional, catching Grant's curiosity as to whether Arthur Harrow was a doctor now. Ignoring Grant calling for him, Spector stated that he would enter the common room where there were a bunch of patients and Bertrand Crawley probably going to yell \"bingo,\" but when he opened the doors, he found himself on top of Taweret's Boat sailing across the sands of the Duat, much to his utter shock.[1]\n\nGrant told the agape Spector that they were in the Duat, the underworld. Spector rejoiced that he was not insane, but Grant was disturbed by the fact he was dead. Grant continued to explain to Spector they were sailing to Aaru, earning a compliment from Taweret for being \"the smart one.\" After Taweret lectured that they would transcend to Aaru if their hearts were balanced, she then carefully phased her hand through their chests to remove their white hearts, surprising the pair.\n\nTaweret remarked how she was nervous to accidentally blow up their chests, concerning Grant. Spector was informed by his alter about how Taweret would balance their hearts on the Scales of Justice and the Feather of Truth, and if their scales balanced, they would be sent to Aaru. However, the scales began fluctuating wildly. Taweret told the pair to travel through the Duat and reconcile their past before they reached the afterlife, or else they would be condemned to the sands of the Duat for all eternity.\n\nThey returned to the interior, the doors of which now contained memories from Spector and Grant's life. Spector attempted to convince Grant to help him kill Taweret and steer the boat themselves, but Grant refused. Grant followed a child's voice to the hospital cafeteria, which was filled with the bodies of all the people Spector had killed as Moon Knight. Even though he assured Grant that they were all criminals, he remembered each and every one of them.\n\nGrant then saw a child at the end of the room, who he followed into another door, locking Spector outside. Inside the room, he relived the memories of his brother Randall Spector drowning and his mother Wendy Spector becoming abusive. Before he could enter his childhood room, Spector pulled Grant into a new memory of Spector leaving his house as a teenager then his memory of becoming Moon Knight.\n\nThe duo were suddenly startled by the sound of baboons, and followed them back to the deck of the ship. Taweret watched in horror as souls began pouring into the Duat without being judged, revealing that Ammit had returned. Spector asked Taweret to return them to life to stop Harrow, but she told him that even if she resurrected them, they would die again of their wounds without Khonshu's healing. Spector asked Taweret to send a message to Layla El-Faouly to free Khonshu, and she agreed to steer the ship towards the realm of the living so long as their scales were balanced.\n\nReturning to the interior, Spector refused to let Grant see what was behind that door in his room, eventually breaking down and pounding on his head. He suddenly found himself back in Dr. Harrow's office, who informed Spector that he had not been injected with anything. Harrow told Spector that he needed to reconcile with Grant.\n\nFinding himself back in the Duat, Spector and Grant entered the room, where Grant witnessed a moment that either caused his split or was very common for them. As his mother broke into the room, Spector pulled Grant away before he could see her beating him. Spector told Grant that he had let Grant live a happy life believing that his mother loved him and was still alive. Grant was incredulous that his mother was dead, but he suddenly appeared in Dr. Harrow's office with a start. Harrow said he was happy to see Grant, since he was worried he would never see him again. Harrow offered to call Grant's mother on the phone, while Grant tried to think of excuses to make him stop. Finally, Grant accepted that his mother was dead after hearing nothing on the line, but a dial tone.\n\nThe two watched one final memory, of Spector refusing to attend his mother's shiva. Grant reassured Spector that it was not his fault that Randall died, and the two hugged before they suddenly felt the boat stop.[1]\n\nOnce Grant had noticed that the ship had stopped, Spector and Grant ran back to Taweret. She informed them that the Scales of Justice have not balanced, and now the lost souls would be coming to claim their soul. She sadly told them that she was rooting for them, but there was nothing she could do now. Spector and Grant watched on, as the lost souls started boarding their ship. Spector desperately attempted to fend off the intruders, but was losing and was pushed against the railing of the ship.\n\nScared, Grant attempted to assist his alter by turning the ship's wheel, briefly giving Spector some room. However, it was short-lived, as the latter was hit over the head with a metal pole, stunning him. Giving himself a confidence boost, Grant attacked the souls with the metal pole, pulling them off Spector and beating them to death. Spector looked at Grant awestruck, but was then immediately attacked again by an attacker hanging off the ship. Attempting to help Spector, Grant rushed the soul, but he was inadvertently dragged off along with the soul. Spector immediately got up and told Taweret to stop the ship, but was unable, and watched on helplessly, as Grant fell over and slowly turned to sand.[1]\n\nIn the wake of Steven Grant's sacrifice, Marc Spector's scales had finally balanced against the Scales of Justice making him worthy to enter into the Field of Reeds, an afterlife of Aaru. This made Spector transport from the ship into the beautiful dimension at the last moment, as he peered out into the fields in complete awe of the beauty of the place, yet feeling tremendous grief for the loss of his comforting alter.[1]\n\nSpector, still saddened by Grant's death, refused to accept peace in the Field of Reeds, and left to save Grant, despite Taweret's warning that he would not be able to return. Spector found Grant's frozen body, and said to him that he was the only superpower he had. He gave him his heart before he was frozen as well, but both were saved when the Gates of Osiris were opened. They both hugged each other, but they noticed a sandstorm coming towards them, running towards the gates. Before they get trapped in the sandstorm, Taweret saved them from being consumed. They finally reached the gates and returned to life, though their body was weak due to the bullet holes.\n\nKhonshu detected Spector and Grant's presence in the living world and struck a new agreement, repairing their body and resurrecting Moon Knight. Spector and Grant requested that their agreement be reviewed, stating that they were free to leave once Ammit was no longer a threat. Khonshu was shocked that they were willing to bargain at that moment, but he had no choice, and accepted their terms.[6]\n\nArthur Harrow sent his newly-granted armies into Cairo, while his disciples evaluated the inhabitants and sent the souls of the unworthy to Ammit to eat. Grant let Spector take reign as he could fly. Moon Knight made his way to the Great Pyramid of Giza and landed at the bottom. He ran up to Harrow and leaped, starting a fight.\n\nSpector flew off into the night as Harrow held onto him. Spector then smartly changed to Grant, who did not have a cape, causing them to fall and Harrow to lose his grip. Once that happened, Spector took reign once again, but Harrow managed to grab back on, making them plunge into the street below. The two fought until Spector was overwhelmed by Harrow, who stood over him and was about to finish him off, using his Staff of Ammit.\n\nSuddenly, Layla El-Faouly arrived and saved Spector, knocking Harrow far away from them. The two were overjoyed to see each other alive and well. Grant then surfaced and complimented El-Faouly on her new look, and they both resumed the fight with Harrow and his followers. Grant switched alters to catch Harrow off guard, attacking from multiple sides. Grant knocked Harrow down and neatened his clothing before kicking. Harrow then tackled Grant. At one point, Spector and El-Faouly managed to pin Harrow to a wall, but he managed to break free from them.\n\nHarrow eventually was able to overpower Spector as El-Faouly became stuck to a van. Harrow plunged his staff into Spector's chest when Spector suddenly blacked out. Lockley then emerged and plowed through all of the enemies, eventually beating up Harrow. Just before chopping off Harrow's head, he changed back into Spector, who saw the destruction, asking Grant if he did it, but Grant assured him that he was not responsible for the extreme violence. El-Faouly asked what just happened, but Spector had no idea.[6]\n\nThey then brought Arthur Harrow to the Chamber of the Gods, Spector and Layla El-Faouly recited an old magic spell to confine Ammit inside Harrow's body. Khonshu instructed Spector to kill Harrow so that the two of them are no longer a threat, but Spector refused, claiming that Khonshu and Ammit are nearly identical and asked the moon god to kill Harrow himself. Khonshu agreed with Spector's order and had to keep his end of the bargain by releasing Spector and Grant in exchange for losing their service to the former.\n\nGrant found himself back at the Putnam Psychiatric Hospital. He asked Dr. Harrow if this was what reality looked like. Dr. Harrow reassured Grant who then asked if Harrow believed in Khonshu and Ammit to which Dr. Harrow said that he did not. Spector then emerged and asked why they cannot believe different things. Harrow responded that their work had to continue. The men switched back and forth between Grant and Spector. As they sat down, they both noticed that Dr. Harrow was leaving bloody footsteps when walking. Harrow noticed as well and was confused as to why he was bleeding. Grant got up from the chair, telling Harrow that he did not know as much as he thought he did. Spector said that although Harrow's offer was tempting, they would rather save the world. They then fell back and were freed from the Duat.[6]\n\nWaking up in Grant's bed, Spector asked Grant if he was there. Grant confirmed his presence to Spector. While Spector was getting out of bed, he told Grant he could not believe that he lived in the apartment, calling it a dump, before accidentally tripping on the foot restraint and landing on his face.[6]\n\nSometime later, Lockley retook control of the body and tracked down Arthur Harrow to the Sienkiewicz Psychiatric Hospital in London. Lockley traveled to the hospital and killed some of the staff there. After finding Harrow, Lockley, keeping out of Harrow's sight took his wheelchair with Harrow in it from an orderly, saying that he had him. Confused, the orderly asked what he had meant, but Lockley told her to calm down, before escorting Harrow outside the hospital.\n\nReaching his limousine parked outside, Lockley shoved Harrow in the backseat and kicked aside his wheelchair, leaving Harrow to speak to Khonshu, as Lockley waited in the front seat. After Khonshu told Harrow that he never wanted El-Faouly as Spector's replacement, but instead he wanted Lockley, so that he could still have Spector under his command. Rolling down the visor blocking Harrow's view, Lockley revealed himself to the shocked Harrow. Lockley told Harrow that it was his turn to lose, pulling out a gun and aiming it at Harrow. Harrow vainly tried to stop Lockley from killing him, but Lockley, with a smile, proceeded to mercilessly shoot Harrow multiple times, killing him and Ammit for good. With his mission finished, Lockley proceeded to drive him and Khonshu away from the hospital.[6]\n\nMarc Spector used to be an incredibly happy person as a child, who was confident, smart, and not afraid to face his fears. However, over time due to his extreme guilt over his brother's death, the extreme childhood neglect and beatings he used to receive from his mother, Spector started to develop a fractured mind, resulting in him developing dissociative identity disorder. Wanting a happy life, and a happy childhood, Spector developed his alter, Steven Grant, a socially oblivious man who lived a happy life with a loving mom, in order to guard himself against the pain of his life.\n\nSpector eventually managed to get some form of control over the system after moving out of his family's house to become a US Marine as soon as he could. However, despite this, due to his extreme trauma other alters continued to show up at some points of his life, which forced him out of the Marines. He was so ill due to his trauma that it was even acknowledged by the likes of Khonshu, who used his moments of weakness to manipulate him into becoming Moon Knight, the avatar of Khonshu who serves vengeful justice.\n\nDue to the nature of their system, Spector is highly prone to aggression and is internally anguished to the point of being driven to tears after being asked by the gods, about his pain due to the system and Khonshu. As a result of his psychological rifts, Spector became a bitter, rageful, and ultimately lonely person who had developed anger issues over time, as shown when Spector shattered everything around him after Grant started fighting against him. Despite all of his pain he had gone through, Spector is a brave and courageous man who is able to think rationally in high stress situations, as he was able to talk and explain to the panicked Steven what he should do while the latter was being followed by the jackal. Spector has a tendency to be brutal and ruthless with his enemies as he had brutally killed many of Arthur Harrow's men with his hands and weapons, which attributes to him being trained as a mercenary.\n\nAs a result of his trauma due to the various events in his life, Spector became a very pessimistic and socially inept man, who always hesitated to communicate his emotions against the world because he always feared the worst out of people, as shown when he was unable to express his feelings of love towards even his own wife Layla. This resulted in him becoming a dishonest person who tried to hide from tough situations, despite having noble intentions. This was demonstrated best when Spector chose to abandon Layla rather than communicating to her about his tough past with his mother, his dissociative disorder, and his situation with Khonshu, in fear of endangering her or hurting her feelings.\n\nNevertheless, despite all he had gone through, he continued to possess a strong moral code, such as refusing to punch or kill a child who was part of Arthur Harrow's cult, slapping him instead. He does care about the well-being of others such as his wife Layla. Spector displays incredible resilience as he chooses to do the right thing to help others, through continuing to deliver out his justice, regardless of what his actions has given him. Due to having committed extreme acts of violence, under the name of Khonshu's vengeful justice, Spector was deeply pained by the burden that his actions had placed on him, feeling extreme feelings of guilt due to his actions, as shown when he remembered each and every person he was forced to kill as a servant of Khonshu and his vengeance.\n\nDespite managing to gain a form of balance after finding love in the form of his wife, Layla El-Faouly, Spector continued to develop a greater self-hatred over time. When Spector had discovered that his mother, the woman whom he had hated for being abusive to him, had died after years of not talking to her, Spector was devastated, believing that he had indirectly caused her death by bringing her unnecessary pain. This pain grew to be so intense that he lost control of the body,\n\nIn comparison to Marc Spector, Steven Grant is a meek and shy person, with many people pushing him around for that reason. Despite being frustrated with people constantly mistreating him, Grant rarely stands up to them and instead passively accepts the abuse. Additionally, Grant is extremely lonely; he has no friends or family members in his life that he can talk to. This has made him quite socially oblivious, as he often vents all of his frustrations to a local performer acting as a living statue, who, quite obviously, does not respond to anything Grant says. However, despite his lack of social skills, Grant appears to have a great deal of care for other people's well being. He is disgusted to find out about the people Marc Spector killed using their body and also allowed the latter to regain control in order to protect civilians from a jackal.\n\nSteven Grant is an incredibly anxious and jumpy person. This is not only reflected in his day-to-day life, where he shows signs of anxiety in social interactions, but also whenever he's confronted with the dangerous aspects of Marc Spector's life bleeding into his own. Whenever Grant is put into a dangerous or horrific situation, he is absolutely terrified and will do little more than try to run away or hide. After transforming into Mr. Knight, Grant seemed to gain more confidence than usual due to his newfound strength and was even willing to help Marc and Layla more often when Marc was still in control. However, despite this anxiousness, he does have a strong sense of morality. After being told by Arthur Harrow's plans and killing innocent people and children in Ammit's name, he is visibly disgusted wanting nothing to do with Harrow and Ammit's cult.\n\nDue to being a walking personification of Marc's grief upon losing his mother and his desire for a loving one, Grant became a loving son who was highly close with his mother who only remembered a loving childhood due to his mother's love. This manifestation came to existence because Marc had to avoid grieving his mother's death due to the sheer amount of pain that it bought him. However, despite struggling after he realizes that his life was all a manifestation of Spector's fears and intense dissociative amnesia, Grant came to terms with himself as he realized that he and Spector came from the same trauma and the same brain, with Grant coming to see the two of them as a team of sorts. As a result, Grant become far more confident and vocal, becoming strong enough to help Marc understand that his mother was wrong about him, and he should forgive himself for his mistake as a child.\n\nJake Lockley is shown to be an extremely shrewd man who is willing to do anything to accomplish his goals, as seen throughout his various murders in his serving to Khonshu. Lockley is the most rageful alter of Spector, who is willing to cross nearly all limits in his animalistic rage, who never hesitates to kill anyone to serve his purpose.\n\nLockley possesses a far more brutal disposition than Spector or Grant, as shown when he had killed Alpha and Beta in Cairo when Spector was not in control. His hyper-aggressive nature is suited perfectly to Khonshu's vengeful agenda. Khonshu uses this alter's unbridled loyalty to serve his \"justice\" on those he views as evil, as shown when he made Lockley kill Arthur Harrow, which he did without hesitation or remorse. In fact, Lockley carried out the murder with a smile, enjoying the moment he shoots Harrow.\n\nThe sheer rage in Lockley left him susceptible to manipulations by Khonshu, who manipulated him into being his loyal servant under the offering of immense power and a purpose for serving justice. Lockley appears to be Khonshu's most loyal servant, executing the god's orders with a smile. He is also fluent in Spanish and it is seemingly his default language, as he speaks it even when someone doesn't understand him.",
