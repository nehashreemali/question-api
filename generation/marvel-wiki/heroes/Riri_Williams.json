  "content": "Riri Williams is a former MIT student and a gifted inventor, who created various cutting-edge designs, such as her own Ironheart armor, based on Iron Man's suits. As one of her projects was used by the CIA to find vibranium outside Wakanda, Williams found herself threatened by Namor, since her invention put Talokan in danger of being exposed to the surface world. Targeted by both Talokanil and the United States Government, Williams was approached by Shuri and the Wakandans, which later escalated into a war between Wakanda and Talokan. Ironheart helped the Wakandans in the final battle, using a new armor, made with Wakandan technology, and returned to the U.S. after the conflict.\n\nWilliams continued her side hustle to get enough money to construct the armor of her dreams, which eventually resulted in her getting expelled from MIT and returning to Chicago. Williams did not abandon her dream and continued working on a suit, while being approached by Hood, who promised her money for working for his gang. Despite warnings from N.A.T.A.L.I.E., an A.I. accidentally created in the image of her late best friend Natalie Washington, Williams continued working for Hood, but soon realized that she and her loved ones were in danger. Being confronted by the threats of magic, Ironheart managed to overcome her deep-seated fear and defeated Hood, before being approached by Mephisto, who resurrected Washington for her as a part of their deal.\n\nRiri Williams was born to Demetrius and Ronnie Williams in 2005.[1] She grew up in Chicago[3] and started building machines at the age of three.[4] She learned a lot about mechanics from Gary, her stepfather who wanted to build airplanes. She would often take his tools and just fidget with his airplanes.[3] Together, she and her dad worked on a Plymouth Barracuda. One day at the auto shop, Gary kissed her on the forehead as she was on the ground. She graduated ninth grade at the age of eleven. Riri was constantly making the news headlines, and constantly had articles written in the Chicago Tribune about her. At the age of twelve, she became the youngest ever to win at the Chicago Science Fair with a Robo-Dog, and had an article written by the Chicago Central City Press about her victory. As a teenager, she attended South Shore International College Preparatory High School, and, due to her genius mind, graduated in 2020, and started college at the age of fifteen.[1]\n\nFresh out of high school, Williams was accepted into and attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she settled into her single dorm and soon ran a business. She completed other students' homework for money, with the money being electronically transferred to her. Williams later became infatuated with creating her own Iron Man-style armor and worked on it intermittently in her own garage. She also set up a very sophisticated computer password that she accidentally locked herself out of, which took her her a semester to regain access. At the age of nineteen, Williams designed a Vibranium Detector, which she created using scraps of junk, after her professor believed that she would never be able to build it.[3]\n\nIn May 2025, Williams approached her friend, who did not pay her for the homework she had done for him. She swiftly took his phone and transferred the money herself. She then went back to her dorm where she met Princess Shuri from Wakanda, who she instantly recognized. Williams wondered if she was being recruited, but Shuri revealed that she was there in regard to the Vibranium Detector.\n\nThe two discussed the machine until Williams wondered if she had upset the Wakandans, so Shuri clarified it was not just them and that Williams was no longer safe and had to leave with her immediately. Williams became worried and tried to escape through the bathroom, but was blocked by Okoye, who had been hiding there the whole time. Williams demanded they leave her dorm and threw a speaker at Okoye, but she sliced it in half. Shuri went to leave, informing Williams that she would have to deal with Namor alone, so Williams decided to go with them.[3]\n\nWilliams brought Okoye and Shuri to her garage, where she told them not to touch anything. Williams collected her computer, explaining that it had her life's work on it. Griot notified them that the FBI had arrived and were surrounding the garage, demanding Williams to step out.\n\nWilliams became annoyed that the FBI had been led to her garage, putting all her work at risk, so she began burning her designs. Shuri and Okoye discussed their next course of actions, so Williams revealed her suit, stating she would be using it to escape. Shuri gave Williams a wireless transmitter so they could communicate before entering Williams' stepfather's car with Okoye. Williams suited up, and when the FBI breached the garage, she fired a shot at them before flying outside through an opening in the roof.\n\nGriot noted that there was a surveillance drone tracking them, so Williams went to destroy it, working out the calculations so that it would crash into the police blocking the bridge. Williams successfully shot the drone out of the sky, however, she passed out from lack of oxygen and began plummeting towards the water. Williams regained consciousness before crashing and regrouped with Shuri and Okoye at the bridge. But, Williams was knocked out by the Talokanil, who took her and Shuri to Talokan.[3]\n\nWilliams woke up in a cave and panicked, so Shuri tried to calm her down. Williams asked if a Black Panther would be sent to rescue them, but Shuri informed her that there were no more Black Panthers. Namora entered and told Shuri to come with her, causing Williams to worry about being left alone. When Shuri returned, she revealed to Williams that Namor intended to go to war with the surface and he wanted Wakanda to fight with him. They were then rescued by Nakia, who arrived and shot the two guards, allowing them to escape back to the surface, where they were picked up by a Royal Talon Fighter.[3]\n\nWilliams was brought to Wakanda, where she met Queen Ramonda and was shown to the Citadel. Suddenly, Wakanda fell under attack by the Talokanil, so Williams assisted Ramonda in using the high-tech windows to help civilians. They were confronted by Namor, who used a Hydrobomb to attack them, flooding the room. Williams was saved from drowning by Ramonda, and was quickly resuscitated, only to discover that the Queen had died saving her.[3]\n\nFollowing the funeral, Williams approached Shuri and told her that Ramonda's sacrifice made her feel the need to help them stop Namor. Shuri stated they needed to weaken Namor, and that she would become the next Black Panther. Williams and Shuri discussed Namor's physiology and figured out that heat would weaken him, so Shuri placed Williams in charge of converting the Royal Talon Fighter into a trap for him.\n\nAs Williams worked on the trap, she also built herself new armor, which Shuri consulted on. During the process, Williams and Shuri bonded over how they were introduced to building things. When Shuri successfully recreated the Heart-Shaped Herb, Williams and Nakia helped her take it, with Williams worried about the dangers of the ritual. When Shuri awoke, they discovered Shuri's newfound strength, making Williams express her desire to also take the Herb.[3]\n\nBlack Panther led the Wakandans to ambush the Talokanil on the Sea Leopard. Creating another Vibranium Detector, Williams used it to lure the Talokanil. When Namor appeared, Williams attacked him, but he soon overwhelmed her, so she requested assistance from Griot. The Royal Talon Fighter was flown in and captured Namor after Williams disoriented him with a blast.\n\nWilliams informed the others of Namor's capture and went to help the rest of the Wakandans fight off the Talokanil. When Williams went underwater, Namora grabbed onto the suit and began attacking it, so Williams resurfaced and attempted to shake her off. Williams managed to get Namora in front of her, allowing her to blast her enemy with a chest beam. Williams regrouped with the rest of the Wakandans, but were soon outnumbered and surrounded. Fortunately, Black Panther returned with Namor and they announced their truce, ending the war between them.[3]\n\nNo longer in danger, Williams went back to Wakanda and prepared to return home. Shuri spoke with Williams before she left, telling her that she would not be allowed to leave with her new armor, which Williams understood. Shuri then revealed that she had repaired Williams' stepfather's car, which would be transported back to Boston with her. Williams invited Shuri to come with her, but she informed her of other business she had deal with.[3]\n\nFrom an early age, Williams was incentivized to tinker and build, developing a fondness and gift for engineering. Coming from a working class family, Williams takes pride in her intelligence, striving to surpass the likes of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Hank Pym and Tony Stark; the latter being a source of inspiration for her work alongside her stepfather Gary.\n\nAfter witnessing the deaths of her stepfather and Natalie Washington, her best friend, Riri developed a fear of her loved ones being harmed, and a deep-seated need to protect them. She never fully processed her grief, throwing herself into her work and becoming isolated from the very people she wants to protect.",
