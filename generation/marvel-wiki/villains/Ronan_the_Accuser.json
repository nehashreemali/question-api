  "content": "Ronan was a radical Kree warlord and a former Accuser of the Kree Empire. A participant in the Kree-Skrull War, Ronan worked with Yon-Rogg and the Starforce after the Ambush in Torfa to wipe out the last of the Skrull refugees. Ronan and the Accusers were then called to drop warheads on Earth to wipe out the remaining Skrull opposition there, but were repelled when Captain Marvel came to Earth's defense. The Accusers retreated, with Ronan promising retribution.\n\nFurther disgusted by an armistice made between the Kree and Nova Empires to end the Kree-Nova War, Ronan initiated a new campaign to eradicate the Xandarians by forging an alliance with Thanos, offering the Orb in exchange for the destruction of Xandar. After a long search, Ronan acquired the Orb, but after realizing it had housed the Power Stone, he instead betrayed Thanos and chose to take the Orb's power for himself. Using his new-found power, he and his forces attacked Xandar, only to be defeated and killed by the Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nRonan was born centuries ago on the planet Hala, the ancestral homeworld of the Kree into an Imperial family which generations had fought and died in the thousand year Kree-Nova War between the Kree and Xandarians.[3] During the war, Ronan lost his father, his grandfather and his great-grandfather.[1] This led him to develop a strong feeling of hate and repulsion for Xandar and its culture.[4]\n\nBy the Kree-Skrull War, Ronan had joined the Accusers, becoming the lead Accuser in charge of the Accuser Warships fleet.[5] In 1995, using several warships, Ronan and his Accusers dropped warheads onto Torfa to eliminate the Skrulls and clear the way for the Starforce so they could rescue Soh-Larr. However, it turned out that the Skrulls had ambushed the Starforce in an attempt to capture Vers. Following her abduction, Ronan contacted Yon-Rogg and blamed the Starforce for the failure of the mission.\n\nYon-Rogg later called Ronan after Vers had discovered that the Kree, were the aggressors in the Kree-Skrull War the whole time and not the Skrulls. Yon-Rogg ordered Ronan and the Accusers to come above Earth and drop Kree Ballistic Missiles in order to eliminate Talos and the remaining Skrulls under the orders of the Supreme Intelligence. Ronan arrived in the midst of the battle and ordered the Accusers to drop the warheads onto the planet.\n\nHowever, once the Accusers dropped the warheads, Ronan was astonished to see them being destroyed by Captain Marvel. As she approached their ships, Ronan ordered for Captain Marvel to be taken down, but seeing how she easily dispatched the fleet and single-handedly destroyed a warship, Ronan admitted imminent defeat and decided to retreat. However, along with a fellow Accuser, he vowed that they would soon return to get her back and use her as a weapon.[6]\n\nAfter failing to win the Kree-Skrull War, Ronan eventually lost his high standing with the Kree Empire when the Accusers were demobilized. However, he continued going by his former title.[6][1]\n\nYears later, the Kree Empire and the Nova Empire had signed a peace treaty to end the war, which Ronan found disgusting and unacceptable. Desperate to annihilate Xandar and it people, Ronan defected from the Accusers and put together his own army, including Korath the Pursuer of the Starforce, the Sakaarans and a sect of the Exolon Monks. The Kree Empire denounced Ronan and his agenda, branding him as a rogue terrorist, but failed to stop his conflict against the Nova Empire.[1]\n\nSeeking the power that could help him achieve his goals, Ronan made an alliance with Thanos, promising to work for him in exchange for his eventual help in the destruction of Xandar. Ronan was ordered by Thanos to lead an attack on a planet, which resulted in half of the native population being slaughtered. Ronan would personally kill Ovette and her daughter, Kamaria, finding their dying screams to be \"pitiful,\" which prompted Drax to vow revenge on him and Thanos.[1]\n\nRonan's most important mission was to find the Orb, as Thanos made it clear that Xandar will be destroyed only after he brings the artifact to him. Ronan and his subordinates succeeded and discovered the Orb on Morag, which he informed Thanos about. Thanos dispatched Gamora and Nebula to the Dark Aster to make sure Ronan succeeded in procuring the Orb, threatening him with death in case he refuseed.[7] Ronan then sent Korath the Pursuer and a small unit of Sakaarans to Morag to retrieve it from the Temple Vault.[1]\n\nOn the Dark Aster, Ronan was awoken from his nap in Celestial blood[8] and dressed in his armor by the Exolon Monks before he began a ritualistic killing of a captured member of the Nova Corps. When the Corpsman insisted that he would never be able to rule Xandar, Ronan told the Corpsman that he intended to cure Xandar before crushing his head with his Universal Weapon. As Ronan watched the Corpsman's blood draining away, Nebula informed him that Korath the Pursuer had returned from Morag.\n\nKorath informed Ronan that the Orb had been taken from him by Star-Lord; Korath explained that his sources had learned that Star-Lord intended to sell the Orb to the Broker on Xandar. Ronan, unwilling to be denied his chance for vengeance and desire not to incur the furious wrath of Thanos, made his decision and ordered Nebula to travel to Xandar and retrieve the Orb from Star-Lord, by any means necessary.\n\nGamora, however, insisted that she should be the one to go as she knew Xandar and Nebula would likely get herself killed. Ronan agreed and sent Gamora to Xandar, telling her not to fail in her mission. Ronan, however, was unaware that Gamora had decided to leave her life as a killer and planned on betraying him and Thanos by selling the orb to a third party: the Collector, using the money to escape from her family and her life of killing.\n\nSoon, Ronan was informed that Gamora had been captured during her mission and incarcerated in the Kyln. When Thanos learned about Gamora's betrayal, he summoned Ronan and Nebula to the Sanctuary to discuss the recent events. Although Ronan still insisted that Gamora was likely simply captured and was still planning on delivering the Orb to them, Other informed him that Thanos had sources inside the Kyln who confirmed Gamora's betrayal and demanded that he could speak to him immediately in person.[1]\n\nOnce they arrived at the Sanctuary, Other spoke for Thanos, accusing Ronan of being the cause of Gamora's betrayal and demanded Ronan show Thanos respect. However, Ronan insisted that Thanos was to blame for everything that had gone wrong. When the Other's taunts began to annoy him, Ronan killed him by breaking his neck with his Universal Weapon, demanding that Thanos face him and take the situation more seriously.\n\nThanos was unaffected by his servant's death; however, he mocked and threatened Ronan, claiming that his politics bored him and his entire demeanor was pathetic. Once Ronan was unable to speak out of fear, Thanos insisted that he would still honor their agreement to destroy Xandar, but if he failed him again, then he would bathe the starways in his blood. Nebula then confirmed that Ronan would never win a war against Thanos.[1]\n\nThanos ordered Ronan and Nebula to raid the Kyln in order to locate the missing Orb and capture Gamora. By the time they arrived with their army of Sakaarans, Gamora had already escaped from the prison with their prize along with her new allies as she continued her quest to sell the Orb to the Collector and escape her life of violence and death that Ronan had forced upon her.\n\nFurious that he was once again failing in his quest to locate the Orb for Thanos, Ronan ordered Nebula to capture and torture the guards in an attempt to learn Gamora's location but found the guard did not know. Realizing that the Nova Corps was coming to retake the prison and that none of the staff had any information, Ronan ordered Nebula and their Sakaaran soldiers to cleanse the prison and have everybody inside executed to keep them silent.[1]\n\nRonan and his subordinates worked to track Gamora and her allies, while Nebula asked if Ronan ever wondered why Thanos wanted the Orb, but Ronan simply said it was not his place. Drax the Destroyer, who desired revenge for Ronan killing his wife and daughter, sent a transmission to Ronan, challenging him to go to Knowhere and face death. Nebula explained that Drax was the prisoner who escaped the Kyln along with Gamora and her associates, so Ronan concluded that the Orb was on Knowhere,[9] leading an attack on the planet. When Gamora attempted to flee, Ronan turned to pursue only to be confronted and attacked by the furious Drax and so had Nebula pursue her instead while he stayed behind.\n\nDrax launched numerous ferocious attacks upon Ronan, but Ronan was easily able to evade Drax's attacks, as his furious rage made him predictable and foolish. As Drax continued to attack his foe, Ronan overpowered him several times while landing several powerful strikes of his own and soon disarmed him of his knives. To prove a point, Ronan even allowed Drax to repeatedly punch him in the stomach to no effect, only watching while Drax's furious rage continued to grow.\n\nEventually, Ronan beat Drax half to death and slammed his body onto the ground, claiming that he could not recall slaughtering his family and would unlikely ever remember killing him either. With Drax the so-called Destroyer defeated and unable to defend himself, Ronan left him to drown in a vat of spinal fluid. Nebula then called Ronan, having retrieved the Orb and, with this information, Ronan returned to the Dark Aster to claim his victory.[1]\n\nWith the Orb now in his possession, Ronan returned to the Dark Aster and contacted Thanos to report his success. However, when Thanos demanded that Ronan bring him the Orb immediately, Ronan told him that he had reconsidered their deal now he was aware that the Orb contained one of the Infinity Stones and questioned his need for Thanos' assistance in his quest for revenge.\n\nNebula handed the Orb over to Ronan who, ignoring the demands of Thanos and Korath the Pursuer's fears, ripped it apart in order to reveal the powerful stone within. Unafraid of its power, Ronan ripped the Power Stone from the Orb and consumed its energy, causing explosions all around him before he embedded it in the Universal Weapon in order to control its force, becoming more powerful than even Thanos himself, who watched in silence at the betrayal.\n\nAs a result, Ronan decided that he no longer needed Thanos' help in invading Xandar and so severed ties with the Titan. Ronan then roared at his former master that, for his insults and mockery, after he ensured that Xandar was destroyed in the name of the Kree Empire, he would be coming to destroy him next. Nebula, having resented Thanos' treatment of her over the years, joined Ronan and vowed to help him destroy a thousand planets if he destroyed her monstrous adoptive father, starting with Xandar.[1]\n\nAs they approached Xandar ready to begin the destruction of the planet, the Dark Aster was confronted by the Guardians of the Galaxy along with the Yondu Ravager Clan, led by Yondu Udonta. Still confident in his power, Ronan remained calm and watched as the Eclector fired a wall of flame at the ship before attempting to breach the side, with Nebula sending out their own fleet of Necrocraft to battle them above the skies of Xandar while Ronan looked on, remaining confident even when the Nova Corps arrived to assist the Ravagers in the battle, forming a blockade around the Dark Aster to stop its movement.\n\nRonan ordered that the Dark Aster continue pushing forward while his Sakaarans battle the attacks in the sky and when the battleship was boarded by the Guardians after Kraglin Obfonteri had breached the side of the ship, Ronan sent Nebula to kill them as he believed their only focus should be to reach the planet's surface so he could destroy it. The Nova Corps stalled the ship's approach on Xandar while Rocket and the Ravagers protected the civilians.\n\nUnfazed by his enemies' attack and filled with more power than all of them combined, Ronan responded by standing before the fleet of Nova Corps ships and accusing them before sentencing them to destruction. Ronan then used the Stone's power to fire a powerful blast from the Universal Weapon which destroyed the Nova Corps' entire fleet, as the burning remains of the army flew to the ground below and Ronan looked at the destruction with a sense of satisfaction as he saw the pain he was causing to his enemies.\n\nWhile continuing to watch the battle unfold, Ronan found himself confronted by Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, and Groot after they had defeated Nebula and Korath the Pursuer during their hunt for him. The Guardians subdued his bodyguards and shot Ronan in the chest with the Hadron Enforcer, causing a small explosion. However, Ronan was barely affected by the blast and was merely knocked off his feet. Ronan then easily overpowered the group with a single shockwave blast from his hammer.\n\nDrax the Destroyer attempted to fight Ronan once again on his own, but Ronan simply grabbed his throat and began to choke him as he lifted him off the ground while mocking him about his dead family, claiming that he recalled their screams which he viewed as pitiful. However, before Ronan could finally destroy the team, Rocket crashed his ship into the Dark Aster, knocking over Ronan, heavily damaging the ship, and sending it plummeting to the ground.[1]\n\nThe Dark Aster crashed to the surface of Xandar, as Groot sacrificed his life to save his teammates from the explosion. However, Ronan was unharmed as he walked calmly out of his ship's wreckage, to the horror of the citizens looking on. Rocket furiously attempted to attack him in revenge for killing his dear friend Groot, but Ronan easily used an energy blast to shoot him away.\n\nSmiling to himself at the desperate and pathetic attempts to stop him that had been proved to be worthless, Ronan mocked the Guardians of the Galaxy and prepared to unleash the Stone's power to annihilate Xandar. However, before he could unleash the stone's power, he became distracted by Star-Lord, who had challenged him to a dance-off. Genuinely confused by this turn of events, the distraction allowed Rocket enough time to repair the Hadron Enforcer allowing Drax the Destroyer to fire it at him, destroying Ronan's Universal Weapon, disarming him and leaving the Power Stone hovering in the air before him.\n\nIn a desperate move to gain the advantage in the battle and kill each other, both Ronan and Quill attempted to catch the Stone during the split second it hung unprotected in the air before them. Despite Ronan's best efforts to regain the powerful weapon and complete his plan, however, Quill was a moment faster and quickly caught the Stone while Gamora called out in horror, as she was aware of what the Stone's power would do to a mortal human like Quill.[1]\n\nThe moment the Power Stone was touched by Peter Quill's hand, it unleashed a massive amount of energy, causing a shock-wave which threw Ronan backwards as flames engulfed their group. As Ronan watched on with a sense of delight, the Stone's incredible and near uncontrollable power almost killed Quill as his body was slowly ripped apart from the inside by the Power Stone. Ronan then laughed as he watched Quill screaming in horrific pain, believing that once Quill was dead, he could then reclaim the Power Stone.\n\nHowever, Ronan witnessed Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, and Rocket join hands as a team and grab Quill's hand, helping with the burden of the Stone's power and gaining complete control over it. Ronan looked on in horror and demanded to know how that was possible for a human to survive such power, and Quill informed him it was because together they were a team, they were able to control it. Ronan furiously attempted to attack them with his ruined Universal Weapon's handle, but they directed the Stone's energy at Ronan, painfully destroying his body and killing him for good.[1]\n\nNews of Ronan's demise quickly reached Hala and incurred great outrage amongst the \"purist\" denizens of the Kree Empire, who marked the Guardians of the Galaxy as heretics and enemies of the Kree people.[10] When Ego heard the news of the Battle of Xandar, planning to recruit his son to aid him on his plot to assimilate the universe, he built a memorial statue of the Guardians with a defeated Ronan at Quill's feet, even though Gamora noted that the statue did not show how the battle actually happened.[11] Ronan's death at the hands of the Guardians of the Galaxy was one of the many factors that contributed to Thanos' plan to obtain the Infinity Stones.\n\nFour years after his death, Thanos ironically fulfilled Ronan's desire to completely destroy the Nova Empire when he invaded Xandar, killing all of the Nova Corps and slaughtering half the population in the process before retrieving the Orb.[12]\n\nRonan was a proud and passionate crusader who fiercely upheld ancient Kree teachings and thought that everyone in the galaxy should be judged by them, holding Kree culture to be superior. While he once fought for them and against the Skrulls, Ronan had expressed contempt even towards his fellow Kree who signed the peace treaty with Xandar. He believed his power and self-righteousness gave him the authority to punish those he deemed unwilling or incapable of following his severe moral code, although he was pragmatic enough to form an alliance with Thanos to destroy Xandar.\n\nPrior to the signing of the Xandarian-Kree treaty, Ronan was much more composed and calm. He seemed to know his limits, as he retreated from the awesome onslaught of Captain Marvel despite later challenging Thanos, demonstrating that he wasn't an individual who disposed of his own men uselessly yet promising to return. However, once the peace treaty was signed this drastically changed to the point where became a fanatical zealot determined to burn Xandar and its people to the ground. Since the war with Xandar killed his ancestors, Ronan not only opposed peace with Xandar but decided to carry out his retribution on the entire present generation of Xandarians, regardless of their complicity in the war or lack thereof. Ronan saw his warped views as justice, but they ultimately amounted to a form of might makes right. Such a mindset allowed him to kill hundreds of innocent lives, including the inhabitants of the Kyln, if he felt that they would get in the way of his overall plans for justice. Even so, he had enough sense to recognize Thanos' cruelty and betrayed him, although much as this stemmed from his personal insults.\n\nDespite claiming that he engaged in his conflict with Xandar for the honor of the Kree Empire and saw no wrong on his actions because he just obeyed the ancient laws of his people, Ronan took great personal delight in the pain and suffering he inflicted upon his victims. Drax the Destroyer recalled hearing Ronan laugh as he slaughtered his wife and daughter and when he confronted Ronan over this, he only mocked him further and claimed to not recall their deaths. When Star-Lord screamed in agony as he was torn apart by the Power Stone, Ronan looked on and laughed at his enemy's suffering without an ounce of pity. Ronan was also willing to punish his allies with death if they didn't follow his commands, such as when he asked for Nebula and Gamora to be dispatched to his ship despite his dislike of being observed by them, as like Thanos noted, his obsession to destroy the Xandarians was clouding his judgment.",
