  "content": "Mayor Wilson Grant Fisk is a powerful businessman and crime lord with a controlling interest in New York City. Decades after he murdered his abusive father when he was a child, Fisk formed alliances with other criminal enterprises and used the aftermath of the Battle of New York to gain power in the city, as he attempted to rebuild Hell's Kitchen by destroying and gentrifying it. His criminal activities brought him into conflict with Daredevil, as well as some of his partners who betrayed him, and he was arrested after his actions were leaked to the FBI. Within Rikers Island, Fisk came to run the prison and sought to destroy his crime competition in New York by the time he was freed. Fisk aided with Punisher's escape, as he desired for him to eliminate competing criminal empires, and embraced the moniker of Kingpin, putting him back in conflict with Nelson and Murdock, who sought to keep him imprisoned.\n\nIn 2017, Fisk initiated a plan to be released from prison and exploit the FBI by selling out criminals in New York City in exchange for being held at the Presidential Hotel, where Fisk could continue all of his criminal activities. From his new position of strength, Fisk began to blackmail and to manipulate several FBI agents, including Benjamin Poindexter, to aid him with framing Daredevil as a terrorist; in addition, Fisk also ensured that his name was cleared within the eyes of the law so that Vanessa Marianna could return to the city. However, Fisk's schemes were thwarted by a posthumous testimony from Ray Nadeem, while Poindexter learned about Fisk's manipulation of him. Daredevil then defeated Fisk, resulting in Fisk's return into prison.\n\nIn 2018, Fisk survived Thanos' Snap and by 2021 was acquitted of his charges and released from prison in the aftermath of the FBI conspiracy scandal. He then assumed command of the Tracksuit Mafia, having used Ronin to massacre their leadership, including William Lopez. By 2024, Fisk strived to regain his total control over New York, although these plans were impeded by Hawkeye and Kate Bishop, while he was also betrayed by Eleanor Bishop. At this time, Maya Lopez discovered Fisk's role in her father's death, and shot Fisk in his left eye. Fisk survived the gunshot and months later attempted to reconnect with Maya, but was rejected. Displeased by this choice, Fisk had planned to kill Maya's family, although Maya awakened her powers and made Fisk relive his childhood trauma. Distraught by the experience, Fisk abandoned Maya and returned to New York and joined the mayoral race.\n\nAs Fisk's mayoral run began, he reunited with Vanessa, knowing that he needed her to stop their criminal activities, while also kidnapping the man whom his wife had been having an affair with. Once elected mayor, Fisk struggled to hide his criminal history from the elites of New York, while also attempting to quietly increase his wealth by expanding Red Hook Pier, a free port where crime could be committed without consequence. Knowing he would be challenged, Fisk founded the Anti-Vigilante Task Force in order to prevent vigilantes from foiling his plans again. Fisk repaired his marriage with Vanessa and successfully gained control over the city using his Task Force. Upon killing NYPD Commissioner Phil Gallo, Fisk enacted martial law and put New York City on shutdown to consolidate his power as the city's ruler.\n\nWilson Fisk was born in New York City during the 1960s, to a caring mother and an ambitious but cruel father. Fisk remained fairly immature, never staying up past midnight, catching the subway on his own or going anywhere outside New York.[12] From that young age, Fisk was taught an abusive form of respect, where his own father demanded his respect but abused his mother for stepping out of line in his view, which deeply traumatized him.[13] Fisk constantly had this strong view of his father, always seeing him as the prime figurehead of their family, in spite of his mother still trying to maintain their financial situation and his father's dealings with Don Rigoletto in an attempt to make ends meet.[4] Fisk tried reading a Bible and read about the Parable of the Good Samaritan, which stuck with him for years as he imagined himself as the Samaritan.[14]\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Fisk's father Bill Fisk had run for the New York City Council, believing it would make him and his family rich having seen this happen for other people around them in New York City. Wilson, at the age of twelve, was tasked with helping out his father with putting signs together to promote his campaign while his mother dealt with the finance. One day while making signs, Fisk's father allowed him to take a drink of whiskey to prove he was a man, but when Fisk choked he was mocked by his father who laughed in his face.\n\nDespite the work that their family put in, the campaign was soon a complete failure, with Bill Fisk losing out to his rival and coming out feeling both angry and humiliated as well as looking for someone to take out this anger upon. Wilson had soon became ridiculed by his neighbor Bernie Walker, who began kicking down all of the signs for Fisk's campaign before hitting Fisk in the jaw for fighting back and attempting to defend his father's work during his political campaign. The upset Fisk quickly returned to his home where his mother cared for his cut lip and gave him food to make him feel better.\n\nWhen his father found out about this assault, he then took the young Wilson to confront Walker in person. Fisk watched closely as his own father cornered and confronted the overconfident Walker until he became angry. Bill Fisk then assaulted Walker and managed to beat him to the ground by hitting him repeatedly with a baseball bat. Fisk was then ordered by his father to kick the defenseless Walker repeatedly, telling him that he had to prove that he was a man and willing to fight back. Fisk did as he was instructed and assaulted Walker repeatedly, as his father ordered him to continue kicking Walker.[4]\n\nHaving lost his campaign, Bill Fisk's drinking habit got more out of hand as the pressure of owing money to local mobsters, including Don Rigoletto, got to him, and he began beating his wife, blaming her for everything that was wrong with his life. During these beatings, he would order Wilson to sit and stare at a blank wall and listen to his own mother scream in fear and pain as she was beaten repeatedly. The young Wilson remained fearful of his father, but hearing his mother's pain caused him to despise his father.\n\nDuring one of these beatings, Wilson decided to put an end to his beloved mother's suffering. He grabbed a nearby hammer and repeatedly hit his father over the head with it, killing him and crushing his skull with hit after hit. His mother comforted Fisk and promised to protect him, deciding to then cut up the body. They began dumping it in the river every night for the next week, knowing that most people who knew them would blame Rigoletto for his disappearance. As a gift, Fisk was given his father's cufflinks, which he kept and wore for years afterward to remind himself of his father's true nature.[4]\n\nIn the wake of Fisk murdering his father, his mother sent him to live on a farm with relatives.[15] Fisk later moved out of the United States and spent most of his time abroad in Asia. While living in China, he learned rudimentary Mandarin and picked up a hobby of collecting tea.[4]\n\nIn 2004,[16] Fisk returned to New York City and became a powerful criminal businessman, developing a plan to pull Hell's Kitchen apart and rebuild it.[17] By 2007, Fisk partnered himself with William Lopez and helped him with his criminal activities within the Tracksuit Mafia. During this time, Fisk also grew closer to Lopez's daughter, Maya, who studied karate at the Brooklyn Karate Academy where the Tracksuits conducted business, prompting her to begin calling him \"uncle\" affectionately.\n\nDuring Maya's karate class, Lopez asked Fisk to take his daughter home as he had to work. Agreeing, Fisk greeted Maya with a laugh as he playfully pinched her cheek.[6][11] Once the class was over, Fisk sat down with the young Maya and told her that, since her father had to work, he would take her out for ice cream, with Fisk signing the words ice cream to help her understand, for which Maya thanked him.[18]\n\nIn 2008, Fisk drove to Maya Lopez's school to pick her up, and saw her trying to buy some ice cream from a nearby vendor. The vendor did not know that she was deaf and instead tried to communicate with her in a disrespectful way, which prompted Lopez to leave and get in the car. Fisk was enraged by the way the vendor was acting with Lopez, so he told her to wait inside the car, saying that there was something he needed to do first.\n\nFisk left the car and followed the vendor down the street, before dragging him to a nearby alley. Fisk threw the vendor against a wall and before he could stand up, threw him against a dumpster. The vendor tried to plead with Fisk, but Fisk proceeded to beat him, smashing his face into a bloody pulp. Fisk then called a subordinate and requested a new jacket, not wishing Lopez to see him covered in blood.\n\nHowever, he then found out that Lopez was watching the scene unfold and tried to calm her down, telling her not to be afraid, despite his hands and clothes still being covered in the vendor's blood. To Fisk's surprise, Lopez was not afraid upon seeing her adoptive uncle's true levels of brutality and even kicked the vendor twice with her prosthetic leg while he was still down in retribution for how he treated her.\n\nFisk was impressed up seeing Lopez's true courage and ruthlessness, smiling at the new found knowledge that she was similar to him, willing to take vengeance against all those who had wronged them. No longer concerned that he would scare her, Fisk took Lopez' hand and the two of them walked back to the limo together, leaving the vendor lying in agony on the ground from the beating.[19]\n\nFisk was approached by Derek Bishop, who was in tough financial situation, so he took a loan from Fisk, although his situation hardly got any better. On May 4, 2012, Derek was among the victims of the Battle of New York, however, all his debts to Fisk remained, so he came into contact with Eleanor Bishop, Derek's wife.[10] Fisk met with Eleanor in a private place, where he offered his condolences for the loss of Derek, commenting that he thought Derek was a good man. Fisk acknowledged that Eleanor liked to get straight down to business, which he respected.\n\nFisk questioned if Eleanor found the situation unsettling, before noting that her late husband had made a mess of his debt to him, as he told her that she would now have to clean this up. Eleanor accepted this offer, but made sure to insist that she did not want to work for Fisk's organization forever. In response, Fisk promised that it would not be forever, but that it would be until her debt was done, which could take years.[20]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of New York, Fisk lost a lot of his connection and money, which put him in a desperate situation to gather up his power again and to maintain his dignity.[21] Eventually, Fisk saw an opportunity to proceed with his plans to rebuild Hell's Kitchen, as it had been damaged during the Chitauri Invasion. He founded the Union Allied Construction that would oversee a large part of the government contracts while using the company as the façade for the illicit activities and money laundering operations.[22] He also hired James Wesley as his personal assistant who helped him with carrying out his criminal plans. Over the years of working together, the two developed a strong friendship, with Fisk eventually treated him like his own son.[23]\n\nBy 2014, he had taken full control over Don Rigoletto's criminal activities. He had recruited Leland Owlsley, the Russian Mafia, Nobu Yoshioka as well as Madame Gao into his organization.[22] Fisk began making connections all across New York City, as he built a relationship with the Stokes Crime Family in Harlem, who ran the gun running businesses across the city.[24] He also developed a rivalry with various criminal organizations across the city, including the Kitchen Irish. However, some members, such as George, chose to side with Fisk.[25] In order to maintain his desired privacy, Fisk instructed all of his employees to only refer to him as their employer, and never to speak his name out loud.\n\nFisk's operations were under the risk of being jeopardized when Karen Page accidentally discovered the evidence of the criminal schemes, happening within the Union Allied. When Page tried to share the information with Daniel Fisher, Fisk and Wesley hired Rance who killed Fisher and framed Page, leaving her with the bloody knife that he had used and with no idea of what had happened. Once Page was locked at the 15th Precinct Police Station, Fisk ordered Christian Blake and Carl Hoffman to keep her in custody, and had Wesley to coerce Clyde Farnum into assassinating Page in her cell, but Farnum failed in his attempt.\n\nWhen Nelson and Murdock got Page out of custody, Fisk and Wesley sent Rance to finish her and retrieve the incriminating files she saved. However, Rance was stopped by the Masked Man who was disrupting Fisk's operations for a while. The vigilante provided the New York Bulletin with the evidence and Ben Urich wrote an article about the corruption within the Union Allied. In order to resolve the situation, Fisk ordered Wesley to cover all tracks by eliminating anyone who could point at him, including Farnum and Rance, as well as liquidating Union Allied. Fisk decided to spare Page, since everything she knew was already revealed and had Wesley to keep tabs on Nelson and Murdock, taking interest in their small law firm.[22]\n\nFisk visited Scene Contempo Gallery as he stared at a white painting, one which resembled the white wall that his father would force him to stare at as a child. While he had silently stared into the painting, Fisk was approached by Vanessa Marianna, one of the gallery's art dealers and the pair discussed the painting and what the meaning behind it was. When Marianna asked him how the painting made him feel, Fisk simply told her it made him feel alone.[1] Fisk then agreed to purchase the painting and hung it in his Penthouse bedroom.\n\nFisk continued to think of Marianna and built up the courage to ask her out on a date. While outside the gallery in his limo, Fisk was briefly updated by James Wesley about their plans to buy out Veles Taxi, with Wesley noting that Anatoly Ranskahov seemed more open to the idea than his brother. They then briefly discussed the Man in the mask, who had been causing them issues, and Fisk promised to find a way to kill him. As he prepared to step outside, Fisk ordered Wesley to stay with the car so he could deal with this alone as it was a more personal matter.\n\nFisk returned alone to the Scene Contempo Gallery and soon found Vanessa Marianna, who was still working. They discussed what Fisk had done with the painting she had sold him, with Fisk explaining that it was up in his Penthouse bedroom so that it would be the last thing he saw every night and the first thing he saw in the morning. Fisk built up the courage to ask her to join him for dinner. Marianna told him that she was working all night but implored him to continue trying to convince her. Despite his shyness, Marianna happily agreed to join him for the dinner, provided that it was Italian food. She and Fisk then properly introduced themselves to each other.[15]\n\nWhile enjoying their dinner together, the pair discussed their past. At one point, Vanessa Marianna mentioned Fisk's cufflinks, which he would often touch while speaking; Fisk told her that they had previously belonged to his father's and he wore them to remember him. When Marianna noted that she had never known of this restaurant, this led to a discussion about the future of New York City's development, with Fisk explaining his own youth in the city before his mother had sent him away. Fisk went on to claim that the city was a part of him, and he now wanted to make it a better place.\n\nAs the dinner wore on, the pair enjoyed each other's company more and more as Fisk recommended the Zuppa Inglese for Marianna to enjoy, which she accepted. However, as Fisk was being asked what sort of person he was to which he claimed to be just a man, they were suddenly interrupted when Anatoly Ranskahov charged into the restaurant, saying that he and his brother had accepted Fisk's offer to take over Russian Mafia. Desperate for Marianna not to learn of all his own criminal undertakings, Fisk then told her to leave with him and ordered James Wesley to put Ranskahov into the car.\n\nFisk walked Marianna back home and apologized for the interruption. Fisk asked if he would ever see her again. Marianna told Fisk that she usually does not date her customers, but she made an exception for him, not because of his money but because she felt that there was something different about him, which she now regretted. Fisk tried to apologize for the failure of the evening and asked if she had enjoyed her time with him; she told him that she did not know how she felt and went inside her apartment, leaving Fisk standing there heartbroken and alone before walking away in silence.[15]\n\nFurious to have been embarrassed, Fisk traveled to James Wesley's location and called him to ensure that he could ambush his target correctly. Fisk proceeded to drag Anatoly Ranskahov from the car and throw him into the mud. Fisk continued to brutally beat Ranskahov in revenge for the embarrassment with Vanessa Marianna, eventually putting his head between the car door and hitting it repeatedly in a psychotic rage until Ranskahov's head was completely crushed and decapitated.\n\nAs Fisk stepped away from the corpse of his victim, Wesley handed him a handkerchief which he used to wipe the blood from his face. Looking down Fisk noticed that his suit had been damaged in the fight when Ranskahov had tried to fight back with a knife, so he told Wesley to contact Melvin Potter at his workshop for a new one. As Wesley questioned what to do with Ranskahov's corpse, Fisk told him to send it to Vladimir Ranskahov. When Wesley mentioned that this killing would start a war with the Russian Mafia who would seek their revenge, Fisk told him that he was now counting on that.[15]\n\nWhile his car was being cleaned of all Anatoly Ranskahov's blood and brains, Fisk and James Wesley had a meeting with the remaining members of his organization, with Fisk apologizing for being absent for so long. Fisk explained to the group that the Russian Mafia was no longer a part of their organization since he had just removed his head with his own car door, and as a direct response to this, Vladimir Ranskahov would be seeking revenge. The group all showed horror and anger at the news, demanding to know why they were not consulted on the matter before this action was taken.\n\nWith everyone furious at Fisk, Madame Gao asked what this meant in the movement of her Steel Serpent heroin without the Ranskahovs; however, Fisk told her to continue dealing with the Veles Taxi operation until he could completely take over their distribution from them, promising that he would split the profits between them all. Despite Leland Owlsley strongly questioning the arrangement, the group begrudgingly accepted the proposal. Nobu Yoshioka told Fisk on his way not to forget the promises he had made to him and all his known superiors in the Hand whom he represented.\n\nAs the group left, with Owlsley complaining that with the Russian Mafia's rebellion and the Masked Man running around, he felt the need to get his stun gun back out from storage before driving away out of the garage with Yoshioka following closely behind him. Left alone, Fisk then approached Gao and offered her his arm as he walked her back to her car. Gao, however, believed he still wanted something from her, to which Fisk then insisted that he only wanted to put this situation behind them all as quickly as possible. She only smiled at this as they walked back to her car arm in arm.[17]\n\nFisk invited Vanessa Marianna for a second dinner to make up for the disastrous first; beforehand, Fisk spoke to James Wesley about their recent events involving Piotr who attempted to rat out Fisk to the New York City Police Department an encounter with the Man in the Mask, but had been murdered by Christian Blake and Carl Hoffman who were busy ensuring that the rest of the NYPD did not learn of the connection between Russian Mafia and Fisk. As Fisk had prepared to leave, Wesley recommended a wine for Fisk to order inside the restaurant for his date with Marianna.\n\nWhile Fisk sat alone and overlooked New York City, he waited, hoping that Marianna would give him a second chance. Eventually, Marianna did show up and was brought to Fisk by Marcel, although she still admitted that she had considered not coming at all, although she was impressed that Fisk had hired the entire restaurant to ensure they were not disturbed. Fisk assured her that, however, she wished the evening to go would be the way it would happen. He admitted that although he was a shy man who did not like being questioned or being in public; he would always be honest with Marianna.\n\nThe pair sat down for dinner and spoke about their own lives, with Marianna telling Fisk of a prince she had once been seduced by as she worked at the Scene Contempo Gallery, which clearly made Fisk uncomfortable to discuss. They briefly talked about why a man like Fisk felt alone, which Fisk blamed on the nature of his own business, which he claimed was rebuilding Hell's Kitchen. Fisk asked Marianna what was the model of the gun in her purse, asking her if she felt she would have needed it, with Marianna claiming that by not confessing what he really did he was then insulting her intelligence.\n\nMarianna made it clear she knew he was involved in some criminal activities, so to win back her trust in him Fisk told her that he planned to change the city for the better with force, believing that it would not happen on its own. Fisk confessed to having hurt people and even admitted that he would hurt more soon, although he insisted that he took no pleasure in being cruel like his father had been. Fisk told her that the city needed to die, so it could finally be reborn into something better. Marianna then gave Fisk her gun, knowing that she was safe next to him as Fisk put the gun into his jacket.\n\nDuring their dinner, Fisk's men detonated bombs in the warehouses of the Russians, killing most of them in the multiple blasts to ensure that Vladimir Ranskahov would fail in his attempt to destroy Fisk's organization to avenge Anatoly Ranskahov. As the city burned and the police sirens could be heard, Fisk and Marianna watched the fires from the window. To reassure her, Fisk told Marianna about the boy who had been kidnapped and rescued by the man in the mask, telling her that the kidnappers were now burning in the flames. On the way out, Fisk tipped Marcel and thanked him for the evening.[17]\n\nAfter his date, Fisk joined James Wesley into their limousine; Wesley had received a call informing him that, although the Russian Mafia's strongholds had been destroyed, Vladimir Ranskahov had escaped with the help of the Masked Man. Fisk became nervous, knowing that Madame Gao would be disappointed that the situation had not yet been resolved, as he had promised it would. Fisk was later informed by Christian Blake that the Masked Man had seemingly taken Sullivan hostage into an Abandoned Warehouse with Ranskahov.\n\nFisk ordered Blake to take down the man but was told this was more complicated since Ben Urich, who was now also on the scene, could expose the schemes. Fisk had ordered Urich to be shot in front of the city's media. Fisk was given a police radio and used it to contact the man in black after Blake and Carl Hoffman had ensured that all other officers had changed channels. The man took the radio and the pair began speaking; Fisk told him they had a lot in common but the man simply insisted that they were nothing alike, and vowed that one day he would bring both him and his entire criminal empire to justice.\n\nFisk told the man that his part in their drama would end that night, as the man would be blamed for the Bombing of Hell's Kitchen. Fisk offered him the chance to kill Ranskahov and go free, noting all of the crimes Ranskahov was guilty of. Fisk had then claimed he respected the man's convictions, but he would ensure that their city would turn on him; Fisk then ordered his men to shoot Urich and release footage of that man attacking police officers. Fisk had then told the man they would not speak again and hung up. He later learned that Ranskahov had been killed in the firefight, and the Masked Man escaped.[26]\n\nThroughout his sleep inside his Penthouse, Fisk often found himself being haunted by nightmares of the night of his father's murder. Once awake and sitting on his bed in a cold sweat, Fisk would stare at the Rabbit in a Snowstorm he had bought from Vanessa Marianna at the Scene Contempo Gallery. Ignoring the visions, Fisk instead chose to focus on his work while also continuing to adhere with his own strict daily routine.\n\nOnce he had gotten out of bed, Fisk would then immediately begin his daily routine, starting by making himself the same breakfast which he made every morning, eating it alone while overlooking his view of the New York City skyline. Once he had eaten, Fisk then began putting on a similar black suit with his father's cufflinks. Often as he would look in the mirror, he would see his reflection as his younger self, covered in his dead father's blood and wielding the hammer Fisk killed him with. Staring at this vision in his reflection, Fisk chose to ignore the horrific image and instead shut off the light before leaving his Penthouse to return to his work.\n\nArriving at the Pier 81 Warehouse, both Fisk and James Wesley had a private meeting with Nobu Yoshioka, who had become furious that his transportation of Black Sky had been ruined by an encounter with the Masked Man and his ally. Yoshioka insulted Fisk's own organization as he felt Fisk had not come through with his promises; Fisk, however, insisted that although the Black Sky was dead, Fisk had, in fact, fulfilled his part of their arrangement by keeping the police away. When Yoshioka suggested that they should renegotiate the terms of their arrangement, Fisk apologized for any offense.\n\nYoshioka instead threatened Fisk before storming out of the pier. Wesley told Fisk that he believed Yoshioka needed to be taught respect as he did not like the way that he had spoken to Fisk. Fearing Yoshioka's group, with whom he did not wish to go to war with, Fisk instead told Wesley to leave the situation alone. Wesley argued that the Hand did not contribute enough for their organization in the same criminal way that Leland Owlsley and also Madame Gao did, but Fisk insisted that they were a necessary evil for their organization to continue with their plans.[4]\n\nWhile inside his penthouse, Fisk spoke to Vanessa Marianna about her life as well as his life living in Asia when he was interrupted by a call from James Wesley. Apologizing to Marianna, Fisk answered Wesley who explained that Christian Blake had just awoken in the hospital after Fisk's ESU Sniper shot him. Fisk suggested they use Carl Hoffman to assassinate him as they agreed that Blake would seek revenge, therefore Fisk knew he had to kill Blake before he exposed his entire operation.\n\nFisk had a meeting with Hoffman in which he tried to convince him to kill his friend and partner. Although Hoffman was initially unwilling to betray his friend of thirty-fiveyears, Fisk was able to change his mind by pointing out Blake's mistakes, claiming Blake had been responsible for the Masked Man gaining information from Vladimir Ranskahov. Fisk began giving subtle threats when Hoffman asked how long it would be until he was also in Fisk's firing line; finally, Fisk allowed Hoffman to choose his own payment for the assassination. Hoffman chose a price and agreed to murder his own close friend for Fisk.\n\nFisk took Leland Owlsley to Melvin Potter's Workshop to be fitted with a kevlar suit in the wake of his own encounter with the Masked Man, as Fisk told him that he would keep Owsley safe with an armed guard to ensure it did not happen again. Owlsley stated that if the Masked Man dropped him off a roof then a lot of money would fall with him; Fisk asked if that was a threat but Owlsley insisted he was just stating the obvious. Once he had finished measuring Owsley for his newest suit, Melvin Potter asked if Fisk needed him for anything else, which Fisk assured him that he did not before defending Potter when Owlsley had rudely accused him of being half an idiot.\n\nThey were interrupted when James Wesley arrived in the workshop and informed them that while Blake had been successfully assassinated by Hoffman, the incident had now become even more complicated as the Masked Man had gotten into the hospital and gotten information from Blake before his death. Although Owlsley was mortified by the failure, Wesley assured Fisk that Hoffman had been able to convince the New York City Police Department that the Masked Manhad assaulted him and then murdered Blake, although Owlsley made it clear he was already losing faith in Fisk.[4]\n\nThe next day, Fisk was once again awoken in the night by nightmares of his past, causing him to get up and stare long and hard at his new painting. As usual, Fisk began his morning routine by making his own breakfast and putting on his suit, only to be interrupted by James Wesley calling him on the phone. Answering, Fisk was informed that Madame Gao was currently on her way to his Penthouse to discuss recent events, so Fisk requested that Wesley arrive first.\n\nUpon her arrival, Fisk poured her tea which he had bought during his last trip to China while Wesley stood by and translated for them both. Although Gao said she approved of the tea, it was not the reason she was there. She began speaking English and told Fisk that she was aware that he did not need Wesley to translate anymore as Fisk was able to speak Chinese fluently due to all his time in Asia, much to the annoyance of Wesley. Gao questioned if Nobu Yoshioka had guessed that Fisk also spoke Japanese, but Fisk believed Yoshioka had not figured it out, much to the amusement of Gao who claimed that Fisk had been playing the fool to make them underestimate him.\n\nFisk and Gao began speaking to each other in Chinese and asked Wesley to wait outside as there was no need for him any longer. They discussed how neither Yoshioka nor Leland Owlsley were happy with Fisk's handling of the recent events and although Fisk attempted to assure her that things were now under control, Gao did not accept this, thinking back to how Fisk handled the situation involving the deaths of both Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov and how that had so negatively affected the organization moving onward, something that Fisk had struggled to defend as a poor emotional decision.\n\nGao went on and then called Fisk sloppy and emotional since he had first met Vanessa Marianna, pointing out that she had been able to locate his Penthouse, something he had tried to keep secret, due to his recent lack of preparation. Ignoring Fisk's attempts to defend all of his actions, Gao got to her feet and said if he did not restore his business to order, she would cut him out of their organization and deal with Yoshioka and Owlsley directly. After she left his home, Fisk threw the dining room table over in a furious burst of anger and then aggressively ordered Wesley to immediately leave his home.[4]\n\nFisk remained in the same spot in his Penthouse and looked out over the New York City skyline for hours. When James Wesley returned, Fisk ordered him to leave, claiming that if he needed him he would have asked, which Wesley disagreed with. Wesley, however, revealed he had brought Vanessa Marianna with him and left them alone. Fisk, still emotional, asked Marianna to leave; she instead commented on how Wesley was worried about him, but Fisk insisted he should not be, leading to Marianna asking him to tell her the truth.\n\nFisk confessed that he was afraid of how Marianna would look at him if he was to tell her the truth about him, but she invited him to speak regardless. Fisk then revealed the story of how he had murdered his own father and he and his mother had covered it up by cutting up his body and dumping it in the river, blaming it on Don Rigoletto. He told her his plans for New York City and how so many people were trying to bring him down and destroy everything he was trying to achieve for the city he loved. Marianna then coldly questioned if Fisk would let them defeat him, but Fisk vowed that he would not.[4]\n\nDespite the revelation about his past, Vanessa Marianna still spent the night with Fisk in his penthouse. As usual, Fisk awoke from a nightmare in a cold sweat, but rather than stare at the painting which gave him comfort, Fisk instead moved over to Marianna and embraced her. In the morning Fisk and Marianna enjoyed breakfast together, another change in Fisk's usual morning routine which he happily welcomed.\n\nDue to Marianna's recommendation, Fisk had agreed to hold a press conference for WHiH World News in order to reveal his work to the people of New York City in order to gain support for everything that he was attempting to accomplish for the city. As Fisk went to get his usual black suits to wear, Marianna helped him pick out a new suit, and even made him choose different cufflinks rather than his usual choice of wearing his father's. Marianna continued to help him enter a new stage in his life as he looked at himself in the mirror, approving of the changes which Marianna was now making to his life.\n\nFisk then made his public statement to the people of Hell's Kitchen outside the New York State Supreme Court Building with Marianna as well as James Wesley standing close by. Fisk made it clear that he did not usually like speaking in public before he condemned the so-called vigilante justice of the Masked Man. Fisk used the recent attack on Leland Owlsley as an example of how this Masked Man was tormenting the good people of New York, calling Owlsley a close friend and a pillar within the financial community who had just been brutally attacked by the man in the mask for seemingly no reason.\n\nFisk told the people that he had attempted to do his work from the shadows in order to not endanger the lives of his friends, claiming the mask was trying to destroy the work he was doing to save his city, pointing to the Bombing of Hell's Kitchen which was being blamed on the man in the black mask. Fisk vowed that he would be stepping out of the shadows, unafraid of those trying to stop him. Fisk asked the people of Hell's Kitchen to stand together before announcing his name to the media. The speech came with support as the viewers cheered for Fisk, believing every word that he had said.[4]\n\nFisk and James Wesley discussed Fisk's new attention by the media, noting how the new donations were coming in as his approval rating continued to rise. Wesley informed Fisk that Randolph Cherryh wished to have a meeting with Fisk, to which he suggested that they reject whatever restaurant Cherryh suggested first. They discussed the hunt for Carl Hoffman, who since murdering Christian Blake had now suddenly disappeared.\n\nThey were interrupted by the arrival of Nobu Yoshioka, who stormed in and tried to break the hand of Francis, Fisk's own security guard. Although Wesley began translating for Yoshioka, he threatened that if he continued to misquote him, Yoshioka would cut out his tongue. Yoshioka revealed he was furious that Fisk had not delivered the city block that he had been promised; Fisk tried to offer another as the original was proving difficult to clear but Yoshioka insisted on getting the one he and the Hand wanted. Fisk then asked Yoshioka to assist him with finding the Masked Man and then killing him.[30]\n\nFisk arrived into the Scene Contempo Gallery to meet with Vanessa Marianna, followed closely by his personal security team. Once Fisk arrived there, he was introduced to Matt Murdock who was looking to purchase some art for his apartment. When Fisk was asked his advice on what Murdock should purchase, he had simply told him to buy whatever Marianna recommended for him to buy as the group laughed together.\n\nDespite them all sharing the laugh together, Murdock, however, then reminded Fisk that they should not be seen to be talking together as they were both currently on opposing sides of a law case. Fisk then explained to Marianna about how he had just recently bought all of the apartment properties from Armand Tully which was where Elena Cardenas was living, before he had then began to explain his plans on improving New York City but Marianna stopped him, noting that Murdock was a customer of the gallery who was just looking to buy some artworks and was not a donor for his political campaign.\n\nWhile Fisk apologized for talking about his campaign too much, both Fisk and Murdock then expressed their mutual desire to watch Hell's Kitchen reach its fullest potential, claiming this to mean a great deal to him personally. Despite seemingly agreeing with Fisk's statements, Murdock then decided to leave the art gallery, saying that he needed to consider the cost of all these artworks before purchasing them. As Murdock thanked Marianna all of her help, Fisk then watched him as he left the gallery, suspicious if Murdock had another motive in going inside their art gallery, and speaking with Marianna and himself.\n\nSeeking to speed up all his plans and appease Nobu Yoshioka, Fisk then ordered the assassination of Cardenas, one of the tenants from the building which the Hand desired, as Fisk's men provided Junkie Jake with some Steel Serpent, in exchange for him fatally stabbing Cardenas multiple times, making it appear to be a robbery that had gone wrong, resulting with Cardenas' death. In the wake of this, Fisk was approached by WHiH World News about her death and claimed that he was mourning her murder, and even called it a tragedy, while using Cardenas' death to strengthen his own political standing.[30]\n\nHaving baited the Masked Man with the sudden death of Elena Cardenas, Fisk later arrived inside the warehouse where Nobu Yoshioka had fought the Masked Man until Yoshioka's unexpected fiery death. With the Masked Man alive, but terribly wounded from attacks from Yoshioka's Kyoketsu-Shoge, Fisk confronted him with James Wesley and Francis by his side, thanking him for killing Yoshioka for him and admitted to organizing Cardenas' death to create the trap.\n\nThe Masked Man claimed he would kill Fisk, while Fisk was unafraid and dared him to try, resulting in them fighting. Fisk was able to easily overpower the Masked Man and beat him mercilessly, taking advantage of the wounds that Yoshioka had already inflicted upon the man with his Kyoketsu-shoge. At one point, the Masked Man desperately tried to cut him with one of Yoshioka's weapons, but Fisk was saved by Melvin Potter's armored suit, so Fisk responded by choking the Masked Man before slamming his body through a table, finally ending the fight in Fisk's favor as Fisk calmed himself.\n\nWith the Masked Man lying wounded on the ground and struggling to get back onto his feet, Fisk wiped the blood of his own face, while watching the man moan and crawl away. Telling the Masked Man that he was disappointed in the poor fight, Fisk then decided to end things once and for all and calmly ordered James Wesley to shoot the Masked Man, but the Masked Man was able to disarm Wesley, leaping from a window, and escaped. Fisk told Francis to tell his men to execute the Masked Man as soon as they saw him. When Wesley asked what to do about Yoshioka's body, Fisk told him to do nothing and let it burn.[30]\n\nFisk had yet another meeting with Madame Gao, this time within the open air, looking out over the New York City skyline. Gao commented on the absence of James Wesley, who was now no longer needed to translate as they both spoke to each other in Chinese. Gao told Fisk her metaphorical tale of the snake that died after mistaking an elephant for its prey, explaining that the snake was killed by its own ambitions. Fisk had asked Gao if he was the over-ambitious snake or the unkillable elephant within the metaphor which made her smile.\n\nWhen Gao expressed her disappointment at Nobu Yoshioka's death, Fisk claimed he did not expect Nobu to go against the Masked Man himself. Gao warned Fisk that the Hand were preparing for retaliation after Yoshioka's death, and she asked him if his ambition would turn to her, but Fisk assured her that she had his respect so he would not harm her. She told him his mind was distracted by his heart. She spoke in English to tell him to chose if he was the savior or oppressor of the city, before allowing Fisk to now consider her words and make a decision before someone took advantage of his weaknesses.[35]\n\nWhile preparing for a fundraiser, Fisk spoke to Leland Owlsley and informed him of Nobu Yoshioka's violent death by being burned alive during his fight against the Man in the Mask, much to the horror and disgust of Owlsley. Ignoring his dismay, Fisk then ordered Owlsley to speak to Madame Gao and assure her that everything was perfectly operational with their organization in the wake of Yoshioka's recent violent death.\n\nOwlsley claimed that saying all this would mean lying to Gao's face which Fisk did not deny. Fisk then told James Wesley to bring the car around to then go to the benefit and also prepare to collect Vanessa Marianna. When Owlsley made a comment about Fisk's relationship with Marianna and how things had gotten out of hand ever since he met her, Fisk spoke to him about what it means to be in love with somebody, comparing the love he currently had for Marianna to the love that Owlsley must have at least once had for Lee Owlsley's own mother, which made Owlsley visibly uncomfortable.\n\nOwlsley responded by telling him that Gao was right in thinking that Fisk had indeed changed, to which Fisk responded by claiming that change was inevitable for him and for New York City to continue to move forward. Owlsley agreed to speak to Gao in an attempt to keep the organization running. When Fisk thanked Owlsley for supporting him with this matter, Owlsley commented that everyone who was still alive was in this together, making reference to Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov's recent murders as well as Yoshioka's. As Owlsley left, Fisk looked out of his Penthouse window at New York.[35]\n\nFisk attended his fundraiser at the Van Lunt Building and gave his speech to all the attendants in which he noted that he had already been questioned as to why he had come out of the shadows and put forward the question of who would not want to stand up and make New York City a better place to live in, which was greatly supported as they clapped for Fisk. Once he had completed his speech, Fisk began walking through the room greeting some of the people and thanking others for all of their personal donations to his campaign.\n\nFisk and James Wesley then spoke to Leland Owlsley who assured him that the business with Madame Gao was taken care of which Fisk personally thanked him for. Owlsley then offered them a drink of champagne which Vanessa Marianna gratefully accepted while Fisk instead focused on networking at the event. Fisk was taken away to speak to Randolph Cherryh in private about the zoning plans he had pitched, leaving Marianna alone with Wesley and Owlsley as they went on to discuss Cornelius van Lunt while a bored Marianna sipped at her champagne while Owlsley continued talking.\n\nWhile he was speaking to Cherryh, Fisk suddenly noticed that many of the attendants began to collapse after drinking the champagne, including Marianna. Already too late to stop her from drinking the champagne, Fisk ran to Marianna's aid and caught her just as she collapsed into his arms and had even begun foaming at the mouth. Horrified at what he was witnessing, Fisk desperately begged her to stay with him and ordered Wesley to call for an ambulance and take her to Metro-General Hospital in order to save her life while Owlsley quietly dropped his own full glass of the champagne.[35]\n\nFisk stormed into Metro-General Hospital carrying Vanessa Marianna in his arms, seeking medical assistance from all the doctors. As the group around Fisk explained what just happened to Murray, James Wesley reassured Fisk that Rosenberg had been contacted and was on his way in a private jet while Fisk looked down at his beloved and silently begged her to make it through this ordeal. As Marianna was being taken into surgery, Fisk demanded to be allowed to stay beside her but was sent away by Schwab.\n\nFisk waited in silence for news outside the hospital doors, awaiting news on his beloved's condition, while Rosenberg and Murray treated her and tried desperately to save her life. As Fisk sat in the same spot without saying a word and ignored everything around him while awaiting news on Marianna's recovery, Wesley and Leland Owlsley watched over him and discussed Fisk's mental state under times of such incredible emotional stress. As they were speaking, Wesley was informed by Francis that three of the others who had also been poisoned had passed away from the attack.\n\nFisk continued to wait in silence until Wesley brought him a cup of coffee, which he refused. They discussed who could be responsible for the attack; Wesley told him that Leland Owlsley believed Yoshioka's group was responsible and they noted that Madame Gao could also be involved. Fisk ordered Wesley to bring him the person responsible so he could look into their eyes as he killed them; he then explained he wanted her sent away for her own protection as he felt responsible for her current condition. He then proceeded to awkwardly thank Wesley personally for his help in the matter.\n\nDoctor Rosenberg quietly stepped out of surgery while Fisk was still speaking to Wesley and informed him that Marianna had survived her operation and was currently recovering from her bed, although he did warn Fisk that there may be complications to her recovery after such intense surgery. Fisk shook Rosenberg's hand and thanked him for his work before stepping into Marianna's bedroom to await the end of her sleep so that he would be the first person whom she saw. Fisk sat beside Marianna's bed, ignoring all phone calls and kissed Marianna on the lips as she peacefully slept in her bed.\n\nWhen Fisk left the room, he spoke to Wesley, who instantly turned off his phone and asked about her condition; Fisk told him that Marianna was recovering, despite Doctor Rosenberg having expressed the possibility of further complications. Fisk asked Wesley to call his mother back and ask what she wanted as he had missed her earlier call. Leland Owlsley stormed through security and also asked how Marianna was doing, but Fisk completely ignored him and went back into the room.\n\nSitting by her bedside, Fisk spoke to the sleeping Vanessa Marianna about his family and religion; he told her about how his father was not a religious man although his mother had wanted to be. Fisk told Marianna about how he had read the bible as a child and tried to find truth and sentiment but found it to be false in his mind, therefore he could not pray for her recovery but could make her a promise which only a possible God could keep him from keeping. Fisk leaned in close to his lover and swore to her that he would make the people who tried to kill her suffer for what they had done.\n\nTaking a moment to step out of Marianna's room to request a cup of black coffee from his bodyguards, although he refused to be brought any food, Fisk asked to know what had happened to Wesley. He was informed by Francis that Wesley had departed for unknown reasons, having promised Francis that he would return eventually and had asked for no assistance from the other men. Returning to Marianna's room, Fisk attempted to call his friend on the phone, however, he received no answer. After waiting a few minutes Fisk tried again, but once again heard no answer from Wesley.[9]\n\nThe next morning, Vanessa Marianna awoke; Fisk went to collect the doctor but when he saw her confused and in distress, he decided to tell her the truth. Fisk told her what had happened and apologized for getting her hurt as he had believed whoever had organized the attack was targeting him and not her. When he told her that he was sending her away for her safety, she refused, stating that she intended to remain by his side, Fisk had then vowed to find whoever was responsible for the attack and make them suffer, which Marianna fully and happily supported.\n\nThe couple was interrupted when Francis asked for Fisk's attention. Although Fisk made it clear that he wished to stay beside his lover's bedside, Marianna ordered him to leave to deal with the situation as she simply told him she would not be leaving her bed any time soon. Stepping outside Marianna's hospital room, Fisk was then informed by Francis that James Wesley had been located. Fisk asked where his friend was but was mortified to learn that Wesley had been found dead inside of an empty warehouse, with nobody understanding why he had been in there or who had killed him and for what reason.\n\nFisk went to his location and found Wesley had been killed by being shot multiple times in the chest. When Francis revealed that Wesley had not informed him of why he was leaving, Fisk lost his temper and beat Francis mercilessly until Leland Owlsley convinced him to stop. Once he calmed down, the heartbroken Fisk had sat beside the body of his closest friend. He kissed Wesley's forehead and vowed to get revenge, although Owlsley had attempted to keep his mind focused on the endgame before starting a war. Fisk took Wesley's phone and discovered the last call he made was actually to Fisk's mother.\n\nBelieving she could get into danger, Fisk immediately decided to have his mother moved from Saint Bénézet Retirement Care to Italy. As he had her driven off, Fisk desperately tried to explain to her the reasons for having her moved but she was upset as she greatly enjoyed living there, did not speak Italian and did not know what she would watch on the television. His mother would often become highly confused by the situation due to her dementia, repeating that it was a beautiful day multiple times, as Fisk continued to hold onto her hand to keep her calm. Fisk asked her about what she had spoken to Wesley about the night before but she had still struggled to recall and repeated herself once again.[36]\n\nFisk met with Leland Owlsley to discuss what he had learned about who was responsible for the recent attacks; Owlsley claimed that he had been unable to find anything to blame on Nobu Yoshioka's men. Fisk ordered Francis to double the offer for information and keep doubling it until someone talked. He then received a call on James Wesley's phone from his contact at the New York Bulletin in which he learned that Ben Urich had had a meeting with his mother and had likely gained valuable information about his past. With this information, Fisk left the meeting immediately.\n\nFisk chose to personally confront Urich in his own apartment. When Urich arrived, having been fired from the New York Bulletin, he sat at his computer to write a blog exposing Fisk. Fisk spoke calmly to him, revealing his presence; Urich demanded that he leave but instead Fisk insisted he stay until he had spoken his peace. Fisk apologized to Urich for not taking him seriously before revealing he did indeed have someone at the Bulletin. Fisk mocked Urich's attempts to reveal the story online as he believed that the internet was filled with nothing but videos of cats and unimportant celebrity news.\n\nFisk asked Urich if he had been alone when questioning his mother; Urich remained confident, stating he was not easily intimidated. Fisk asked if Urich was responsible for Wesley's death which Urich denied, which did not surprise him. Fisk, however, told him that as he had gone after his mother, he was not here to threaten Urich but was there to kill him. Fisk then launched from his seat and attacked Urich, wrapping his massive hands around his throat. Although Urich did attempt to fight back, before long, Fisk killed Urich and left his body lying in his trashed apartment.[36]\n\nBack in his penthouse, Fisk cared for Vanessa Marianna, who was still recovering from her assassination attempt. When she asked what he was doing, he told her he was reviewing the funds to have her moved out of the country so he could move the funds back, allowing her to stay with him. Although Fisk had a good understanding of financial paperwork, he became confused at some irregularities, so he called for a meeting with Leland Owlsley to discuss them.\n\nFisk and Owlsley discussed the final stages of Fisk's plans, with Owlsley stating they would need a replacement for Madame Gao's heroin business as it had been destroyed by the Masked Man. Fisk asked about the irregularities he had discovered but Owlsley insisted that it was normal; however, when Owlsley tried to hand the papers back, Fisk noted that his hands were shaking and he was sweating. Seeing no other alternative, Owlsley confessed to trying to kill Marianna in an attempt to get Fisk's mind back on the job but denied any involvement with James Wesley's death.\n\nOwlsley then told him that their partnership was over and Fisk was to hand over half his assets to him. When Fisk questioned why, Owlsley informed him that he had Carl Hoffman, who was willing to go to the police if anything happened to Owlsley. He explained that he had more than enough money overseas for him and his son to never be seen again. Furious, Fisk refused the offer and attacked Owlsley, who defended himself with his stun gun, but Fisk was so angry, he barely felt it. Fisk disarmed Owlsley and threw him down an elevator shaft, killing him before ordering Francis to find and kill Hoffman.[14]\n\nIn the wake of Leland Owlsley's murder, Fisk then scrambled to take control of the situation as quickly as possible. He later received a call informing him that Carl Hoffman had been located in an old church where Owlsley had been hiding him before his death. Knowing that Hoffman could destroy his entire organization if he was able to go to the New York City Police Department, Fisk ordered the closest team led by Corbin to then assassinate Hoffman immediately.\n\nThe team, however, failed with their task and Hoffman was eventually rescued by the Masked Man. Hoffman then went onto the police and exposed Fisk's entire criminal operation and illegal actions with the help of Nelson and Murdock who he employed as his lawyers, directly leading to the arrests of Turk Barrett, Corbin and his fellow corrupt NYPD officers, M. Caldwell, who had been Fisk's contact at New York Bulletin, with Parish Landman, and Randolph Cherryh also then being arrested, as Cherryh still insisted on WHiH World News that they had done anything wrong.\n\nKnowing that following all the sudden developments, there was now nothing he could possibly do to stop him being arrested for all of his crimes, Fisk proposed to Vanessa Marianna just as the FBI broke into his Penthouse to arrest him on racketeering charges stemming from Fisk's skimming off the inflated Union Allied pension funds. While the FBI charged into the building, Fisk put the ring on Marianna's finger and then told her that she was his heart and everything, while he was being dragged away, leaving Marianna alone. Fisk was taken outside and put inside the back of an armored van as the paparazzi had surrounded him.\n\nInside the van, Fisk began reciting a parable from the Bible to the FBI agents inside, specifically the story of The Good Samaritan, in which a man is beaten and left in the dirt, only to be ignored and left to die by a priest and another religious man. Then a Samaritan came and helped the man, caring for his wounds while also then giving him his money. Fisk explained he had always believed he was the Samaritan in the story, but he had learned he was neither the Samaritan or the priest, but he represented the men of ill-intent who had attacked the traveler who had been on a road he should not have been on.\n\nAs Fisk finished his tale, the armored van was stopped in the middle of the road and a firefight broke out outside, while Fisk did not say another word and instead just simply sat calmly and waited for his escape plan to finally come into action. When Fisk's men succeeded in eliminating all of the police officers and FBI agents outside, the attackers banged on the door and demanded the guards to open it. One of the guards watching Fisk threatened to shoot him if they got inside, however, he was then shot by the other, who had been working for Fisk and entire time and then freed him from his handcuffs.\n\nOnce the armored van's doors had been opened, the now free Fisk calmly walked to the other van with his armed guards before ordering his men to kill anyone who attempted to follow them, whether they follow on the ground or in the air, uncaring of the lives that would be lost as long as he got his own freedom. As they all continued making their hasty escape, before long Fisk's crew arrived at his warehouse where Fisk was then moved inside the Atreus Plastics van to avoid the detection from the FBI who were currently desperately searching for him throughout all New York City for their escaped prisoner.\n\nOnce on the move, Fisk then called Vanessa Marianna, who was still waiting for his arrival with Francis guarding her as they still stood by Fisk's helicopter pad to leave New York. Fisk told Marianna to leave on the helicopter if he was not beside her in twenty minutes, fearing that he could still be found and recaptured, although she insisted that she would not go anywhere without him while they then continued to express their deep love for one another as Fisk continued his journey to her while thinking of them finally escaping from the city to begin a new peaceful life together away from all the crime and chaos.[14]\n\nHowever, before they could get to Vanessa Marianna and Fisk could finally get away before he then was recaptured by the New York City Police Department, the van was attacked and caused to crash. Fisk fell out of the van, bleeding from his head injury while dazed and confused by the crash, but before he could get back onto his feet, Fisk was then confronted by Daredevil, who told him not everyone deserves a happy ending, which confused Fisk until he soon realized this was, in fact, the Masked Man wearing a upgraded uniform.\n\nWhile Daredevil fought all Fisk's guards who began shooting at him, Fisk then desperately attempted to escape from the scene on foot only to be cornered by his enemy. With nowhere to go, Fisk roared at Daredevil, screaming as he told him how all of had wanted was to make New York City something better than it was, believing that his work to make it into something beautiful before Daredevil had then stopped his plans. Enraged by being confronted by his enemy, Fisk furiously vowed he was going to kill him in revenge for everything he had done, but Daredevil repeated what Fisk had said to him before following Nobu Yoshioka's death and told Fisk to take his shot.\n\nThe pair engaged in a fierce and aggressive fight, where Daredevil's speed and agility were equally matched against Fisk's brute strength and determination, with Daredevil flipping over Fisk and kicking him repeatedly while Fisk simply charged into him and threw him across the street. Although his new armor gave Daredevil extra protection, Fisk was still able to nearly beat him to death by lifting him in the air and slamming him down hard before beating him with a metal stick, all the while ranting about how New York City did not deserve heroes but deserved people like his father and to drown within its filth.\n\nRefusing to give up, Daredevil then managed to disarm Fisk, telling him that the city was not Fisk's to control and was in fact a city under his protection, before using his own batons to then beat him down into submission, knocking Fisk to the floor following repeated strikes to his head and chest. Despite being barely able to sit up following the beating, Fisk had still continued to mock Daredevil's attempts to make any difference with the city on his own while wearing his new costume, which Fisk had called silly, claiming that one man could not make a difference with all of the crime and corruption in the city.\n\nDaredevil just ignored the taunts and threw down his pair of batons, which Fisk then mockingly smirked at. However, with a final furiously hard punch to the face, Daredevil knocked out Fisk and he fell to the ground, finally defeated following his own desperate escape attempt. The still unconscious Fisk was then arrested and finally taken back into custody by the New York City Police Department again as soon as Brett Mahoney had arrived onto the scene and finding him, with Mahoney personally handcuffing Fisk and letting Daredevil escape the scene for him finally bringing Fisk back to justice.[14] The New York Bulletin nicknamed Fisk Kingpin in a news article after his arrest.[37]\n\nWilson Fisk was taken to Rikers Island inside an armored van with a team of SWAT officers keeping a close watch over him to ensure he could not escape a second time. When he arrived, with his face still covered with bruises and cuts from his battle against Daredevil, he was ordered by the guards to remove his clothes and personal items for storage, including his coat and his cufflinks.[7]\n\nFisk was then given a white uniform to wear. A guard rudely hit Fisk over the head with his baton as he explained that the uniform which was for newcomers. Once he had his uniform and fresh towels, Fisk was walked down the corridors as the other inmates mocked him, and was led into his prison cell. Fisk could do nothing but sit quietly on his bed, stare at the blank white wall in front of him and begin planning for his eventual return to the city, when he would regain his power and get his cruel revenge on those who took away his life and destroyed his plans for New York City's better future.[14]\n\nFisk later had a meeting with Benjamin Donovan who had warned him that the case was not looking good for him due to the long list of crimes the US Attorney was charging him with, including corruption and bribing. Fisk then asked Donovan about Vanessa Marianna, being assured that she was safe, although Fisk insisted that she could still not be allowed to visit him. Donovan warned him that although Marianna had been sent more than enough money, the government had seized a vast majority of his assets, and advised him to keep his head down and not cause trouble.\n\nOne day, while sitting in his cell and reading quietly by himself, Fisk was visited by Dutton who proceeded to have Fisk's cell door opened by his men so he could mock Fisk's current situation since his arrest. Fisk made it clear that he was aware of who Dutton was due to his reputation as a drug dealer in New York. Fisk was then told by Dutton that although Fisk may have made a name for himself on the outside, Dutton was the Kingpin of the prison and did not wish for Fisk to even attempt to change this, threatening his life if he tried it before walking away with a grin on his face.\n\nLater, in the café, Fisk sat alone and watched Dutton from across the room. He was visited by Stewart Finney, who claimed that he wished to meet Fisk as he felt they could help each other, as they were both formerly rich men who were not common criminals and thugs. Finney explained that Dutton ran around eighty percent of the contraband running throughout the prison. Fisk asked about the men Finney had previously sat with, Miguel Valdez and his brother. Finley then explained that they were the violent brothers who had been sent to Rikers for hideous crimes and also had a sick mother.[7]\n\nFisk called for a meeting with Benjamin Donovan where instead of being updated on his current legal case, Fisk ordered him to assist with Stewart Finney's case and pay the rent on Andrea Valdez's home. Despite Donovan's objections as he had previously advised Fisk not to get involved with any criminal activity within the prison, Fisk had furiously ordered him to get it done and ensure that all the transactions were untraceable.\n\nFisk's plan worked as Finney, Miguel Valdez and his brother became loyal to him as they worked on a plan to assassinate Dutton and take over the prison. Despite Finney assuring Fisk that there was currently no way to get in Dutton's cell block, he did hand him the latest copy of the New York Bulletin which featured an article on Punisher's trial and then conviction for the murders of various criminals which had included the Kitchen Irish, the Mexican Cartel and the Dogs of Hell. Fisk and Finney had then searched for any possible connection between all of these gangs and Dutton's own criminal career.\n\nFisk recruited the assistance of Roy Olsky to ensure during the trial that Punisher pleaded guilty and was sent to Rikers Island. Fisk had another meeting with Donovan to move all of his remaining funds to bribe the guards into joining his side, although Donovan warned that any other money he would need would for these criminal dealings be have to be taken from Vanessa Marianna's protection, Fisk, however, assured Donovan that he would not need any more money after this was completed. Donovan then asked if he wanted to know what the Punisher would be doing but Fisk still did not answer him.[7]\n\nIn November 2015, while exercising in the outdoor gym alone, Fisk was visited by the newly arrived Frank Castle.[38] Fisk explained how he had followed Castle's case in the New York Bulletin before he tried to comment on how he felt the deaths of Castle's family was a tragedy but was ordered to stop as Castle insisted he was not allowed to mention his family as Castle claimed that he did not believe Fisk really had any sympathy for him and insisted Fisk get to the point.\n\nFisk moved on and discussed Nelson and Murdock who had handled Castle's case in the courtroom and had tried to claim that Castle was suffering from PTSD from his experiences. Fisk offered to help him to find some closure instead, claiming he had found a sense of empathy while inside Rikers Island for those who had been wronged by the law. Fisk informed Castle that Dutton had some kind of connection to the massacre at the Central Park, explaining that despite the fact that he was not part of either the Kitchen Irish or the Mexican Cartel, he had undoubtedly had a hand in all of their activities.\n\nFisk explained how Dutton was in another cell block within Rikers which he now essentially owned and was constantly surrounded by guards and inmates alike, which Castle insisted he did not care about. Seeing his rage build, Fisk then offered Castle a chance to kill Dutton to avenge his wife and two children; when Castle questioned why Fisk did not kill Dutton himself, Fisk claimed that he desired to be unnoticed while in the prison so that he could do his time and then return to New York City. Castle at first refused to help, knowing that Fisk would personally benefit if Dutton was to be killed.\n\nAs tensions rose, Miguel Valdez and his brother stepped out onto the gym floor to back Fisk up, but Castle was unintimidated. As Castle still refused to be a mobster's personal assassin, Fisk argued that he should consider all of the enemies he had within the prison already and Fisk was giving him the perfect opportunity to confront the man implicated in his family's deaths. With this in mind, Castle then finally agreed to help and Stewart Finney stepped forward and gave Castle a shiv and they explained that Roy Olsky would assist him in getting into Dutton's cell block to confront and kill him.[7]\n\nFisk ensured his plan went as planned, and Frank Castle successfully assassinated Dutton by stabbing him with the shiv Fisk had provided, while learning that Blacksmith was responsible for the Massacre at Central Park. When Castle returned, Fisk ordered Roy Olsky to lock the door, trapping Castle as Olsky unlocked the other cell doors, allowing all Dutton's loyal men to find his body. As he watched this unfold from the higher level, Fisk tauntingly thanked Castle before then leaving him to die by being beaten to death by all the other violent inmates who were still loyal to Dutton.\n\nCastle survived the assassination attempt and killed every attacking inmate. Having witnessed this, Fisk made a new plan for Castle using his talents for violence to Fisk's own advantage. Fisk visited Castle while he was locked inside solitary confinement with his arms and legs in chains, and even ordered the guards to wait outside. Castle confronted Fisk over trying to have him killed, which Fisk confessed would have been easier but noted that considering the state Dutton was found in then he had likely given Castle all of the information on his own wife and two children's deaths as he had wanted.\n\nFisk was asked as to why he had left Castle alive and he explained that he had changed his former plans for Castle due to the changing circumstances, admitting he was wrong. Fisk told Castle that he had a gift for violence which he now wanted to exploit, noting he had not believed the stories of the Kitchen Irish and Dogs of Hell massacres he had committed. Fisk explained that he intended to use Castle's violent nature, but Castle, insulted, attacked by headbutting Fisk, but Fisk soon overpowered him due to Castle's chains and Fisk then furiously beat him into submission before stepping away.\n\nOnce they had both calmed down in the wake of the clash, Fisk gave the order to some of the prison guards standing by that all of Castle's hand and ankle cuffs should be removed before he offered Castle the chance to escape from Rikers Island and use all his skills to kill the crime rings in New York City so Fisk would no longer have any rivals when he finally got free. Castle agreed, promising that one day he would target Fisk himself, with Fisk calmly replying that he was counting on it. Fisk had then allowed Castle to steal a guard uniform and walk free to then continue his violent crusade once again.\n\nWith the Punisher gone to continue his crusade in New York City, Fisk then went to Dutton's bedside and ate his steak dinner beside him while Dutton struggled to breathe on life support. Fisk explained to Dutton that his wounds were indeed fatal and he would soon suffocate on his own blood. Fisk promised that Dutton would not suffer alone, as he felt Dutton had been right previously, that in prison there was only room for the one Kingpin to take charge. Dutton died shortly after this exchange and Fisk took command of the prison, doubling the cut of the guards and gaining even more influence than Dutton had ever had as Kingpin of the entire prison.[7]\n\nOnce Matt Murdock arrived at Rikers Island to question Fisk, being brought in by Benjamin Donovan, where Murdock explained that he knew that Fisk was behind Frank Castle's escape, which Fisk initially denied as he claimed to have no interest in Punisher's activities. Fisk continued to deny any involvement, leading to Murdock threatening to use the law to keep Vanessa Marianna out of the United States of America and ensure that Fisk never saw her again.\n\nThis threw Fisk into a rage and caused him to rip off his handcuffs and brutally slam Murdock's head against the table multiple times. Murdock attempted to fight back; however, he was not a match for the vastly stronger Fisk, although he did punch him, leading to Fisk remembering that Murdock's father was a boxer. Fisk admitted to taking control of the facility and allowing Castle to escape before telling Murdock that once he is free, he will dismantle his life, as well as Foggy Nelson's, and that Castle's actions should be the least of his current worries. Murdock left Fisk shortly after.\n\nWhile eating a perfectly cooked steak and drinking wine in his prison cell later that night while two other prisoners stood guard outside, Fisk took a sip of wine and was hurt by the cut on his lip from the earlier punch. While re-examining the cut Murdock left on his lip, Fisk seemingly remembered the same damage being inflicted upon him by Daredevil when he was arrested. The suspicious Fisk told Miguel Valdez that he would like to re-examine Murdock's files while he began planning on how he would destroy Nelson and Murdock and get revenge for his current situation in Rikers Island.[39]\n\nDuring his imprisonment in Rikers Island, Fisk started to devise a plan on how to get out of the prison and get back at the top of New York City's criminal underworld. Through Donovan and Partners, Fisk came into contact with Felix Manning, a fixer who aided Fisk in setting numerous shell corporations to cover his money transactions, as well as ensured Vanessa Marianna's safety outside the United States of America.[40] Fisk took interest in Ray Nadeem, an FBI agent with unstable FICO score, which made him a potential recruitment target. In 2016, Fisk manipulated Nadeem's financial situation to make him vulnerable to his schemes.\n\nFisk then started to target other FBI agents from New York Crime Division, including Tammy Hattley. Fisk had his men assassinate Hattley's child and threatened her that her daughter Allison would meet similar fate unless she would agree to work for him.[3] Fisk also ordered Manning to manipulate Foggy Nelson's family through Red Lion National Bank to get a potential leverage on Nelson, in case he would pose a threat in the future.[41] Furthermore, Fisk purchased the Presidential Hotel, which was used by the FBI for house imprisonment for white-collar criminals awaiting their trial, through his shell company Vancorp.[42]\n\nBy the end of 2017, Fisk was told that his mother died and that she had left him a box of memories, including the hammer Fisk used to kill his father.[12] Since then, Fisk carried the hammer with him to remind himself where he came from.[19] Fisk also attempted to distract himself by imagining he was inside of his own Penthouse, where he could make his traditional omelette in the morning. However, Fisk could still hear the other inmates over his classical music as he made himself breakfast, although Fisk could still furiously yell out to all of the other inmates to be quiet.\n\nFisk was rejoined by Benjamin Donovan and Nicholas Lee who came with news that his appeal was still continuing as they had planned, although Fisk suspected that they actually had more to tell him than just this. Reluctantly, Donovan and Lee then informed Fisk that there had been some more setbacks with bringing Vanessa Marianna back to New York City so they could be reunited as the FBI now wanted to charge Marianna as an accessory to Fisk's crimes, so she would be arrested as soon as she returned. Disappointed by this update, Fisk demanded Donovan and Lee go as he considered what to do.[43] Fisk later found out that Rostam Kazemi had a change of heart and was intending to buy the Presidential Hotel back, so Fisk hired a gang to prevent Kazemi from doing so.[42]\n\nAs usual, Fisk was then called into his meeting with the FBI as they still attempted to get new information out of him about the criminal gangs who operated within New York. This day, Fisk had been greeted by Ray Nadeem who was clearly unimpressed by getting assigned to meet with Fisk since he had been refusing to help them for some time. Fisk, however, asked Nadeem if he was in love with anyone and what he would do to protect them, which Nadeem had briefly mistook for Fisk threatening his family, although Fisk calmly assured him that this was not the case, commenting on all of the mistakes he had made.\n\nFisk claimed that he was accepting the dept he was paying due to his many mistakes, but told Nadeem that he refused to accept that Marianna would have to pay for all those mistakes as well by being forced to never return to the United States of America and for them to never see each other again. As Fisk said he would do anything to protect Marianna, Nadeem then questioned exactly what he meant, as Fisk asked to make a deal with the FBI.[43] Fisk gave the FBI key intel on the Albanian Syndicate, resulting in the arrest of the Mother Teresa and other mobsters which Nadeem took credit for.[42]\n\nIn order to get out of Rikers Island, Fisk had used his influence over the prison to convince Riggle to allow Jasper Evans to make an attempt on his life, believing this would allow Fisk to convince the FBI that prison was too dangerous.[44] As part of this plan, Fisk put himself in a vulnerable position as he went to Rikers gym.\n\nAs was pre-planned, Fisk allowed Evans to come close to him, under the guise that Evans was assisting with Fisk's exercise, before Evans drew a shiv and plunged it into Fisk's stomach, causing non-fatal wounds while also screaming that Fisk was now the snitch so that everyone else in the prison could hear him. However, Fisk responded to this attack with pure rage and, despite this being pre-planned, Fisk threw Evans away from him and considered killing him in retaliation, trapping him underneath the barbell he was using and kicking him in the head, before almost striking the terrified Evans with a weight.\n\nWith Evans trapped and defenseless, he cried out in utter terror and begged for his life while Fisk stood over him, furiously holding up the weight over his head and considering crushing Evans' skull with it. However, Fisk then eventually recalled the plan and chose not to kill Evans, instead of dropping that weight down just inches from Evans' head and going to sit back down. Fisk then took a seat while all the prison guards arrived, taking control of the situation.[42] As a reward for his own involvement with the scheme, Fisk had Riggle write up his false paperwork that Evans was sent to their solitary confinement, when in reality he was freed from Rikers and returned home.[44]\n\nFollowing the stabbing, Fisk was rejoined by Ray Nadeem who first checked on Fisk's condition following the incident, noting that he had spoken to all the doctors at Rikers Island who had just told him that the wound was not fatal. When Fisk commented that he found their new situation quite profound, Nadeem demanded that he not start with his mind games, although Fisk claimed that he found the situation to be extremely serious, noting that he had never before feared being attacked.\n\nFisk commented that everyone in Rikers knew that he was talking to the FBI and was, therefore, a snitch; however, Nadeem made it clear that the FBI still expected Fisk to continue cooperating with them to bring down more organizations like the Albanian Syndicate, noting that if he did not, then the FBI would not clear Vanessa Marianna of all criminal charges. Manipulating the situation to his own ends, Fisk reminded Nadeem that he had become a target within Rikers and if he remained there he would likely be killed and then would be unable to help the FBI anymore, demanding a renegotiation of the deal.[42]\n\nWith the FBI believing that Fisk would remain in serious danger if he was allowed to stay in Rikers Island, a deal was renegotiated as Benjamin Donovan had managed to convince the FBI to allow Fisk to be taken out of Rikers and instead moved into the Presidential Hotel as they could still keep Fisk under constant guard by the FBI as long as he was being kept there. As he was being prepared to be moved, Ray Nadeem complained about all Donovan's many demands before Fisk was lead out of the facility.\n\nWhile they drove down the streets of New York City, Fisk listened to Nadeem as he explained the rules of his imprisonment at the hotel. However, rather than acknowledging what Nadeem was saying, Fisk began talking about his own life and how he had spent much of that alone, believing that this was the source of his strength and how he achieved so much. Fisk noted that despite all his successes, he felt unfulfilled until he met Vanessa Marianna, telling Nadeem that he felt like he would explode just from the sense of almost overwhelming amount of freedom and power that his love for Marianna brought.\n\nAs he continued talking about his love for Marianna, Fisk said that he discovered the great lie behind love, in that the freedom it seemingly gave him was, in fact, the opposite. Fisk told Nadeem that while their literal prison presented a challenge for a prisoner to escape, love was the truly inescapable prison. Concluding his long metaphor, Fisk told Nadeem that due to his own love for Marianna he was always in his prison. But regardless of this, if he could do anything more to protect Marianna, then he would do that, as nothing would be a challenge for him as long as it had ensured that Marianna could remain safe.\n\nHowever, just as Fisk concluded his metaphor about love, a sudden explosion then destroyed the car in front of them, before the second fireball rolled their own vehicle onto its back, knocking both Fisk and Nadeem unconscious. Fisk soon awoke, still handcuffed to his seat and found that Nadeem was still out cold, as Fisk then desperately attempted to free himself while calling out to Nadeem. Before long, bullets began striking the car's bulletproof windows as the Albanian Syndicate attempted to kill Fisk, who then used brute force to rip his handcuffs free, despite having nowhere he could escape to.\n\nFrom inside the bulletproof vehicle, Fisk watched the surviving FBI agents fight against the Albanians, who still had them completely surrounded and managed to take them all down one by one, as one agent ordered Fisk to stay in the car before getting shot in the head. The Albanians then all surrounded Fisk's car, and began firing at the windows, aiming to kill Fisk in revenge for having both Vic Jusufi and the Mother Teresa arrested, as another Albanian sawed through the car door while Fisk prepared himself for a final and likely fatal fight with seemingly no hope of surviving this attack on his life.\n\nHowever, just before the Albanians could get inside Fisk's car, a shot rang out and took out an Albanian as Benjamin Poindexter stepped out and used pinpoint accuracy to shoot and kill the Albanians. Fisk continued to watch while Poindexter proved to be an extraordinary marksman, ricocheting bullets before brutally executing two men who surrendered to him and even throwing his magazine cartridge into another man's throat. With all this going on, Fisk finally managed to get out of his car, as Poindexter held his gun to Fisk and told him not to move, while Fisk had calmly raised up his hands.[42]\n\nNow seemingly safe from harm, Fisk and all of the surviving agents were rescued by more squad cars as they drove at full speed through New York City until they reached the Presidential Hotel, as they then pulled Fisk straight inside while Fisk asked to make a phone call as Nadeem and Poindexter ensured that the area was safe for them to proceed. As he was moved, Fisk overheard Arinori complaining that five agents had been killed in that attack because of Fisk. Fisk saw that Donovan and Nicholas Lee were there as he then demanded they go and ensure that Marianna was safe.\n\nFisk then got inside the elevator with Nadeem and Poindexter as he was moved upstairs to the Penthouse where he would be continuing his sentence, finding that it was filled up with security cameras and a team of agents outside to ensure that Fisk could not leave. Nadeem explained the situation and promised that he would be safe there, Fisk complained that he had almost been killed that night, to which Nadeem responded by furiously grabbing Fisk's collar and reminding him that several good FBI agents had been killed while protecting him, demanding that Fisk's intel had better be worthwhile.[40]\n\nOnce safe inside of the Presidential Hotel, Fisk was able to take his shower as he reflected on what had happened during their ambush on the FBI's Convoy, recalling how his life had been saved by Benjamin Poindexter and his incredible shooting abilities. However, before Fisk could even finish his shower, he was interrupted by the arrival of Arinori, who informed Fisk that both of his lawyers from Donovan and Partners had just arrived, as Arinori threw Fisk a towel and had ordered him to then get dry and dressed.\n\nHeading downstairs, Fisk found Benjamin Donovan waiting to speak to him with Nicholas Lee, as Fisk immediately questioned if they had been able to locate Vanessa Marianna. Although Donovan requested that the cameras be shut off so that he and Lee could speak to their client in peace, Fisk told them not to worry about all that and instead just finally tell him whether or not the Albanian Syndicate had indeed targeted Marianna. However, to Fisk's utter horror, Donovan had then regretfully informed him that they did not know if Marianna was safe as she had gone missing, as Fisk began worrying for her safety.\n\nWhile he waited for an update on Marianna's situation, Fisk sat alone in his Penthouse and stared at the blank wall in front of him, being reminded of Rabbit in a Snowstorm. Eventually, however, Fisk had noticed that the FBI had turned off all their cameras in the room as Donovan and Lee arrived to finally give Fisk the update he had been waiting for, informing him that they had gotten into contact with Felix Manning who promised that Marianna was safe, explaining that her bodyguards would relocate her every seventy-two hours and they did not use any mobile phones to ensure they were not tracked.\n\nGetting to the point, Fisk questioned where Marianna was now, while Lee explained that she was in a safe house in Barcelona, which had greatly annoyed Fisk since he believed Europe was too dangerous to hide Marianna due to the risk of extradition; however, Donovan had explained that it was Marianna's decision as she enjoyed the art and could be quite insistent. Briefly reminded of Marianna's nature which he found so attractive, Fisk calmed down before then demanding to Donovan and Lee get back into contact with Manning in order to get Marianna moved into somewhere safer and even closer to him.[40]\n\nThat evening, Fisk had been served his plain dinner by J. Lim, who had called him an asshole, while Fisk remained under the close watch of Benjamin Poindexter, who would barely look at Fisk as he was stood guard. Instead of eating, Fisk simply addressed Poindexter directly, commenting on how Poindexter had saved his life from the Albanian Syndicate's men the night before, to which Poindexter claimed that was a mistake. Fisk expressed his condolences for the lives of the FBI agents who died protecting him, acknowledging his own condolences would likely bring a little comfort to all of their families.\n\nAs Fisk continued talking, Poindexter simply ignored him, while Fisk had commented on how brave the men who died were, with Poindexter only speaking up to remind him that he only had five more minutes to finish eating that meal. Fisk then commented on how he owed all those fallen FBI agents a debt that he could never repay, but noted that he had also owed Poindexter a great deal, commenting on how Poindexter was incredibly skilled with a firearm, but Poindexter chose to ignore Fisk's questions about his talents as he instead took Fisk's food away from him and then left the room with all his food.\n\nThat evening, Fisk was rejoined by Benjamin Donovan who claimed that he had just been attacked by a masked man who Donovan had suspected was actually the Daredevil, as Donovan told Fisk how the masked man had taken out six FBI agents and, despite not wearing his red suit, he had little doubt that this was the same man. Having heard this, Fisk stepped over to his Penthouse's window and looked out over New York City, commenting that the Devil of New York had finally returned and was seemingly aiming to bring down his criminal empire once again, much to Fisk's considerable frustration.[40]\n\nThat morning, as Fisk knew it would be, Lim and Poindexter charged in Fisk's bedroom to do a room search, with the two agents surprised to find that Fisk was already prepared and facing the wall as was instructed by the time that the entered the room. While Lim began the search, Poindexter had explained the current situation to Fisk and demanded that Fisk would co-operate with the situation, which Fisk calmly accepted while Lim proceeded to throw Fisk's bed onto the floor during his search, while Poindexter had then searched Fisk's entire body for any potential weapons that he might have.\n\nEventually, Lim's search of the room and Poindexter's search of Fisk himself was concluded while Fisk and Poindexter had then directly faced each other at the end of their search, both clearly sizing each other up, with Poindexter calmly confirming that the room was now indeed all clear. Fisk then watched while Poindexter and Lim left his room, watching while Poindexter momentarily paused while stepping out of the Penthouse, locking eyes with Fisk who was stood on his balcony and kept a closer eye on the agent, as Fisk still considered what benefits Poindexter could hold for him in the near future.[44]\n\nFisk was soon contacted by all his allies at Rikers Island that Matt Murdock had arrived to ask his questions about Fisk's time there, as Fisk proceeded with arrangements to have Murdock killed. Watching from a secret room at the Presidential Hotel, Fisk watched while Murdock proved to have the skills of Daredevil as he subdued the guards before Fisk called him up, commenting that Murdock had pretended to be Foggy Nelson to get into the prison before asking the wrong questions.\n\nAs Murdock tried to talk his way out of that situation, Fisk reminded him of how he threatened Vanessa Marianna the last time they had spoken, before Fisk left Murdock to fight his way towards freedom, ensuring that even if Murdock had made it back to his taxi, that taxi would still be driven into a river where Murdock would drown. That same day, Fisk had his daily food delivered, finding that Benjamin Poindexter and J. Lim had chosen to take a bite out of his burger before it was delivered, which Fisk ignored as he continued to eat the burger with his spork regardless of Poindexter and Lim's prank.\n\nWhile he was eating his meal, Fisk was joined by Tammy Hattley as well as Winn who had come to talk to Fisk about the Ambush on the FBI Convoy on Poindexter's involvement with it. As Hattley and Winn questioned Fisk about what happened, he was asked about the men he saw who surrendered before Poindexter executed, with Fisk telling Hattley and Winn that those men had tried to kill Poindexter before he killed them in self defense, which Hattley and Winn simply accepted. Once he was alone, Fisk looked up at one of the cameras, assuming that Poindexter would be watching what he had said.\n\nFollowing this interview, Fisk sat alone in the Penthouse and read the New York Bulletin until he saw all the cameras in the room being shut off. Poindexter then burst into the room and questioned what Fisk's game was. Fisk claimed that he was not offering Poindexter favors, but sympathy, noting that while Fisk himself could handle the insults and mockery that the papers like the Bulletin could throw at him, he believed that an agent like Poindexter would struggle with what the press would say, to which Poindexter then noted that despite all his confidence, Fisk still did not actually know anything about him.\n\nFisk, however, simply showed Poindexter the Bulletin's report about the ambush, which suggested that the FBI had botched the transfer, knowing that this would add to Poindexter's paranoia about being used as a scapegoat for the FBI's failure. Fisk made this point clear, noting that the FBI were now investigating Poindexter for just simply doing his job, complimenting Poindexter on his outstanding work in saving his life as well as Ray Nadeem's life during that ambush, as he claimed that the FBI were now trying to demean Poindexter's act of courage, before the confused Poindexter then walked away.[44]\n\nFisk was later informed by Benjamin Donovan that despite his best efforts, Matt Murdock had seemingly survived his taxi being driven into a river since his body had not been recovered, much to Fisk's great frustration. Considerably annoyed, Fisk told Donovan to go and remind Felix Manning that he did not tolerate loose ends; however, Donovan still attempted to reassure Fisk that Murdock's corpse was likely just swept away in the water, noting that even if he had gotten free of the taxi, there was no way that any blind man could have then swum back onto the shoreline following such a brutal crash.\n\nUnconvinced, Fisk then showed Donovan their footage of Murdock fighting his way through Rikers Island with the same amount of skill as Daredevil. Clearly confused by all the footage there, Donovan attempted to reassure Fisk that Donovan and Partners had already researched Murdock and had found through his medical records that he had lost his sight at the age of nine. Fisk, however, then noted that a man capable of this could have survived and recalled how Murdock threatened to stop Vanessa Marianna from reuniting with Fisk, while Fisk had stepped up to the nervous Donovan while saying this.\n\nThey were then interrupted by the arrival of both Ray Nadeem as well as Benjamin Poindexter, as they prepared to finalize Fisk's deal with them. Fisk sat quietly while Donovan demanded everything that had been agreed upon, including Fisk's personal items, which Nadeem had agreed to supply as they had previously agreed if Fisk continued supplying valuable information about the Albanian Syndicate as well as others. Fisk then spoke up, and acknowledged the sacrifices the FBI had made, before claiming that Murdock was a criminal working for him, hoping that the FBI would soon arrest or kill Murdock.[45]\n\nWanting to understand Benjamin Poindexter better, Fisk then had both Benjamin Donovan and Felix Manning pull together every file they could find on Poindexter's youth, therapy, military records, and past employment, as Donovan personally delivered it to Fisk. As he looked over all the paperwork and therapy recordings, Donovan confirmed that this was everything that Manning had been able to pull together. Fisk noted that this would take some time, as Donovan took a seat with an audiobook while Fisk got to work reading everything there was about Poindexter.\n\nFisk first learned that the young Poindexter had lost his parents and was sent to Lyndhurst Home for Boys where he developed his keen skill at accuracy through playing baseball, able to hit the same mark perfectly every time. During that game, Poindexter's coach, Bradley, had eventually made the decision that he would take Poindexter off the pitch to allow Kanon his chance the play, a decision which had greatly upset an already emotional Poindexter. Out of frustration, Poindexter threw his baseball at Bradley's head, cracking his skull and killing him, resulting in Poindexter going into therapy.\n\nReading through the notes written by Doctor Eileen Mercer, Fisk had learned that Poindexter struggled to cope with the deaths of his own parents, and rarely acknowledged the death of Bradley, as Mercer diagnosed Poindexter with Borderline Personality Disorder while he was treated at the Riviera Psychiatric Institute. Fisk had learned that Poindexter grew up strongly relying on Mercer to guide him through life, and had broken down when Mercer had been diagnosed with a terminal illness, with Poindexter being recommended to find himself a job with a strong structure so he could continue getting better.\n\nFisk saw that in his search for a structured life, Poindexter had briefly enlisted into their United States Army before managing to get himself his job at the Brooklyn Suicide Prevention Center where he had been provided with the script and a strong structure for his life. It was here that Fisk also learned that Poindexter had met and gained his strong attachment with Julie Barnes, who had also worked in there and had provided Poindexter with the support that he craved. Fisk discovered that even after leaving the job and working at the FBI, Poindexter had continued to be obsessed with Barnes and often followed her.\n\nSeveral hours of research later, once Fisk knew everything he could about Poindexter's youth and how to manipulate his emotions for his own means, Donovan asked Fisk what all of this work was actually about without getting into the specifics. Getting to his feet, Fisk told Donovan how he had just become New York City's scapegoat for everything that they saw as corrupt in their city. Fisk claimed that the public could be easily distracted and therefore all he had to do was create a new villain for the public to despise instead of him, believing that he could manipulate Poindexter into becoming that villain.[45]\n\nAs had been agreed with the FBI, following his information leading to the arrest of the Albanian Syndicate, Fisk was supplied with all his former possessions, including furniture and artworks which were all brought into his Penthouse prison in the Presidential Hotel. Pleased to have regained much of the luxury he had missed, Fisk chose to wear a white suit, putting on the cufflinks Vanessa Marianna had once chosen for him. Fisk then stepped out onto his balcony and overlooked the room, delighting in seeing everything that was returned.\n\nFisk then sat down at his table as Benjamin Poindexter came in with his dinner, with Poindexter furious as he had discovered that Fisk had pulled some strings to get Julie Barnes her job at the hotel, knowing that Poindexter would encounter her and have this strong emotional reaction to seeing her once again. Poindexter, however, claimed that Barnes meant nothing to him. While Poindexter kept talking and then accused Fisk of having him followed by Felix Manning, Fisk remained silent until Poindexter finally snapped and threw Fisk's food over the floor, demanding that Fisk finally say something about all this.\n\nRemaining calm, Fisk told Poindexter how, as a boy, he murdered his own father with a hammer, acknowledging that at this time he was still highly immature and had not had a chance to grow up and then experience the world outside of New York City, but had still killed his own father. Fisk noted that this feeling of being a child, standing over a father figure who he had murdered, was something that Poindexter would be able to relate with, commenting that Poindexter had been trained to hide these feelings during his time with the military and the FBI, to make himself into someone the world would tolerate.\n\nWhen Poindexter furiously accused Fisk of destroying what he and Barnes had, Fisk claimed that it was not an honest relationship and that was what had destroyed it, leading to Poindexter claiming that he should have let Fisk die during the Ambush on the FBI Convoy. Fisk then stepped up to Poindexter and claimed that Barnes would have never fully understood him, and neither would a society that always punished people like him, before making the comparison between Poindexter's life and his own, which clearly angered Poindexter as he proceeded to storm out of the Penthouse, leaving Fisk alone.[12]\n\nFisk arranged to have Benjamin Poindexter investigated by the FBI in the wake of the ambush, knowing that losing that structure would be getting to Poindexter. Just before Poindexter would have killed himself, Fisk called him at his Apartment, telling him about how his mother died while Fisk was in Rikers Island, at which point Fisk had learned that she kept the hammer that Fisk used to kill his father, proving that his mother was proud that he had taken this action.\n\nTelling Poindexter that he accepted him for who he was, Fisk then had Felix Manning deliver Daredevil's Suit to Poindexter with orders to go out to the New York Bulletin and kill Jasper Evans while he was still wearing it, promising that if he accepted this mission, then Fisk would never abandon Poindexter.[12] As Poindexter then went out to complete his mission for Fisk and ensure that Evans was unable to give evidence against Fisk to Karen Page and Mitchell Ellison, Fisk remained in his Penthouse and looked over all the artworks that had been supplied to him, as Fisk questioned Nicholas Lee over why his beloved Rabbit in a Snowstorm still had not been returned to him.\n\nOnce Lee had left, Wellers had all of their cameras turned back on, before hearing that there was an incident breaking out which he went to investigate. Fisk then calmly walked back into his room and went to the secret room hidden by his wardrobes and headed downstairs, where he found Shelby waiting. Fisk watched the live feed of Wellers and Doyle complaining about having to guard Fisk, before he told Shelby to put on the news, as Fisk watched reports by WHiH World News and WJBP-TV confirming that Poindexter had completed his mission, resulting in Daredevil being blamed for all the deaths.[46]\n\nWhile in his basement, Fisk was told by Felix Manning that Melvin Potter's attempt to betray Daredevil had failed and Potter had been arrested, while Fisk had then decided not to assassinate either Potter or Betsy Beatty, calling Potter irrelevant as Fisk asked about Benjamin Poindexter, as Manning informed him that he was laying low as they had agreed, although Manning had still noted that he was concerned about Poindexter's mental state following their Attack on the New York Bulletin Building, as Fisk then acknowledged he had already demanded a lot from Poindexter and told Manning to keep an eye on him.\n\nThe meeting was interrupted as Ray Nadeem made his way inside of the Penthouse in order to speak with Fisk, forcing Fisk to return upstairs and get into bed, so that Nadeem would still have no idea about his secret basement lair. Once Nadeem found Fisk in bed, Fisk noted that Nadeem should be with his wife, who he correctly named as Seema Nadeem, which greatly angered Nadeem who threatened Fisk if he spoke her name again. Getting to business, Fisk had asked what he could help Nadeem with, to which Nadeem then compared Fisk to Jack Kem, a gangster Nadeem had known growing up.\n\nFisk asked Nadeem to have a little more faith in him, promising that he was a better man than Kem, noting that the luxury he was being afforded at the Presidential Hotel was the price he requested which the FBI had now paid. Nadeem demanded to know if Fisk let Jasper Evans go free from Rikers Island in exchange for stabbing him, to which Fisk claimed that Nadeem had become desperate, choosing not to answer Nadeem's question as he wished him a good night and returned to his book, while the now highly concerned Nadeem then slowly walked out of Fisk's bedroom to consider what to do.[46]\n\nUpon learning that Poindexter was beginning to rebuild his mental state through his friendship with Julie Barnes, Fisk made the decision to break Poindexter, as he arranged to have Barnes murdered with the assistance of Manning. Watching from a screen inside of his basement, Fisk watched as Manning's men shot Barnes in the head and removed her body, as Manning then took Barnes' phone which they later used to send Poindexter several abusive and heartbreaking messages, knowing that he would not cope with this well and would be easier to manipulate for Fisk's next plans as a result.[5]\n\nIn the evening, Fisk got a surprise visit from Karen Page, while Fisk greeted her and acknowledged that he was not expecting to find her in there. Looking around the room, Page compared Fisk's time in the Presidential Hotel to his imprisonment in Rikers Island, with Fisk noting that all of the luxuries must be offensive to Page who wanted to see him suffer following all the times that Fisk had tried to have Page killed, as Fisk had then noted that he was still paying the price for those crimes against Page.\n\nAs the tense standoff continued, Fisk offered to make Page a cup of tea, which she turned down as that was not what she was there for, before Fisk requested that Page take a seat with him at his table, acknowledging that Page had come there to get words from him at least. Having briefly sat in an awkward silence, Fisk was the first one to speak up as he noted that Page was not really writing an article about his mother for the New York Bulletin as she claimed, to which Page noted that she could while Fisk questioned what the benefit of this would be, asking if it would just be done to upset him.\n\nFisk then noted that he did not enjoy intrusions into his private life, to which Page questioned why he had invited her inside his Penthouse if this was the case. Fisk then answered this by noting how Page had previously worked for Ben Urich, commenting that Urich's death was his final lesson, noting that Page clearly had not understood this last lesson. Page questioned if this was a threat, but Fisk only claimed that this was an observation which he had made. Page told Fisk that she went there to talk about what his mother had told Urich before Urich's death, commenting that she was also in that room with Urich.\n\nPage began talking in more detail about how she and Urich had then pushed Fisk's mother into talking to them, clearly hoping to get an emotional reaction out of Fisk, but Fisk did his best to remain calm as he asked what Page's point was. Page went on to tell Fisk how his mother recalled a lot about Fisk's childhood, making a mocking comment by calling Fisk by Willie, as Fisk noted that her readers of the Bulletin would likely be as entertained by this small gossip pieces as she was, but Page mockingly claimed that they would only pass things like that around the office to get their own laughs.\n\nAttempting to regain control of the conversation, Fisk asked how the office was following the Attack on the New York Bulletin Building, with Page musing that Fisk had known about this attack before it had even happened. Page, however, remained calm and explained that the Bulletin intended to write a story about Fisk's father and how he had brutally murdered him with a hammer when he was still just a child. With Fisk struggling to cope with what Page was saying to him, so continued digging and questioned if there was any part of him that was not already broken, while Fisk began to regain composure.\n\nTaking a breath, Fisk told Page that he had let her in his Penthouse because he actually had some questions of his own which he wanted to ask her. While Page listened, Fisk then asked her about her time working at Nelson and Murdock as a secretary, although Page still insisted that she was their office manager, with Fisk noting that she knew all about Matt Murdock's work, which she had confirmed. Fisk, however, then directly asked when Page became aware of Murdock's secret life and, although Page did not verbally answer, Fisk still saw in Page's eyes that this was indeed the case.\n\nPage, however, was not broken by this mistake as she instead asked Fisk if they could talk even more about secrets, calling him by his first name. Page then said James Wesley's name, which confused Fisk as Page asked what it had been like for him when Wesley disappeared, mockingly reminding him of the fear and stress he had experienced when Wesley was no longer answering his phone. As Page went on, Fisk's emotions got the better of him while she questioned if he had been angry with Wesley for disappearing on him, before Page made a comment that Wesley had died quickly, which horrified Fisk.\n\nWhile Fisk could barely hold himself together, Page told him that he should not be worrying about Murdock and informed him that she was the one who had killed Wesley when she shot him multiple times in the chest, noting that she wanted to shoot him several more times but had run out of bullets. Filled with murderous rage, Fisk got to his feet and roared, but before he could attack, Wellers and J. Lim charged into the room and took Page out in handcuffs, as Foggy Nelson had just arrived there and claimed that Page was planning to assassinate Fisk, which resulted with her being removed before Fisk could kill her, as Fisk was then taken back upstairs for his own protection.[5]\n\nMortified over what Karen Page told him, Fisk then contacted Felix Manning and asked him to bring Benjamin Poindexter for a meeting, having Manning's assassins just outside in case Poindexter did not co-operate as Fisk hoped. Once he arrived, Poindexter expressed his shock at seeing Fisk's secret basement. Poindexter then informed Fisk that Ray Nadeem knew about everything as he and Daredevil had just attempted to break into his Apartment looking for proof of his crimes, so they could expose both Poindexter and Fisk.\n\nFisk remained calm and promised Poindexter that they would take care of this problem for him. Seeing that he was clearly distressed by everything that happened, including Julie Barnes' disappearance, Fisk got to his feet and then stepped over to Poindexter and made a comment that rage, such as the kind he was holding onto, could not just stay inside as it would become a poison that would kill him. Fisk told Poindexter to unleash out a primal scream to release that rage, which Poindexter did. Fisk then hugged Poindexter and told Manning to send his assassins away, deciding not to kill Poindexter.[5]\n\nIn order to keep Ray Nadeem from exposing everything about their recent actions, Fisk ordered Tammy Hattley to murder Winn and then threaten to pin the blame on Nadeem, forcing him to submit to Fisk's leadership. With Nadeem now forced him serving him, Fisk used him and the other agents now under his control to gather together all New York City's biggest crime bosses, so that Fisk could put forward his own dominance over them and then become New York's true Kingpin of Crime.\n\nWith everything now in place, Fisk was joined in his secret room by Hattley and Nadeem, as Fisk asked where Shelby was, while Hattley promised that she was on her way before she went to remove Fisk's Ankle Monitor. However, Fisk, in the show of strength, demanded that Nadeem remove it for him. Fisk then followed Hattley, Nadeem and the other FBI agents as they left the Presidential Hotel through a backdoor to get to their cars and make their way towards the crime boss meeting, while Fisk took great pleasure in seeing the horror on Nadeem's face as he realized how much power Fisk had gained.\n\nKnowing that Nadeem had contact with Daredevil, Fisk had him call him up and inform him that Fisk had just left the hotel, in the hopes that he would turn up at the Red Fish Blue Restaurant and try and capture him, at which point, Fisk and his own team of corrupt agents would be able to ambush and finally kill him. Fisk calmly watched as Nadeem made the call before he left the car to check out the area, as Fisk then spoke with Benjamin Poindexter and told him to be ready, noting that Daredevil would know this would be a trap but would still likely come regardless, so Poindexter would have to be ready.\n\nOnce he had been assured by the FBI that the area was secure, Fisk stepped into the Restaurant and greeted all five of the crime bosses, who had been complaining about the situation which they were still highly confused by. Upon seeing Fisk there, Everett Starr questioned what was going on, to which Fisk had told him that this would be an opportunity for everyone there. Fisk then took a seat with the crime bosses and informed them that he was offering them protection from any FBI investigations and prosecutions, although John Hammer was unconvinced and believed that it was actually a sting operation.\n\nWith Sophia Carter also unconvinced by Fisk's offer and calling out to any recording devices that she denied any knowledge about the situation, the only one who showed interest was Rosalie Carbone, who had then asked how much Fisk was demanding for all of this. When Fisk demanded twenty percent of all of their earnings in exchange for his protection, Starr then furiously scoffed, explaining how he believed that Fisk was actually looking to get a confession from them so he could get one more month in the Presidential Hotel in return for sending them back into prison.\n\nStarr continued showing great disrespect to Fisk, commenting on his white suit and the con he made to get into the hotel, before telling him that he would not be contributing to his demands. However, just as Starr said this, Poindexter threw his Billy Club at his head, which fractured Starr's skull as he dropped down dead at the table, blood pouring out of his wound. As Poindexter, now dressed in Daredevil's Suit, stood by Fisk, the crime bosses, including Latimer Zyl all looked on his horror while Fisk raised the price to twenty-five percent, which Carbone and the others agreed to, much to Fisk's pleasure.\n\nAs the meeting continued, however, it quickly became apparent that Daredevil had still failed to make an appearance, as Poindexter went in search of the Restaurant and found nothing, which caused Fisk considerable anger as he barely managed to remain seated without launching into a murderous rage. Poindexter then stepped over to Nadeem and questioned if he was actually the one who had warned Daredevil, but Nadeem insisted that they had all heard him on the phone and therefore he had no chance to warn Daredevil. Giving up, Fisk decided to return to the hotel and make a new plan.[3]\n\nOnce they left the Restaurant, Fisk was informed by Wellers that they had located Karen Page who was hiding out in Clinton Church. Fisk sat with Poindexter in the car and Fisk told him how he rarely allowed people to know him personally, but James Wesley was one of those people who became a friend, a surrogate son to him before Page had then murdered him. Poindexter asked Fisk if there was something he wanted him to do, to which Fisk had immediately asked Poindexter to murder Page, as Poindexter then smiled and told Fisk to consider it done, before stepping out of the car to complete his mission.[23]\n\nDespite all Benjamin Poindexter's best efforts, Karen Page had still managed to survive the attempt on her life due to the intervention of the Daredevil who had come to her rescue and eventually defeated Poindexter,[23] leading to a long hunt for her only for the New York City Police Department to take Page to custody and then let her go free. Fisk's lawyers meanwhile completed their role in exonerating him in the eyes of the law.\n\nStepping out in front of their New York City general public, Fisk was greeted by their abuse as many demanded that Fisk be taken back to Rikers Island as they accused him of being a criminal and a cop killer. Fisk, however, had remained calm and watched while Benjamin Donovan stepped forward and addressed the public, informing them that the Court of Appeals had overturned the conviction against Fisk, officially making him a free man once again; however, this news only resulting in more furious booing from those general public who were completely disgusted by the new result which was in Fisk's favor.\n\nFisk then personally stepped in front of the podium before the angry eyes of the public and reporters from WHiH World News and others as he acknowledged that they might find this news to be difficult to accept, but claimed that they had all been lied to and manipulated, accusing news like the New York Bulletin of planting fake stories that he was a criminal. Fisk went on to claim that he was merely a good man who had stood up against that system and corruption in their city and was then punished for it, which began to result in the public seemingly reconsidering their view on his case as they went silent.\n\nFisk went on to claim that organizations like the Bulletin attempted to tear him down with their false allegations, while also sending out the Daredevil to frame him, using the recent Attack on the Bulletin as well as the Duel at Clinton Church as examples to prove Daredevil was indeed a criminal who was only now showing his own true colors as a killer following the murders of Jasper Evans and Paul Lantom. Fisk concluded his speech by asking the public to believe him, in that the Daredevil was, in fact, their true public enemy number one, which was met with stunned silence from the audience watching him.[41]\n\nOnce his speech was finished, Fisk returned to his Penthouse where he had Tammy Hattley remove his Ankle Monitor while she had explained that the FBI would continue offering Fisk protection as he would officially continue to be a valuable asset to them with all of the information that he would not actually be providing, with Benjamin Donovan also noting that the FBI was terrified of what the public's reaction would be if he was killed in the near future, as Fisk had then calmly dismissed Hattley.\n\nFisk then looked over his Penthouse, which was being covered with his artworks before asking where Vanessa Marianna was, to which Donovan explained that she was currently in the sky and had almost reached New York City. Looking at the last blank wall where he had intended to hang his beloved Rabbit in a Snowstorm, Fisk noted that the only thing left to do was to get it back, although Nicholas Lee had noted that they had recently doubled their original offer to buy it back but were still having no luck, to which Fisk told them that he would go there in person and make a more compelling offer himself.\n\nFisk went to the Residence of Esther Falb, the current owner of the Rabbit in a Snowstorm, as Falb opened the door and explained that she knew exactly who Fisk was and demanded that he remove his shoes before coming into her home, which took Fisk off guard. Once inside, Fisk first took a moment to look at his beloved Rabbit in the Snowstorm, commenting on how beautiful and peaceful it was, while Falb noted that the painting had been through quite a lot, noting that it was finally back home and questioned if Fisk had just come there to offer her more money for it as they sat opposite each other.\n\nFisk said that he understood that Falb became aware of the painting when he was sent to Rikers Island and the painting was taken away from him by the government, as Falb admitted it was true. Fisk then explained to Falb how he had bought the painting from Marianna at the Scene Contempo Gallery and told her that he felt connected to Marianna whenever he looked at it, as Falb then commented on how power Fisk and Marianna's love clearly was. Falb explained her own relationship with that concept of love and told Fisk that the painting was not Marianna's to give away, which had surprised Fisk.\n\nAlthough Fisk still tried to argue that Marianna was unaware of the painting's true origins, Falb was just offended as she explained how during World War II, she personally witnessed the Gestapo coming to her family and demanding everything that they had, including that painting, which had resulted with the Gestapo killing her father. Falb asked Fisk if he knew what it was like to see his father die in front of him, but before he could answer Falb continued her story of how she was marched across Poland and suffered along the way, telling Fisk that the painting was her only connection to that lost family.\n\nFalb then called Fisk a wolf and claimed that it was men just like him who had killed her family and took away her ability to love, which had horrified Fisk. When Falb told Fisk that she would not allow him to take anything more from her, Fisk acknowledged that she had been through a terrible amount of suffering and had told her that he knew Marianna would want Falb to keep the painting. Getting onto his feet, Fisk was asked if this was meant to mean anything to Falb, to which Fisk claimed that while it did not, it still meant a lot to him. Fisk took one final look at Rabbit in a Snowstorm before walking away.\n\nDisappointed about that result, Fisk was being driven back towards the Presidential Hotel where he was informed by Wellers about their current situation with Karen Page, with that she had just been taken into custody by Brett Mahoney, which Ray Nadeem had just allowed, which would result in Page being allowed to walk free. Fisk took this news with considerable anger as he asked Wellers to give him his jacket, before wrapping it around Wellers' head and furiously beating him until Wellers was dead, as Fisk told the driver to pull over and dump Wellers' corpse into the street while Fisk relaxed.[41]\n\nBelieving that Ray Nadeem had betrayed him, Fisk sent his team of assassins over into Nadeem's own house with the intention of killing his entire family out of revenge, only for Daredevil to arrive and help Nadeem and his family to escape.[41] However, Fisk's concerns with Nadeem were put back when he learned that Vanessa Marianna was almost in New York City, as Fisk immediately went out to greet her helicopter once it arrived, although Johnson tried to give Fisk an update about Nadeem's escape.\n\nFisk had then watched with sheer joy as Marianna stepped out of her helicopter and he was able to lay eyes on her for the first time in two years, ever since the FBI had taken him away to Rikers Island and Marianna had then consequently been forced to make her escape away to Europe to ensure that she was not also arrested. As they had stepped over to each other, Fisk and Marianna had held the hands of each other as Marianna flashed a beautiful smiled at him and greeted him, which filled Fisk's heart with sheer joy. Softly resting their heads together, they took in the happiness of a long dreamed reunion.\n\nEscorted by the FBI, Fisk then took Marianna back to the Presidential Hotel, while Fisk opened the door for his love and explained how the hotel had three restaurants, a spa and all of the staff that Marianna could ever need. While Marianna clearly delighted in this, Fisk noted that everything he had listed was all theirs, admitting that he had just bought the Hotel for Marianna to enjoy, noting that their Penthouse had the best view of New York City, commenting that it was their city to enjoy now that they were finally back together, to which Marianna noted that it was clear everything that Fisk had ever wanted.\n\nAs Fisk and Marianna had arrived on their floor, they found Benjamin Poindexter was waiting for them, although Fisk simply dismissed him despite Poindexter claiming to have something important to say. Fisk then showed Marianna the Penthouse, which had been decorated with candles and artwork ahead of her arrival, with the dinner table laid and waiting for her. As Marianna walked around in silence, Fisk offered to get her a drink, which Marianna turned down while Fisk commented that he had tried to decorate with his artwork as best he could, acknowledging that Marianna had better taste than he did.\n\nAs Fisk suggested that Marianna could curate her own collection to be displayed in the hotel, Marianna smiled and thanked him for being so generous to her, while Fisk insisted that he had only wanted her to feel welcome once she had arrived. Fisk then offered Marianna some food, however, she explained that she was not hungry but was just tired from her long trip back from Europe, as Fisk said that he should have realized that all of this could be overwhelming for her. Marianna then went upstairs to take her bath before going to sleep, leaving the disappointed Fisk stood alone inside his Penthouse once more.[47]\n\nThe next morning, Fisk sat in his Penthouse and looked at the empty wall where Rabbit in a Snowstorm was meant to be hung, until Fisk was then greeted by the arrival of Benjamin Poindexter, who came with his breakfast. When Poindexter then asked if he could get him anything else, Fisk simply ignored him, until Poindexter gave his apologies for his failure at killing Karen Page which Fisk had asked him to do, as he instead blamed Ray Nadeem's interference with Brett Mahoney for Page managing to get away from him with her life.\n\nFisk simply remained silent while Poindexter vowed that because of everything that Fisk had done for him, he would track down and kill Page, to which Fisk finally spoke up and told Poindexter that he would have another agent take charge of assassinating Page for him. While Poindexter attempted to defend himself and insisted that he could still handle Nadeem, Fisk commented that he simply wanted Poindexter to do nothing, commenting that he now believed that he had simply put too much of a burden onto Poindexter's shoulders, which led to this failure, much to Poindexter's disappointment.[47]\n\nLater that same morning, Fisk made his traditional breakfast omelet as he waited for Vanessa Marianna to get up, as Marianna claimed that a long flight usually made her exhausted. Marianna thanked Fisk for making her favorite breakfast as she sat opposite him, with Fisk desperate to make Marianna's breakfast perfect as he questioned if she wanted anything more. Despite everything, Fisk suspected that something was wrong, as he had asked her to tell him what it was so that he could try to make it right.\n\nMarianna explained to Fisk that while she had been away, she had always been surrounded by his bodyguards, which lead to the life where she was always fine and the day was always nice, but nothing more. Marianna commented on one day she had in Bilbao where she was surrounded by hundreds of people and yet felt incredibly alone, as Fisk acknowledged that they had both been lonely since being apart. Marianna told Fisk that despite their reunion, she still felt a certain level of distance, as Fisk asked what he could do to change this for Marianna, still desperate to make her comfortable.\n\nHowever, they were interrupted by Felix Manning's arrival as he first apologized and asked for a private word, as Fisk then apologized to Marianna before leaving. Once inside of his basement, Fisk warned Manning never to discuss their business in front of Marianna, before Manning explained that Ray Nadeem had still not been located, but suspected that he would be taken to the Supreme Court Building due to an increase in their security, which could mean that Nadeem could intend to testify against Fisk. Enraged by this update, Fisk demanded to know just how Manning had still failed to kill Nadeem.\n\nClearly nervous, Manning explained that Daredevil had prevented them from killing Nadeem, commenting that he had executed those men responsible but offered his resignation if Fisk still blamed him personally for this failure. Considering this for a moment, Fisk then calmed back down and had commented on how Manning had been able to keep Marianna safe in Europe for two years while Fisk had been in Rikers Island, commenting that he would provide Manning with whatever he needed to ensure that Nadeem was killed and that Fisk would not be indicted by Nadeem's legal testimony.\n\nUnder Fisk's orders, Manning sent out his assassins to attempt to kill Nadeem as he and Matt Murdock made their way across New York City towards the Court Building, resulting in a furious chase across the streets which Nadeem barely survived. However, while Nadeem and Murdock made it to the building, Fisk had already threatened the jury, resulting in them choosing not to indict Fisk. Once this had been done, Fisk watched Blake Tower speaking on WHiH World News as he announced the news, while Fisk saw his success over Nadeem's attempt to return him to prison with considerable satisfaction.[47]\n\nWith the threat of Ray Nadeem indicting him done with, Fisk had then returned into his Penthouse where he found Vanessa Marianna sitting alone, finding her beside Rabbit in a Snowstorm, while the surprised Fisk questioned how it got there. Marianna then explained that the painting had been a gift from Benjamin Poindexter who had claimed that he managed to convince Esther Falb to part with it, as Fisk noted how he had intended for the painting to remain with Falb.\n\nMarianna then told Fisk that Poindexter had asked to be thought of as their new James Wesley, as she questioned if this was accurate, which Fisk immediately denied, only claiming that Poindexter could be useful to them. As they were talking, Fisk noticed a drop of blood on the frame of the painting, which was likely Falb's, before Marianna questioned if Poindexter was dangerous, to which Fisk insisted that it was nothing for her to be concerned about. Fisk promised that he would handle Poindexter, while Marianna demanded to know exactly how, despite Fisk attempting to insist that it was not important.\n\nMarianna told Fisk that this was still important for her and insisted they finally start speaking plainly to each other. Marianna admitted that when she met him at the Scene Contempo Gallery, she was fascinated by his strength and brutality, making her want to observe him while she began to fall in love with him. However, Marianna then insisted that if he continued hiding things, she would still be as lonely in New York City as she was in Europe, noting how Fisk stopped his people talking in front of her and she wanted to be a part of his real world, although Fisk warned her about dirtying her own hands.\n\nMarianna insisted that her hands were never clean and asked Fisk to share his life with her, as Fisk took Marianna's hand and asked her to follow him. Entering his basement, Fisk found Felix Manning as well as Shelby, who were both surprised to see that he had just allowed Marianna to come inside, with Fisk confirmed that he was keeping a watch on everybody he felt he needed to. With Fisk's permission to speak freely, Manning then gave Fisk and Marianna his new update on Nadeem, who had been found in his house, commenting that Nadeem's testimony remained sealed and inadmissible.\n\nManning still suggested keeping Nadeem alive due to the public nature of his testimony, with Fisk suggesting that they force Nadeem to stand trial for the murder of Winn to turn the FBI against him and discrediting him in the press. Marianna, however, questioned how much Nadeem knew and how determined he was to hurt his business, before she suggested that instead they had Nadeem killed, telling Fisk to recruit Poindexter to assassinate Nadeem, which Fisk agreed to, resulting in Nadeem's corpse later being found in his own swimming pool, having been shot in the head by Poindexter.[47]\n\nWith Fisk's crimes now seemingly exonerated in the eyes of media, the people of New York City came to believe that Daredevil had set him up, Fisk set his focus on marrying Vanessa Marianna. While Fisk looked through his suits to find the perfect outfit to wear for their wedding, he also listened to the news as they discussed his conviction being overturned, questioning Karen Page and Blake Tower's recent attacks against him which were seemingly proven wrong.\n\nWhile Fisk chose which flower to wear on his suit, he found himself still haunted by the image of his younger self, covered in his father's blood. Marianna then came to visit Fisk, showing off her wedding dress while Fisk questioned if he really looked as nervous as he was, to which Marianna simply smiled and admitted that he did, calling it charming. Sitting Marianna down beside him, Fisk admitted that he never believed he could feel such love until he met her at the Scene Contempo Gallery, also claiming that he did not believe he was even capable of feeling such a love for another person like her.\n\nFisk told Marianna that he cared for her and her happiness more than anything else in his life. However, Fisk then also confessed that this concept had given him a terrible thought that perhaps his feelings were actually just a trick, and his vanity getting the best of him as his love for Marianna could just be due to how he saw his own reflection in her eyes. Fisk confessed that this thought filled him with dread, as he feared that he was unworthy of Marianna's love and was actually just a broken man, incapable of feeling that true love that he had so desperately wanted to feel for Marianna ever since meeting her.\n\nDespite Fisk's confessions about his own fears for his love for her, Marianna still claimed that everyone in the world was already broken, and the trick was instead to find the person whose broken pieces fit with your own, claiming that their own broken pieces just fit together perfectly. Helping him chose an outfit, Marianna handed Fisk a rose to wear on his suit as he smelled it softly, as Fisk turned around and faced his reflection in the mirror, with Marianna sat behind him while they prepared to finally marry one another as they had planned for so long, ever since they had been separated two years earlier.[48]\n\nFisk had invited several key figures in New York City's crime world to his wedding at Presidential Hotel, including some more high ranking criminal bosses from his previous meetings, including John Hammer and Latimer Zyl, who had arrived along with Rosalie Carbone, with both Hammer and Zyl still complaining about Fisk being so bold as to summon them all there at such short notice. Fisk and Vanessa Marianna then begun the wedding ceremony, with Fisk becoming momentarily lost in Marianna's eyes before continuing the ceremony.\n\nHaving said \"I do,\" Fisk and Marianna then finally wed one another, getting a round of applause from those in attendance. Heading into the dance hall, Fisk and Marianna stepped out to greet their guests, as Carbone first congratulated Marianna on a beautiful gown and ceremony before also speaking with Fisk, with Carbone noting her amusement at Fisk having her sat next to the prosecutor who had attempted to send her to prison. Carbone noted that she had been satisfied when she made the prosecutor hold her purse, noting that she knew this was due to the tax that she was paying to Fisk.\n\nFisk and Marianna were both then called up to have their first dance together as a married couple, while almost every single guest took out their phones to record their dance. As Fisk happily danced with the woman he loved in his arms, they soon noticed that something seemed to be wrong, since everybody in the room began watching a video that had been sent to all the phones at the same time. While Fisk tried to ignore this, he eventually grabbed a phone and realized the video was of Ray Nadeem, confessing his crimes and the crimes of the FBI moments before his death, exposing Fisk to the world.\n\nAs confusion mounted, Tammy Hattley informed Fisk that something was wrong and several agents were down. At that moment, Fisk and Marianna looked in horror as Benjamin Poindexter, dressed back in the Daredevil Suit, got on the stage and gave his toast to the couple, having just discovered that Fisk had Julie Barnes killed. Poindexter then threw the microphone directly at Marianna's head, only for it to be blocked by the arrival of Daredevil. Fisk and Marianna were then dragged away to safety, as Daredevil and Poindexter furiously fought each other, both intended to attack Fisk for their own reasons.[48]\n\nOnce they made it back into their Penthouse, Fisk expressed his fury at Benjamin Poindexter being able to attack them and ruin their wedding, while Vanessa Marianna commented on the threat that Ray Nadeem posed to them which was why she had ordered his death. Fisk vowed to discredit Nadeem and get revenge on Poindexter, only for Marianna to tell him to hold back his anger so that they could escape, knowing Poindexter still posed a serious threat.\n\nFisk commented to Marianna that she had not made a mistake with marrying him, which she accepted but still pushed him to escape with her before Poindexter could come after them. Just as Fisk made it upstairs to the bedroom where he planned on escaping through the basement door, he found himself face to face with Daredevil. Seeing his enemy again, Fisk told Marianna to run, as Daredevil commented that everything Fisk had rebuilt was now done with. Filled with rage, both Kingpin and Daredevil roared at one another before Daredevil charged at Kingpin, knocking him straight through a wall.\n\nFisk soon gained control of the fight as he furiously threw Daredevil through a wall and began beating down on him with all his might until Daredevil was able to get back onto his feet and, with a few well-placed strikes, knocked Fisk down the stairs. However, Fisk became distracted from his fight with Daredevil as he saw that Poindexter had entered the Penthouse and was making his way to Marianna, as he intended to kill her in revenge for Julie Barnes' death. Daredevil, however, was the one to get to Poindexter first, kicking him away and getting Marianna to safety as he and Poindexter began to fight.\n\nBefore Poindexter could throw items at Marianna to try and kill her, Fisk had charged towards him and then began furiously beating him against a brick wall, although Poindexter's quick reflexes allowed him to dodge the punches as Fisk accidentally punched the brick wall, causing him considerable pain. While Poindexter landed some strikes against Fisk and hit him with a steel bowl, he had proved no match against Fisk's rage as he threw Poindexter up the stairs, beating him against the walls before launching him back as Poindexter had then smashed straight through the glass and landed on the table below.\n\nWhile Poindexter was briefly taken out of the fight, Fisk was attacked by Daredevil, only for Fisk's rage to allow him then take Daredevil's punches as he punched him back and, with all his rage built up, lifted Daredevil straight into the air and smashed him straight through the kitchen table before continuing to beat him down. This was soon broken up as Poindexter attempted to kill them both by breaking a chandelier over their heads, only for Daredevil to kick Fisk back and roll away himself before it could land on them, while Poindexter had continued throwing knives at Fisk, hitting his protective jacket.\n\nThis clash was once again taken away by Daredevil, who blocked everything that Poindexter threw at him before fighting him one on one, while Fisk wrapped Marianna in his coat and attempted to use the distraction to take her away to safety. However, Poindexter soon managed to subdue Daredevil while throwing him through a window before picking up some shards of broken glass and throwing them at Fisk who, now without his protective jacket, was impaled by the shards, causing him considerable pain. While Fisk ripped the shards out of his skin, Daredevil had continued battling against Poindexter.\n\nDespite Daredevil soon regaining the upper hand over Poindexter as he had beat him down, Poindexter had spotted an opportunity to kill Marianna, as he grabbed a steel bowl and threw it with considerable force at her head, only for Daredevil to leap up at the last moment and block it from hitting Marianna. Fisk, enraged by Poindexter's continued attempts to murder his wife, charged at him and lifted him up off the ground before slamming Poindexter's back straight into a brick wall in the corner at full force. This resulted in Poindexter's spine being crushed, leaving him paralyzed on the floor.\n\nNow with Poindexter out of their fight, Fisk turned his attention back to Daredevil and, despite being wounded by Poindexter's last attack, Fisk continued attempting to beat Daredevil to death. However, it soon became apparent that, no matter how much strength and rage Fisk still had, Daredevil remained the superior fighter and still had more energy than Fisk, as Daredevil managed to land several strong hits against Fisk, beating him down until Fisk then managed to land a head butt that knocked Daredevil back for a brief moment, while Fisk then locked eyes with Marianna who had continued watching.\n\nDistracted by looking at his beloved wife, Fisk lowered his arms and allowed Daredevil to continue beating him, as Fisk was beaten down onto his knees and repeatedly struck in the face, as Fisk's blood had stained Rabbit in a Snowstorm as Fisk was finally beaten down into submission. As Marianna screamed in horror, Daredevil considered snapping Fisk's neck, only to stop himself and roar in rage, while Fisk still told Daredevil that he would continue hunting Karen Page as well as Foggy Nelson and he would expose Daredevil's true identity to the world and demanding that Daredevil kill him once and for all.\n\nKnowing that his death would destroy Daredevil's soul forever, Fisk noted that no prison like Rikers Island would be able to hold him in and continued to demand that Daredevil kill him. Daredevil, however, refused to allow Fisk to destroy who he was, furiously vowing that Fisk would spend the rest of his life in his cage, being kept far away from Marianna and knowing that New York City had rejected him and that Daredevil had beaten him. Daredevil had then lifted up his mask, revealing Matt Murdock underneath, while demanding that Fisk keep his secret and never attempt to assassinate Page or Nelson.\n\nDaredevil had then threatened that if he did not agree, then he would prove that Marianna ordered the death of Ray Nadeem. Looking at Marianna, Fisk confessed that he had failed her and admitted that this had been the happiest day of his life, as she told him that all she ever wanted was him. With that, Fisk agreed to Daredevil's terms in order to keep Marianna safe. Having shaken hands, Fisk watched as Daredevil left before Brett Mahoney and his team arrived to arrest Fisk and Marianna, taking the paralyzed Poindexter into custody as Mahoney acknowledged Poindexter was not the real Daredevil.\n\nHaving finally been defeated, Fisk was taken outside in handcuffs by Mahoney, along with several FBI agents who had also been exposed by Nadeem's video, including Tammy Hattley. While Fisk was being moved to Mahoney's police car to be taken back to prison, he asked Mahoney to have one final chance to say goodbye to Marianna, who was being put into a separate police car; however, Mahoney refused as he noted how Fisk had not done the same for all the men who he murdered. As Marianna was taken away from him, Fisk roared out in frustration before being taken into police custody once again.[48]\n\nIn 2018, Kingpin survived the Snap.[10][11] Due to the scandal that arose from the FBI being corrupted, Kingpin was acquitted of his crimes and his involvement in the corruption.[49] By 2021, he was freed from prison, and still retained a modicum of his criminal power and influence.[11] With the intention of getting all of his lost power back,[50] Kingpin resumed his alliance with the Tracksuit Mafia, with William Lopez as his second-in-command.[51] Kingpin ran his criminal empire alongside his wife Vanessa Marianna,[52] who changed her surname to Fisk.[53]. He also informed Vanessa that Daredevil was Matt Murdock.[54] During this time, Kingpin returned to wearing his father's cufflinks instead of the ones his wife had picked for him. As a means to expand his reach and generate additional revenue, Kingpin founded Sloan Limited to serve as a front for money laundering[10] as well as Fisk Shipping, a railway cargo shipping company with facilities in multiple states.[11][55] He also built relationships with other leaders of the criminal underworld in New York City,[13] including the Five Families.[53]\n\nFisk's plans to maintain his empire were interrupted when Ronin started hunting down criminals across the globe,[56] although Kingpin's power and influence kept Ronin from attacking him.[51] Seeking to take advantage of Ronin's crusade, Kingpin had Ronin kill the Tracksuit Mafia leaders by informing Ronin, via an informant, that they were attending a meeting at Fat Man Auto Repair. Kingpin informed Kazi Kazimierczak about his plans, who kept his silence on the inside job despite his loyalty to William. As a result, Ronin massacred multiple Tracksuit Mafia members, including William. With Lopez gone, Fisk took over leadership of the Tracksuit Mafia and began mentoring Maya Lopez.[51] Kingpin was soon approached by Henry Lopez, the brother of William who wanted to leave the business after his brother's death. In response, Kingpin threatened to kill Henry if he tried to walk away and instead appointed him to manage the Fisk Shipping facility in Tamaha, Oklahoma.[19]\n\nIn 2021, Fisk was informed that Maya Lopez was being arrested by the New York City Police Department, so he went to the crime scene to release her personally as the officers, having recognized him, chose not to stand in his way. With the help of an interpreter, Fisk told Lopez that her reckless behavior concerned him, adding that he mourned her father as well and that he understood her rage.\n\nLopez doubted that he understood what she felt, so Fisk told her that his father was killed as well when he was twelve years old, omitting the fact that he had been the one to kill him. Fisk added that the pain he felt at the moment his father died was something he had never felt again since, and asked Lopez to let him help her channel her rage in a constructive way.\n\nFisk sent Lopez to assist his men in attacking a rival criminal enterprise that was planning to move on his territory, in which they succeeded even despite Daredevil's interference. Fisk commended on Lopez's performance, noting that none of his men could hold their own against the vigilante the same way as she did. Fisk asked her if she found his exercise useful to her and Lopez replied positively to Fisk's satisfaction. He stated that Lopez lacked a purpose and a place to call her own, but now that she was with Fisk, he would make sure she had everything she needed.\n\nFisk started mentoring Lopez, while falsely assuring her that he had dedicated all of his resources to finding Ronin and bringing him to justice. Lopez made Fisk promise that when he found Ronin, she would be the one to kill him to avenge her father, which Fisk agreed with.[11] Fisk assigned Lopez to multiple missions, and during one of their Sunday evening dinners, Fisk raised a toast for Lopez stating that she had completed her final lesson, telling Lopez that she was ready to put her skills to a practical use. He then dismissed the ASL interpreter while signifying to one of his men to assassinate her in the hallway and get rid of the body. Lopez then became one of Fisk's most trusted subordinates and murdered many people on his behalf.[19] Fisk also gave Lopez her father's position as commander of the Tracksuit Mafia, with Kazi Kazimierczak appointed as her second-in-command.[51]\n\nIn December 2024, Kingpin learned that Armand Duquesne III had become aware that Eleanor Bishop was working for him and had threatened to expose them both, leading to Kingpin deciding to have him murdered,[56] so he would not be able to disclose the sensible information.[57] Kingpin ordered Bishop to do it, covering their tracks by altering the data to make Jack Duquesne listed as the CEO of Sloan Limited. When Clint Barton appeared in the city and targeted Kingpin's business, he became concerned that an Avenger had taken an interest in his operations, so he put a bounty on Barton's head and had Bishop hire Yelena Belova to assassinate him.\n\nKingpin was invited to attend a meeting with Bishop, as Bishop reminded Kingpin of their good relationship and how she had always done as she was told, to which Kingpin noted that this was expected while she still held a debt to him, which Derek Bishop had left behind after his death in the Battle of New York. While Bishop insisted she had paid off this debt, Kingpin noted she had made herself wealthy as well, noting he helped provide this.\n\nAs Bishop reminded Kingpin that she had killed Armand, and caused her fiancé to take the blame, she explained that her daughter had returned to New York City, and was getting too close to learn the truth, which Bishop refused to allow. Kingpin stated that there cannot be lines drawn in his business, to which Bishop told him that she would instead leave the business entirely, as Kingpin demanded her not to be rash.\n\nIgnoring Kingpin's warnings, Bishop explained that she had kept copies of all their dealings as her own insurance policy against him, believing that this would protect her from Kingpin's fury. In the spirit of the holidays, Kingpin gave Bishop a minute to rethink the decision that she was making, but Bishop declared that she did not need a minute, and proceeded to walk out of the meeting, leaving Kingpin enraged.[10]\n\nWhile Fisk was making plans with Kazi Kazimierczak, they were then joined by Maya Lopez, as Fisk got to his feet and noted that he had seen Lopez at the end of several tough fights, but there was something more going on, with Fisk inviting Lopez to tell him about her fights with Ronin, all while Kazimierczak translated. As Lopez said nothing, Fisk reminded her that he had taught her to keep a low profile.\n\nIn response, Lopez apologized to Fisk, admitting that she had gotten carried away, with Kazimierczak continuing to translate for Fisk. When Lopez noted that Fisk knew what her father had meant to her, Fisk then insisted that he meant a lot to all of them, continuing to maintain the lie that he was not involved in his death. Lopez then told Fisk that she had come to her senses, promising that she would focus on the job.\n\nSurprised, Fisk noted that this was quite the change of heart, to which Lopez noted that no matter what she did, she could not bring her father back, and that finding whoever killed him, would not change anything, with Fisk still not reacting to the references to her father's killer. Instead, Fisk had told Lopez that her father would have wanted her to move on, suggesting he wished her father could see the woman she became.\n\nLopez had then asked Fisk if she could have a couple of days off from her work in order to clear her head, which Fisk had agreed with, noting that it seemed reasonable in the circumstances. Once Lopez went to leave, Fisk stopped her, before telling her in sign language that he loved her, which Lopez said back to him. With that, Lopez left, although Fisk still remained skeptical about her true intentions, as he had considered what to do.\n\nFisk began to complain to Kazimierczak about Ronin seemingly returning to New York City, while he also had to deal with Hawkeye taking an interest in his operations. As Fisk became increasingly angry about all of these complications which had arisen, he had then raged about Eleanor Bishop quitting her position within his organization, seemingly not taking their operation's work as seriously as they had needed her to do.\n\nFisk then concluded that Lopez had also seemingly turned against him and their Tracksuit Mafia, which Kazimierczak agreed with, as they both believed that Lopez had most likely uncovered the truth about her father's death. Fisk asked Kazimierczak what he thought they should do about it, wanted to test his loyalty. Fisk stepped up to Kazimierczak and noted that people needed to be reminded that he owned the city.[10]\n\nRemaining enraged by Eleanor Bishop's decision to leave his organisation, Kingpin sent the Tracksuit Mafia to Rockefeller Center to assassinate her, with Kazi Kazimierczak leading all their attacks. However, the Tracksuits were confronted by Hawkeye and Kate Bishop, allowing Eleanor to escape. Despite this, Kingpin caught up to Eleanor's car and furiously killed her driver, before he ripped the car door away.\n\nAs Kingpin told Eleanor that he would not allow her to leave, and attempted to pull her out of the car, he was confronted by Kate, who aimed her bow and arrow at Kingpin, demanding he leave her mother alone. Unimpressed, Kingpin questioned what she would do with the weapon, to which Kate then responded by shooting an arrow into Kingpin's chest. However, Kingpin's hidden body armor allowed him to survive the shot, as he snapped the arrow.\n\nShocked by this, Kate took a grappling arrow at shot at Kingpin again, only for him to grab it in mid air, and then furiously pull Kate towards him, before punching her in the air, knocking her back down onto the ground. As Kingpin removed his jacket and prepared to kill Kate, he was suddenly and unexpectedly struck by Eleanor's car, as she had moved into the driver's seat and driven at him, causing Kingpin to crash through a shop window.\n\nKingpin soon recovered from the impact and got back onto his feet, ready to kill Eleanor, who was injured from the impact. However, Kate had once again stood between Kingpin and his revenge, as she attempted to punch him, only for Kingpin to grapple with his bow, insisting that Kate was in over her head. Kingpin managed to throw Kate to the ground and moved towards Eleanor, as Kate fired an electrified shield arrow, blocking Kingpin's path.\n\nThis enraged Kingpin even more, as Kate attempted to attack him again, only for Kingpin to punch her hard in the stomach, knocking her across the room. Kingpin attacked Kate as she attempted to crawl away, grabbing hold of her Quiver and throwing her across the room, before breaking her arrows in half, telling her to mind her business. Despite these warnings, Kate again attempted to get Kingpin into an armlock, only for him to throw her aside.\n\nIn spite of everything, Kate still refused to give up, as she slid under Kingpin's legs and confronted him again, only for Kingpin to push her backwards once more, as Kingpin told her that she was beginning to annoy him. However, as Kingpin had taken a step towards her, walking over all of the broken trick arrows, Kate had then revealed that she had managed to steal one of his cufflinks, which she flicked down at the broken arrows.\n\nOnce the cufflink had struck the broken arrow heads, it caused a chain reaction, as multiple arrows exploded at once, causing a massive fireball, fireworks and shockwaves. All of these blasts happened directly under Kingpin's feet, causing him to get thrown backwards and hitting his head against a pillar, knocking him unconscious. Once Kate was sure Kingpin was unconscious and unable to fight, she went to check on her mother.[10]\n\nEventually, the New York City Police Department arrived at the scene and arrested Eleanor Bishop for her part in all of Kingpin's schemes, but he had managed to get out of the scene before the officers could find him. Still wounded following his battle against Kate Bishop, Kingpin painfully made his way through the streets of New York City, until his path was blocked by a car.\n\nAs the car pulled up in front of him, Kingpin realized that the driver was Maya Lopez, as he breathed a sigh of relief, only for Lopez to reveal a gun. Kingpin soon realized that Lopez had indeed learned that Kingpin had been responsible for her father's death at the hands of Ronin. Kingpin then told Lopez that they were family, and that families did not always see eye to eye. Lopez responded by shooting him, causing Kingpin to fall down.[10]\n\nLopez assumed Kingpin was killed and fled the scene, unaware that he had survived the shot and was put under hospital care. While Kingpin remained in the hospital, his damaged eye was covered with with an eyepatch and a bandage while it healed.[11] During this time, Vanessa Fisk sat by his bedside for months, waiting for him to awaken.[53] Kingpin's survival was also kept a secret, with the underworld believing that he had been killed, and a bounty was placed on Lopez's head.[11]\n\nFive months later, Fisk finally recovered enough and was able to leave the hospital. He was informed that the Black Knife Cartel found Maya Lopez in Tamaha and was about to kill her in retribution for destroying one of their arms shipment in New York. He called Zane and ordered him and his men to stand down, just as he was about to execute both Lopez and her uncle. Fisk then decided to see Lopez personally and took his private jet to Oklahoma, awaiting her return at the Battiest Residence.[58] As Fisk approached her, Lopez immediately tried to distance herself, before Fisk's men surrounded and subdued her.\n\nWhile she struggled, Fisk came closer and applied Translator Contact Lens to her eyes, which he commissioned so they could converse freely. Shocked that Fisk was not dead, she asked why he was there, to which Fisk replied that he simply wanted to have a Sunday family dinner like they used to. Lopez snarked that it was Tuesday but she entered the house with Fisk regardless. As they went to the dining room, Fisk told Lopez that he was not angry with her, while taking off his eyepatch and showing Lopez the damage from the gunshot. Fisk said that Lopez only did what she thought she had to do, which impressed him, and remarked that there must be a part of her that was happy to see Fisk alive.\n\nLopez disagreed with that, saying that she wanted him dead, but Fisk argued that the expression of relief on her face said otherwise. He expressed his disappointment that Lopez was so quick to assume the worst and turn against Fisk, as she used to see him as a hero, but she said that was no longer the case. Fisk replied that despite everything, he still cared about her and did not want to see her getting hurt. Fisk presented Lopez with wine he had brought, and she told him that she would open it. Fisk explored the house and looked at the picture of Lopez and her family, and once she returned, Lopez nonchalantly said that she poured the wine down the drain, which did not upset Fisk too much.\n\nAs the two sat down with cookies from Lopez's favorite bakery, Fisk accidentally dropped some kitchenware and seeing Lopez alerted at him holding a knife, Fisk simply handed it to Lopez. Fisk insisted that he knew everything about Lopez and they cannot trust anyone but each other. Lopez then inquired why Fisk actually came to her, so he proposed her to come back to New York City with him, adding that he is willing to hand over the control of his criminal empire to her in exchange. Seeing Lopez conflicted, Fisk said that he would be waiting at the Choctaw Casino until tomorrow, asking Lopez to consider his offer, before leaving.[19]\n\nOn the next night, while Fisk was at the Choctaw Casino, Maya Lopez arrived and held him at the gunpoint, as Fisk anticipated her trying to kill him again. Fisk took a seat in the chair and told Lopez that he had always loved her like a daughter, but Lopez replied that all her childhood was only a fantasy that made her view him as a hero, instead of a monster. Fisk argued that at every point, Lopez knew what she was a part of and never questioned why she had to kill all those people. Lopez did not budge and claimed that Fisk isolated her from a normal life but never truly cared about her, implying that he gave her Translator Contact Lens only because he never cared enough to learn ASL.\n\nIn response, Fisk lashed out at her that he was always there for her but admitted that he had failed Lopez, the same way his own father failed him. Fisk then showed Lopez a hammer that he kept as a memorabilia of what he had to do to become the man he was now. He told Lopez that his father only felt strong when he was abusing his mother, so Fisk had to become stronger and stop him. Lopez was shocked to find out that Fisk killed his own father, to which Fisk responded that he had to do it to become free and move forward with his life. Fisk then handed the hammer over to Lopez, encouraging her to kill him and free herself like he did, while also freeing Fisk himself.\n\nLopez hesitated for a few moments, before refusing to go along with Fisk's suggestion and put the hammer away. Fisk remarked that both of them have come the full circle now, adding that he expects her to return with him tomorrow. The next morning, Fisk boarded his private jet and waited for Lopez, however, he was informed by his subordinates that Lopez left Tamaha and they were unable to tail her, which greatly enraged him.[19]\n\nFisk later came to a postal office, where he saw Chula Battiest dropping several envelops, so he helped her pick them up. Battiest noted that Fisk was not a local, asking if he came for the powwow, to which he elusively agreed to. Fisk noted that he did not expect to see so many people in town, to which Battiest replied that guests come all over for the Choctaw powwows. Fisk then took notice of Battiest's necklace, which said \"I love you\" in ASL, and when Battiest asked if Fisk could sign, he said that he was trying for his niece. Battiest said that she learned ASL for her late daughter and Fisk mentioned that he also lost a person he loved which hurt him quite a lot. Battiest told him that she kept it up for her granddaughter, but when Fisk asked about her, he confirmed that they were both talking about Lopez all along.[13]\n\nKingpin then ordered his men to capture Chula Battiest and Bonnie, while the Black Knife Cartel infiltrated the Choctaw Nation Powwow and waited until for further orders. Maya Lopez confronted Kingpin with a gun in her hand, but Kingpin revealed that he had Battiest and Bonnie as his hostages, while his men surrounded Lopez.\n\nWith Bonnie acting as an interpreter, Kingpin expressed his disappointment in Lopez, who betrayed him after he offered her everything, but Lopez argued that Kingpin was the one who betrayed her. She insisted that Battiest and Bonnie were her true family and they had nothing to do with this, to which Kingpin replied that now he knew how much it would hurt her when he killed them just like he killed Lopez's father.\n\nKingpin then ordered his men to attack Lopez, however, she was able to summon the powers of her ancestors and pass them over to Battiest and Bonnie. To Kingpin's shock, the three of them were able to fight back against his men. Kingpin then attempted to charge at Lopez himself, but she was able to stop him by touching his heart with her powers. She then tapped into his mind and sent Kingpin into the memories of his childhood, where he found himself at his old house. Kingpin was able to hear his father beating his mother through the cracked wall, which made him succumb to his trauma.\n\nAs Kingpin was on the verge of a breakdown, Lopez appeared in front of him and told Kingpin that he must let go of the pain and anger inside of him. She pleaded with him, saying that he was still her uncle no matter what and he must shut out the voice of his father, but Kingpin screamed that he was not the person Lopez wanted him to be. He then reached for the hammer, to which Lopez asked him to hand it over, but Kingpin was unable to let go of the pain completely. As Lopez restored them to reality, a distraught Kingpin grabbed her hands and demanded her to know what she had done to him. The experience proved to be too much for Kingpin, who then abandoned his plans to kill Lopez and her family and ordered his men to retreat.[13]\n\nFisk boarded his private jet in order to return to New York City and contacted his associates, claiming that the situation must be stabilized before it spiraled out of their control. While talking over the phone, Fisk saw NY1 reporting on the upcoming race for the New York mayor and watched Pat Kiernan and Errol Louis talk about an ideal candidate who would take care of the city's legitimate issues.\n\nAs they mentioned that there was still a window of opportunity for a surprise candidate to emerge, Fisk expressed interest in joining the mayoral race.[13] Upon returning home, he spoke with Vanessa and informed her of his mayoral ambitions before he distanced himself from her, leaving Vanessa to continue to run his empire by herself. During this time, Fisk lost weight and gained more muscle, and began wearing darker colored suits once more. Later that year, Fisk learned that Foggy Nelson had been killed by Benjamin Poindexter.[53]\n\nIn late 2026, Fisk was notified that he had received the two hundred thousand signatures necessary to officially run for mayor. He enjoyed a small meal before he went to get dressed, and briefly lingered on a white suit before opting for a gray one.\n\nHe headed to a warehouse where Vanessa Fisk was conducting a meeting with the Five Families and interrupted it, telling Vanessa that he needed to speak with her. As the other criminals swiftly left, Vanessa chided Wilson for returning after months away and then prematurely ending a Families meeting, while Wilson merely commended her for having kept them in line in his absence while also having garnered their respect.\n\nWilson stated that he was broken and shattered[53] by Maya Lopez[13] and that he had to put himself back together, but that during his recovery process, his love for Vanessa and his desire to help New York City had been reignited. He notified Vanessa that during his mayoral campaign, his assets could not be perceived as illegal, and Vanessa assured him that she had structured their businesses to elude scrutiny. Wilson then told her that he had the sufficient signatures and that it was time for him to officially declare his mayoral candidacy.[53]\n\nWith the sufficient signatures obtained, Fisk got on television and began speaking about the state of vigilantes in New York City and how they needed to be stopped in order to make the city safer. Fisk then declared that he would be able to fix the system and the city publicly announced this candidacy for mayor of New York City, using the slogan \"Fisk Can Fix It.\" Fisk hired Sheila Rivera to serve as his assistant and political advisor, while Buck Cashman served as his assistant and right-hand man. As he watched the polls, Rivera informed him that rivals Roger Cressna and Diana Montoya were ahead of him, and that he needed to refine his message for the upcoming debate, to which Fisk stated that his message was already clear.\n\nAs Cashman stated that Fisk's messaging did not need refining, a young man behind Fisk chimed in and agreed with him, and claimed that Fisk was all over social media, including on The BB Report, and that \"Fisk Can Fix It\" was trending. Fisk asked the man who he was, who responded that his name was Daniel Blake. Fisk asked Blake why he would vote for him, and Blake replied that Fisk had made something for himself and that he believed he would do the same for New York before profanely stating that Mayor Fisk was the coolest thing he had heard. Fisk asked Rivera where she had found Blake, and Rivera informed Fisk that Blake had single-handedly canvasses over two thousand signatures for Fisk and that he was cheap to employ. Fisk then gave Blake a look and then walked out of the room, followed by Cashman and Rivera.\n\nOne night, Fisk participated in the mayoral debate against Cressna, where he informed the public that he had been shot by a vigilante and discussed the dangers of vigilantism. When Cressna stated that he agreed with him, Fisk balked that Cressna was posing and that while Cressna proposed registration for vigilantism, Fisk wanted to treat the problem at its root by outlawing vigilantism.\n\nThe next day, Fisk exited a NY1 station and greeted his fans when he noticed Matt Murdock outside. Fisk told Cashman it was fine when he tried to keep him from getting near Fisk. He approached Murdock and remarked that it had been quite some time since they last met. Murdock then asked Fisk if they could have a conversation, and Fisk agreed; Fisk then followed Murdock as the pair walked to Square Diner.[53]\n\nSitting across from each other in a booth, Fisk listened to Matt Murdock comment on his muscle gain as a result of his weight loss, causing Fisk to tell Murdock that he was not intending to fight him. Fisk then remarked that it was not entirely unpleasant to see Murdock and asked about his life. Fisk briefly mentioned his tutelage of Maya Lopez, resulting in her shooting him in the face, which they both laughed off.\n\nAs they continued to talk, they both reflected over how they stopped visiting Hell's Kitchen as much and that they had both improved in their careers. Fisk explained his intentions for becoming mayor, but Murdock was doubtful due to Fisk's multiple attempts to kill him, although Fisk accused Murdock of the same. Murdock insisted that he never tried to kill Fisk, who was unconvinced. Fisk took the opportunity to assure Murdock that he had nothing to do with Foggy Nelson's death, as per their promise.\n\nMurdock believed that Fisk was using being the mayor of New York to serve his own goals, but Fisk answered that he genuinely wanted to fix the city. Fisk asked Murdock why he stopped being Daredevil, which was due to him trying to kill Benjamin Poindexter. Fisk spoke about dealing with their violent natures and the power it had over them. When Murdock threatened to bring down Fisk if he reverted to his old ways, he responded that when elected mayor, he would not tolerate vigilantes, threatening Murdock to not return as Daredevil. With the two understanding each other, Murdock got up and left the diner.[53]\n\nHaving gained the majority of votes, Wilson won the election and became the new mayor of New York. As his campaign team celebrated around him, Wilson looked over to Vanessa Fisk, and the two silently shared a glance at each other. Upon giving a speech about making New York safer, Wilson was joined by Vanessa on the roof, where he revealed that he knew that she having an affair with a man named Adam. Vanessa made Wilson promise that he would not kill Adam, and she then left, leaving Wilson to overlook the city.[53] On December 31, 2026, Fisk gave a speech that was broadcasted, where he denounced vigilantes such as Punisher, Spider-Man, and Daredevil.[52]\n\nWhile Sheila Rivera outlined the day's agenda, Fisk asked about the desk he was sitting at, wondering if Fiorello La Guardia sat at the same one. Fisk explained that La Guardia was a hero of his father's, being the only man he respected. Fisk returned to his agenda, expressing his wish to push the meet and greets, but Rivera emphasized the importance of establishing connections within the first few days. Rivera also brought up that his wife's public absence was hurting his image, so Fisk decided to work on that.\n\nWhile stuck in traffic with Rivera, Buck Cashman, and Daniel Blake, Fisk was advised by them on where his strongest supporters were located throughout New York. Fisk expressed his desire to want to fix the city, although Rivera told him that he should just maintain the status quo. Learning that a pothole was causing the traffic, Fisk got out of his car and ordered nearby construction workers to get it filled. A crowd of people gathered, and Fisk reiterated his promise to fix things.[52]\n\nAs a favor for Daniel Blake, Fisk agreed to meet with BB Urich. Fisk remarked that Urich's coverage of his campaign was spot on and he admired that she took him seriously. Fisk then learned that Urich was related to Ben Urich, so Fisk told her that he knew her uncle and that he was a good journalist. Fisk listened to Urich talk about how Commissioner Phil Gallo was resigning, which would hurt Fisk, as many other officers were also going to step down in protest.[52]\n\nFisk arrived at the funeral for Kel Shanahan to speak with Commissioner Phil Gallo about his retirement. Gallo immediately berated Fisk, knowing he has been responsible for the deaths of many other police officers. Fisk attempted to move past the issue, but Gallo explained that he intended to end Fisk's term as mayor. Before walking away, Gallo called Fisk out for not actually loving New York, but was just a monster trying to rewrite his legacy.\n\nKnowing that Gallo would never accept him as mayor, Fisk resorted to his past methods and blackmailed Gallo by getting Buck Cashman to track down Gallo's secret son, using him as leverage. Gallo met with Fisk to declare his retirement, but Fisk revealed his blackmail. Fisk worsened the situation by making major cuts to the NYPD, forcing Gallo to not retire. Fisk then spoke to Cashman about blackmail, claiming that anyone could be swayed by a piece of paper before he referred to his cheesesteak as having been disgusting.[52]\n\nWilson and Vanessa Fisk agreed to seek marriage counseling, so they met with Heather Glenn. In their first session, Vanessa explained to Glenn how she and Wilson ran their business together, but then Wilson left for a long time, which caused a strain in their marriage. Wilson talked about being attacked by Maya Lopez, and how that required him to distance himself while he recovered. When Glenn asked to hear more from Fisk, he simply stated that he did not want to lose Vanessa.[52]\n\nDuring breakfast, Wilson was informed by Sheila Rivera that there was a double homicide at Red Hook Pier from a hijacking gone wrong. When Rivera left, Vanessa told Wilson that the Five Families were creating a mess and turning on each other because neither of them were at the head of the table. Vanessa worried that once they killed each other, whoever was left would come after Wilson, but he replied that their former life was no longer a concern for them.\n\nDuring another session, Wilson and Vanessa spoke privately while Heather Glenn stepped outside, with Vanessa revealing that she sent Buck Cashman to settle the feud between the Five Families. Wilson expressed his concern of not being able to trust Vanessa, but she explained that she wanted to keep the peace. Wilson felt that peace needed to be broken and to let chaos reign so that a stronger order could be built. Vanessa accused Wilson of punishing her for her affair, but Wilson claimed he was not.[59]\n\nWhen the trial of Hector Ayala ended in a not-guilty verdict, Fisk called on Daniel Blake to schedule another interview with himself and BB Urich. On the record, he disavowed Ayala and the result of the case, declaring vigilantism an affront to the rule of law. He told Urich that he intended to make good on his campaign promise: to bring justice to New York's vigilantes and let the rule of law prevail.[59]\n\nIn another session with Heather Glenn, it was suggested they discuss Vanessa Fisk's affair with Adam, although Wilson was uncomfortable with the matter. Wilson stated that it was a betrayal, but Vanessa responded that Wilson leaving her was also a betrayal.\n\nWilson listened as Vanessa talked about what drew her to Adam, as well as how her father's behavior crushed her mother and that she did not want to feel the same, as Wilson leaving hurt her. Wilson was surprised to learn this, as Vanessa had never told him. Wilson revealed to Glenn that he confronted Adam, claiming that they just talked and he expressed how important Vanessa was to him. Wilson lied about not knowing where Adam was currently. Glenn the concluded the session by telling them that forgiveness was the only way forward. Before leaving, Glenn asked to speak with Vanessa alone, so Wilson left the room.[8]\n\nFisk brought Sheila Rivera, Daniel Blake, and Buck Cashman to Red Hook Port, where he explained to them his intention to transform it into a new industrial district. Fisk wanted Blake to set up a press conference immediately to make his announcement, but Rivera stopped them, reminding Fisk that there was a process they needed to go through first.\n\nAs Rivera explained how city government worked, she brought up the recent mob shooting, which has made people uneasy about the location. Committed to doing things the right way, Fisk asked Rivera on how they needed to start, so Rivera detailed the timeline of steps needed to be completed, which Fisk accepted. Speaking privately with Cashman, Fisk was advised on the situation with the Five Families, being told that it would only end with one of the heads being sentenced or all of them dying.[8]\n\nFisk was taken to Lincoln Middle School, where he sat in a classroom and painfully listened to children sing \"We Built This City,\" much to his displeasure. When they finished, the teacher went to introduce the next song, but Fisk quickly stopped her, telling them they had to leave. Arriving at the Latvian Cultural Center, Sheila Rivera informed Fisk someone had leaked his recycling project, so he ordered her to summon a meeting. Fisk then went upstairs and listened as the Latvian delegation performed a Latvian version of \"We Built This City.\"\n\nReturning to his office at New York City Hall, Fisk yelled at his staff, assuring them that he would find out which one of them leaked the information. Daniel Blake came forward and confessed to being the leak, so Fisk ordered everyone out of the room. Rivera stayed, and before Fisk could say anything, Blake apologized and expressed his deep respect for Fisk, stating that he would still support him no matter what happened to him. Fisk was taken aback by Blake's loyalty, and in a calmed state, Fisk told him that he would not fire Blake, as loyalty was hard to come by. Fisk then threatened Blake that if he ever leaked information again, it would be the last thing he ever did.[8]\n\nDuring dinner with Vanessa Fisk, she talked about their session with Heather Glenn, which Wilson was aware that Vanessa was asked if she felt safe in her marriage. Vanessa honestly told Wilson that she told Glenn she did feel safe. Vanessa asked Wilson if she should feel safe, so Wilson told her that he had learned many things from his father, but not forgiveness, which he was trying to do. Wilson expressed his desire for things to go back to how they were between them.\n\nLater that night, Fisk made his way down to his basement where he was keeping Adam prisoner in a cage. As Fisk walked through the basement, he passed the Rabbit in a Snowstorm painting, and sat down at a table, where a full meal was prepared for him. As Fisk poured himself a glass of wine, Adam desperately begged Fisk to let him go, but Fisk ignored him. Fisk recalled Glenn's words about forgiveness being the highest form of love to taunt Adam, who continued to demand his freedom.[8]\n\nAs Sheila Rivera ran through the day's agenda, Fisk expressed his exhaustion with attending so many black tie events. In his office, Fisk found Luca waiting for him, so he gave him five minutes to state his business before leaving. Fisk told Luca that he needed to pay Viktor what he owed, but Luca disrespectfully refused. Fisk doubled the amount, but Luca remained unfazed, telling Fisk to stay out of the crime world before leaving.[60]\n\nFisk later met with Johnny Santini from sanitation, who informed Fisk about the recent murals appearing around the city were made of blood. Fisk summoned Phil Gallo to his office, who explained that the blood was mixed into paint with an epoxy applied on top to make the murals impervious. Gallo revealed that from the blood was from at least sixty victims, and Fisk ordered him not to alert anyone of Muse, at risk of him going into hiding. Fisk then suggested a change of protocol with the NYPD.[60]\n\nThe night, Wilson got dressed for the meeting with New York's elite and was joined by Vanessa Fisk, who he informed about Luca's visit. Wilson then explained how politics has its similarities to the crime world, as it was about finding what someone wanted, and either providing it or withholding it to get them to do anything. However, Vanessa explained that it was different tonight, as Wilson had to ask the elite for money, so she educated him on how to deal with them. As Vanessa helped Wilson with his suit jacket, it ripped, as he had put on some weight.\n\nFisk met with the elite, and he navigated the room, talking with many people about his new project for Red Hook Port. Fisk met with Artemis Sledge and her husband, who were opposed to the idea. Sledge made it clear that she was aware Fisk made a lot of his fortune from business at Red Hook Port, and that the new project was just a self-serving con to enrich himself. Fisk claimed that he only cared about the city, but Sledge stated that despite his supposed power right now, the elite had the control.\n\nFisk then spoke with Jack Duquesne, who disagreed with Fisk's stance against vigilantes. Duquesne then told Fisk that his project did not align with the elite's interests. Fisk retorted that the elite knew nothing about making things happen, so Duquesne told him not to underestimate the elite, as they could take away his mayorship. Fisk asked if that was a threat, but Duquesne replied that it was a warning. Fisk regrouped with his wife, telling her that the elite were parasites for rejecting his project.[60]\n\nFisk was interrupted by Buck Cashman and Daniel Blake, who showed him the recent mural by Muse. Cashman claimed that Muse was mocking the NYPD, which Fisk felt they could use to his benefit. Fisk met with Phil Gallo the next day to reveal his plan to assemble a task force led by him to deal with the Muse case.\n\nGallo noticed Fisk had selected all of the corrupt cops, and Fisk explained that they would receive privileges like overtime and no body cameras. Fisk and Cashman went to meet with the selected cops, who were gathered at a warehouse. Fisk told them that Muse needed to be stopped, and that they were the ones to do it, claiming they had shown \"initiative\" in the past, and praised their \"creative thinking.\" Fisk then revealed that they were all founding members of his Anti-Vigilante Task Force and told them to show their faces as they take the city back.[60]\n\nWith everything building up inside of him, Fisk went to visit Adam, bringing an axe with him. Fisk walked up to Adam's cell, telling him that his wife would want him to release Adam, but that he could not do that. Fisk expressed that they had a shared experience, and spoke about how using a tool had aided him in fights when he was younger.\n\nFisk opened the cell and threw the axe to Adam for him to use against Fisk in a fight. Adam grabbed the axe and angrily swung at Fisk, who quickly knocked Adam down. Adam got back up and swung again, but Fisk was able to disarm him and proceeded to smash Adam down onto the table. With Adam subdued, Fisk began savagely beating him, punching his face several times. Fisk ended the fight by bashing Adam's head into a brick pillar. Fisk dragged Adam back into his cell and sat at his bed, looking at the wall.[60]\n\nFisk invited Buck Cashman and Daniel Blake to his office and stated that the city was afraid of Muse, especially as nothing had been done about him. Blake and Cashman informed Fisk that Angela Del Toro was saved from Muse by Daredevil.\n\nFisk was unsettled learning that Daredevil had resurfaced, and later spoke to Cashman about the vigilante's return. Cashman wondered if Daredevil's return could be good for the city, but Fisk ranted about how Daredevil destroyed his empire, claiming that he was unjustly arrested because of him. Cashman told Fisk that going after Daredevil could be seen as an abuse of power, but he replied that he had a duty to protect the city.\n\nFisk was visited by Angie Kim, who revealed her suspicion that Bastian Cooper was Muse based off of what she had found out about his history. Fisk asked Kim about Daredevil's return, so she confirmed that he was back. Fisk dismissed Kim, telling her that he would handle the Muse case. Connor Powell called Fisk and reported an encounter he had with Daredevil in Muse's lair, and that Heather Glenn was Muse's next target. Fisk ordered the Anti-Vigilante Task Force to find Muse and save Glenn.\n\nFisk arrived at Glenn's office, where Cole North informed him that Muse had already been killed before the Task Force arrived, stating that Daredevil had been there. Unwilling to let a vigilante be responsible for defeating a serial killer, Fisk told North to take credit for stopping Muse. Fisk set up a press conference, standing alongside the Task Force, to declare that he had kept his promise to the city.[16]\n\nWilson was informed from his wife that Luca intended to kill him, so they set up an ambush, with Vanessa giving Luca Wilson's location at a restaurant. While Wilson was having dinner, Luca approached him from behind but was quickly shot in the head by Buck Cashman. Wilson casually thanked Cashman and then asked him to call Vanessa and see if she wanted any food brought home.[16]\n\nWilson brought Vanessa to Red Hook Pier, where he told her that his project had now received its funding. As they walked, Wilson acknowledged the good Vanessa did for his empire, leading her to wonder why he wanted to throw it away. Wilson clarified that he was simply transforming his empire and that Vanessa's work was responsible for his project coming to fruition. They briefly talked about Luca before Wilson brought up the reason he brought Vanessa to Red Hook Pier.\n\nWilson entered his dungeon and showed Vanessa to the cage he had been keeping Adam in. Wilson noted that he kept his promise and did not kill Adam, who continued to beg for freedom. Wilson yelled at Adam to stop talking and expressed that he could not live without Vanessa. Gesturing at the key and a gun on the table, Wilson witnessed Vanessa pick up the gun and repeatedly shoot Adam, killing him. Wilson held Vanessa, promising to never leave again, and the two then embraced.[54]\n\nFisk called a meeting in his office to celebrate the recent victories of his Anti-Vigilante Task Force. Sheila Rivera noted the controversy with their excessive force, but Fisk defended that their methods were effective. Fisk acknowledged Daniel Blake's successful intimidation on BB Urich, and decided to promote him to Deputy Mayor for Communications. Rivera objected, but Fisk dismissed her and revealed that he found out his desk belonged to Fiorello La Guardia.[54]\n\nWilson hosted an inaugural ball at Gracie Mansion to benefit the Red Hook Port Revitalization Project, with the Anti-Vigilante Task Force stationed as security. In addition to his staff attending, Wilson extended invitations out to BB Urich, Phil Gallo, Heather Glenn, as well as New York's elite that had previously dismissed him, including Artemis Sledge and Jack Duquesne. Now wearing a white suit, Wilson proudly stood before his guests with Vanessa Fisk.\n\nAs Wilson greeted his guests, he noticed the arrival of Matt Murdock. Duquesne went up to Wilson, who asked to speak with him privately. In another room, Wilson listened to Duquesne comment on underestimating him back at the fundraiser before bringing up funding for his project. Duquesne went to refuse, but Wilson cut him off, revealing that he knew Duquesne was the vigilante, Swordsman. Wilson threatened to send his Task Force after him, forcing Duquesne to comply with supporting the project.\n\nWilson spotted a reporter taking a picture of him, so he ordered Connor Powell to deal with him. Wilson met with more of the elite and proceeded to threaten them into supporting his project. Later on, Wilson saw Murdock heading directly for him, but the confrontation was interrupted when a spotlight was cast on Wilson. Vanessa arrived at Wilson's side and told him it was time for their first dance. The couple took to the middle of the room and began dancing, and were soon joined by others, including Murdock and Glenn. As they all danced, Wilson whispered so only Murdock would hear, stating that there would be consequences for his return as Daredevil.\n\nBuck Cashman informed Wilson that Bullseye had escaped from prison. Hearing this news, Vanessa went to confess something to Wilson, but he stopped her, not wanting Murdock to hear. Murdock bumped into them and began dancing with Vanessa, leaving Wilson with Glenn. Wilson spoke with Glenn, mentioning Murdock's history with vigilantes. Suddenly, Murdock dove in front of Wilson and was shot in the shoulder by Bullseye, saving Wilson's life. Wilson dropped Murdock and retreated to safety with Vanessa.[54]\n\nWilson and Vanessa Fisk were escorted to their room, where Vanessa went to confess, but Wilson stopped her, revealing that he knew she hired Bullseye to kill Foggy Nelson. Wilson explained that they would be able to move billions through Red Hook Pier, with the police and the gangs under his control as the mayor.\n\nFollowing Bullseye's escape after the attack, Fisk summoned Buck Cashman, Sheila Rivera, Daniel Blake, Phil Gallo, and a few members from the Anti-Vigilante Task Force to his office to order a hunt on Bullseye and all vigilantes. Gallo objected to Fisk's advocation for lethal force. Fisk then ordered for the city to be closed off, but Rivera stated that could only be done if there was a real threat to public safety.\n\nFisk ended the meeting and told everyone to leave except for Cashman, who informed Fisk that Matt Murdock was in stable condition at Metro-General Hospital. Cashman felt that Murdock saving Fisk complicated matters, but Fisk disagreed and ordered Cashman to kill Murdock. Later, Fisk informed Rivera that the city was at a tipping point and that it needed a push, and ordered her to find anyone in his staff that was not loyal and fire them. Fisk then had the power to the entire city shut off.[49]\n\nSheila Rivera followed through on her orders and revealed to Kingpin that Phil Gallo was planning on putting an end to him as mayor. Kingpin ordered Luke to intercept Gallo on his way home and bring him to a secure location, where Kingpin had summoned several members of the Anti-Vigilante Task Force.\n\nOnce Gallo arrived, Kingpin accused him of letting down everyone in the NYPD, although he stated that it was not his fault for being a cog in a broken machine. Seeing past the deception, Gallo realized that he was right about Kingpin not changing his criminal ways. Kingpin hit Gallo in the throat and knocked him to his knees before squeezing his head with his bare hands. Kingpin claimed that he would protect the city right as he crushed Gallo's head in front of the Task Force members.[49]\n\nOnce the blackout ended, Kingpin gathered at New York City Hall to prepare for a televised broadcast. There, he met with Heather Glenn and told her that he would change the city, leading him to offer a job as his administration's Commissioner of Mental Health, which Glenn accepted.\n\nKingpin then went live with his broadcast to all of the city, explaining that there was an assassination attempt on his life and that the blackout was caused by sabotage. Kingpin claimed that Phil Gallo had resigned, and used it to make a promise that he would not let the city live in fear. Kingpin announced his Safer Streets Initiative, which made all vigilantism illegal, installed a curfew, and put the city under martial law.\n\nWith his Safer Streets Initiative being put into effect immediately, Kingpin established his dungeon in Red Hook Pier to become a prison for vigilantes and anyone else who opposed him. Amongst the prisoners kept in cages and guarded by the Anti-Vigilante Task Force were Swordsman and Punisher. Kingpin and Vanessa Fisk walked through the dungeon, passing the cages, and sat down for dinner at a table next to Rabbit in a Snowstorm, where they celebrated their victory.[49]\n\nDespite being one of New York City's most powerful crime lords, Fisk has a very shy and introverted demeanor. He did not like crowds and was uncomfortable around other people, until Vanessa Marianna's involvement. Fisk almost had an compulsive mindset, being a creature of habit and hating when things in his life changed, or went against how they were planned. He preferred to operate out of the spotlight and was loathe to interact personally with his fellow conspirators unless forced to.\n\nHowever, in spite of his social anxiety and his awkward nature, he is nonetheless capable of being extremely persuasive and charismatic when he needs to be. He has a keen understanding of psychology and social dynamics, which allows him to almost effortlessly manipulate people around him and exploit their psychological and emotional weaknesses. He also has a natural talent for leadership, as his take-charge attitude, the sheer force of personality, and raw physical presence enable him to take control of chaotic situations. As evidenced from the speeches he gave at his press conferences, he knows how to play a crowd as well, feigning emotion and passion in order to rally support from the masses.\n\nHe is a polite, articulate, and well-spoken man of courtesy and manners. He expected courtesy from his subordinates as well, as he would attack and sometimes even kill those who did not show respect to him or those he cares about. Fisk is a man of deep sophistication, enjoying the high-class life despite his poor origins. He enjoyed fine suits, fine dining, and classic literature and music. He considered himself a man of honor and always kept his word. While he can be a brutal, cold, calculating machine, he honestly believed what he was doing for Hell's Kitchen was righteous.\n\nHowever, if Fisk was provoked, he had an unstoppable, almost animal-like rage. His aggression was immense, and nothing could get in his way if those he cared about or his plan for the city were in danger. This was largely due to his abusive father, who taught him to keep hitting someone even when they were bloodied and beaten. Fisk's broken childhood had a lasting effect on him, still causing him nightmares even into his later years. He even hallucinated his reflection in the mirror having the image of his younger self covered in blood after murdering his father. His trauma was so deep that Echo's powers could not completely heal him, but it still served to temporarily strip him of his anger and abandon Tamaha without his former goddaughter.\n\nFisk constantly kills those who fail him; one of the most famous cases being that of Anatoly Ranskahov, a member of the Russian Mafia, who had his head he smashed in with his car door. He can even go so far as to kill people who betray him to protect his criminal empire, such as his partners Eleanor Bishop and Leland Owlsley or NYPD Commissioner Phil Gallo. He also threatened one of his assistants, Daniel Blake, with the same fate, telling him that if he failed him again, it would be the last thing he would ever do.\n\nThere are only five people that Fisk has ever cared for in his life. Fisk's mother was the only person that showed him love and respect growing up, and thus Fisk would kill to protect her, killing both Ben Urich and his own father for her. Vanessa Marianna became the love of his life; Wilson once brutally beat Anatoly Ranskahov to death and removed his head with a car door for simply interrupting their date. When Leland Owlsley had been involved in poisoning Marianna, he threw him down an elevator shaft to his death. James Wesley was the only man Fisk ever called a friend; he was emotionally distraught upon learning the death of Wesley, even kissing the forehead of his dead friend, and ordered the assassination of Karen Page when he found out she was the one who had killed him. Fisk also cared about Maya Lopez and treated her as family, but his relationship with Maya was damaged when she found out that Fisk was involved in her father's murder. Finally, Fisk had a deep respect and almost fear of Madame Gao, and her opinion of him, though this changed after he found out that she was responsible for the attempt on Marianna's life.\n\nMarianna's effect on him made him more vulnerable and less able to run his organization because his focus was primarily on her. He ignored both Gao's and Owlsley's warnings to cut ties to her and as such, Owlsley betrayed him by dealing with Gao and was part of the plot to poison Marianna. Fisk was shocked at his friend's betrayal and it took time for him to come to his senses and kill Owlsley. When his criminal organization was brought down and his plans for the city ruined, he finally snapped and no longer cared about the city, saying it deserved to be destroyed and it deserved people like his father. His belief was shown when he related himself to the antagonist of the Good Samaritan story, as he first thought himself to be the hero of it.\n\nAfter being imprisoned, Fisk became even more cynical, ruthless, violent, and sociopathic. Having given up on his ambitions to change the city for the better, he became concerned solely with attaining money and power, getting revenge upon the people who had wronged him, and being reunited with Marianna. He also became more impulsive and prone to homicidal outbursts, as he beat Wellers to death in a fit of rage after Benjamin Poindexter failed to kill Page. While he originally showed some reluctance and remorse about killing civilians like Elena Cardenas, this changed after his release from prison, as he displayed a willingness to order the murders of innocent people without a second thought if it would even slightly further his plans. This was evidenced when he had Poindexter go on a killing spree at the New York Bulletin in order to cause a panic, and when he had Julie Barnes murdered to secure Poindexter's loyalty even though it was not necessary.\n\nDespite losing most of his moral compass, Fisk still does have some level of compassion and loyalty in regards to Marianna, who he prized above everything else, even wanting to die at Daredevil's hand when he felt he'd failed to keep his criminal life and corrupt nature from harming her after Poindexter came to assassinate the two of them in revenge for Julia's death. When Felix Manning failed a task, Fisk not only spared him but allowed him to still work for him in gratitude for keeping Marianna safe. He also kept his word not to expose Daredevil or go after Foggy Nelson or Page when Daredevil threatened to expose Marianna to the police as being the one who had ordered the hit on Ray Nadeem. And, despite orchestrating the death of Maya Lopez's father, he loved her as if she was his own daughter.\n\nFisk became more hegemonic after his second imprisonment, as his obsession with controlling New York City worsened to the point of justifying that the city is rightfully his. He also became more paranoid and aggressive, as he sought to eliminate Eleanor Bishop after she resigned as a partner, which made Fisk conclude that Bishop would rat him out despite not really having any intention, he also fought savagely against her daughter Kate. After his return to New York City and recovering from Echo's powers, he devised a Machiavellian plan to run for mayor.",
