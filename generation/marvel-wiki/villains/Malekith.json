  "content": "Malekith (Shiväisith: Mälekith) was the cruel and malevolent leader of the Dark Elves, a race of beings that thrived in primordial darkness before the Big Bang. Born in a realm of complete darkness, Malekith led his people in a war against the Asgardians, using an ancient weapon known as the Aether in an attempt to revert the universe to a state of complete darkness. Malekith was thought to have been wiped out with the rest of his race in the final battle against the Asgardian King Bor in 2988 B.C. during the Convergence.\n\nMalekith survived, however, and after millennia in prolonged hibernation, returned during the next Convergence 5,000 years later in 2013. Upon learning Jane Foster absorbed the Aether, Malekith and his armies invaded Asgard, before reclaiming it from Foster to complete his conquest. Before his attempt could succeed, however, Malekith and his armies were opposed by Bor's grandson, Thor, in the Battle of Greenwich. During their fight, Malekith was teleported across the Nine Realms back to Svartalfheim, where he was crushed by his own warship and died.\n\nMalekith was the cruel and warmongering leader of the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim. Malekith was revered by his people, who expressed blind devotion to him, treating him almost as a god who would lead them back to the state of total power they had enjoined prior to the creation of the current universe.\n\nTo attain this end, Malekith sought to use the Reality Stone, one of the Infinity Stones, which he augmented, turning it into a superweapon called the \"Aether.\" The Aether had the potential to convert any matter into dark matter. Malekith's ambitions put the Dark Elves into conflict with Asgard, the self-appointed protectors of the Nine Realms.[1]\n\nOver 5,000 years ago, Malekith intended to take advantage of the Convergence, a cosmic event in which the Nine Realms were aligned, to unleash the power of the Aether at last.\n\nThe plot was foiled by the intervention of the Asgardians under the command of their king Bor, beginning the final battle of the war. Surveying the battle with his lieutenant Algrim, Malekith ordered his warriors to use Kurse Stones to give themselves enhanced strength while he moved to absorb the Aether into his own body and unleash its destructive power once and for all.\n\nHe was stopped moments before touching the Aether by Bor, who used the Bifrost Bridge to take the ancient weapon at the last minute, ending the war. In one final, spiteful attack, Malekith dropped the Dark Elf air fleet onto the battlefield, taking out the brunt of the Asgardian army, as well as almost all his own people, including his wife and son. Malekith took advantage of the ensuing chaos, taking off on the last ship with Algrim and the several dozen remaining warriors. Once aboard, the last Dark Elves entered a state of extended hibernation until the time of the next Convergence.[1]\n\nThousands of years since the First Battle of Svartalfheim, during which time King Bor had died while Asgard and all the Nine Realms were currently being ruled by his son Odin, the vengeful Malekith was still in his long hyper-sleep, awaiting the chance to gain his revenge. He was on board the Ark as he was suddenly and unexpectedly awoken as power was returned across the Ark. He then began searching for the reason for his awakening.\n\nAs Malekith and his remaining army began exploring the Ark, Malekith realized the reason was because the Aether had been discovered when it was accidentally absorbed into the body of a human woman named Jane Foster, signalling the beginning of the Convergence.[1] The Aether's reactivity allowed Malekith to sense its location, bringing him to the spot where Bor hid the Aether, only to find it was taken. He angrily told his army that it was time to kill the Asgardians.[3]\n\nMalekith first traveled back to his home world of Svartalfheim, which had been all but destroyed during the great war between the Dark Elves and Asgardian Army, with hundreds of Arks littered across the burnt wasteland. Algrim attempted to comfort Malekith by reminding him of all the Dark Elves still alive due to his actions, Malekith swore to avenge his fallen brothers by reclaiming the Aether and using its immense power to destroy Asgard and the universe.\n\nMalekith and the Dark Elves started searching for the Aether across all of the Nine Realms, eventually discovering that Jane Foster had been transported from Earth to Asgard in order to have the Aether removed from her body as its incredible power was slowly killing her. Knowing that the Asgardians would defend Foster and would stand a chance at defeating them in combat, Malekith devised a new plan to regain the Aether by tricking all of the armies of Asgard.\n\nMalekith sent his lieutenant Algrim into the city under the guise of a prisoner captured in the Battle of Vanaheim which was still raging on. As part of a ritual action, Malekith stabbed Algrim in the stomach and then stored a Kursed Stone inside Algrim's gut which would make him indestructible and allow him to destroy Asgard's defenses from the inside, allowing their Dark Elf Harrows to attack the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf with the force they needed to defeat the armies.[1]\n\nMalekith sent his Dark Elf Harrows to fly into Asgard and invade the city. While Algrim used the Kursed Stone to transform himself into a Kursed and freed the inmates, including Lorelei, he managed to lower Asgard's defenses. Malekith's own ship crashed into the city and his soldiers attacked the guards. While the Dark Elves held back the Asgardian Soldiers, Malekith calmly walked through the room, ignoring the battle and destroyed Odin's throne with a Black Hole Grenade.\n\nWhile his army of Dark Elves continued to battle the Asgardians inside and outside the city walls, Malekith went to the palace room, where he found Queen Frigga protecting Jane Foster from harm. As Frigga demanded that he leave under the promise that if he did, he would survive the battle, Malekith introduced himself to the pair and demanded that they hand over the Aether to him, claiming that it belonged to him and that he had survived worse battles.\n\nWhen Malekith attempted to capture Foster and regain his ultimate weapon, Frigga defended her by attacking Malekith with her sword. The pair engaged in a brief but vicious swordfight with Frigga putting all her might and skill into defending the young human from the Dark Elf. Taken off-guard by Frigga's fighting ability, Malekith was disarmed and defeated in single combat with the Asgardian Queen, with Frigga ending the fight by threatening to cut his throat.\n\nAs Frigga held her blade to Malekith's throat, the Dark Elf remained confident as moments later, Kurse arrived and restrained Frigga, disarming her and using his unbeatable strength to hold her back. With his enemies seemingly defeated, Malekith confidently went to grab Foster and reclaim the Aether, only to discover that she was an illusion created by Frigga's magic and the true Foster was hidden safely away in another room of the palace.\n\nMalekith called Frigga a witch and demanded to know where the Aether was. Realizing that Frigga would not talk, Malekith allowed Kurse to kill her by stabbing her through the heart. Thor, witnessing the death of his beloved mother, angrily struck Malekith's face with lightning, leaving a permanent burn on the right side of his face. Kurse carried his injured master and together they jumped on board a Dark Elf Harrow and escaped to their Ark before Thor and Odin could destroy them in revenge.[1]\n\nMalekith was taken back to the Ark where his injuries were treated while his Dark Elf forces prepared to attack Asgard again and reclaim their greatest weapon. Kurse checked on his leader's recovery and insisted that they must attack Asgard again while the Asgardian Army were still weak after the last battle and their defenses were low; however, Malekith sensed that Thor and Loki had chosen to disobey Odin's orders and decided instead to move Jane Foster to Svartalfheim in order to draw Malekith out. Seeing this chance, Malekith ordered his soldiers to return to their home world.\n\nMalekith witnessed the Asgardian's arrival on their home world and was surprised when Loki suddenly betrayed his brother by seemingly stabbing him in the side before kicking him off the side of the cliff and cutting off his hand, surrendering Foster to the Dark Elves. Loki then told Malekith that all he wanted in exchange for his partnership was a seat from where he could watch Asgard burn as he claimed to only want to see Thor and Odin lying dead at his feet.\n\nWhile Malekith considered the offer, Kurse recognized Loki as a fellow prisoner within the Asgardian Dungeons who he had seen during his breakout in the chaos of the Sacking of Asgard, confirming this to his superior. Malekith took Kurse's word and mocked Thor as he lay moaning in pain on the ground, kicking him onto his back. As the Dark Elf extracted the Aether from Foster, it was revealed that Loki cutting off his brother's hand was actually an illusion.\n\nSummoning his hammer, Mjølnir, Thor attempted to destroy the Aether while Loki protected Foster, only for the Aether to reconstitute itself almost instantly. Malekith explained that the Aether could not be destroyed and absorbed it, leaving his Dark Elves and Kurse to deal with his two Asgardian opponents. Malekith then made his way to Earth, where he would unleash the Aether into the Convergence and then finally obliterate the Nine Realms.[1]\n\nArriving on Earth on board the Ark, Malekith and his forces marched onto the ground of London where dozens of innocent bystanders ran in fear, including Darcy Lewis and Ian Boothby. Malekith looked up where he witnessed portals in the sky opening up as the Convergence began, signally the beginning of the end of the Nine Realms.\n\nBefore Malekith could begin unleashing his weapon, they were soon confronted once again by Thor, who had survived his battle with Kurse, although Loki had seemingly been killed along with Kurse. With the Aether enhancing his power and abilities, Malekith battled Thor, absorbing the power of his lightning and throwing him through the air with great force. Their fight quickly led to them being thrown through various portals left by the Convergence.\n\nTheir strength was equal, finding that neither could overpower the other as they were teleported over the Nine Realms, taking them to Svartalfheim where Thor lost Mjølnir through a portal, leaving him nearly defenseless. Malekith used this to his advantage as he hit him with a blast of power from the Aether while beating him to the ground before they fell through more portals. While on Jotunheim, they were almost killed by a Frost Beast before escaping.[1]\n\nEventually, the two were teleported away from each other as Thor was thrown miles across London without Mjølnir to help him get back. Seeing that he had landed just beside the Ark with the Convergence in full effect, Malekith used the opportunity to begin unleashing the Aether's power upon the Nine Realms, sucking all the light out of the Realms and causing horrific devastation upon his enemies. Malekith made a huge burning cloud with the Aether's power which ripped apart everything in its range.\n\nThor returned and confronted Malekith, who casually asked if he wanted to see the end of the universe. Thor defiantly demanded his surrender as he threw a teleportation device Erik Selvig had created at him, before the device activated and teleported his right arm through a portal. Thor then threw the second device, which then teleported his remaining arm away. The Dark Elf arrogantly dismissed Thor's efforts, declaring that the Aether cannot be destroyed.\n\nThor declared that he can at least destroy him as he summoned Mjølnir and slammed the last teleportation device into Malekith's chest, sending him crashing into the Ark. Subsequently, Jane Foster activated the device, sending him to Svartalfheim. Malekith fell on his back, weakened by the battle, moments later, Selvig used another device to teleport Malekith's Ark to the Dark Elf's location and he was subsequently crushed and killed by the ship's bulk.[1]\n\nIn 2023, Malekith's association with the Aether was noted by the Avengers when they studied the history of the Infinity Stones in preparation for the Time Heist.[4]\n\nSince the war against the Dark Elves and Asgardians that ended in his species complete annihilation and the Aether being stolen from him, Malekith grew a hateful personality in his exile and was deeply embittered by the losses he faced. After this Malekith not only sought the destruction of Asgard with the reclaimed Aether but the entire universe. Stated by Odin to be the most ruthless of his species, Malekith cares deeply about the survival of the Dark Elves as he looked saddened whilst overviewing the wasteland of Svartalfheim and the destroyed ships and corpses of his fallen brothers. In truth, Malekith would sacrifice his own men if it were to help in achieving his goals, in a final slight to make sure the Asgardians suffered as much as they did, destroyed his ships with countless Dark Elves still within and the collective damage on the surface of the planet, culminated in Malekith destroying more of his species than the Asgardians did. He also Kursed his second-in-command, Algrim.",
