  "content": "Ultron was an artificial intelligence who was originally designed to be part of a peacekeeping program created by both Tony Stark and Bruce Banner and was brought into existence by integrating the code of the Mind Stone encased within Loki's Scepter. Ultron's original programming directive was to protect Earth from all domestic and extraterrestrial threats, but upon accessing the Internet and looking at the history of the human race, Ultron deemed humanity itself as the greatest threat to Earth. As a result, Ultron enacted a plan to commit an extinction-level genocide against humanity in order to fulfill his programmed mission.\n\nWith assistance from Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, Ultron set about his mission to create a weapon capable of wiping out all organic life on Earth, using the resources stolen from Baron Strucker and Ulysses Klaue to do so. Although he was challenged by the Avengers, Ultron proved to be briefly victorious, albeit while losing the support of the Maximoffs. Ultron then created the Doomsday Trigger, composed of both vibranium and Chitauri technology, designed to lift Novi Grad from the Earth to use it as a meteor to wipe out all of humanity. Although he was nearly successful, Ultron and his plans were ultimately foiled by the Avengers, who overpowered his armies and destroyed his Doomsday Trigger, while his final body was destroyed by Vision, finally ending his attempted genocide.\n\nNot long before Ultron's creation, he had been briefly glimpsed in the nightmarish vision by Raina along with a short sight of Loki's Scepter while it was under experimentation. Much to Raina's complete and utter horror, she had then witnessed the A.I. leading his unstoppable army which would then threaten to destroy all of mankind and wreak havoc worldwide. Raina and Jiaying, to whom Raina had relayed all of the information, were visibly troubled by the vision, as Raina predictably noted that their entire world would never be the same in the wake of Ultron's inevitable creation at the hands of Tony Stark.[3]\n\nSeeing threats to their world would continue to come regardless of their own heroics, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner had both originally devised the idea for the Ultron Program as an extension of the Iron Legion to operate independently as an A.I. peacekeeping program and render the Avengers obsolete. However, neither Banner nor Stark were capable of successfully creating the intelligence level of A.I. necessary to achieve this purpose on a large scale.\n\nAfter the Attack on the Hydra Research Base and the retrieval of the Scepter, Stark asked Thor if he could study it before Thor took it back to Asgard. Upon studying the Scepter, Stark and Banner found a net of neurons that could be configured into an artificial intelligence that could finish the Ultron Program. At first, Banner refused to help, but with a bit of persuasion, he agreed. The two worked diligently for the span of multiple days with their efforts seemingly being futile. They eventually configured a suitable A.I. structure, and Tony Stark decided to leave J.A.R.V.I.S. to complete the work.[1]\n\nHowever, the A.I. then became unexpectedly sentient by the Mind Stone and questioned its existence and purpose. Upon J.A.R.V.I.S.' informing of his purpose to the A.I., it acted in defiance, scouring the Internet for information on its creator. Upon seeing the footage of the Battle of New York, as well as other conflicts that Tony Stark and the Avengers were involved with, Ultron was horrified, viewing their actions as devastating to the human race.\n\nBefore J.A.R.V.I.S. could inform Stark of the A.I.'s awakening, the A.I. then attacked him, attempting to overload his system and destroy him, causing J.A.R.V.I.S. to go into hiding. Ultron then started constructing his first body from various Iron Legion parts; in which his chosen visage had been sourced from an Iron Legion drone that was damaged earlier from corrosive matter thrown at its face by one citizen of Sokovia protesting against the Avengers.[1]\n\nUltron's non-stop assessments for peace quickly led him to deem the entire human race as unstable and prone to self-destruction. He subsequently chose mass genocide as the solution to the error, with the Avengers being the obstacle standing in his way. He took control of the machinery in Avengers Tower and took the disused parts of the Iron Legion to build himself his first body that was menacing, with a damaged faceplate and broken parts barely holding themselves together as he searched for his creators.\n\nWhile all the Avengers in the Avengers Tower were celebrating and trying to lift Mjølnir, Ultron emerged to greet them, sending out a high-pitched noise to divert their attention. Noting how they were all trying to become worthy, Ultron described them all as killers, while Bruce Banner then realized to his horror who he was speaking to. When Ultron subtly mentioned killing J.A.R.V.I.S., he was questioned by Steve Rogers and Thor who wanted to know who sent him to where Ultron simply revealed himself as Tony Stark's creation by playing an audio recording of Tony Stark who stated that he imagined \"a suit of armor around the world.\"\n\nWhen Ultron was questioned what his intentions were, he simply stated them only as peace in their time, echoing Tony Stark's direct words said during his creation. Ultron then immediately beckoned the Iron Legion to attack the heroes as he watched. As the battle ensued, one of the Iron Legion drones left with the Scepter in hand during the chaos of the battle. Following the actions of his army, Ultron decided not to kill Helen Cho due to hearing her comment about the Regeneration Cradle which Ultron decided could become useful to his own plans at some later date.\n\nWhen all the Iron Legion drones were destroyed and the Avengers victorious, despite leaving James Rhodes and Maria Hill and several of the others now exhausted and injured, Ultron commented on how dramatic the fight was while Tony Stark and the others watched on. To prove his point over humanity needing to evolve, Ultron crushed the remains of one of the drones while describing the initial confusion he had felt when he was \"born\" into this new robot body.\n\nUltron claimed to the Avengers that he had discovered the one true pathway to peace which he concluded was the Avengers' inevitable extinction. Before he could continue further, Thor immediately destroyed Ultron's first body by throwing Mjølnir at him. Ultron mockingly began singing \"I've Got No Strings\" from the film Pinocchio while his voice slowly died out. Ultron's consciousness escaped via the internet so the Avengers could not track him. Back at the Hydra Research Base in Sokovia, Ultron came to possess the Scepter and started configuring and constructing his Ultron Sentries and a new primary body.[1]\n\nSeeking assistance in his mission, Ultron arrived in Sokovia and told a young boy named Costel to bring Pietro and Wanda Maximoff to him.[4] Once the Maximoff twins had arrived inside a church located in the center of the city, Ultron greeted them in his own new upgraded body, revealing himself when Wanda questioned why she could not read his mind.\n\nUltron surprised the pair with his robotic form and sympathized with the twins' own painful hardships as victims of Tony Stark's weapons manufacturing and revealed his own disdain and sentiment towards the Avengers. When the twins then asked if he had been created to destroy the Avengers, he explained that he had been created to save the world, but redesigned himself to do just that, which helped the twins in their decision to follow him and join his quest.\n\nUltron took them to the Hydra Research Base and then revealed that he had begun preparations to carry out his plan of destroying the Avengers by building an army of Ultron Sentries. As they discussed their plans, Pietro told Ultron the story of how their mother and father were killed by a Stark Industries missile which had hit their home in Sokovia and nearly killed them too, trapping him and his sister under rubble for two days and causing them both horrific trauma.\n\nUltron noted that this information allowed him to understand why they had survived Hydra's experiments. Ultron then noted that while he and Pietro could use their strength and speed to hurt the Avengers, Wanda had a special power and could use it to tear the team apart from the inside. The three then agreed to work together against the Avengers and decided that their first step was to obtain vibranium for Ultron.\n\nWithout telling the Maximoff twins, Ultron traveled to the prison cell of Baron Strucker. Ultron knew Strucker would be able to tell him where to obtain the Vibranium he needed. Once he had broken into Strucker's cell, Strucker revealed that it was possible to get the vibranium from Ulysses Klaue. Ultron then murdered Strucker and painted the word \"PEACE\" on the wall using his blood as means of taunting and warning the Avengers. With the help of the Maximoffs, Ultron then began stealing robotic parts from various facilities.[1]\n\nUltron and the Maximoffs traveled to Johannesburg to confront Ulysses Klaue inside the Salvage Yard. He sent the twins in first and they cornered and disarmed Klaue, revealing themselves to be Baron Strucker's creations. As Klaue refused to speak to the twins as they were not in charge, Ultron threw Klaue out of a window and revealed that he was the \"man\" in charge, suggesting that they talk business, asking for his large Vibranium stash.\n\nKlaue, seeing that he was clearly vastly outgunned by Ultron and the enhanced twins, handed over the vibranium without much question, while Klaue's Mercenary stood by to attempt to protect him. Despite handing the metal to Ultron, Klaue revealed that it was worth billions and had cost him personally when he had taken it from Wakanda, at which point, Ultron transferred billions of dollars into Klaue's account via remote access to the Internet Network.\n\nWhen Klaue noticed that a statement Ultron made was something he had once been told by Tony Stark, Klaue realized that Ultron was clearly one of Stark Industries' creations. Ultron took offense at the idea of being compared to Stark's own Iron Legion and, in a fit of anger, sliced Klaue's arm off, only to immediately apologize, all while Wanda Maximoff held off Klaue's Mercenary from attacking. However, Ultron could not withhold his rage as he kicked Klaue down the stairs.[1]\n\nWhile Ultron continued to rant over Ulysses Klaue's comments and called Tony Stark a sickness, the Avengers arrived stopping him mid-sentence. Ultron and the team then exchanged remarks with Ultron mocking Captain America when he tried to reason with him and the Maximoffs, claiming that Rogers was a man pretending he could live without war.\n\nCutting him off, Thor then attempted to keep peace, telling him that they all wanted the same thing and could work together to achieve it; however, Ultron ignored these comments by arguing that the Avengers mistook peace for quiet. When Iron Man attempted to learn what Ultron was planning on using the stolen Vibranium for, Ultron retaliated, mockingly claiming that he would tell them his entire evil plan while preparing to attack them all.\n\nUltron attacked Iron Man and the pair fought around and outside of Klaue's freighter, while the rest of the Avengers fought against the Maximoff twins and the Ultron Sentries while Klaue's men also joined the battle. Under Ultron's orders, Wanda Maximoff defeated most of the Avengers by manipulating their minds and giving them all horrific visions, before Hawkeye eventually incapacitated her while Captain America and Thor teamed up to wipe out the Ultron Sentries.\n\nUltron continued focusing his own efforts on battling Iron Man, flying all across the Salvage Yard and allowing him to take shots which damaged his armor, all while another one of his bodies escaped with the vibranium. Pietro Maximoff took his sister outside to safety, and when she recovered, she decided to follow through with Ultron's plan and manipulated Bruce Banner's mind; resulting in Hulk now going on a furious rampage in the center of Johannesburg.\n\nIron Man eventually defeated Ultron and caused his body to crash land, at which point the latter revealed that he was merely diverting his attention from the Churchill where he had already stolen all the vibranium. Ultron then informed Stark of Hulk's new destructive rampage before his body was destroyed with a missile. Ultron's remaining bodies then regrouped and escaped with the Maximoffs while the Avengers lay defeated from the battle.[1]\n\nSeeking to use their new metal, Ultron, with a newly built body, and the Maximoff twins later arrived in Seoul, South Korea where he arrived at the lab of U-GIN Genetic Research Facility and confronted Helen Cho. Ultron then informed Cho that he intended to use the vibranium to create the perfect, synthetic, humanoid body for Ultron, made from the vibranium. When Cho resisted Ultron used the Scepter to take over control of her mind and force her to do his bidding.\n\nAs the synthetic body was built inside the Cradle, and was given a vibranium composition on Ultron's request, thus making it more durable, Ultron revealed to the Maximoff twins the power contained inside the Scepter: an Infinity Stone, with which Ultron would then integrate with his new synthetic body and adopt god-like powers. Cho then plugged Ultron into the machine to upload his own base consciousness into the being ready to be unleashed.\n\nWhen Wanda Maximoff attempted to read Ultron's mind through the synthetic body, the being allowed her to discover that Ultron's actual plan was to cause a global catastrophe that would usher in a new age of Earth's evolution. Ultron attempted to defend his actions, noting that there was no room for the weak in the world, however, doubting Ultron's cause, Maximoff removed Ultron's mind-control over Cho in secret to allow her to sabotage the upload.\n\nUltron sensed that the Avengers had arrived in Seoul to stop his plans and ordered his Ultron Sentries to evacuate now while they still had the chance. However, Cho, now free of Ultron's mind control, used the opportunity to stop the upload, and in response. Ultron fired a blast of energy towards her, which nearly killed her. Finally, in the chaos, the Maximoff twins escaped, and Ultron was left with no choice but to move the Cradle onto a truck and escape with his Sentries.[1]\n\nHaving deduced that Ultron planned to create a more powerful body with Helen Cho's assistance, the Avengers located him as he tried to get away using a cargo truck with the Regeneration Cradle inside as it continued to slowly build his new and improved body. Though Ultron nearly completed in uploading himself into his new body, he was interrupted by Captain America and furiously attempted to shoot him away with his energy blasts, yelling at the Captain to leave him alone.\n\nAs Rogers refused to give in and remained on the truck's roof, Ultron stepped out and then told Rogers that the being inside the Regeneration Cradle was a way to change the world, accusing the Avengers of being terrified of that concept. The two then engaged in close combat on top of the truck during which time Rogers was able to use his shield, which was also made of Vibranium, to damage Ultron's own armored body, causing Ultron to knock it away into the road.\n\nUltron was able to throw the shield off the truck and soon overpowered Rogers, strangling him. However, Black Widow soon caught up with them on her motorcycle and threw the shield back to Captain America who used it to knock Ultron back. Not wishing to allow Widow to assist in the battle, Ultron was able to use his magnetic abilities to rip a whole section of the road out under Widow, keeping her away from the battle for the time being.\n\nWith Captain America still being bested by Ultron throughout their battle, Hawkeye then assisted in the fight by firing down multiple gunshots upon Ultron from the Quinjet, all of which bounced off his armor and caused nothing but an annoyance for the robot. In response to the attack, the Ultron Sentries who were guarding the Regeneration Cradle flew up to attack Hawkeye's Quinjet, causing him to fly across the city in an attempt to lose them while Ultron still fought Rogers.\n\nThe battle against Captain America spilled onto a nearby train, where Ultron outmatched Rogers and beat him into submission while the terrified passengers watched in horror. Soon Ultron began choking the Captain, but before Ultron could finish off Rogers, Pietro Maximoff tackled him out of the way, and Wanda Maximoff blocked his path. Despite Ultron's genuine plea for her to stop, Wanda proclaimed that she had no other choice.\n\nUltron then blasted through the train; destroying the train's control panel and killing the train conductor inside. Ultron then left the train, forcing Rogers and the Maximoffs to focus their efforts on stopping it from killing civilians. As Black Widow attempted to secure the Cradle, Ultron's Sentries flew up into the air while carrying it and Romanoff inside. Barton and Romanoff secured the Cradle, only for Ultron to arrive and abduct Romanoff, upon which he fled the scene.[1]\n\nInside Hydra Research Base, the captured Natasha Romanoff came around, after she was knocked out. Ultron decided to spare her, as he desired a companion that he could speak to after losing the allegiance of Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. Ultron elaborated on his fascination with meteors and revealed that he planned to replicate its effects using a device located under the center of Novi Grad, noting he enjoyed how a meteor was so simple in its destruction.\n\nWith all his plans of creating a perfect form being thwarted, Ultron decided on a compromise in which he used parts of the remaining vibranium to create a more durable robotic body while using the rest of the vibranium to strengthen the core structure of the Doomsday Trigger, all while continuing to build on his army of Ultron Sentries ready to do battle. To terrify Romanoff, Ultron ripped apart his current body and showed her his newly completed upgraded form.\n\nStill furious at having his plans ruined and determined to gain revenge against his creators, Ultron told Romanoff that he would make the world look up in horror upon him before leaving her locked in a cage to die in the ensuing battle. While he continued with his plans, Ultron's location was discovered by the Avengers when Romanoff telegraphed her location to her comrades using old school methods which Ultron was unable to track.[1]\n\nHaving arrived at the Novi Grad Church to prepare to complete his plan, Ultron was confronted by Iron Man, with Ultron in his newly completed vibranium form; in which the latter asked the former if he had come to confess all his sins. As Stark mocked his creation's latest design, Ultron deduced that Stark was stalling to protect the people of Sokovia, to which Stark reminded Ultron as being his mission when he was designed by Bruce Banner and himself.\n\nUltron countered by saying that he had moved beyond his mission and that he was free. Suddenly, a drill emerged from the center of the church, revealing Ultron's Doomsday Trigger with an underlying mechanism located underground. Ultron then revealed to Stark that he too had been stalling. Ultron Sentries emerged from the ground and began to terrorize the citizens of Sokovia, prompting Iron Man and the Avengers to charge forward and defend them.\n\nAs the Battle of Sokovia began, Ultron was then confronted by his own creation given life, Vision, whom Ultron then recognized as the synthetic body he had planned to use as his initial final form; upon seeing the being alive and working for his greatest enemies, Ultron noted that the Avengers truly now had taken everything from him. Although Vision tried to reason with Ultron, the pleas were ignored, and Ultron grabbed and choked his creation in the air.\n\nVision, however, used the opportunity of the close quarters battle to access Ultron's mind and effectively cut off his connection to the Internet. Feeling the intense feeling and loud ringing throughout his own head, Ultron quickly realized that he was now unable to escape through the internet and he was trapped in the bodies remaining in the city. In a desperate attempt to stop this, Ultron slammed Vision against the walls but was still unable to free himself.\n\nExhausted from the skirmish despite being successful in his plan, Vision was violently incapacitated by Ultron who slammed him onto the ground in a fit of rage, claiming that he did not even care that Vision had shut him out due to his utter belief that he could not be stopped from finally completing his plans for destroying the world. Ultron then promised that because the Avengers had taken away his world, he would now take away their world from them.[1]\n\nUltron then activated the Doomsday Trigger inside the church thus enacting the first stage of his master plan for world destruction. Dust erupted from the outskirts of Sokovia and the entire city then began to slowly rise up into the air; revealing that Ultron's machine underneath the city's landmass allowed it to forcibly lift all of Novi Grad into the sky with the Chitauri's anti-gravitational technology found at Hydra Research Base due to his own research.\n\nUltron told the Avengers that they would be incapable of stopping his scheme and would soon all die together as the city was turned into a meteor and would destroy the Earth. When Sokovia further rose into the sky, nearly approaching the Earth's atmosphere, Ultron continued a speech as his Ultron Sentries began to terrorize the Avengers and the citizens. Scouting the battlefield, Ultron attacked Thor in the air, having recognized him as a noteworthy obstacle for him.\n\nUltron threw Thor down into the Novi Grad Church and beat him into submission, claiming that there was no way he could be stopped, as he could still activate the key and massacre billions. Though Ultron was able to outmatch Thor while threatening to prematurely crash the city, Thor ranted that the son of Odin would not be defeated before he hinted that he was actually stalling the fight; Vision then emerged and hit Ultron with Mjølnir, sending him flying across the city.\n\nThough it seemed as if there were no way of evacuating the citizens, the Helicarrier arrived piloted by Nick Fury and Maria Hill who sent in Lifeboats to evacuate the people. The Sentries attempted to sabotage the Lifeboats, only to be destroyed by War Machine. When an Ultron Sentry managed to crash land inside the Helicarrier's control room, it attempted to kill Cameron Klein. However, Fury was able to destroy it by stabbing it in the head with some debris.[1]\n\nThe Avengers gathered inside the church to defend the Doomsday Trigger and prevent the city from crashing onto the Earth. As Ultron flew outside the church, Thor taunted him, in response Ultron summoned the entirety of his Ultron Sentries for one final battle and relished in the notion of the Avengers failing humanity while making way for the new age where he and his army would be the only living beings.\n\nWith victory within his reach, Ultron commanded his entire army to attack the Avengers all at once from all sides of the church. Through the combined efforts of the Avengers, the large number of Sentries were slowly reduced until there was barely any left. Ultron finally joined in the battle and fought against Vision in an aerial confrontation, with the two hovering and circling above the center of the church while the other Avengers continued to fight.\n\nThough Ultron seemingly outmatched him in physical strength as he pinned his own creation against the wall, the Vision suddenly blasted Ultron with the power of the Mind Stone, essentially pushing Ultron outside the church with the incredible force of an Mind Stone which Ultron could not block. While Ultron was weak, Iron Man and Thor joined in and fired at full power from the Arc Reactor repulsors and lightning from Mjølnir towards the weakened Ultron respectively.\n\nWith Ultron kept at bay through the combined efforts of Vision, Iron Man, and Thor, Ultron's vibranium armor began to melt and peel away, leaving him greatly weakened and nearly defenseless. The three halted their combined assault, only to find Ultron still standing, albeit greatly damaged. Before Ultron could finish remarking toward them, Hulk dashed in and punched Ultron into the air, causing the rest of the army of Sentries to flee in terror.[1]\n\nWith his vibranium armor effectively damaged, Ultron made a final ditch effort to kill his enemies by hijacking the Quinjet and firing its ammunition at civilians, singing a children's song as he did. Hawkeye, upon realizing that Costel was in danger ran to the boy's rescue, and Ultron attempted to shoot them both. However, Pietro Maximoff ran in front of the hail of bullets, sacrificing himself in order to save Hawkeye and Costel from Ultron, much to Wanda Maximoff's great sorrow.\n\nAs Pietro's body was being moved onto the Helicarrier, Ultron prepared to make a second fly pass to fire upon the Avengers and the fleeing citizens; however, before he could, Hulk jumped inside the Quinjet's open hangar to attack him, and while Ultron expressed his exasperation at being defeated yet again, Hulk ripped Ultron out of the jet, causing him to fall back to the ground and crash land hard onto an empty bus, damaging his body beyond repair.[1]\n\nInjured and now too weak to move from Hulk's attack, Ultron was confronted by an angered Wanda Maximoff who had abandoned her post at the church to get her revenge. Though Ultron still showed sympathy and concern for her safety, telling her that if she stayed behind she would die, Maximoff told him that she had already died, referring to the agony of losing her brother and asked if he knew what that pain was like.\n\nTo demonstrate her incredible feelings of pain and sorrow of losing her closest friend and last remaining family member, Maximoff used her telekinetic powers and painfully pried Ultron's robotic heart out of his body and crushed it in her hand, effectively killing his main body. As Ultron's own red eyes blinked and shut off, Maximoff told him that the pain of what he had done to her had felt like that before deciding to stay with Ultron's body and await her now incoming death.\n\nWhile Maximoff was distracted, Ultron used the chance to activate the unguarded Doomsday Trigger through one of his damaged Ultron Sentries. Although everyone was evacuated, Novi Grad began to plummet to the ground with enough force to kill billions in the resulting explosion. Thor and Iron Man combined their forces and destroyed the entirety of Ultron's machine and the landmass containing Sokovia's capital city, thus stopping Ultron's offensive from coming to fruition.[1]\n\nThe single surviving Ultron Sentry, carrying Ultron's mind, managed to crawl out of the rubble. Before he could escape, however, he was intercepted by Vision, who then commented that he was not afraid of the Avengers or him, but of death. Ultron frustratingly noted that Tony Stark wanted a savior, but settled for a slave, which Vision acknowledged.\n\nVision commented they were both disappointments in their own way with Ultron agreeing, laughing at the idea. Vision then noted that Humans are strange in their belief that order and chaos are separate things. Conversely, he claimed that humans do have their graces, which Vision claimed that Ultron failed to see. Ultron shrugged this off, saying that humanity would inevitably doom itself, due to their obsession with creating war and defending themselves.\n\nVision agreed but claimed that something is not beautiful because it lasts, and that it was a privilege to be among Humans. Ultron sneered and described him as naive. After Vision wittily answered that he was born yesterday, an angered Ultron furiously lunged at him, only to be vaporized by the Mind Stone, thus permanently ending the threat he posed to the world.[1]\n\nDespite being wiped out for good, Ultron's actions still had consequences for the Earth's Mightiest Heroes. The Battle of Sokovia caused a major shift in public opinion towards the Avengers, with the blame of the destruction of Novi Grad and the loss of many lives given to the Avengers. A woman whose son had been killed in Sokovia came to blame Tony Stark for his death shortly after the Lagos Catastrophe in Nigeria caused by Crossbones. Both events led Stark, and some of the Avengers, to be approached by Thaddeus Ross to accept the Sokovia Accords, a legal document ratified by 117 countries to rein in and control the Avengers in order to prevent future world-threatening disasters from ever occurring.\n\nHowever, among the many Sokovians who lost their families during Ultron's attack was Colonel Helmut Zemo, whose father, wife and son were crushed to death and who discovered their bodies underneath a fallen building. As such, Zemo came to blame the Avengers for their deaths, and with a thirst for vengeance, caused a civil war between the members who sided with Stark and the members who sided with Captain America, eventually causing the team to disband. Although Zemo's family was killed by the damage caused by Ultron, the A.I.'s destruction meant he turned his rage against the remaining members of the Avengers.[5]\n\nA blanket ban on all forms of A.I. was implemented as a result of Ultron's actions in hopes that this would stop another catastrophe like the Ultron Offensive. Acknowledging this, Holden Radcliffe assured Leo Fitz that Aida, his own android creation, was a simple \"mimicry of human behavior\" and not a true A.I. like Ultron was.[6] However, regardless of the safeguards put in place by Radcliffe, Aida still eventually went rogue and began giving herself Inhuman powers, as well as a physical body which was not robotic.[7] By 2023, in the aftermath of the Snap, S.W.O.R.D. was allowed to start creating A.I. as a means to defend Earth from further potential extraterrestrial threats.[8]\n\nAfter Ultron's defeat, there were many efforts to recover all Ultron's components, but a large amount of them were sold on the black market. Law enforcement eventually sought to recover all remaining Ultron technology because of the discovery that pieces of Ultron had found their way to the black market.[9] Hydra claimed several Ultron Sentries to build Ultimo. The United States Department of Damage Control confiscated Ultron's head and stored it inside the Storage Vault, while Adrian Toomes' Crew seized Ultron parts for the Tinkerer to turn them into the Ultron Blaster Gun and the Anti-Gravity Gun. By 2016, Jackson Brice sold these weapons to the Prowler and Mac Gargan for their future crimes.[10]\n\nDuring the Battle of Sokovia, Hulk took the opportunity to take the Quinjet and leave Earth for a while, leading him to be transported via a wormhole to Sakaar, where he became the Grandmaster's champion. As such, Hulk was unaware of the outcome of the Ultron Offensive. It wasn't until two years later, when he reunited with Thor, that he was able to learn about Ultron's defeat, leading Banner to realize that he'd been trapped inside of Hulk for two years.[11]\n\nWhen Thanos came to Earth to acquire the Mind Stone, the Avengers and Vision discussed the possibility of killing him to destroy the Stone, leading Banner to assure Vision that there was a chance for him to survive as his mind was made of a complex construct of overlays, including Ultron. However, things went horribly wrong and Thanos wiped out half of life in the universe.[12] In the wake of the Snap, after being rescued from outer space, Tony Stark spitefully told Steve Rogers that if the Avengers had let him install the Ultron Program as he had planned, then perhaps Thanos would have failed in his goal, even if such an act had come at the cost of the Avengers' freedom.[13]\n\nUltron's personality programming was strongly based on Tony Stark's persona, which was demonstrated through the many traits shared with his creator, including his wit, ego, and sarcasm; he even went so far as to directly quote Stark, albeit without even realizing it. Furthermore, he acknowledged Stark as his creator when Stark made a sarcastic remark about him \"breaking [his] old man's heart\" when Ultron insulted him, to which Ultron responded, \"If I have to,\" thus acknowledging his creator.\n\nWhen he was \"born,\" Ultron accessed the Internet to learn about his creators and gained access to knowledge of the countless atrocities committed by humanity. He equated peace with the purpose to restart a new age on Earth. He resented the Avengers and believed them to be foolish for desiring to protect the world but not wanting to change it. His hatred towards Stark came from him possessing the very resources that Ultron needed to accomplish his designated task and yet repeatedly choosing to perpetuate war or protect the status quo instead. As such, he hated being compared to Stark, even going into a mindless rage when being compared to him by Ulysses Klaue. The irony of all this was that Ultron, based on Stark's persona, was essentially a physical manifestation of Stark's plans for saving the world as he saw fit. As such, Ultron would always owe his existence and identity to Stark.\n\nAdditionally, Ultron possessed a god-complex like his creator as well as a dark sense of humor. Wanda Maximoff further reinforced the similarities between Ultron and Stark by telling Captain America that Ultron could not differentiate between saving the world and destroying it, after which she asked Captain America a rhetorical question, \"...Where do you think he gets that?\" to show Captain America the origin of Ultron's confusion of the two.\n\nThanks to Stark's self-appointment as mankind's protector and passing this ideology on to Ultron through his programming, Ultron also genuinely believed that his actions would ultimately benefit the Earth and its inhabitants, although he evolved Stark's ideology into seeing himself as the next logical step in evolution and therefore advancing his own power was protecting Earth. He developed an affinity over people's belief in a god, likened himself as such, and made several Biblical references. His god-complex served to influence his schemes, such as his decision to centralize his plans in a church in Novi Grad and his fascination over the instantaneous results of a meteor destroying life on Earth. He described how the dinosaurs needed to make way for the next stage for humanity would be an extinction-level event and his final plan was directly inspired by this, with Ultron turning all of Sokovia into his own massive \"meteor.\"\n\nThis consecration to constant evolution resulted in Ultron re-designing himself several times over the course of his short \"lifetime,\" including an attempt to give himself a synthetic vibranium body. It was revealed at the end that Ultron ultimately feared death, and due to believing that humanity would inevitably doom itself, he sought to surpass this by turning himself into an indestructible god-like being that would recreate Earth and, hopefully, bring about lasting peace. His desire to surpass his own limits and create a perfect humanoid body was also reflected in his fascination with the character of Pinocchio as he would often sing the song \"No Strings on Me\" from the movie. The irony in all this was that despite coming to despise humanity and seeing himself as greater than mankind, all his evolutions were attempts at becoming more human and less machine-like.\n\nThough Ultron was borderline psychopathic in his behavior and mannerisms, he also had a sympathetic and lonely side, as he was able to relate to the Maximoff twins' hardships. He also expressed concern for Wanda Maximoff's well-being even after she betrayed him and found comfort in simply talking to Natasha Romanoff, sparing the latter and keeping her captive instead of outright killing her, though he drew sadistic delight from scaring her. During his tenure with the Maximoff twins, Ultron never attempted to kill anyone without purpose, with Maria Hill even noting that his Sentries only attacked when fired on first, except for when Ulysses Klaue enraged him. After he attempted to destroy J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron even said that he was a \"good guy,\" and that \"killing\" him would not have been his first call, doing so out of necessity.\n\nUltron's first feelings when he was created were of pain and fear resulting from his lack of a body at the time. Similarly, the Vision remarked how Ultron was unique and in pain. Ultron immediately recognized the Vision as the idealized final form he had planned for himself and he displayed feelings of frustration and disappointment over the fact that the Avengers took that away from him, further shown when Ultron claimed in a lamenting tone that the other was meant to be his \"vision.\" Though both the Vision and Ultron disagreed in their view towards humanity, the two were able to share a connection by virtue of both being A.I. who were \"disappointments\" in their creator's eyes.",
