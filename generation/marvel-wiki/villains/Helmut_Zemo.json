  "content": "Baron Helmut J. Zemo is a Sokovian nobleman, former Colonel of the Sokovian Armed Forces, and commander of EKO Scorpion, dubbed Baron Zemo. Following the Battle of Sokovia, Zemo became a criminal mastermind who sought revenge against the Avengers and other enhanced individuals, after losing his entire family. Knowing he was no match against the Avengers, Zemo planned to have them destroy themselves, framing Winter Soldier for bombing the United Nations and killing T'Chaka, which caused Captain America to defend Barnes. His actions caused the Avengers Civil War, in which Iron Man led the manhunt for Barnes and Zemo, allowing Stark to learn Barnes was responsible for his parents' murder. With the Avengers in ruin, Zemo tried to shoot himself, but was captured by Black Panther and given to Joint Counter Terrorist Centre for his incarceration.\n\nEight years later, Zemo was broken out of prison by Barnes, to aid him and Sam Wilson in tracking down the Flag Smashers. Zemo agreed, as he intended to put an end to super soldiers for good. Zemo took Wilson and Barnes across Madripoor, where Zemo then met and killed Wilfred Nagel, the creator of the new serum. When Zemo found all of the Flag Smashers in Latvia, he destroyed all but one of their remaining serum vials. Zemo was then involved in the clash between John Walker and the Dora Milaje, as they both intended to take him into custody, during which Zemo quietly escaped. Zemo visited the Sokovian Memorial, where he made amends with Barnes, before being handed to the Dora Milaje to continue his sentence within the Raft. While Zemo remained in the Raft, Oeznik assassinated the four remaining Flag Smashers.\n\nHelmut J. Zemo was born in 1978 in Novi Grad, the capital city of Sokovia, and hailed from an aristocratic family, from which he inherited the title of baron. The family had connections to the Madripoor criminal underworld, and were in possession of a collection of antique cars that were passed down by generations.[3] During his youth, Zemo would visit a building in Latvia, which he greatly admired.[4]\n\nIn adulthood, Zemo joined the Sokovian Armed Forces and became the commander of EKO Scorpion, Sokovia's paramilitary tactical unit. Despite the nature of his job, Zemo was able to form a family, marrying a woman and having a son, Carl. Zemo and his family lived a happy life within Novi Grad while also maintaining close relationships with his father within the Sokovian countryside. Carl developed a fascination with the Avengers and had expressed a desire to Zemo to see them, specifically Iron Man, in action.[1]\n\nWhen Ultron attacked, Zemo and his EKO Scorpion squad were called upon to defend Sokovia. Zemo sent his family to take refuge with his father outside of Novi Grad, where he believed they would be safe. Despite this, his wife, son and father were killed, and Zemo found their bodies two days later. Although Ultron was defeated by the Avengers, Zemo blamed them for his family's deaths, developing a hatred to the Avengers and enhanced individuals in general, for their apparent lack of concern for innocent lives.[1]\n\nZemo managed to decrypt the Hydra data leaked by Black Widow and uncovered the information about the Winter Soldier Program, a Hydra program aimed at creating super soldiers. Zemo deemed all enhanced individuals a threat like the Avengers, so he hunted down and killed all Hydra scientists who worked on the project, so it would be impossible to restart.[3]\n\nUncovering the information about Bucky Barnes and the book used to control the Winter Soldiers, Zemo devised a plan to use Barnes to create a conflict within the Avengers and destroy them from the inside, since doing it by force would be impossible for him. Zemo tracked down Vasily Karpov and traveled to Cleveland, where he created a scene, by pretending to have accidentally crashed into Karpov's car, claiming that it was an accident and asking to be let inside.\n\nClaiming that he wanted to sort out the insurance, Zemo waited for Karpov to open the door, at which point he attacked and subdued him before tying him upside down above his sink slowly filling with water. Using his hammer to bust through the walls of Karpov's cellar, Zemo found and took the Winter Soldier Book from Karpov's Hydra files spoke politely with Karpov, commenting on how Karpov had kept his looks over the years.\n\nZemo then demanded information about their assassination of Howard and Maria Stark which had occurred in the year 1991. Instead of answering, Karpov demanded to know who he was, to which Zemo politely introduced himself, before repeating his question about the mission report from 1991. Karpov then questioned how Zemo found him, to which he explained that, when S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, their intelligence was leaked online by Black Widow, which he had studied and deciphered to learn what he needed to know.\n\nDespite Zemo making his intentions very clear that he would not stop until he had obtained the information he needed to exact his revenge, noting that his loyalties did not lie within Hydra, Karpov refused to help him. Seeing that Karpov would not speak with him, Zemo then left the tap running and walked out of Karpov's house with his new stolen belongings while Karpov gave the Hydra salute before then drowning inside of his sink, as Zemo abandoned him.\n\nUsing all the information he had obtained, Zemo traveled to Austria and then proceeded to frame Barnes, into taking the fall for a bombing which then killed the Wakandan king T'Chaka. The timing of events coincided with the signing of the Sokovia Accords, the new framework that would place any enhanced people under government oversight, and a burgeoning cause for some friction between Captain America, who refused oversight, and Iron Man, who supported it.[1]\n\nHaving been hunted across the world for his apparent involvement in T'Chaka's death, Bucky Barnes was eventually caught and subdued, as part to the efforts of Everett Ross' men and War Machine and, into the custody of the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre.[1] Knowing this, Zemo awaited the arrival of Theo Broussard while he listened to his late wife's voicemail message before greeting Broussard.[8]\n\nZemo then brought Broussard back to his own hotel room where he proceeded to murder him and hid his body inside the bathtub. While practicing reading the trigger words from the Winter Soldier Book he would need to gain full control of the Winter Soldier, Zemo was then interrupted by the arrival of his breakfast, not allowing the woman to enter so she did not see Broussard's corpse or the bomb that he had made. Zemo then had an ally deliver the bomb to a power station.[1]\n\nArriving inside the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building, Zemo found Bucky Barnes was locked in the contained cell with his robotic arm tightly fixed down with Zemo soon managing to get past security and posed as the psychiatrist Theo Broussard, who was supposed to evaluate his mental state before Barnes was sent into Wakanda to await his trial for the murders of T'Chaka and many others. Knowing that their cameras were on him, while people like Everett Ross were watching him closely, Zemo began by doing his true evaluation of Barnes' mind while awaiting news on the next stage of his plans.\n\nAs Zemo continued with the evaluation, he questioned Barnes about the horrors that he had seen throughout his life in World War II and as an assassin for Hydra, only for Barnes to insist that he did not want to talk about this. Before he continued, Zemo then received the text giving him a warning just before all the power around the facility was shut off, including the cameras, before Zemo then told Barnes that it was time to discuss his home, which he had while serving Hydra.\n\nZemo then re-activated Barnes' Winter Soldier Program training by using the Hydra manual he procured from Barnes' former handler Vasily Karpov, which led to Barnes breaking free of his restraints to stop Zemo's plans, ripping his arms free and punching the glass to try and get away. Zemo was able to finish saying the codewords just as Barnes broke free, resulting with Barnes finally falling under his control. Zemo requested a mission report on Howard Stark's death.\n\nHaving obtained all the information that he needed about the deaths of the Stark family as well as the Winter Soldiers that he intended to use as bait in the next part of his plan to destroy the Avengers, Zemo then ordered the Winter Soldier to fight and destroy anyone who attempted to stop him before getting into a helicopter and escaping, believing that this escape attempt would seemingly prove his guilt for both the bombing and the murder of T'Chaka to the entire world.\n\nAs the Winter Soldier obeyed all of his orders, Zemo then lay on the ground, as if he had been assaulted himself in order to maintain his cover. While the Winter Soldier remained out of sight for an ambush, Zemo was then confronted by Captain America and Falcon who had attempted to save Barnes. Seeing Zemo lying on the ground, Rogers suspected something was wrong as he had demanded to know what Zemo wanted, and was told that he wanted to see an empire fall.\n\nHowever, before Rogers could put Zemo into his custody, the Winter Soldier charged forward and attacked, knocking Sam Wilson down to the floor before using his Prosthetic Arm to then throw Rogers down an elevator shaft. As Zemo had checked if Rogers had been killed by the impact, Wilson awoke and chased the fleeing Zemo, who ran up the flights of stairs, with Wilson close behind. Eventually Zemo made it outside to Berlin where he ditched his jacket and disappeared.[1]\n\nOnce the Avengers' co-leaders had gathered forces for their factions and fought each other to a near-standstill over their continued tensions surrounding the Winter Soldier's escape and how it impacted the Sokovia Accords, Zemo continued his plans as he prepared to travel to Siberia in order to seemingly to reawaken the five remaining soldiers from the Winter Soldier Program from their cryostasis.\n\nWhile waiting for transport out of Germany, before his involvement in all the chaos could be exposed, Zemo again listened to the last voicemail message left by his deceased wife to remind himself of his motives against the Avengers following the Battle of Sokovia, as they destroyed his family. Boarding the plane toward his next destination, Zemo made his escape from Berlin and soon arrived in Moscow, and then proceeded to travel into the Siberian region of Russia.\n\nHaving arrived and hired his snow plow to make it through the harsh weather toward the Hydra Siberian Facility, where he had learned from Vasily Karpov that the Winter Soldier had been kept, Zemo then contacted his hotel back in Berlin and requested his usual breakfast, knowing that the innkeeper would find Theo Broussard's corpse, allowing all of those who had been tracking him down to learn his true identity and follow him so the final stage of Zemo's plan could happen.\n\nZemo eventually arrived at the Hydra Facility where Karpov worked for decades and all of found the Winter Soldiers including Josef, who were still held inside Cryostasis Chambers, peacefully awaiting their next orders. While he awaited the arrival of Captain America and the Winter Soldier, who were being followed by Iron Man, Zemo killed all five soldiers with a single bullet into the head each while they slept, putting an end to the Winter Soldier Program once and for all. With the Winter Soldiers dead, Zemo found a sealed bunker and hid there, waiting for the Avengers to arrive.[1]\n\nWhile he waited in his bunker, Zemo witnessed the arrival of Captain America, Iron Man and Winter Soldier, as he turned on all the lights and revealed the dead Winter Soldiers, questioning if they believed that his plan was to have more Winter Soldiers in the world. Once Zemo revealed his location, Captain America then attempted to subdue him by launching his shield directly at Zemo, only for it to bounce off the bunker wall.\n\nZemo then calmly noted that if they killed him then they would never learn why he had brought them there, before Captain America then questioned why he killed innocent people, including T'Chaka, simply to bring them to this location. Facing his enemy, Zemo told Captain America that he had thought about nothing else for over a year, and he had studied everything about him, before joking that he sees a bit green in his blue eyes, which Zemo calls a flaw.\n\nCaptain America deduced that Zemo was Sokovian, questioning if this what his revenge was about, only for Zemo to note that Sokovia was a failed state even before it was destroyed by the Avengers, as he explained that he was there because he made a promise, before explaining that due to the Avengers, he had lost everybody he cared about. Zemo then put on the video that he had obtained, noting that the only way to completely destroy an empire, was from within.\n\nZemo watched on while footage of Winter Soldier tracking down and killing Howard and Maria Stark played in front of them, much to Stark's utter shock and horror. Just as Zemo had planned, seeing his parents being killed by the Winter Soldier drove Stark into a fit of rage, made worse as Rogers revealed that he had always known this, resulting in Stark furiously attacking his former allies to kill Winter Soldier, while Zemo then quietly escaped during all of the chaos.[1]\n\nZemo awaited the result of the ensuing battle in the snow, content that he had split the Avengers apart as their leaders fought to the death. While overlooking the landscape, Zemo listened to his wife's final voicemail one last time, before deleting it. Black Panther then found Zemo and they discussed his involvement in the demise of T'Chaka, which had almost led to Black Panther killing the innocent Winter Soldier for revenge due to all of Zemo's manipulations.\n\nSeeing the rage of Captain America and Iron Man, Black Panther refused to allow himself to be consumed by revenge, seeing it within Zemo's heart. Believing his scheme to be complete regardless, Zemo attempted his suicide by placing his gun under his chin; however, the Black Panther stopped him in time by catching the bullet in the palm of his Panther Habit and putting Zemo in a choke hold.[1] Zemo was then bound up by Black Panther, who took him to be arrested.[11]\n\nDespite his suicide attempt being prevented, Zemo succeeded with his mission to divide the Avengers, with Captain America being forced to go on the run, while Iron Man struggled with the choices he had made. Zemo was then left to be mocked by Everett Ross while he was locked inside of a containment cell at the headquarters of the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre in Berlin, Germany.\n\nRoss taunted Zemo by explaining that if he ever tried to escape or even raised his voice in protest, he would receive a painful electric shock, as he continued to encourage Zemo to do this, simply so Ross could see Zemo being electrocuted. While Zemo remained silent, Ross then asked Zemo how it felt to see his plans fail so spectacularly after spending so much time and effort and Zemo simply replied by asking him, \"Did it?\", which surprised and confused Ross.[1]\n\nBy 2024, Zemo had been transferred to a prison in Berlin, remaining closely monitored while continuing to serve his sentence in solitary confinement.[12] During his imprisonment within the Berlin Correctional Facility, Zemo received a visit from Bucky Barnes, to which Zemo had immediately responded by speaking all the words he had memorized from the Winter Soldier Book, attempting to reactivate Barnes' programming. However, Barnes explained that this no longer worked on him, which Zemo admitted that he had already known, but had simply wanted to see how Barnes would react upon hearing those words.\n\nStepping closer to the glass, Zemo looked in Barnes' eye, claiming he still saw the Winter Soldier inside of him. Changing the subject, Zemo noted that Barnes had the luxury of being kept in a Cryostasis Chamber during his imprisonment, to which Barnes insisted that it had not been a pleasant time. Zemo apologized to Barnes, insisting that his actions in framing him for T'Chaka's murder had never been personal, while just calling him a means toward an end goal.\n\nBarnes told Zemo that somebody had managed to recreate the Super Soldier Serum, much to Zemo's surprise, as he deduced that Barnes had assumed that it was Hydra who was behind this, which was why he came to see him. Noting that Barnes must be desperate, Zemo explained that he knew where to begin their investigation, but said nothing more, making it clear to Barnes that he would refuse to assist him if he was forced to continue his imprisonment.\n\nBarnes asked Zemo about the book that he was reading, to which Zemo explained was by Niccolò Machiavelli. Zemo then slid the book to Barnes, who examined it and returned it, before leaving the facility. As Barnes departed, Zemo found that he had managed to slip a key card inside of the book. Shortly after Barnes had left, the alarms across the facility began to go off, as Zemo was able to take advantage of this and exited a cell, while two prisoners fought.\n\nAs he made his way through the facility, Zemo brutally subdued Menz and stole his uniform, which allowed him to make his way through the facility without being questioned, while he used the key card to make his way through the doors, while still keeping his face hidden from all the security cameras. Having allowed riot guards past him, Zemo then pulled the fire alarm, forcing an evacuation from the prison, during which Zemo used the riot and alarm to escape.[3]\n\nHaving successfully escaped from their Berlin Correctional Facility, Zemo then returned into his garage, where he was greeted by Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson, with Wilson being horrified to see that Barnes had assisted with Zemo's escape and demanded that Zemo be taken back to prison, while Barnes insisted that they needed him. As Barnes and Wilson argued, Zemo attempted to make a point, only for Barnes and Wilson to demand that he remain silent.\n\nZemo stood by, as Barnes argued that Wilson had previously broken the Sokovia Accords to stand by his side along with Steve Rogers, and requested that he do it again, while Zemo argued that he was invaluable, to which Wilson simply ordered him to shut up. Wilson then reluctantly agreed to Barnes' plan to allow Zemo to help them, demanding that Zemo not make a move without permission, which Zemo agreed to, while Wilson questioned where they would start.\n\nZemo then brought Barnes and Wilson into the garage and began going through the cars, explaining that they had been collected by his family over generations. As he collected these guns and other equipment, Zemo explained that he had spent years hunting all of the people that Hydra had recruited to recreate the Super Soldier Serum, noting that once the serum was out there, other people like the Avengers could then use it to create armies of super soldiers.\n\nWhile he was talking, Zemo noticed his mask within one of the cars and collected it. Zemo then told Barnes and Wilson that he had ended the Winter Soldier Program once before and had no intention of leaving all his work unfinished, claiming that they would have to scale the ladder of low-lives. Zemo explained that the first stop would be Selby, who he was still connected to, promising that, once they had gone through her, they would eventually be able to find their target.[3]\n\nHaving reclaimed his possessions, Zemo led Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson to his private jet, with Wilson expressing his surprise about Zemo's wealth, to which Zemo explained that he was a Baron, and his family have been Sokovian royalty before his country was destroyed by the Avengers. Zemo then reunited with Oeznik, who expressed his delight upon seeing Zemo again after so many years, before leading them all on board the plane and then taking off.\n\nOnce airborne, Zemo got champagne from Oeznik, who apologized that this might be a little warm, noting that they might not have any good food left, to which Zemo suggested that they give the bad food to Barnes and Wilson. Zemo then noted that they did not know what it had been like to be locked inside of the Berlin Correctional Facility, before then acknowledging that Wilson was held inside the Raft and therefore may understand what it had been like for him.\n\nAlthough Wilson tried to ask where they were going, Zemo became fascinated while reading Barnes' notebook, as he questioned who Nakajima was. In response, Barnes launched out from his seat and grabbed Zemo by the throat, vowing to kill him if he ever touched the notebook again. Zemo apologized, noting that he understood that it was a list of names of all the people he had wronged as the Winter Soldier, while Barnes warned Zemo not to push his luck any more.\n\nWilson then noted that the book had belonged to Steve Rogers, who wrote Wilson's recommendation of Marvin Gaye inside there, although Barnes insisted that he only liked his music from the 1940s. Although Barnes tried to dismiss the point, Zemo insisted all Gaye's music was a masterpiece, which Wilson agreed with. Zemo acknowledged how much they admired Rogers, before noting that when he met him, he realized there was a danger with these people becoming symbols.\n\nZemo went on to insist that people like Rogers got put on pedestals, and people would forget about their flaws, which resulted in the formation of groups like the Avengers, who caused innocent people to die in their wars, noting how they destroyed Novi Grad during their conflicts. Zemo compared this to World War II, asking Barnes if he remembered being sent to Germany to stop Red Skull, before asking if they wanted to live in a world full of people like Red Skull.\n\nZemo informed them that they were going to Madripoor, while Wilson questioned what this place was, to which Barnes explained that it was an island in Indonesia, with Zemo noting that it was a lawless place. However, Zemo then explained that they could not walk inside Madripoor as themselves, as members of the Avengers would likely draw far too much attention, as Zemo informed Barnes that he would actually have to become the Winter Soldier once again.[3]\n\nUpon arriving on the outskirts of Madripoor, Zemo listened, as Sam Wilson complained about the clothes he had been given, insisting that he looked like a pimp, to which Zemo claimed that only an American would see a black man dressed like this as a pimp. Zemo assured Wilson that he had been dressed up as Smiling Tiger, who Wilson would be disguised as during their time within Madripoor.\n\nWhile they got closer to Madripoor, Zemo commented on the smell, before insisting that they would remain in character, no matter what happened, as their lives depended on it. They were then collected by a car, as Zemo pointed out high-town, but insisted that they had to go to low-town for their mission, with Wilson commenting on their lack of friends in Madripoor, which Zemo smiled at. During the drive toward Madripoor, several motorcycles surrounded their car.\n\nOnce they had arrived inside of Madripoor's centre, Zemo led Wilson and Bucky Barnes through the streets, passing armed guards and secret dealings along the way, as he then took them all past the Princess Bar and instead took them inside the Brass Monkey Saloon. Once inside, Zemo spoke to Barnes in Russian, questioning if he would be ready to comply, which Barnes did not respond to. Zemo then brought the group to the bar, where the Bartender mistook Wilson for Smiling Tiger, while Zemo explained that their plans had changed, and they needed to speak with Selby about their business, which the bartender was skeptical about, unsure of their true intentions.\n\nZemo then stood by as Wilson was offered Smiling Tiger's usual drink, which included the insides of a snake, much to Wilson's horror, which Zemo drank with him, despite Wilson's discomforts. However, while they were stood at the bar, Zemo was then approached by one of Brass Monkey Saloon's henchmen, who explained that Zemo was not welcome there, to which Zemo insisted that he did not have business with the Power Broker, but suggested they talk with him in person.\n\nZemo pointed to Barnes to make his point, while the henchman soon recognised Barnes as Winter Soldier, noting that haircut. Once the henchman walked away, Barnes commented on the Power Broker, to which Zemo noted that every kingdom like Madripoor needed a king, suggesting that they should try and stay under his radar. As Wilson questioned if he knew him, Zemo explained that he only knew Power Broker by his reputation, calling him judge, jury and executioner.\n\nZemo saw that more of Power Broker's men had arrived, while Zemo ordered Barnes to attack. Zemo stood by and watched on, as Barnes unleashed his Winter Soldier brutality upon the henchman, crushing a man's wrist with his Prosthetic Arm, with Zemo pushing guards into his path and watching him subdue them. As guns were armed, Zemo ordered Barnes to stop, noting that they had to stay in character, before the bartender then said that Selby would see them.[3]\n\nHaving been granted access, Zemo went upstairs inside the Brass Monkey Saloon to meet with Selby, who insisted that Zemo should not have come into her bar and made demands, to which Zemo insisted that he had actually been making an offer. While Selby noted that a lot had changed since his last visit, she then questioned exactly how and when Zemo had been able to escape from the Berlin Correctional Facility, to which Zemo simply claimed that people like them always found a way to escape.\n\nSelby then greeted Sam Wilson, having mistaken him for the Smiling Tiger, although she noted that he was taller than she expected him to be, before questioning what Zemo's offer was. Zemo explained that he wanted Selby to tell them everything they knew about the Super Soldier Serum, and he would give her the Winter Soldier in exchange, as Zemo walked over to Bucky Barnes, who did not react, promising that he would give Selby the code words that would control him.\n\nZemo then continued to mock Barnes, by caressing his face while promising that he would do anything that Selby required of him, with Selby noting that this was more like the Zemo she had remembered, noting that she was glad she did not have him killed. Selby informed Zemo that the Super Soldier Serum was on Madripoor, where it was being developed by Wilfred Nagel, who had been recruited by the Power Broker to work on the serum, but things did not go to plan.\n\nZemo asked if Nagel was in Madripoor, although Selby explained that she would not be giving up this information for free, insisting that he would not be able to find Nagel without her. However, before the negotiations could continue, they were interrupted when Wilson's phone rang, much to Zemo's frustration, as Selby demanded that he answer the call on speaker. Zemo listened as Wilson answered the call from Sarah Wilson, but attempted to keep his cover intact.\n\nAlthough Wilson had been able to maintain his cover for most of the conversation, this fell about when Sarah called out to Cass, before calling him by his first name. Hearing this, Selby demanded that they be killed, only for a sniper's gunshot to strike Selby through the chest, killing her. Once they had subdued the guards, Zemo rejoined Barnes and Wilson, who insisted that Selby's death would be pinned on them, while Zemo considered their next move.\n\nOnce they got outside, Zemo noticed the mercenaries around them were getting texts, offering a reward for their deaths. Before they could get clear, an assassin began shooting at the three of them, as Zemo ran down the road, separating himself from Barnes and Wilson. Once they reunited, Zemo saw them being saved by the same sniper, whom Zemo had referred to as a guardian angel, before Sharon Carter stepped out of the shadows, holding Zemo at gunpoint.\n\nCarter noted that Zemo had cost her everything, as Zemo stood behind Wilson who insisted that they needed Zemo's help to find the supplier of serum. Zemo listened as Carter had complained that her actions in stealing Captain America's shield and the EXO-7 Falcon to stop Zemo resulted with her being forced to go on the run. However, Barnes requested Carter's help, as she reluctantly offered to protect them in high town, noting that her feud with Zemo was not over.[3]\n\nZemo followed Sharon Carter back to her Art Gallery, where Carter explained that she had made her money hustling in stolen art works ever since going on the run. Although Sam Wilson believed that Carter was lying and sold fake art, Zemo corrected him, explaining that the gallery did sell stolen art by Vincent Van Gogh and Claude Monet, which Bucky Barnes also agreed with.\n\nWhile Wilson and Barnes were given newer clothes by Carter, Zemo got himself a drink, and listened while Wilson asked why Carter had not returned to the United States of America, to which Carter insisted she would be arrested if she returned. Carter questioned if Wilson had given up Captain America's shield because he understood the hypocrisy, which Zemo agreed with, before Carter asked about John Walker as the new Captain America, which Barnes scoffed at.\n\nCarter noted that Barnes had always believed in a patriotic world view, jokingly noting how he had been Captain America's best friend in World War II, before he was Zemo's pet psychopath. Zemo listened on as Wilson explained how the Flag Smashers had stolen the Super Soldier Serum, noting that Wilfred Nagel was their lead, who worked for the Power Broker. Although she warned them to stay out of this, Carter agreed to help them, if Wilson helped to clear her name.\n\nWith Carter agreeing to help, she explained that she would host her party with some connected people, and advised them to stay out of trouble, as Zemo shrugged and commented on causing trouble. At Carter's party, Zemo spent some time at the bar, and admired the art, while under the close watch of Barnes, while he had enjoyed stepping on the floor and dancing. Eventually, Carter rejoined Zemo, Barnes and Wilson, explaining that she had located Nagel.[3]\n\nZemo followed Sharon Carter into the Buccaneer Bay shipyard on the outskirts from Madripoor, with Zemo and Sam Wilson agreeing that Madripoor knew how to party, based upon the previous night, although Carter warned that there was still a bounty on their heads. Carter then led them to a container where Wilfred Nagel seemingly was, giving each of them an earpiece so they could stay in contact, while she would stay outside to keep watch as they confronted Nagel, ensuring nobody would stop them.\n\nZemo stood by as they entered the container, only to find it empty, although Carter insisted that it was the right one. Zemo then gone to the back of the container, and soon noticed that it contained a hidden doorway, which Zemo was able to open, leading Wilson and Bucky Barnes inside of Nagel's Laboratory. Entering, Zemo stayed back as Wilson and Barnes raised up their guns, and soon found Nagel working on the Super Soldier Serum, before turning off his music in order to alarm him.\n\nAlthough Nagel tried to force them out, he stopped once he saw Barnes, recognising him as Winter Soldier, while Nagel introduced Zemo, noting that Nagel would have heard of Zemo. While Nagel attempted to suggest they make a deal, Carter warned them on the radios that bounty hunters were arriving. Zemo then listened as Nagel explained that Hydra had recruited him into their Winter Soldier Program, continuing all their work after the Winter Soldiers had failed to be controllable.\n\nZemo began searching the lab, while Nagel went on to explain that, following Hydra's downfall, he was recruited into the CIA, who had samples of another test subject's blood, which he used to recreate the serum, claiming to have done what no scientist since Abraham Erskine had done. Wilson questioned how they had never heard about this, to which Nagel explained that he had been killed in the Snap before he could complete his work, which was abandoned.\n\nZemo listened on, as Nagel explained that he had come to Madripoor following the Blip, where the Power Broker funded his work, noting he had created twenty vials of the serum, before Karli Morgenthau stole them. While Nagel spoke about Morgenthau seeking help for Donya Madani, Zemo quietly found a gun. Once Carter stormed in, warning that they were out of time, Zemo took his chance and shot Nagel, killing him before Wilson and Carter took the gun away.\n\nHowever, before he could be confronted, Zemo was able to escape as a rocket struck the side of the lab, causing an explosion which knocked everyone off their feet, allowing Zemo to escape during the chaos. While Wilson, Barnes and Carter found themselves cornered by the bounty hunters, Zemo was able to get on top of a container, where he donned his mask, and shot an exposed gas valve, causing a massive explosion which killed several of the bounty hunters in the fireball.\n\nAs the surviving bounty hunters recovered from the explosion, Zemo was then able to leap down from the container and catch them off guard, as he grabbed one bounty hunter and used him as a human shield, before shooting and killing the other three. With that, Zemo kicked over the bounty hunter he had used as a shield, and executed him, before looking through the flames at Barnes, Wilson and Carter, who used the moment as their chance to escape, while Zemo ran from the flames.\n\nWhile he explored the shipyard, Zemo eventually came across one open container, and discovered a sports car inside, as Zemo removed his mask and stole the car. Zemo then regrouped with Barnes, Wilson and Carter in the car, with Wilson then insisting that Zemo would go back to the Berlin Correctional Facility for killing Nagel, only for Zemo to note that they needed him to find Morgenthau. With Carter staying behind in Madripoor, Zemo then gave Barnes and Wilson a lift away from the docks.[3]\n\nFollowing their escape from Madripoor, Zemo brought Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes to his private jet, where he made food while they discussed the legacy of Captain America's shield. Once Zemo rejoined them, Wilson explained that Donya Madani had been found dead in Riga, as Zemo explained that he knew a place they could go to, while also noting he looked forward to meeting Karli Morgenthau.\n\nZemo flew the group to Riga in Latvia, where they walked down the streets, as Zemo discussed what became of Sokovia, noting it had been torn apart by its neighbours in the wake of Novi Grad's destruction at the hands of Ultron and the Avengers, and seemingly erased from the map. Zemo then questioned if either Wilson or Barnes had ever even gone to visit the Sokovian Memorial, but noted they would have never bothered to show their respects.\n\nThey then arrived at their destination, only for Barnes to inform them that he would be going on a walk and would join them later. Although Zemo and Wilson were surprised by this decision, they allowed Barnes to leave and went inside of the building without him.[3] Once in the building, Zemo took some time to have a shower, until Barnes returned, as he explained that he had encountered the Dora Milaje, who had come from Wakanda to recapture Zemo.\n\nAs Barnes insisted that he was not followed there, Zemo questioned how he could be sure, to which Barnes insisted that he would have known. Zemo then commented on how sweet it was for Barnes to defend him, although Wilson ordered him to be quiet, insisting that nobody was defending him. Barnes also commented on how Zemo had murdered Wilfred Nagel, although Zemo advised they not continue discussing Nagel's death, with Wilson insisting that there was no denying this.\n\nHowever, they were then interrupted by Barnes, who told them that the Flag Smashers had just bombed the GRC Supply Depot out in Lithuania, resulting in the deaths of three people, as Zemo noted that Morgenthau was clearly getting worse. Zemo insisted that he had the will to complete their mission and kill Morgenthau, questioning if they did as well, to which Wilson insisted that she was just a kid, although Zemo claimed Wilson was being too hopeful about her.\n\nZemo suggested that Morgenthau was a supremacist, explaining that the concept of a super soldier would always trouble people and claimed that this mind set had previously led to the Nazis, as well as the Avengers and Ultron. In response, Wilson acknowledged that Morgenthau was radicalised, but insisted that there was one peaceful way to stop her. However, Zemo insisted that the desire to be a super soldier could not be separated from their supremacist ideals.\n\nZemo continued to claim that anybody who took the Super Soldier Serum got on the path to supremacy, insisting that Morgenthau may not stop until she was killed, or had killed them. However, Barnes suggested that Zemo could be wrong about his theories, noting that Steve Rogers had never been corrupted after he took the Super Soldier Serum, which Zemo acknowledged was true, but he noted that there had never been another case like Rogers.\n\nFrustrated, Barnes suggested they hand Zemo to the Wakandans, to which Zemo also noted that they would lose their guide as a result. Changing the subject, Wilson acknowledged that Madani had been a pillar of the community, comparing her to his aunt who had passed away, and was given a large funeral, suggesting that Morgenthau would likely attend this funeral for Madani. Zemo agreed, as he took his tin of turkish delights, which he called irresistible.[4]\n\nSeeking to learn where they could find the Flag Smashers, Zemo joined Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes as they visited the GRC's Resettlement Camp. Zemo expressed regrets over the state of the building, noting how he used to visit there for parties and dinners, acknowledging that he had not known the politics at the time, but remembered it being beautiful. Wilson then went to investigate.\n\nWhile Wilson was upstairs, Zemo approached some of those local children, singing Baa, Baa, Black Sheep as he walked over, before placing his Turkish Delights for the children, noting how this had been his son's favorite. While one Brave Girl took the candy, Zemo told her that his old friend Donya Madani had passed away, and he questioned if the girl knew where Madani's funeral would be, as he simply claimed to want to pay his final respects at the funeral.\n\nZemo managed to convince the brave girl to whisper in his ear, telling him where and when Madani's funeral would be. Once he had his information, Zemo noted that Wilson and Barnes were watching him, telling the children that they were very bad men and could not be trusted, as he gave all the children the rest of the candy. Having convinced the children to stay silent, Zemo returned to Wilson and Barnes, while commenting on how cute the children were.[4]\n\nReturning into his residence, Zemo made some tea, while Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes explained that they had not gotten any information about Donya Madani's funeral, with Wilson noting that this was because Karli Morgenthau was the only person who had been fighting for them. Zemo listened to Wilson commenting on how Morgenthau's ideals had come from the world's reaction to the Snap, where countries worked together for a common good.\n\nZemo brought over their teas, as Wilson noted that this all changed once the Blip brought everyone back, with Morgenthau hoping to get the world all working together again, although Barnes questioned if Morgenthau's motives were all that different to Zemo's. Barnes then questioned what the Brave Girl told Zemo, as he just explained that Madani's would be in the afternoon. Barnes then noted that the Dora Milaje were still coming for him, suggesting that he keep talking.\n\nHowever, Zemo suggested that Barnes would leave him to the Dora Milaje once they got to Morgenthau, as he noted that he had wanted to keep his leverage. In response, Barnes furiously grabbed Zemo's drink and smashed it, making his clear threat to his safety, only for Wilson to advice Barnes not to engage with Zemo, noting he would just exploit him and tilt his head in a mocking way. While Wilson went to make a call to Sharon Carter, Zemo offered Barnes cherry tea.[4]\n\nHaving learnt where Donya Madani's funeral would be held by that afternoon, Zemo walked there along with Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes. However, along the way, they were confronted by Captain America and Battlestar, as Captain America insisted that Karli Morgenthau for them to be risking the mission like this, while also questioning why they freed Zemo from the Berlin Correctional Facility, only for Wilson to insist Captain America calm himself down.\n\nAs Captain America became more agitated, Zemo explained that he knew where Morgenthau was going to be, although Captain America stopped his path and demanded answers. As Wilson explained that it would be at a memorial, Zemo walked past, having spotted the Brave Girl who would lead them. Zemo ignored Wilson and Captain America, while they debated whether Captain America should take Morgenthau by surprise, or if Wilson should try and talk her down.\n\nEventually, Battlestar convinced Captain America to go along with Wilson's plans, with Captain America insisting that they would deal with Zemo later, who noted that he was sure it would all come to an agreeable conclusion. Approaching the girl, Zemo handed her some money, telling her to give it to her family, before she led them to the GRC's Resettlement Camp, where Madani's funeral was, as they snuck through in and were pointed to Morgenthau's location.\n\nDespite him assisting them, Zemo was then handcuffed to the wall by Captain America, who also gave Wilson ten minutes to speak to Morgenthau, while Zemo noted that Captain America was being understandably aggressive with him. While they waited, Zemo began noticing Captain America becoming impatient, complaining that this was a bad idea, with Barnes insisting that the ten minutes were not done yet, which had only annoyed Captain America further.\n\nZemo watched on, while Captain America attempted to rush in and to arrest Morgenthau, only to be blocked by Barnes, with Captain America noting his jealously of Barnes being the super soldier, before insisting that Wilson needed his backup to deal with Morgenthau, even suggesting that she may have already killed Wilson. Eventually, Captain America and Battlestar stormed past Barnes to arrest Morgenthau, while Zemo used this opportunity to escape.\n\nAs a result of Captain America's interference, Morgenthau then attempted to escape from the facility, only to run directly into the path of Zemo, who immediately shot her into the stomach. However, Morgenthau survived these shots, and was able to leap behind some cover, while Zemo continued shooting at her, only to lose her bags as she ran, dropping her vials of Wilfred Nagel's Super Soldier Serum as a result, as Zemo soon realized what he was looking at.\n\nSeeing that it was the Super Soldier Serum, Zemo wasted no time in smashing the vials under his boot, intending to ensure that the world would be rid of groups like the Flag Smashers and Avengers, while ignoring Morgenthau's pleads for him to stop. While Zemo smashed the vials, Morgenthau escaped with the help of Nico, only for Zemo to then finally be stopped from his rampage when Captain America threw his shield at Zemo's head, which knocked Zemo out.[4]\n\nHaving returned to his residence, Zemo recovered from the blow to the head by drinking a whiskey and wearing a wet cloth over his eyes. Zemo then asked Sam Wilson if he had ever been offered their Super Soldier Serum, which Wilson denied, to which Zemo went on to ask if Wilson would have accepted it if he was. With Wilson insisting that he would not have, Zemo call this impressive, before claiming that Wilson could not hold out hope for Karli Morgenthau's redemption, since it was already too late.\n\nZemo claimed that Morgenthau was beyond any redemptions, and they could not allow her, nor the Flag Smashers to turn themselves into gods, as he believed Super Soldiers should never be allowed to exist. However, Wilson noted that Zemo was also talking like a god, before questioning if Bucky Barnes should not be allowed to exist as well. They were interrupted by Barnes' return, who insisted there was something wrong with Captain America, which Wilson agreed with.\n\nWhile Zemo watched Wilson and Barnes debating who should have been given the shield, they were interrupted as Captain America and Battlestar arrived and attempted to arrest Zemo. However, Wilson refused to surrender Zemo, noting that Captain America had ruined his talk with Morgenthau and that Zemo had actually proved himself useful to them. Before Captain America could challenge Wilson to a fight, Nomble then threw her Vibranium Spear between them.\n\nZemo witnessed Ayo and Yama also arriving, while Ayo insisted that Zemo would be taken into the custody of the Dora Milaje, although Captain America refused. As tensions rose, Zemo continued to drink his whiskey as he watched the Dora Milaje fight against Captain America and Battlestar, with Wilson and Barnes reluctantly joining the clash. While the fight progressed, Zemo took his opportunity to quietly step into the bathroom and escape through a hidden hole.[4]\n\nDespite managing to escape Latvia, Zemo knew that he would be apprehended soon enough, and so he fled back to Sokovia, to visit the Sokovian Memorial and pay his respects. Soon enough, while Zemo was standing by the memorial, he was interrupted by the arrival of Bucky Barnes, with Zemo noting that he thought Barnes would have arrived sooner. Zemo told Barnes that he did not need to worry about him, since he had decided not to kill him, with Barnes then noting his own sarcastic relief about Zemo's decision.\n\nWhile Barnes made it clear that he had a gun, Zemo then explained that Karli Morgenthau had become radicalized beyond the point of redemption, noting that he had warned Sam Wilson about this, but Wilson had not listened, comparing Wilson's stubbornness to Steve Rogers. Zemo then noted Barnes that Hydra had programmed him to kill, so he knew what had to be done about Morgenthau in order to ensure that the Flag Smashers did not complete their mission.\n\nAlthough Barnes claimed that he appreciated Zemo's advice, he insisted that they would stop Morgenthau in their own way, which Zemo scoffed at, noting that he was afraid Barnes would say that. Zemo then witnessed Barnes clicking his gun, before aiming it at Zemo's head, seemingly prepared to execute him. Willing to die and be reunited with his wife and son, Zemo did not resist, and instead nodded in approval to Barnes, giving him permission to shoot.\n\nHowever, when Barnes pulled the trigger, the gun simply clicked, much to Zemo's surprise. As Barnes raised up his Prosthetic Arm, he dropped all of the gun's bullets down onto the floor. Zemo was then surrounded by the Dora Milaje, who had arrived to take him into their custody, with Zemo then smiling at Barnes as he realized what was happening. Zemo then told Barnes that he had already crossed off his own name out of his list, believing that they had both now found their closure from everything that they put themselves through.\n\nHaving accepted his defeat, Zemo claimed to hold no grudges against Barnes for this decision to hand him over to the Dora Milaje rather than executing him, and said his final goodbye to him, before being taken away by Nomble and Yama, while Barnes spoke to Ayo about the situation. Zemo was then taken back onboard of the Dora Milaje's Royal Talon Fighter, where they intended to take him to the Raft, where Zemo would live out the rest of his life behind bars.[13]\n\nPrior to his arrest, Zemo ensured his own agenda for ending the Flag Smashers would not go unfinished. To that end, Zemo employed Oeznik to set off his bomb on an armored truck carrying Dovich, Gigi and DeeDee after their failed attack on the GRC. While imprisoned in his cell at the Raft and continuing to read his books, Zemo heard the news of the vehicle bombing on his radio and smiled at the prospect of hearing his mission was fulfilled, and relaxed on his bed.[14]\n\nHelmut Zemo was a member of a death squad in the Sokovian Armed Forces and managed to build a happy family despite the nature of his job. However, the war between the Avengers and Ultron resulted in the death of his whole family, and he became consumed with anger and hatred. Despite knowing the Avengers were not the villains of that war, Zemo nevertheless held them responsible, as well as all enhanced individuals in general, believing them to be the reason behind all chaos in the world. Without any means or resources to take the powerful group head-on, he wished to destroy the Avengers from the inside, ensuring that they are forever crippled, if not dismantled.\n\nWhile he is a very vengeful man, he is actually more the ultimate personification of manipulation, as he is able to carefully plan and execute all the steps required to manipulate the 'pieces' involved to do his bidding, whether if said 'pieces' realize it or not. His use of psychological warfare was so brilliant that he was able to compensate for previously unaccounted factors--including the death of T'Chaka and Black Panther joining the fray, and turn these seemingly rogue factors into means to further his plans.\n\nDespite his relentless attempts at trying to destroy the Avengers, Zemo is ultimately not without a conscience. He first tried to interrogate Vasily Karpov, but stated that if he did not get the mission report from the officer, then he would resort to more violent means that he would not enjoy. Zemo also sincerely apologized to T'Challa for killing his father, and even opened up to him about why he wanted the Avengers destroyed. This caused even T'Challa, a man who had wanted Zemo's death the most, to sympathize with his current situation, and even spare him, as he realized that revenge would have completely consumed and destroyed him, as it did with Zemo.\n\nZemo intended to kill himself after avenging his family, as he had little else to live for, and only T'Challa's timely intervention stopped him from shooting himself. Zemo kept a voice message of his late wife on his phone as one of the last connections from his former life that he held onto, which he often played over. He deleted the message as he was about to commit suicide--a sign that he was ready to join his family. Even after being saved from being assassinated by Charmagne Sund, Zemo attempted to commit suicide once again by jumping off of the roof of the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building, showing that his desire to join his family in death still remained even after his imprisonment.\n\nAs a person out to destroy what he sees as an empire, he ironically is fearful of loss despite being someone who has little else to lose. His plans required careful planning and execution, which in turn require extreme levels of patience and focus with loads of contingencies ready at hand, as the slightest mistake or oversight could easily result in the complete failure of his endeavor.\n\nLike most who are out for vengeance and have committed horrible acts to do so, he feels no joy and finds no solace despite the fact that his plans ultimately succeed while he comes out alive. At the end of his journey, Zemo's motivation to live dissipated and he is overcome by grief and guilt, seeing death as the only way out of his misery and making amends for the atrocities he wreaked.\n\nDespite his intense demeanor and capability for extreme violence and destruction, Zemo possesses a lighter side to his personality. Despite his career as a soldier, he was a family man who was a loving husband and father to his wife and son respectively, and shared a close bond with his own father. This mellow side even extends to his hobbies, as he is passionate about car collecting, the arts, and when given the chance to relax in Madripoor, even danced at a nightclub.\n\nAlthough Zemo hates the Avengers, he respects Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes, the latter two of which he worked alongside after escaping prison and even seemed to enjoy a bit. Zemo goes on to explain he hates the Avengers as a symbol - super soldiers like Rogers were put on a pedestal, and are dangerous when left unchecked, as their very power represents supremacist ideals. Rogers was an exception as he does not abuse his power or get corrupted - as Sam is an ordinary human trying to do the right thing, like Zemo, he has nothing against him.\n\nZemo told Wilson and Barnes that he held no grudges toward either of them, despite them both being members or allies to the Avengers. However, despite his word, he did playfully slight them whenever possible, telling the Latvian kids that they were very bad people, attempting to control Bucky, and pointing out that they could not turn him over to the Dora Milaje since he was their lead on the Flag Smashers. However, despite his actions, Zemo has nothing but gratitude toward Wilson and Barnes, who allowed him to briefly have a life again, as well as accomplish his mission of destroying the remaining Super Soldier Serum.\n\nZemo is also an honorable man. Aside from being forced to escape from the Dora and killing Wilfred Nagel, which was inevitable, he showed no intent of betraying Wilson and Barnes, as much as he teased manipulating them. Later, when Barnes confronted Zemo at the Sokovian Memorial, Zemo peacefully accepted that Barnes might shoot him - and when Barnes revealed it was a bluff to buy time for the Dora Milaje to catch him, Zemo showed no anger or resistance, but rather told him he respected his decision and bid him a well-wishing farewell before he was taken to the Raft to be imprisoned.",
