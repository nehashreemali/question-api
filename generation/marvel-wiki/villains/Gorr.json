  "content": "Gorr was a vengeful galactic killer who sought the extinction of all gods, coming to be known throughout the galaxy as the God Butcher. Once a devout and peaceful man, Gorr lost his faith after the death of his daughter. Enraged at how the gods belittled his suffering, Gorr happened upon the All-Black the Necrosword. With his life entwined with the blade, Gorr embarked on a campaign of slaughter against the gods, while seeking Eternity to grant his wish to bring about their extinction. Requiring the Bifrost Bridge to open the Gates of Eternity, Gorr kidnapped the children of New Asgard to lure Thor to him, intending to steal Stormbreaker, which could summon the Bifrost. Confronted in the Shadow Realm, Gorr took Stormbreaker, proceeding to seek out Eternity, where he was confronted again by Thor and the Mighty Thor, who shattered the Necrosword. Managing to reach Eternity, the dying Gorr was convinced by Thor to use his wish to bring his daughter back, whom Gorr entrusted her to Thor, dying as a content man.\n\nGorr was given a daughter, and they both constantly prayed to their planet's god Rapu, with his daughter drawing pictures of him while Gorr prayed. He had his head tattooed with symbols of his devotion to Rapu.[3] However, despite Gorr's continuous prayers to Rapu, the people of Gorr's planet died from the heat and lack of food and water, leaving only Gorr and his increasingly weakening daughter left.[1]\n\nSometime later, Gorr was forced to carry his daughter up to their altar, with Gorr pleading to Rapu to provide them sustenance. However, when Gorr noticed his daughter was on the verge of death, he cradled her, telling his daughter that there was going to be a great land and water for them, but his weakened daughter just told Gorr that she was tired before passing away in his arms.[1]\n\nAwaiting his own death, Gorr mourned for his daughter until he heard a voice beckoning for him. Confused, Gorr followed the voice into a lavish forest, where he gratefully submerged himself in the stream, replenishing his body with water after a long time going without.\n\nAs Gorr crawled out of the stream, he cut his hand on a sword, but the cut instantaneously healed. Noticing fruit before him, Gorr desperately began to eat it until he heard a voice. Recognizing the person as the god Rapu, Gorr immediately bowed in front of him, before introducing himself as the last of his Disciples. Gorr explained that his people's faith in Rapu never wavered and they now awaited the \"eternal reward\" that Rapu had promised, which was what Gorr thought the fruit was for.\n\nMocking Gorr, Rapu clarified that there was no eternal reward, and that they were celebrating the death of the Dark Shadow Lord, who had been the last wielder of All-Black the Necrosword, whom was threatening his empire. Gorr pointed out how there's no empire left, but Rapu answered, stating that there will always be more followers to replace him. Saddened, Gorr told how his kind have suffered, and how they and his daughter died in his name. Rapu was not empathetic and claimed that they deserved to die in his name.\n\nThe now enraged Gorr stated that Rapu was not a god and therefore was unworthy of worship, tearing off his medallion. Rapu grabbed Gorr by the throat, proclaiming that Gorr now had a purpose, to be sacrificed to Rapu by his hand. However, the shadow that Gorr and Rapu cast, allowed the Necrosword to rise into Gorr's hands, telling him to find Eternity by using a Bifrost Bridge, where he could exact his revenge against the gods. Accepting this, Gorr proceeded to stab Rapu in the throat.\n\nPutting him down, Rapu explained to Gorr how the Necrosword had chosen him, and that now Gorr will be cursed by the sword. However, as the Necrosword physically changed Gorr, he told Rapu and the other gods that it didn't feel like a curse, but a promise, before stating that his vow was to kill all of the gods. Gorr then beheaded Rapu, marking the first kill of his campaign to achieve his revenge.[1]\n\nTaking on the Necrosword's goal, Gorr traveled the cosmos through the Shadow Realm, and with the help of the Shadow Monsters, they slayed any gods he could find until he found Eternity. This violent massacre eventually led to Gorr being known as the God Butcher, and he became feared by the likes of Zeus, among others. On his journey, Gorr killed the Sky Lords of Indigarr, leaving the Indigarrians unprotected, allowing Habooska the Horrible and his army to invade the planet.[1]\n\nDuring this time, Gorr would be challenged by Falligar the Behemoth and Lady Sif on Falligar; however, with it being a trap, Gorr killed Falligar and cut off Sif's arm in battle, leaving her alive to warn Thor. Gorr proceeded to travel to New Asgard, where he intended to lure Thor so that he could obtain Stormbreaker so that he could open to Gates of Eternity.[1]\n\nGorr traveled to Earth and went to New Asgard, Norway. He stared out at New Asgard, before sending the Shadow Monsters to attack the Asgardians. Gorr stayed back and waited until he witnessed Thor arrive on the Bifrost Bridge, which made him smile. Gorr made his approach towards Thor, utilising the shadows to disappear so that he could sneak up on him.\n\nAfter ambushing him, Gorr used the Shadow Monsters to pin Thor to a car and threatened him with All-Black the Necrosword. Gorr attempted to steal Stormbreaker, but Thor fought back. Now cornered by Thor, Mighty Thor, and Valkyrie, Gorr realized that he was not going to be able to steal Stormbreaker and retreated into the shadows. Instead, Gorr came up with a new plan to kidnap all of the Asgardian children and put them in a cage. Thor and Mighty Thor chased after Gorr, but he escaped with the children.[1]\n\nAs Gorr flew the cage to the Shadow Realm, he overheard Axl Heimdallson recounting the story of how Thor went to Nidavellir to forge Stormbreaker, and then used it to decapitate Thanos. Wanting to intimidate the children, Gorr teleported into their cage suddenly, startling them. He told them what a nice story that was, before introducing the children to Octy, who he then proceeded to tear the head off of, frightening the children.\n\nGorr mockingly asked why they were upset as they had liked the decapitation story earlier. He then threw Octy's head at them. Gorr then noticed a young girl and told the rest how he had a daughter, telling them how she liked to draw but that the gods were not there to protect her. When he stated they were alone, Axl reassured the children that Thor was on his way to rescue them, which Gorr menacingly told them that he was counting on it, before leaving the kids by themselves.[1]\n\nReturning to the Shadow Realm, Gorr waited for Thor to arrive. Once Thor, Mighty Thor, and Valkyrie entered Gorr's hut, he engulfed the room with shadows and revealed himself. Mighty Thor threw Mjølnir at Gorr, but he dodged it and proceeded to restrain the three heroes with tentacles. Gorr told Thor to summon Stormbreaker, but he refused.\n\nGorr noted how Thor was denied help from the gods, something they had in common, but Valkyrie insisted that they were nothing alike. Gorr pulled Valkyrie closer to him and responded that he, unlike Thor, was not a hypocrite as he felt that he was creating peace. Gorr was then excited when he realized Valkyrie was a member of the Valkyries, and stated that the gods failed her, too, as her sisters-in-arms were all killed. Gorr taunted Valkyrie over her losses, deeply upsetting her, before moving her aside.\n\nGorr directed his attention to Mighty Thor, sensing that she was different from Thor and Valkyrie, as she was dying. Gorr explained that much like how All-Black the Necrosword empowered him, Mjølnir empowered her, but it did not save her from what was killing her. Gorr reiterated how the gods would use them, but would do nothing to help them, and that there would be no eternal reward for their service. Gorr then moved Mighty Thor away, telling Thor that she would be dead soon.\n\nReturning to Thor, Gorr stood behind him as he presented Mighty Thor and Valkyrie still restrained before them. Gorr confessed that he understood Thor's pain, revealing he had a daughter and that he had hoped the gods would save her, only for her to die. But, Gorr had now come to the mentality that his daughter was lucky as she did not have to live in a world run by wicked gods. Gorr once more told Thor to summon Stormbreaker while strangling Mighty Thor and Valkyrie to motivate him.\n\nThor eventually gave in and summoned Stormbreaker, but used its power to destroy the hut, freeing all of them from Gorr's hold. In return, Gorr summoned many Shadow Monsters to help him fight against the heroes. Gorr stared down with Thor and gestured towards Stormbreaker before running at each other. As Mighty Thor and Valkyrie were distracted with the Shadow Monsters, Gorr battled against Thor, but was still unable to defeat him and claim Stormbreaker.\n\nMighty Thor and Valkyrie soon joined the fight and teamed up against Gorr, managing to overpower him, allowing Valkyrie to stab him in the back with Thunderbolt. Thor and Mighty Thor went to fight off more of the Shadow Monsters, leaving Valkyrie alone with Gorr as they fought. Gorr used the shadows to appear behind Valkyrie and stabbed her, badly injuring her. Thor went to help Valkyrie, but Gorr had him restrained. Thor broke free and blasted lightning at Gorr, forcing him to retreat. As the heroes accessed the Bifrost Bridge to escape, Gorr reappeared and stole Stormbreaker from Thor.[1]\n\nWith everything he needed, Gorr headed for the Gates of Eternity, still keeping the children captive. Once they arrived, Gorr planted Stormbreaker to the ground, using the Shadow Tentacles to force it in place, and summoned the Bifrost Bridge towards the entrance to open the passageway to Eternity.\n\nNoticing Thor's arrival behind him, Gorr summoned more Shadow Monsters to protect him so that his mission would not be interrupted. Thor got pass the Shadow Monsters and confronted Gorr, so the two fought. Gorr managed to disarm Thunderbolt from Thor and was able to overpower him, beating Thor to the ground. To finish Thor off, Gorr went to stab him through the chest with All-Black the Necrosword, but Thor managed to catch the sword. As Gorr pushed the Necrosword downwards, he was knocked away by Mjølnir.\n\nMighty Thor arrived, and she teamed up with Thor to fight against Gorr, who found himself quickly outmatched. As Thor went to stop Stormbreaker, Gorr continued fighting Mighty Thor. As they clashed, Gorr told Mighty Thor that she had lost, mockingly calling her \"Lady Thor.\" As Mighty Thor corrected him, she repeatedly attacked him with Mjølnir. When the two collided their weapons, Mighty Thor created a powerful burst of energy that sent them backwards, weakening the Necrosword.\n\nGorr went to attack Mighty Thor, but was blocked by Thor. Gorr violently swung at Thor to kill him until the Necrosword was caught between Thunderbolt. With Gorr's sword stuck in place, Mighty Thor threw Mjølnir at it, shattering it into pieces and knocking Gorr to the ground. Gorr reclaimed the hilt and attempted to reforge the sword, but Mighty Thor captured the shards inside of Mjølnir and summoned lightning to destroy them. The Necrosword turned to dust, stripping Gorr of his power, so he hurried to the opened gateway.[1]\n\nNow before Eternity, Gorr prepared to complete his mission by making his wish. Thor told Gorr to stop, but he felt that he owed it to his daughter to finish what he started. Thor appealed to Gorr, claiming that he knew his pain and that he wasn't seeking revenge, but love.\n\nGorr was confused by Thor's suggestion, and when Thor walked away, Gorr was angered at him. Thor stated that Gorr had won so he was going to spend his last moments with Jane Foster, who was now in a weakened state. Gorr listened as Thor told him that he could bring his daughter back. But, as he felt the effects of All-Black the Necrosword wearing off, Gorr noted that he was dying and would not be able to look after his daughter. Foster assured Gorr that Thor would care for her, which he agreed to do.\n\nConvinced by Thor and Foster, Gorr made his wish to Eternity to bring his daughter back to life. As Gorr laid in the water, he was overcome with happiness to see his daughter returned. The two hugged and Gorr began to cried over how much he had missed her. Gorr then told his daughter that he was sorry. After Foster died, Gorr turned to Thor, extended his arm out to him, and asked him to protect his daughter. Thor nodded to Gorr, who then died in his daughter's arms.[1]\n\nPrior to his fall, Gorr was a simple, devout man who cared deeply for his daughter and his people, loyally praying to the god Rapu for salvation for his people and his daughter prior to her death. Even after his daughter's death, Gorr still believed in his idol Rapu, and believes that Rapu can bring his people to a bright future and bring them an \"eternal reward\" after all the suffering his people endured. This changed after he met the very god he prayed to, an arrogant spiteful being that showed no empathy towards mortals and mockingly dismissed Gorr's hopes that he would come to the aid of his people, or that he would reward them at the end of their lives, even dismissing Gorr as merely a disciple who could be replaced by future ones. Gorr's purpose of his entire life was defeated as he lost faith in his idol and other gods. As he renounced his god, All-Black the Necrosword called to him and was summoned into his hand, and he decapitated Rapu, swearing an oath to kill all gods.\n\nAfter he acquired the Necrosword, the corruption of the sword steadily eroded Gorr's mind, making him increasingly vengeful in his quest to kill all gods, even killing kind gods like Falligar the Behemoth, who wasn't arrogant like Gorr's original idol. Gorr believed that all gods were arrogant and would only use their disciples, as reflected when he told Mighty Thor she was used by gods, who did nothing to ease her pain and disease and even exacerbated her cancer with the continued use of Mjølnir. Gorr believes all gods are equally guilty and that he is truly creating galactic peace by exterminating gods. This reflects that Gorr in fact became delusional after his fall, and would stereotype all gods as arrogant. He gained a dark sense of humor which he would use on everyone to unsettle his enemies and to scare the Asgardian children he took as hostage. He would also behave visibly excited when he met Valkyrie in Shadow Realm. However, it could be inferred that Gorr still retained a liking of children after being corrupted by the Necrosword, just like Gorr's love of his own daughter prior to his fall, as Gorr had kidnapped Asgardian children and, in a twisted act of trying to play with the kids, killed Octy and scared the kids instead. Gorr was also manipulative. In an attempt to persuade Valkyrie in believing in his twisted view, Gorr told her that her gods did nothing when her lover died fighting Hela. This manipulative trait stems from his delusional views though, as Gorr failed to see that not all gods are as he thought.\n\nThe corruption of the Necrosword also made Gorr arrogant. Even after losing the Necrosword, Gorr asked Thor why Thor dared turn his back on him, reflecting that Gorr has truly became arrogant and somewhat condescending in his ways, demanding gods to respect and fear him even though he lost his powers along with his weapon.\n\nThough, in front of Eternity and free from the Necrosword's influences, Thor reminded Gorr that his rampage and hatred against gods were in fact fueled by the love for his deceased daughter. Gorr realized that with the ultimate power of Eternity, he could revive his daughter whom he missed very much. Seeing Thor return to Jane Foster out of love after he told Gorr to make his wish to exterminate all gods at once, Gorr realized it wasn't too late to change his ways, by resurrecting his daughter who he truly wants. With his own will, in his last moments of life, Gorr chose love over revenge and was even willing to entrust his daughter to be raised by a god.\n\nUltimately, Gorr deeply loved his daughter, as shown when he was on the verge of weeping while telling Rapu how he and his people suffered leading to the death of his daughter. In front of Eternity, Gorr also asked Thor what kind of father he would be if he stopped his conquest in the last moment, falsely believing he did justice to his daughter by killing all gods, when he was actually using the death of his daughter as an excuse for his villainous deeds.",
