  "content": "Xu Wenwu (Mandarin: 徐文武) was a legendary and nearly mythical figure who rose to power after discovering a set of mythical rings, and founded the army known as the Ten Rings. Xu established himself as a powerful warlord who conquered kingdoms over the millennia, the rings' power gifting him immortality. In the modern-day, Xu had continued seeking power, finding the ancient city of Ta Lo. He fell in love with Ta Lo's gatekeeper, Ying Li, and fathered Xu Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing. Despite swearing off violence to raise his family, Xu eventually reclaimed his rings when Ying was murdered at the hands of the Iron Gang. He trained Shang-Chi to be an assassin to avenge his wife's murder. However, Xu's two children would grow fearful of their father and eventually abandon him.\n\nIn the 21st Century, Xu discovered that Aldrich Killian was able to recruit Trevor Slattery to impersonate Xu himself, giving him the Mandarin moniker, while also appropriating the legend of the Ten Rings. Enraged at Slattery's portrayal of him, Xu had him abducted and sentenced to imprisonment for tarnishing his name. Eventually, Xu would begin hearing his late wife's voice, urging him to free her from imprisonment in Ta Lo. Xu sought out his children to aid him, only for Shang-Chi and Xialing to reject his request, siding with Ying Nan to stop his army. Through his attempts to rescue his wife, Xu unintentionally unleashed the Dweller-in-Darkness. Xu sacrificed himself to protect Shang-Chi from the Dweller, passing the Ten Rings down to him, before the Dweller then drained his soul from Xu's body and killed him.\n\nAround a thousand years ago, Xu Wenwu discovered ten rings which had gifted him with unmatched power and immortality. Possessing the power of the rings, Xu soon became a powerful warlord and founded the organization, known as the Ten Rings.[2] Xu's past was shrouded in mystery, but his followers had described him as being an ancient warrior-king that has inspired generations of men since the Middle Ages. As the leader of the Ten Rings, Xu had become a myth to his followers, with only his most trusted men being aware that he really existed.[1]\n\nHaving established his name as a legendary and feared warlord, Xu traveled across Asia, building the power of the Ten Rings and conquering whatever lands he desired. On one instance, Xu would lead his army to a castle occupied by the Seljuk Empire, who stood in fear as Xu approached alone, on horseback. As a sea of arrows were fired at him, Xu unleashed the power of his Ten Rings, blocking the arrows as he charged forward.\n\nWith the power of his rings, Xu launched himself through the air, and landed in the middle of the defending army, as he swiftly used the power of his rings to obliterate his enemies. Keeping his foes at bay, Xu eventually launched a massive power strike from his rings, which blew through the opposing army and obliterated the gateway into the castle. Xu and his army were swiftly victorious, and had claimed the castle in the name of the Ten Rings.\n\nXu and his army would take control of another facility, which would become the Ten Rings Headquarters, where Xu would continue ruling over the Ten Rings, observing his army of soldiers training. Through the few hundred years, Xu would use his army's to continue building his power, as they assassinated their enemies and conquered more of the globe. However, despite the immense power he had gained, Xu would never be satisfied, and continued seeking more power.\n\nStill desiring power, Xu led his Ten Rings into further battles. During one battle on a snow covered field, Xu found himself surrounded by another army, but with the power of his ten rings on his arms, Xu was able to easily overpower them, swiping the rings across the battle field and killing dozens of soldiers. Xu threw the rings at the army's wagons and uncovered their gold supplies, further building his power and wealth through the might of the ten rings.[2]\n\nUnder the leadership of Xu, the Ten Rings continued to conquer much of the world, expanding their reach beyond Asia, as they took bases across India and Europe. As the decades went by, Xu found himself unbeatable, with his vast armies standing alongside him, as well as the power of his own ten rings, which he could use to destroy any armies that stood in his way. As Xu's strength grew, he allowed the Ten Rings to fall into the shadows, focusing on manipulating world events, rather than going into war.\n\nWith the wealth he had gathered from centuries of conquering Asia and claiming rival armies for himself, Xu's confidence and strength was unmatched. His soldiers became known in legend as some of the most feared in the globe. Xu and the Ten Rings continued moving with the times, upgrading their weaponry, as they continued to use Hooked-Swords, but would electrify them for extra damage, while many soldiers would use guns and bombs to their advantage. However, Xu's only weapon remained his own ten rings, which he would never remove from his arms, ensuring he remained one of the most dangerous men in the world.\n\nXu led the Ten Rings into a global spy and terrorist organisation, as they focused on assassinations rather than all out war. During World War II, Xu had one of his soldiers detonate a bomb within London.[2] With their reach now expanding across the globe, Xu had a Ten Rings organisation established in Afghanistan, and put Raza Hamidmi al-Wazar in charge of it.[6] Due to their power, Xu gained many enemies across the globe, who sought to kill him and destroy the Ten Rings, including organisations such as the Iron Gang, who mistakenly believed that due to their apparant silence, Xu and the Ten Rings were less of a threat.[2]\n\nIn 1996, Xu, not yet fully satisfied with the power that he had amassed over the centuries, decided to seek out the village of Ta Lo, said to contain various mythical beasts, to expand his powers. Xu returned to the Ten Rings Headquarters, onboard his Helicopter, while examining his books about Ta Lo and the creatures that were rumored to reside there.[2]\n\nUpon landing at the headquarters, where the guards bowed to him, Xu was greeted by Hui, who commented that he heard that their work in Afghanistan was going well, to which Xu noted that Raza Hamidmi al-Wazar had done good work at capitalizing on the instability in the region. Xu and Hui walked through the Ten Rings soldiers training, as Hui noted they were doing good work presenting Xu with pictures of dead men.\n\nHui then explained to Xu that they had successfully killed every member of the Iron Gang, as they had been caught attempting to sell weapons in their territory without paying their dues to the Ten Rings. Xu was then presented with the new Iron Gang leader, who had been captured and was awaiting execution. Xu then calmly removed the leader's hood, as he questioned if he knew who he was, which the leader confirmed.\n\nXu also questioned if the man knew the fate of men who stole from the Ten Rings, who which the leader noted that Xu's men had already killed his family, insisting that he should finish the job. In response, Xu grabbed the leader's throat and powered up his rings, only to instead tell the man to kill himself. With that, Xu ordered Hui to let the leader return home with no further punishment, before he returned to his office.[8]\n\nReturning to the prospect that he had come to discuss, Xu had a meeting with Hui in his office, where he had explained his plan to find Ta Lo and claim their power for his own, with Hui promising that he would arrange for the Ten Rings to send out a scouting team to search the area for him as soon as possible. However, Xu's desire for the power that Ta Lo held, led him to insisting that they leave immediately to find it.[2]\n\nOnce they tracked down the area, Xu and Hui were driven through the forests in their Jeeps, with Xu still closely examining his books for more details on the area. However, as they were driving, they realized that the forest was closing in around them, forcing their driver to attempt to flee.\n\nOnce they reached a clearing, Xu realized that they were driving towards a cliff, as he used his rings to fling himself out of the car and land safely on the cliff edge. However, he was too late to save his allies, as Xu watched the car full to the bottom of the cliff, with Hui and his men still inside. Despite the loss, Xu continued on with his mission, going through the forest on foot.\n\nDespite the forest itself having attacked him and his men, he made it to village's entrance, where he encountered a woman named Ying Li, who guarded the entrance to Ta Lo. She and Xu engaged in a fight, where she displayed her own impressive combat skills, but the two immediately began to fall in love.\n\nDuring the fight, Ying held her own against his Ten Rings, making Xu really impressed. However, much to his shock, Ying used her own powers to manipulate his Ten Rings so that they start to act against him, using his own powers against him. Ying temporarily took the ownership of all of his rings and turned it into a powerful energy ball to attack Xu, making him clash against a tree. However, before he would fall down hard on the ground and get seriously injured, Ying redirected him to the river using her powers, thereby saving his life.[2]\n\nA highly impressed Xu deeply fell in love for Ying Li, not just the only woman to defeat him in a thousand years, but the only person. A lovestruck Xu returned to Ta Lo's gates again and again to meet Ying, where they would have dates at that same location and eventually fell in love. However, the villagers of Ta Lo would not accept Xu, fearing his past sins would have destroyed the village. As a result, Ying decided to leave Ta Lo with Xu.[2]\n\nWith Ying Li having chosen to leave Ta Lo in order to be with Xu, he in return chose to dedicate himself to a life of peace, focused on his love for her. As a result, Xu made the decision to aside his terrorist empire and even forsake the power of the Ten Rings in order to be with her, placing the rings in a box and accepting a limited life span in exchange for their relationship.\n\nXu and Ying eventually married, settling down inside the compound that had once been the headquarters of the Ten Rings. The pair would have two children together, a son named Xu Shang-Chi and a daughter named Xu Xialing. For a time, Xu settled down with his family, believing he had finally found a purpose worthy to grow old for, with no desire to return to his former life as a war lord, instead enjoying nights of playing games and practicing martial arts as a family.\n\nDuring this time, Xu and Ying had attempted to return to Ta Lo and live in peace there, however, the elders of Ta Lo, led by Guang Bo turned them away, claiming that Xu's history with the Ten Rings would destroy the peace of Ta Lo. Despite feeling insulted by this claim, Xu still made no retaliation, as he and Ying chose to remain in their home with their family, with Ying still teaching their children about the legends associated with Ta Lo, while Xu dedicated himself to peace.[2]\n\nOne evening in 2007, Xu had left his home, leaving Ying Li to look after their children, as she would train Shang-Chi in the ancient fighting style of Ta Lo. However, once Xu had returned to their home, he discovered a scene of destruction, with Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing standing among the chaos. Xu discovered that the Iron Gang had come searching for him to get revenge for his past actions, and had proceeded to murder Ying Li when they could not find him.\n\nXu was devastated by the loss of Ying, and returned to his room to grieve. Once Shang-Chi came to speak to his father, Xu was staring at his rings and noted that this never would have happened had he been wearing them, as the Iron Gang would not have dared to challenge him. With that, Xu decided to put the rings back on and avenge his wife's death.[2]\n\nHaving put the rings back on and chosen to return to his former life of violence and war, Xu began searching for the members of the Iron Gang who had invaded his home and murdered his wife. After tracking them down to a bar, Xu brought Shang-Chi along with him so that the latter could witness his father getting his payback for Ying Li's death, walking hand in hand with Shang-Chi into the Iron Gang's bar, as customers looked on in surprise.\n\nLetting go of Shang-Chi's hand, Xu stepped over to the table where the Iron Gang were enjoyed themselves, powered up his rings, and smashed his fist through their table. Before they could even react, Xu proceeded to mercilessly slaughter the Iron Gang and used the rings to launch them across the bar with incredible force, leaving Shang-Chi to watch in shock and then step aside as Xu used the power of his rings to launch one of the gang members into a glass wall next to him.\n\nWith the final gang member lying seriously injureed by Shang-Chi's feet, Xu stepped over to him, pressing his foot hard down against his chest, and demanded to know where the Iron Gang Leader was so that he could kill him and avenge Ying Li. Unfortunately, the gang member insisted that he did not know, which Xu accepted. Having reestablished his reputation as a warrior to be feared, Xu proceeded to kill him with a blast of energy to the head, as Shang-Chi looked on in shock at the violence.\n\nWith his revenge partly satisfied by this massacre of the Iron Gang's members, Xu turned his attention back towards Shang-Chi, as he asked if he was willing to help avenge his mother, insisting that a blood debt would have to be paid in blood. When Shang-Chi nodded yes to this, Xu took his hand and the two of them left the Iron Gang's bar behind, with Xu planning on how he would find the gang's leader and finally kill him, while also rebuilding his former power.[2]\n\nAlthough he avenged Ying Li's death with the slaughter of the Iron Gang, Xu was still left with an emptiness in his heart, so he chose to rededicate himself to the Ten Rings and wear his Rings at all time. Xu also decided that he would have Shang-Chi trained to become a warrior for the Ten Rings, although he had also chosen to not have Xu Xialing trained, since Xu only wanted male warriors to fight in his armies.\n\nTo assist in Shang-Chi's training, Xu recruited Death Dealer, as he observed his son being trained to fight with the same foricity as the other Ten Rings warriors, training him with blades, as well as his own fists. Xu would also stand by and watch, as Shang-Chi was forced to punch a thick wooden bar repeatedly, with Death Dealer striking him with a stick if he began to relent due to the pain. Xu watched on, as Shang-Chi would punch the wooden bar for hours, leaving his knuckles bleeding.\n\nEventually, Xu approached Shang-Chi following hours of him punching the wooden bar and invited him to take a break. Retiring to his room, Xu cleaned the blood from his son's knuckles, promising that the pain would go away and he would eventually be stronger for it. As they were speaking, Xu noticed that Shang-Chi was looking at his Rings, as Xu noted that they had brought their family strength, and now Shang-Chi would have to prove himself to be strong enough to wear them himself.[2]\n\nIn 2008, the Ten Rings struck a deal with Obadiah Stane which involved purchasing the illegal Stark Industries weapons. The Ten Rings ambushed the United States Air Force convoy in Afghanistan and kidnapped Tony Stark, imprisoning him in their base, attempting to force him into making them weapons for them. However, Stark made a suit of armor and escaped. Stane later betrayed the Ten Rings and had Raza Hamidmi al-Wazar as well as multiple of his men killed.[6]\n\nXu targeted Stark and attempted to have him assassinated by using Ivan Vanko, sending his agent to arrange passage for Vanko to Monaco, although this failed.[13] Over the next year, the Ten Rings suffered numerous defeats at the hands of Iron Man, as Xu ordered his men to capture James Rhodes and his new armor. Although Rhodes managed to defeat the Ten Rings, to Xu's frustration, his men managed to obtain a valuable information needed to take Iron Man down.[14]\n\nIn 2013, Xu became aware that Aldrich Killian had orchestrated the series of apparent terrorist attacks against the United States of America in order to cover up his illegal experiments,[15] inventing the moniker of the \"Mandarin\" who he claimed to be the leader of the Ten Rings,[2] which was an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning \"advisor to the King\".[1] Xu was dismissive of the moniker, due to its association with mandarin oranges.[2] Trevor Slattery, who portrayed \"Mandarin\", completely twisted his image, which absolutely infuriated him.\n\nAfter Killian was defeated by Iron Man, Slattery was arrested and imprisoned in the Seagate Penitentiary, and Xu sent Jackson Norriss to break Slattery out of the prison and capture him. Disguised as a documentary filmmaker, Norriss successfully infiltrated the prison and abducted Slattery into Xu's custody.[1] Slattery was brought to Xu himself who was intended to kill him, however, in the last moments, he witnessed Slattery's actor performance and changed his mind. Xu instead decided to keep Slattery as his personal \"court jester\" and imprisoned him within the dungeons deep within his headquarters, forcing him to perform monologues for his various guests and soldiers.[2]\n\nOnce Shang-Chi was older, Xu observed him as his warriors were training his endurance, striking him with staffs, while Shang-Chi remained strong and barely reacted. Finally, Xu had a dozen of his Ten Rings warriors attack his son with blades, only for Shang-Chi to prove himself as the superior warrior, being able to disarm all of his opponents with relative ease, coming out as the victor in the fight, much to the considerable satisfaction of Xu, who had been observing the entire clash, alongside Death Dealer, with Xu confirming that Shang-Chi was ready to become a member of the Ten Rings.[2]\n\nIn 2014, following several years of searching, Xu finally discovered the location of the leader of the Iron Gang, and set about exacting his revenge against this man. Since Shang-Chi had turned fourteen and was excelling at his training, Xu decided that he would send him out to assassinate the Iron Gang's leader, and thereby he would have avenged Ying Li's death.\n\nXu then met with Shang-Chi as his helicopter arrived to take him on the mission, with Xu handing his son a knife and telling his son that it was his right to avenge Ying Li's death for them. Xu had also expected this to be Shang-Chi's oppurtunity to prove himself to be a worth soldier within the Ten Rings. However, despite completing his mission and killing the man, Shang-Chi had failed to return to the Ten Rings Headquarters, and chose to hide himself from Xu, and his future with the Ten Rings.[2]\n\nXu traveled to Romania for business purposes. During his visit, he found a child named Mattias living on the streets who had lost his right hand, but was able to juggle three balls with his one remaining arm. Xu soon took a liking to Mattias since he had reminded him of Shang-Chi, and decided to adopt him as his own son. Mattias soon became another of Xu's protégés, who quickly rose in the ranks to become one of the Ten Rings' top operatives.\n\nXu had a mechanized Razor Blade to be implanted over Mattias' missing hand, and from that point on, Mattias dubbed himself \"Razor Fist\" and used the razor blade arm as his signature weapon. Xu found the name Razor Fist amusing and approved it, despite it technically being incorrect. Due to their mutual respect for one another, Xu would be willing to defend Razor Fist from insults, while Razor Fist followed Xu's orders without question.[8]\n\nFollowing Shang-Chi's disappearance, Xu Xialing eventually chose to defect from the Ten Rings as well, having used the tunnels underneath the dungeons within the Ten Rings Headquarters to sneak away without being seen. Xu used his vast resources to easily track down his children, but respected their decision to leave the Ten Rings and instead kept a close eye on them in their self-imposed exile without interference.\n\nXu observed as Shang-Chi changed his name to Shaun and moved to California to attempt to make a new life for himself, where he would become friends with Katy Chen, although Xu would be disappointed to see his lack of ambition and only working as a valet. Meanwhile Xu would track Xialing to Macau, where she would open the Golden Daggers Club. However, Xu always remained confident that one day his children would return to the Ten Rings.[2]\n\nOver the next few years, Xu began hearing a voice inside his head, which was the voice of Ying Li, calling for Xu come rescue her. Believing the voice, Xu communicated with the voice and determined that Ying had not actually been killed by the Iron Gang, and was instead being held captive in Ta Lo. As a result, Xu had determined that he would go to war with Ta Lo and rescue Ying, determined to reunite his family.\n\nKnowing that the way into Ta Lo was almost impossible to navigate, Xu realized that the way to find the path would be to use the Eyes of the Dragon, which would show him the pathway into Ta Lo. However, Xu had realized that these eyes had been given to Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing before Ying's death. Xu ordered the Ten Rings to track down his children, tracking Shang-Chi down to California, as he sent Razor Fist and Gao Lei to find him and reclaim the Eye, with them completing their mission following a duel with Shang-Chi.[2]\n\nXu had then tracked Xu Xialing down to the Golden Daggers Club, as he and his soldiers led an attack on the club in order to obtain her part of the Eyes of the Dragon. While Razor Fist and Death Dealer led the attack, chasing down Xialing and battling Shang-Chi who had come to aid his sister, Xu stayed back, until he and his soldiers had successfully captured Xialing and Katy Chen, as he then found Shang-Chi battling Death Dealer.\n\nStepping into the fight to break it up, Xu used his rings to grab Shang-Chi's arm and throw him back, revealing that he had already captured Xialing and Chen. Xu then told Shang-Chi that he had already told the Ten Rings that they would not have been able to kill him if they tried, noting that he was glad that Shang-Chi had proved him right by surviving. Xu then told Shang-Chi that it was time for them to return home, as he and Shang-Chi rested their foreheads together and left the club.[2]\n\nReturning to his Helicopter, Xu took his family and hostages back to their Headquarters, as his army of Ten Rings soldiers stood by and bowed to Xu as he arrived, as Xu looked to Shang-Chi to see his reaction to their greeting. Xu then allowed his children to explore their former home again, with Shang-Chi looking at his old training post, as Xu Xialing took Katy Chen to view her former bedroom.[2]\n\nAs the day turned to evening, Xu took some time to look at his memorial to Ying Li, where he lit joss sticks for her. Xu was then rejoined by Shang-Chi, as he handed him some joss sticks and told him that his mother would be happy that he had come home. Xu then questioned if Shang-Chi had gotten the postcard with the Great Protector on it from him, noting that he sent it so that Shang-Chi would be forced to seek out his sister without any unnecessary violence.\n\nXu claimed that he hated being the bad guy in his son's eye, to which Shang-Chi questioned how he had been able to find him in California, to which Xu explained that he had always known where his children were. Xu went on to accuse Shang-Chi of bouncing from one family to the next, and meeting Chen in the United States of America, who he called Shang-Chi's girlfriend, while they worked at the Fairmont San Francisco parking cars for rich guests.\n\nXu had then told Shang-Chi that he had given him ten years to live his life, while questioning where these years had gotten him, before telling him that it was time for Shang-Chi to take his place by his side, as the leader of the Ten Rings. However, Shang-Chi still insisted that this was not going to happen. In response, Xu simply told Shang-Chi that he reminded him of Ying, before noting that he must be hungry, and inviting him to join them for dinner.[8]\n\nXu invited the group to join him for dinner, only to soon find tension between Shang-Chi and Razor Fist, who had continued staring at each other. Although Xu insisted that they needed to stand down, since they were all on the same side now, Shang-Chi denied this was true. In response, Xu told Shang-Chi about his reaction to him running away, claiming that he had barely eaten or slept as a result of losing his son.\n\nAs he continued with his story, Xu explained that, while he was on a business trip in Romania, he had encountered a young boy who reminded him of Shang-Chi, explaining that he had watched this boy standing on a box and juggling three balls with his one arm. Xu told Shang-Chi that he had adopted the boy as his own son, to which Razor Fist had also noted to Shang-Chi that his father gave him a home and a purpose with joining the Ten Rings.\n\nWhile Xu Xialing noted that her father also gave him a Razor Arm, he insisted that it was called a Razor Fist, which Xialing and Katy Chen insisted did not make sense, due to the name being an oxymoron. However, seeing that Razor Fist was getting confused and frustrated, Xu insisted that they stop, noting that he could call his blade whatever he wanted. Following this, Razor Fist left the family and Chen alone to eat and talk.[8]\n\nXu asked Chen what her true Chinese name was, expressing the importance of their names. Xu went on to tell the group his true name, noting that the only person who used to use that name was Ying Li. Continuing with this thought, Xu told them about how Aldrich Killian had invented a name for him, by recruiting Trevor Slattery to portray him and appropritate of his Ten Rings to use it as a cover for Killian's terrorist actions. As they listened, Xu explained that this plan had worked, and that the United States of America had become terrified of a fake terrorist, named after a mandarin chicken dish as well as a mandarin orange.[2]\n\nXu explained to his guests that Ying Li had been seemingly speaking with him, which Shang-Chi had refused to believe, leading to Xu promising to prove it to them. Xu brought them all into his office, as he explained that he had been working there when he heard the voice of his late wife, claiming that she was still alive and had actually been imprisoned within Ta Lo, as she begged for Xu to come and save her. However, Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing remained unconvinced, insisting that their mother was dead.\n\nDetermined to prove this to them, Xu took his family to a sculpture of the Great Protector, where he placed the Eyes of the Dragon, causing water to be shot out around them, only to freeze in time, much to the amazement of Shang-Chi. As they watched, the water then fell on the ground and created a map, which Xu explained was the secret pathway into Ta Lo. Xu told Shang-Chi and Xialing that he intended to follow this path and attack Ta Lo, with the intention of rescuing his wife from them.\n\nDespite him showing that he had the support of the Ten Rings behind him, as his warriors held up their Hooked-Swords in salute of Xu, Shang-Chi insisted that they could not attack Ta Lo, claiming that there was no way that their mother was alive, and Xu would be committing genocide for no reason. Enraged by this, Xu proceeded to use his rings to throw Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy Chen to the ground, ordering Razor Fist to take them into their prison cells while they prepared for war.[2]\n\nAs Xu had been watching the monitors of the Ten Rings Headquarters, he witnessed Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing managing to steal a Car from their garage and escaping from the compound, having managed to get out of their cell, taking Katy Chen and Trevor Slattery with them. As Xu watched his children escaping from him, he was rejoined by Razor Fist, as he instructed him to prepare for their mission, which Razor Fist had agreed to.\n\nXu then prepared for the upcoming battle by wearing his armor, before sitting in his office, studying his books on Ta Lo in order to ensure that he knew everything possible about the Ta Lo Armed Forces before he went into battle against them. As he read, Xu heard the voice of Ying Li in his head, calling out for him to rescue her, as he turned to see the vision of Ying and Xialing sitting together and smiling at him. The voice and vision further enforced Xu's determination to rescue his late wife from Ta Lo, as he remained convinced that this vision was real and she could be saved.\n\nXu was then snapped back to reality once Razor Fist had arrived outside his office, and informed him that the Ten Rings were now ready for the mission to attack Ta Lo, to which Xu confirmed that the pathway would be open by dawn, at which time they would begin the assault. Razor Fist then agreed to prepare their squad of Jeeps for the mission to attack, as he left Xu to continue studying all his books and preparing to battle the people of Ta Lo, and to rescue Ying from their custody.[2]\n\nUsing the guide given to him by the Eyes of the Dragon, Xu was able to lead his soldiers into Ta Lo, as they drove their Jeeps into the other dimension, until they eventually found their path was blocked by the villagers of Ta Lo. Once his soldiers had stepped out and stood their ground against the villagers, Wenwu stepped forward, finding that Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing had betrayed him and joined the villagers against him.\n\nXu attempted to convince his children that Ying Li was being held behind the Dark Gate and he was there to rescue her, although Shang-Chi had insisted that this was not true. Xu was also challenged by Ying Nan and Guang Bo, who insisted that they were not hiding his late wife, with Bo claiming that they had turned Xu away from Ta Lo years earlier, because the crimes of his past would have destroyed their land, which angered Xu, as he called Bo a young man and threatened him.\n\nDespite being told that he would not be honouring his wife's legacy if he proceeded with the attack, Xu still demanded to be allowed to pass, which Ying Li refused, as the Ta Lo Armed Forces readied their weapons, with Razor Fist preparing his soldiers to defend Xu, with Ten powering up his Ten Rings in readiness. Eventually, Xu was forced to accept that his children would not join him, as he turned to Razor Fist and ordered him to lead the Ten Rings in an attack against the villagers.\n\nXu then stood by and watched the Ten Rings firing their Electrified Crossbows at the villagers before engaging them in a battle with their Hooked-Swords. As chaos broke out across the village, Xu remained focused on the Dark Gate and calmly marched through the battle. Before he could reach the village's temple, Xu was stopped and challenged by Ying, who was wielding a Dragon Scale Staff, as she was determined not to allow him to open the gates, claiming that what was there would destroy them all.\n\nXu remained uninterested in this fight, as he only wished to find his wife, and before Ying could attack him, Death Dealer leapt in between them attacked Ying, throwing his daggers at her and forcing her to be distracted and allowing Xu to continue his march towards the Dark Gate. With the battle happening around him, Xu was spotted stepping into the village temple by Shang-Chi, who chased after him, with Xialing remaining focused on battling the Ten Rings army while Shang-Chi could deal with their father.\n\nStepping inside the village's temple, Xu bowed and prayed before the image of Ying, until he was found and confronted by Shang-Chi. Once again, Shang-Chi desperately attempted to convince his father that his mother was not behind the gates, which Xu refused to listen to. Xu then attempted to throw his son off balance by insulting him, only for Shang-Chi to insist that he was no longer afraid of him, which Xu denied.\n\nThe father and son then began fighting each other, with Xu unleashing his rings against Shang-Chi, who defended himself with his Dragon Scale Staff. Xu insulted his son saying that he spent his entire life afraid - always running and always hiding. However, eventually Xu managed to launch himself into the air and land a kick to Shang-Chi's head, knocking him to the floor, while also insulting his son by reminding him of how he had hidden in fear when the Iron Gang had come to their home and murdered Ying, as Shang-Chi watched.\n\nHowever, rather than this stopping Shang-Chi, this resulted in him becoming enraged as Shang-Chi attacked him father, forcing the fight to leave the temple. Once they made distance between one another, Xu began firing his rings at Shang-Chi, who was able to block the attacks with his staff before continuing to fight his father. As Shang-Chi and Xu continued to fight, Shang-Chi pointed out that he and Xialing need Xu to be the comforting parent after Ying's death, but instead chose revenge over his family, and even if he managed to get his mother back, why would she take him back. In fury, Xu immediately ended the battle by striking Shang-Chi with the full force of the rings, launching him into the lake with incredible force.[2]\n\nWith nobody standing in his way, Xu launched himself through the air with the power of his rings, and landed before the Dark Gate. As Xu stepped to the gates and touched the Dragon Scale, he heard the voice of Ying Li in his head once again, calling to him to rescue her. In response, Xu then powered up his rings and proceeded to punch the Dark Gate with all of his strength, causing shockwaves to begin shifting the scales.\n\nAs Xu continued to punch the gates, he transferred all ten rings onto one arm, so he could punch with more strength, but failed to noticed that the shifting of the scales was causing Soul Eaters to be freed from the gates, which then flew back to the village. Eventually, while Xu continued punching the gate, the Great Protector flew out of the lake to protect the villagers from the Soul Eaters that Xu had inadvertently unleashed upon them.\n\nWith the Great Protector battling the Soul Eaters, Xu was then knocked off his feet by the return of Shang-Chi, who kicked his father away from the gate and stood against him. Once again, Shang-Chi insisted that Ying was not back there, although Xu protested that he had to save her, blind to the creatures that he was unleashing. To stop his father, Shang-Chi then demonstrated the fighting style of Ta Lo, as Xu prepared for the fight.\n\nThe father and son had then continued their previous battle, with Shang-Chi now using the same fighting style as his mother, which Ying Nan had taught him, to get the upper hand over Xu. Despite his son doing better in this clash, Xu was still able to use the power of the rings against him, only for Shang-Chi to eventually manage to use his control of the air to catch five of the rings in mid-air, giving him control over them.\n\nXu and Shang-Chi then battled for control over the rings, eventually finding themselves locked in a pull of power between the rings, with each using five of the rings to attempt to pull them away from the other. Determined to end the battle, Xu then proceeded to launch his remaining five rings at Shang-Chi with all of his power, causing a large explosion, while Xu fell to the ground hard, believing that he had defeated Shang-Chi.\n\nHowever, to Xu's amazement, Shang-Chi stepped forward with the power of all ten rings under his control. Xu then stood by helplessly, as Shang-Chi used the same power of his mother to increase the power of the rings, preparing to fire a deadly blast of energy at Xu, which would undoubtedly kill him. Despite having the opportunity to kill his father however, Shang-Chi instead dropped the rings at his feet, demonstrating his power.\n\nAs they stood against each other, Xu insisted that he had to save Ying, only for Shang-Chi to once again insist that, while he wished it was true, his mother was not back there. However, before they could continue to attempt to find a peaceful resolution, they witnessed the Dark Gate being destroyed, as the Dweller-in-Darkness burst through, having gained enough power. Xu could only look on in horror, as he realized that he had been deceived.\n\nWith the Dweller free, it turned to attack Xu and Shang-Chi, only for Xu to reclaim the rings and use their power to throw them both out of the way. However, this caused Xu to briefly turn his back to the Dweller, who snatched him from the ground with its tentacles and began sucking the lifeforce from his body. Knowing he could not be saved, Xu looked down at his son, reminiscing on times he spent with Shang-Chi, from his adulthood to when he was only an infant, and bequeathed the ten rings to him before the Dweller consumed his soul and killed him.[2]\n\nUpon obtaining the rings following Xu's death, Shang-Chi was able to kill the Dweller-in-Darkness, avenging Xu's death. The following night Xu's death was honored alongside Ying Li, and all the others who lost their lives during the battle, with both Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing having come to terms with their father and forgiven him despite all he did. Shang-Chi kept the rings for himself but opted to use them more responsibly, while Xialing claimed she would finish dismantling the Ten Rings.[2] Instead, Xialing took over Xu's position as the new leader of the Ten Rings intending to continue her father's work, but she also decided to implement major reforms to the organization.[2]\n\nA ruthless and calculating warlord, Xu led the Ten Rings with an iron fist, threatening his subordinates with death if they did not accomplish his orders, like when one of his agents failed in obtaining the War Machine Armor. His mystical rings gave him an insatiable hunger for power for centuries, aiming to be the Khan of the entire world. Nevertheless, Xu is not extremely cruel with his men: when his agent told him that he had got valuable information surrounding War Machine's battle suit, Xu simply spared him, demonstrating that he accepts any kind of useful progress on his plans. He also had great respect for the family, in a quest for power he met a woman named Ying Li, whom he married and had two children Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing which led him to leave his cloak and focus on family life, but all that changed when a criminal organization called Iron Gang murdered his wife returned to his cloak to avenge her and take up the cause he thought he had left behind, training their children for their succession.\n\nHaving his style of leadership, Xu has demonstrated that he does not like to be imitated, being willing to punish those who had dared to impersonate him for their purposes. When the Mandarin fiasco engineered by Aldrich Killian incriminated the Ten Rings from Extremis-caused explosions and had Trevor Slattery posing as the leader of the Ten Rings, Xu resented them enough even after Killian died to the point of sending one of his most loyal agents to the Seagate Penitentiary to abduct Slattery.\n\nXu showed somewhat of a dry sense of humor when joking about how the fake name Killian came up with to impersonate him was ridiculous and found it funny that USA was intimidated \"by a mandarin chicken dish\" as well as \"a mandarin orange\", similarly he decided to spare Trevor Slattery from execution after being amused by his acting performances, instead deciding to keep Trevor as a prisoner and make him a jester for his court on an occasional basis. Despite this, he did not seem offended when one of his subordinates called him by the same nickname that Killian had given him when he informed him of the results of the Battle of Hong Kong.\n\nXu was not a very talkative person; when in battle he opted to stay quiet and remain focused in combat avoiding any distractions. When threatening his enemies Xu tends to remain calm and speak in a polite voice, despite this he still very intimidating needing only a few words and angry stares to make others cower. He tended to suppress his emotions and keep a level headed attitude, though when taunted enough he can act more impulsive such as when he Shang-Chi claimed that Ying wouldn't accept him back even if she came back to life, Xu on a rare moment of anger punched Shang-Chi with the full force of the rings tossing him into a lake when previously he was only attempting to knock his son down.\n\nDespite all, Xu greatly loved and cared for Ying, his late wife, and was willing to put side his organization away as living a normal life with her while raising a family. After meeting Ying in the bamboo forests, the two of them fell in love quickly, and even was willing to give up the Ten Rings so that he could live a normal life with her. Ying was the best of him and the only woman he ever loved enough to become a better man and loving father. Sadly, her death caused him to take his position again and take vengeance on her murder. As a result, he became cold and distant towards his children, forcing Shang-Chi into a hellish training to become a dangerous martial artist while manipulating him, while also neglecting Xialing and not allowing her to train alongside her brother. He cruelly trained his son to be a killer, pressuring him into becoming an assassin, and selfishly ignored his daughter due to being unable to look at her as she reminded him so much of his late wife. After Ying’s death, out of a twisted sense of love towards his child, Xu believed that by training Shang-Chi to become a deadly killer, he could keep Shang-Chi safe and can make Shang-Chi able to protect himself from enemies, an act that Ying couldn’t. Xu’s distorted sense of love towards his children made him become cold and uncaring, and took the Ten Rings again, without noticing that what Shang-Chi and Xialing really needed was their father’s true care and love. His love to Shang-Chi was also demonstrated when the Dweller-in-Darkness was freed from captivity and attempted to attack Shang-Chi, Xu finally came to his senses and used the Rings to send him and Shang-Chi to safety, but this act of love eventually cost Xu his life.\n\nXu even displayed a spiteful side to him, in that he called out Shang-Chi for doing nothing and just watching his mother die through a window. disregarding that Shang-Chi was only a child at the time and could have done nothing to prevent his mother's death, and was angered in how Shang-Chi turned the argument around on Xu, for how he was not there when they needed him, how it was his crimes that his wife was made to pay for with her life, and that ultimately he chose the Rings over his family. In the end though, during the final moments of his life, Xu's thoughts were filled with times he spent with his son, proving that his love for him ran true and deep, and his final act was to pass on the Rings to his son to give him what he needed to defeat the Dweller-in-Darkness.\n\nThe lore of the Mandarin in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has dealt with several retcons throughout the years. While early versions of Iron Man 3 featured the real Mandarin, the movie ultimately revealed the \"Mandarin\" was an impostor, which led to the creation of the character Trevor Slattery, as writer Drew Pearce suggested during one of the writing sessions. Director Shane Black further supported this decisions arguing that \"Who would be fool enough to declare that they're an international terrorist? If you're smart, whatever regime you're part of, you'd put a puppet committee and remain in your house\".[19] Kevin Feige commented that due to the Mandarin's story in the comics, which relies on a lot of stereotypes, they wanted to reinterpretate the character in his MCU debut, and they decided to depict the Mandarin as a \"symbol and fear-monger, which is what he was in the comics. This is a very modern, if not post-modern, interpretation of that.\" This was depicted in the film by Aldrich Killian, as it was revealed Killian himself was the Mandarin, the puppeteer behind Slaterry's \"Mandarin\".[20] However, the idea of the \"real Mandarin\" existed in previous films of the Iron Man franchise, and thus the short film All Hail the King was made.[21]\n\nAccording to Drew Pearce, the idea of the one-shot was an excuse to bring Slattery back and tease him for future appearances and not an attempt to apologize to the fan-base.[22] The short depicted that the real Mandarin was angered that Trevor Slattery and Aldrich Killian had used his moniker and ordered a Ten Rings member Jackson Norriss to capture Slattery. Following the release of the short, Feige added that the idea was that \"Killian was perverting the notion of things he's heard\" to make his own version during his campaign.[23] The short also explained the Mandarin had been a title commonly associated to the Ten Rings mythos for ages, however, this was retconned in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.\n\nWriter David Callaham stated that Xu Wenwu did not use the title of \"The Mandarin\" himself: \"Our version of the character is not The Mandarin in the way that people are expecting him to be. \"The Mandarin\" is a title that has been applied to him in the past by people that don't understand his culture.\" Director Destin Daniel Cretton followed on from this by stating: \"It was for me the part of the Shang-Chi comics that I personally really connected to. It was really important for us to find the root of that anger and that pain. That was the goal from the get-go, and probably the number one fear of all of us was creating a Mandarin that was further contributing to the \"Yellow Peril\" type of stereotypes that are still flying around.\"[24] In spite of this, in the film, Wenwu claims that Aldrich Killian had invented the name by the events of Iron Man 3 and implied that he had never been called the \"Mandarin\" in the past. This contradicted an issue of Iron Man 3 Prelude, which featured the character being addressed by a Ten Ring Member as such and All Hail the King, where Jackson Norriss referred to Xu as \"Mandarin\". The mythos of the Ten Rings were retconned as well for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings changing from a Mongolian red flag to a Chinese black flag without any explanation in-universe.[25]",
