  "content": "Obadiah Stane was the business partner of Tony Stark and a good friend of his father, Howard Stark. Upon Howard's death, Stane became interim CEO of Stark Industries until Tony officially took over shortly after. Stane's jealousy of the younger Stark led to him betraying Stark by joining forces with the Ten Rings to organize a failed attempt to assassinate him, so Stane could become CEO once again. He further armed the Ten Rings with Stark Industries weapons, to facilitate their campaign in the war-torn Gulmira. He eventually betrayed and had the Ten Rings executed due to their failure to kill Stark. When his involvement with terrorists was exposed by Pepper Potts, Stane created an armor and adopted the name Iron Monger and attempted to kill Stark himself, leading to his own death.\n\nObadiah Stane was a businessman who worked in partnership with Howard Stark in Stark Industries for many years. Together, they were responsible for supplying many weapons to the U.S. military.[1] Stane also worked alongside Stark and Anton Vanko in the development of the first Arc Reactor, but the massive prototype seemed impossible to develop further.[5]\n\nIn 1967, Vanko was found guilty of espionage. After Howard deported him with a heavy heart, Stane comforted his friend, stating that it was sad but necessary. He told him to take it as a sign that maybe the Arc Reactor was not ready to be published into the world. He decided that they should continue just making weapons instead, promising to stand by his side.[6] In the late 1980s, Stane had a son he named Ezekiel. Stane often talked about his affinity for technology around his son, resulting in his passion being passed down to Ezekiel.[2]\n\nOn December 16, 1991, Howard and his wife Maria were ultimately killed in a car accident. As quoted by a newspaper, Stane expressed his condolences to the Stark family and lamented Howard's loss, stating that such news filled them with grief.[7] Due to Howard's death, Stane took over the company as interim CEO. His brief tenure made him highly egotistical, though, as Stane took great pride in his work and the respect it gained him.\n\nShortly after, Stane was forced to step down from his position to become Stark Industries' second-in-command when Tony Stark officially took over as CEO.[1] Stane remained with the company and became a mentor to Stark, helping him with the day-to-day operations.[8] On July 18, 2006, the oldest university bell tower in the United States of America was rededicated to Stane and renamed as Stane Tower.[9]\n\nAfter nearly two decades as second-in-command, Stane grew tired and jealous of the younger Stark, and decided to turn against him. He began by cooperating with the Ten Rings, among other groups, illegally selling Stark weapons to them behind Stark's back. Eventually, Stane felt it was time to eliminate Stark for good, so he betrayed him by contacting the group to kill Stark during the Jericho presentation in Afghanistan. However, he kept the identity of their target a secret.[1]\n\nDespite his grudge against Tony Stark, Stane presented himself as a close and loyal friend to him. In February 2008, when Stark failed to show up in Las Vegas to accept his award in Caesars Palace, Stane took his place, collecting the award from James Rhodes and giving an affectionate tribute to him. He claimed that the reason Stark was not there was because he was working, despite being fully aware that Stark was most likely gambling in a casino. The next day, Stark flew to Afghanistan to debut Stark Industries' new Jericho missile to the United States Air Force.\n\nStane called Stark to see how the presentation went; soon after they spoke, the Ten Rings attacked and failed to kill Stark, and they instead kidnapped him. Realizing who their target was, Raza Hamidmi al-Wazar felt that they had not been paid enough, and decided that Stane would have to pay greater for them to finish the job. The Ten Rings kept Stark alive to use to their own advantage by having him build them the Jericho. Instead, Stark used his time to build a weaponized armor suit and escaped by fighting back against his captors, being quickly found by the military.[1]\n\nWith Tony Stark having been rescued and returned to the United States of America, Stane met with him and Pepper Potts outside of Stark Industries Headquarters, where he had organized a press event for Stark to discuss his experiences. Stane greeted Stark, keeping silent about his involvement in the incident and noting how Stark had Happy Hogan get him a burger before arriving.\n\nStill clearly traumatized by what he had witnessed, Stark began by asking everybody to sit on the floor with him before noting how he had never had the chance to say a final goodbye to Howard Stark before his death. As Stane listened, Stark explained how he wished he had gotten the chance to ask his father how he truly felt about what his company did, noting how his kidnapping had opened his eyes to his own legacy of creating nothing but weapons.\n\nWhile Stane listened closely, Stark informed the attendees that due to seeing young soldiers in the United States Armed Forces being killed by the Ten Rings using his own weapons which he had made to protect the soldiers, he had decided to immediately shut down Stark Industries' weapons manufacturing division. Stane jumped in and moved Stark away from the podium and attempted to convince the audience that there was nothing to be concerned about, noting that they should be glad that Stark was back before attempting to move on and create his own narrative.[1]\n\nStane went to meet with Tony Stark inside Stark Industries Headquarters; arriving on a segway, Stane found Happy Hogan outside, who pointed him in the direction of Stark, who was studying the prototype large-scale Arc Reactor. They discussed how Stane was now forced to participate in meetings with Stark Industries' investors to negotiate how their company would continue without its main weapons division, with Stane arguing that making weapons was just what they did.\n\nDespite Stane arguing that their work kept the world from falling into chaos, he continued his efforts to try and convince Stark to change his mind on the matter, but Stark remained convinced of his decision. When Stark suggested that they focus on Arc Reactor technology, Stane claimed that they had created it as a publicity stunt, although Stark insisted that it did work. Having made it clear that James Rhodes had updated him on the technology he had used to escape, Stane insisted upon inspecting Stark's miniaturized Arc Reactor in his chest. As Stark showed Stane the technology, proving it did work, Stane agreed to help Stark in his plans, suggesting that they work together from this point onwards.\n\nDuring one of the meetings with their investors based in New York City, Stane recommended to the board of directors that Stark be removed from his position within the company. He met with Stark and Pepper Potts at Tony Stark's Mansion, where he gave out pizza and played the piano while he waited for Stark to join them. When he finally arrived, Stane told Stark that it was the board's decision to push him out, claiming that he was undergoing post-traumatic stress disorder, which Stark refused to accept as the consequence of his being responsible.\n\nIn an attempt to learn more about Stark's newest technology, Stane once again attempted to gain access to either his Arc Reactor or whatever new designs he was working on in his basement, claiming that he needed some new technology that he could then pitch to their investors to reassure them. Unfortunately, Stark still continued to refuse him. Annoyed, Stane refused to let Stark take the pizza box downstairs with him, although he let Stark take a couple of slices.[1]\n\nStane arranged a party for Stark Industries at the Walt Disney Concert Hall but did not invite Tony Stark himself. While Stane was giving interviews to the press, where he tried to assure them that weapons manufacturing was only a small part of their company's work, Stark arrived anyway. Greeting Stark, Stane recommended that he take this slow so that he did not upset the board of directors, which Stark promised he would, though Stane was unconvinced.\n\nHaving spoken with Christine Everhart, Stark furiously confronted Stane about whether or not Stane had been secretly selling their own weapons to the Ten Rings, who had just recently attacked an Afghan village called Gulmira with Stark's weapons, including the Jericho. Seeing no other alternative, Stane revealed to Stark that he was the one who had cut him from the company, claiming it was the only way he could protect him before Stane walked away from the party.\n\nStane soon found out what Stark had been working on when he watched a KNKV News report where James Rhodes explained that there had been an incident in Gulmira where several Ten Rings operatives had been killed and a fighter jet had been damaged. Stane knew immediately that this was the result of Stark building a new and improved Iron Man Armor based on the original design he had used to escape his captors while trapped in Afghanistan.[1]\n\nDue to the Ten Rings finding all the remnants of the prototype armor which Tony Stark had used to escape, they decided to make a new deal with Stane to hand over the prototype to him in exchange for creating an army of similarly armored soldiers for the group to use. Upon arriving at their new base, Stane met with Raza Hamidmi al-Wazar, commenting on his facial scars caused by Stark's escape.\n\nStane told al-Wazar that if they had killed him like he was supposed to rather than kidnapping Stark, he would not have his scars. Asking Stane to leave his bodyguards outside, Raza invited Stane inside to examine the armor and designs they had collected. Raza explained his desire to work with Stane and gain an army of iron soldiers so the Ten Rings could take over all of Asia, noting that he viewed the suit as the pinnacle of weapons technology.\n\nUltimately, Stane betrayed the Ten Rings, using a Sonic Taser to paralyze al-Wazar and mocked his efforts to try and intimidate Stane. While he apologized to al-Wazar for the unpleasant feeling the Taser was giving him, he promised that it would only last fifteen minutes, although he made it clear that it would be the least of his problems. Stane then had his guards execute al-Wazar and the rest of the Ten Rings members so he could use the Iron Man armor for himself, as he simply had no further use for them.\n\nWith al-Wazar and his subordinates now dead, Stane took the armor for himself. On his way back to the United States of America, Stane contacted his allies at Stark Industries and ordered them to set up a workshop in Sector 16 underneath the Arc Reactor and arrange their top scientists, including William Ginter Riva to begin attempting to recreate the technology, demanding that they complete a working prototype of the Iron Monger as quickly as possible, in addition to masking all the data.[1]\n\nWhile working to develop his own armored suit, Stane learned that despite having his best scientists working with all of the best resources that Stark Industries could provide them with, they were still unable to find some way to could recreate the miniaturized Arc Reactor technology that Tony Stark used to power his first armor. However, they were able to continue work on the armor, building an enlarged version of the original, just without any way to power it. Stane then talked to his scientists about how he needed the armor because the weapon in the wrong hands could mean the end of the world.[11]\n\nStane later went to Tony's office and discovered that Pepper Potts was using his computer. Unsure if she had indeed discovered his designs for his armor, Stane engaged in a casual conversation with her about the whiskey that Stark kept in the office, commenting that Stark always got the best quality whiskey before claiming that he understood what Potts had been going through in an attempt to relax her and not scare her.\n\nHaving had a brief glance at the computer, Stane saw that there was nothing noteworthy on the screen and briefly relaxed, hoping that he would not have to kill Potts. They then moved on and discussed Stark's return from Afghanistan and how much he had changed, with Stane claiming that he had been incredibly happy when Stark had returned from his kidnapping. He noted that the man who had left never came home, as Stark had clearly left part of himself behind in the cave with the Ten Rings. Potts, however, claimed Stark was a complicated man and that he would be alright in the end, leading Stane to claime that Potts was a very rare and special kind of woman.\n\nWhen Potts left, Stane took her newspaper from her, saying that he wanted to do the puzzles. After Potts left, he checked the computer himself, and discovered that Potts had indeed found out about all his plans by hacking into it and downloading all his files, including his designs for the Iron Monger armor and the videos Raza Hamidmi al-Wazar had sent him. He watched as Potts left the building along with Phil Coulson, intending to tell S.H.I.E.L.D. everything about Stane.\n\nStane then went to check on the scientists building the Iron Monger armor and demanded an update, being told that the technology to shrink the Arc Reactor simply did not exist. This threw Stane into a rage and he screamed at his workers, demanding that they do the work that Stark was able to do in a cave with nothing but a box of scraps; however, William Ginter Riva simply explained that he did not have the same skills as Stark.\n\nKnowing he would soon be arrested, he used a Sonic Taser to paralyze Stark and ripped Stark's reactor from his chest, intending to use it to power his new suit. Stane exposed his own betrayal by revealing to Stark that he indeed ordered the hit on him and he planned to kill Potts as well, claiming her death would be Stark's fault as he got her involved in the first place. Stane then left Stark to die from a heart attack and went to complete his work on his new armor.[1]\n\nBelieving that Tony Stark would soon be dead due to having a heart attack, Stane returned to Stark Industries Headquarters. While Stane installed the Arc Reactor into his completed Iron Monger Armor, he was interrupted when he overheard Pepper Potts and a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrive at the building to arrest Stane for all of his crimes, which Potts had uncovered, including working with the Ten Rings and organizing Tony Stark's kidnapping. Stane, however, focused on completing his work on his Armor so he was ready to face all of the agents.\n\nHearing them blow up the door with a Pick-Lock Device, Stane then powered up the Iron Monger and donned the armor, ready for his final stand. While Phil Coulson and the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents searched the workshop and eventually found the Mark I Iron Man Armor, Stane's hiding place was soon discovered by Potts. When he was discovered, Iron Monger attacked and killed three of the agents before furiously chasing after Potts, who barely escaped from him in time.\n\nDetermined to stop Potts from revealing his deals with the Ten Rings, Iron Monger then punched his way through the roof of the facility and found Potts attempting to call on Stark for help. As Potts looked on in horror and became cornered, Iron Monger loaded his gun and then aimed it at her, telling her that her services were no longer required. Just as Iron Monger was about to kill Pepper with his advanced weapons, he discovered that Stark was still alive and had come to save her in the new Mark III armor. Just before Iron Monger could shoot him out of the sky, Iron Man flew down and crashed straight into his former friend.\n\nIron Man threw Iron Monger into the nearby motorway and they then engaged in a brutal fight to the death. Seeking to take advantage of Iron Man's desire to help others, Iron Monger cruelly picked up an Audi Q7 filled with innocent people, intending to throw it at him. As the woman and her children inside the car screamed in terror, Iron Man fired a beam of energy directly from his own Arc Reactor at Iron Monger, knocking him away before Iron Man caught the car and placed it safely back on the ground, despite the screaming family driving into him in their attempt to escape the battle quickly.\n\nWhile Iron Man was distracted by saving all the people, Iron Monger grabbed a passing motorbike, causing the rider to crash, and used the bike to strike Iron Man before he threw him inside a nearby bus. Iron Monger began ranting about how he had spent years building up Stark Industries ever Howard Stark's death and he refused to let Stark stop him now. Iron Monger then fired at the bus with his lase-guided rocket, causing a massive explosion with Iron Man inside.\n\nHowever, Iron Man survived the blast and hovered in the air. While Iron Monger complimented Iron Man on all the upgrades, he proceeded to show off his own suit's new advanced capabilities by demonstrating its flying abilities. As Iron Man tried to fly away, Iron Monger gave chase, flying higher and higher into the sky over Los Angeles while Iron Man instructed J.A.R.V.I.S. to help him get even higher with Iron Monger getting ever closer behind him.\n\nEventually, the Iron Monger caught up with Iron Man and then Iron Monger used all of his suit's strength to crush the armor, mocking Stark as he did. However, when Stark mentioned if Stane had fixed the suit's icing problems, which he had previously discovered while testing the Mark II. To his horror, Iron Monger suddenly realized that the extreme altitude had rendered the suit frozen, causing it to malfunction and fall from the sky to the city thousands of feet below.[1]\n\nSurviving the fall, Iron Monger found Iron Man attempting to remove his Mark III armor as its power began running low. Iron Monger then attacked Iron Man, who was unable to defend himself as he had already taken off one of his gauntlets, allowing Iron Monger to strike him hard and send him flying back. Iron Monger proceeded to grab Iron Man and used the Iron Monger Armor's incredible strength to crush Iron Man, who used his flares to briefly blind Stane inside the suit while Iron Man just managed to get away.\n\nIron Monger then searched across the rooftop of the Stark Industries Headquarters to find his target, until Iron Man then surprised him and jumped on his back, attacking Iron Monger and managing to damage his optical and targeting systems by ripping out all the wires. Iron Monger furiously ripped Iron Man off his back, taking off his mask at the same time as the badly injured Tony Stark attempted to get to his feet, despite being too exhausted to continue the fight.\n\nIron Monger was still able to trap Stark on a glass roof and shoot the glass from beneath him. Removing his own protective helmet, Stane crushed Iron Man's helmet and began mocking Stark by telling him that he had finally made his father proud while also noting that his attempts to end Stark Industries' weapons manufacturing had resulted in him creating the best weapon ever, promising that he would now use that very weapon to finally kill Stark.\n\nIron Monger then began firing rockets at his enemy with poor aim due to the damage the suit had obtained, with Stark trapped as he held onto the platform for dear life. In a desperate attempt to kill Stane, Stark then ordered Pepper Potts to overload the prototype large-scale Arc Reactor located at the complex underneath them. As a result, the reactor's blast electrocuted Stane to death. His body then proceeded to fall into the reactor, resulting in a massive explosion.[1]\n\nIn the wake of the highly public Duel of Los Angeles and Stane's subsequent death, Phil Coulson came up with a cover story; Stane's disappearance was explained by claiming that he was currently on vacation using a small private aircraft, one whose poor safety record would go on to publicly explain his death.[1] This story was picked up by news outlets like the Chicago Spectator, leading many in the public to believe Stane died in a plane crash.[2] S.H.I.E.L.D.'s cover-up led to him being fondly remembered by the public as an inventor, philanthropist, and mentor to Tony Stark. Others believed that Stane was still alive, with multiple supposed sightings of him being reported.[12]\n\nFollowing his death, Stane was cremated. Upon learning the true nature of his father's death, his son Ezekiel legally changed his name to Joe McGillicuddy to try and distance himself from his father. Despite this, Ezekiel held on to his father's ashes, albeit by keeping them in a plastic bag.[2]\n\nStane was a good friend to Howard Stark, whom he helped build Stark Industries from the ground up, and the death of his friend left him devastated. However, his brief tenure as CEO following Howard's death made him power hungry and arrogant. Being forced to relinquish his position as CEO to Howard's son Tony hurt his ego and left him resentful for many years before eventually deciding to turn against him. While eventually deciding to turn against Tony, he portrayed himself as a loyal friend and business partner of Tony. Craving power made him a cold-hearted sociopath who had no regards for the wishes or feelings of others, and he did not even care about the destruction caused by the weapons that Stark Industries created. His desire to become CEO again caused him to betray Tony by placing a hit on the young Stark by using the terrorist organization known as the Ten Rings.\n\nMore than once, Stane proudly called himself a weapons manufacturer and an \"iron monger,\" which showed that the only value he was concerned about was the one that would result in profit. He used this to convince the board of Stark Industries to remove Stark from power after he effectively shut down the weapons division of Stark Industries, which culminated in a highly significant drop in the stock market. While utilizing the Iron Monger Armor, Stane quickly went on a rampage and attempted to destroy everything in his path during his fight against Iron Man. Throughout their fight, he constantly stated how much he was enjoying the suit's power, causing havoc and recklessly ignoring human life or casualties, claiming that it was only \"collateral damage.\" He was also willing to kill Pepper to cover his tracks.\n\nIn addition to his greedy and ruthless nature, Stane was also rather reckless and arrogant. While he did manage to improve on the first Iron Man suit, he never learned to properly train himself on how to use it before fighting Tony. This was best shown when he was unaware of the icing problem that Tony managed to counteract, which led him to fall from the sky.",
