  "content": "Brock Rumlow was a Hydra infiltrator who had been posing as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and STRIKE's team field commander. Due to his training from S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra, Rumlow had become a world-class combatant, with extensive experience in street fighting, martial arts, and military combat techniques. Following the Battle of New York, Rumlow's STRIKE team had been ordered to return the Scepter to Hydra. Following this, Rumlow followed Captain America on several missions, until the Hydra Uprising was revealed and Rumlow was ordered to lead their team and assassinate Captain America under the orders of Alexander Pierce. Eventually, all Hydra's schemes were defeated and, during the Battle at the Triskelion, Rumlow had almost been crushed to death by a Helicarrier while fighting against Sam Wilson, suffering several horrific facial scars in the process.\n\nOnce he recovered, Rumlow abandoned Hydra, instead becoming an independent terrorist and assuming a new moniker of Crossbones, setting out onto his path to make anyone involved in his downfall suffer the pain and loss he endured. During a mission within Nigeria, Crossbones had lured the Avengers into a public battle, under the guise that he was attempting to steal a biological weapon. During all of the chaos, Crossbones fought against Captain America, but was quickly defeated. In a last-ditch effort, Crossbones detonated his suicide vest, but Wanda Maximoff mistakenly diverted him into a building just as he exploded, killing him as well as several Wakandan relief workers.\n\nBeing an operative for Hydra, Brock Rumlow was tasked to infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D. to strike from the inside at the right time. Rumlow became an agent and rose through the ranks until he was tasked to command the STRIKE unit, which put him in command of a team that had included Jack Rollins, allowing him to ensure that only Hydra agents were part of that unit. Following Alexander Pierce and Jasper Sitwell's direct orders, Rumlow ensured that Hydra's infiltration within S.H.I.E.L.D. went completely unnoticed, which had then allowed them to move forward with all their plans of world domination.[4]\n\nIn 2012, in the aftermath of the Battle of New York, Rumlow was sent to Stark Tower once the Chitauri had been wiped out and Loki apprehended by the Avengers, putting an end to the conflict. He and his men, accompanied by Jasper Sitwell, were given the God of Mischief's Scepter by Black Widow so they could take it back to S.H.I.E.L.D. Black Widow and Hawkeye warned them about the dangers of the Scepter's mind control abilities, to which Rumlow promised that they would be careful.\n\nHowever, Rumlow had been secretly ordered by Alexander Pierce to have the Scepter delivered to List for Hydra. As they rode down the elevator to the first floor, Sitwell had reported to Pierce that they were on their way to List.[5] Following the theft of the Scepter, Rumlow continued working with STRIKE, under Captain America's leadership. Rumlow went on a mission to stop Baker from stealing a Zodiac weapon, and while he had saved Captain America's life during the mission, Baker escaped.[6]\n\nRumlow's STRIKE team, who were led by Captain America and Black Widow, were sent on a mission to recapture the Lemurian Star, a ship which had been hijacked by a group of pirates led by Georges Batroc. As Rumlow spoke about the number of pirates to expect, Captain America made his frustrations at it being a ship controlled by Nick Fury clear, as he felt Fury should get much of the blame.\n\nOnce Rumlow had briefed the team on all the details of their operation, Captain America gave his orders and left the Quinjet first, leaping out into the ocean in order to silently clear the top deck on his own before the rest of the team arrived. When Jack Rollins looked on in surprise at this move, he questioned if Captain America had jumped out without his parachute, which Rumlow confirmed that he had as he then attached his own parachute, impressed by the incredible jump.\n\nRumlow and STRIKE joined Captain America moments later, finding that he had managed to take out the vast majority of the onboard pirates that had been stationed there by Batroc on the ship without raising the alarm in a matter of mere minutes, using nothing but his Shield and S.H.I.E.L.D. fighting skills to take them out. Once Rumlow came down to the ship, he found a pirate had managed to get the drop on Captain America and held him at gunpoint.\n\nSilently dropping onto the ship with his parachute, Rumlow had been unseen by the pirate as he proceeded to kill him with a silenced shot straight into the back of the head while joking that Captain America was clearly helpless without him. Once Captain America had thanked him for saving his life, Rumlow rejoined the rest of their STRIKE team and went to continue his mission, as they got into position, ready to go and to rescue the hostages from the rest of Batroc's pirates.\n\nWith the pathway clear, Rumlow and Rollins made their way through the ship, taking position outside the kitchen where the hostages were held, using a Taser Rod to silently knock out on the pirate who was guarding the door, as Rumlow ensured they did not make any noise. Once Captain America and Black Widow were in position and ready, Rumlow and his team killed Batroc's men and rescued the hostages, including Jasper Sitwell, who had also been among them.\n\nWhile Rumlow and STRIKE made their escape from the ship with the hostages close behind him, he informed Captain America that Black Widow failed to meet them as he continued the drop-off. Meanwhile, Captain America personally battled Batroc who eventually gotten away after Captain America became momentarily distracted upon finding Black Widow hacking into the ship's computer system and stealing the secret intel as per Nick Fury's direct orders.[4]\n\nSince Nick Fury had been coming close to uncovering some key information about Project Insight and all of Hydra's secrets, it was then decided by Alexander Pierce that the Winter Soldier would be sent out to assassinate him before Rumlow and all the other undercover agents were exposed. Following this, Rumlow went to the hospital where Fury was being treated, seemingly dying on the operating table and ensuring that Hydra's secrets were undiscovered.\n\nWhile standing guard in the hospital with his STRIKE team, Rumlow had then received a call from the Triskelion and had been ordered to ensure that Steve Rogers returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to debrief with Pierce about everything that he had witnessed. While Rogers had initially delayed since he and Natasha Romanoff were speaking, Rumlow insisted that they had to leave immediately. Rumlow and the STRIKE team then accompanied Rogers back to the Triskelion.[4]\n\nSince Steve Rogers' meeting with Alexander Pierce had resulted with Rogers being declared an enemy of S.H.I.E.L.D. as he had withheld key information about Nick Fury's death, Rumlow had been ordered to bring him into custody. Rumlow and the STRIKE team then coordinated a plan to capture Rogers inside an elevator as he attempted to leave the Triskelion, thereby ensuring that Hydra's secrets were not exposed.\n\nStepping into the elevator with several STRIKE agents, Rumlow had greeted Rogers, attempting not to alert him to the incoming ambush. While they headed down, Rumlow spoke to Rogers to gain his trust, claiming that forensics had found evidence on the shooter for them to see, before more agents entered and gently pushed Rogers into the middle of the elevator, ready for their ambush. Rumlow noted to Rogers that he had been sorry to hear about the death of Fury.\n\nAs they were joined by Jack Rollins, Rogers had become suspicious about the situation and gave the team one chance to escape before they got started. Realizing that Rogers knew what was coming, the Hydra agents refused the offer and attempted to recapture Rogers, using Taser Rods and Magnetic Handcuffs. As Rogers had furiously fought back against them, Rumlow managed to kick his arm against the wall, causing a Magnetic Handcuff to then lock him into place.\n\nWith Rogers pinned against the wall, Rumlow attacked him with his Taser Rods, causing him considerable pain until Rogers was able to beat him back and free himself. While Jasper Sitwell was watching the situation and sending them reinforcements, Rumlow eventually was the last man standing against Rogers, who had beaten all the other Hydra agents unconscious. Rearming himself with his Taser Rods, Rumlow insisted that the ambush was not personal.\n\nDespite knowing he was outmatched by Rogers, Rumlow had then proceeded to attack him, furiously swinging the Taser Rods at him and managing to strike Rogers into the stomach twice, causing him considerable pain. However, Rogers swiftly regained control of the situation and punched Rumlow hard in the head, before throwing him up into the ceiling of the elevator, knocking Rumlow unconscious, as Rogers had then made his successful escape from the facility.[4]\n\nFollowing their humiliating defeat, Rumlow led the ensuing manhunt for Steve Rogers under the orders of Alexander Pierce. Before long, Rumlow and his team had been able to track Rogers down to a mall in Washington, D.C. where he and Natasha Romanoff had activated a flash drive with a tracker on it. Seeking to take down Rogers, Rumlow soon arrived at the mall with his STRIKE team including Jack Rollins, all eager to gain revenge of their defeat in the elevator.\n\nAs the STRIKE agents searched the mall, it was confirmed by Rollins that Rogers and Romanoff had already left the shop where they had activated the hard-drive, learning all about Zola's Algorithm. Rumlow confirmed that the other Hydra agents did not have a visual on their targets, as he personally searched for them. Having failed to notice a kissing couple going past him, Rumlow finally accepted that Rogers and Romanoff had successfully managed to escape.[4]\n\nAs their hunt for the fugitives continued, Rumlow had gained word that Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff had been located while they were at Camp Lehigh, where they had been attempting to gain information about their scheme out of Arnim Zola's computer hard-drive, which was located at the camp. Learning this, Alexander Pierce then destroyed the camp with a missile in an attempt to kill them and ordered Rumlow to search the area in order to confirm that they had been killed.\n\nRumlow and his STRIKE team then explored the remains of the area, looking through the rubble for their corpses and discovered a pair of shoeprints, showing him that Rogers and Romanoff had survived the destruction of the camp and had managed to escape. Upon seeing this, Rumlow reported back to his Hydra superiors and told them to call in the Winter Soldier, believing that he would be the only one who would be able to take out their targets following this latest failure.[4]\n\nRumlow's plans to call in the Winter Soldier proved to be successful, as the Soldier tracked them down during their interrogation of Jasper Sitwell and then forced them into the open. Once their fugitives were cornered, Rumlow and his STRIKE teams then charged forwards and had managed to swiftly capture Steve Rogers, together with Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson on the streets of Washington, D.C. following their prolonged fight with the Winter Soldier, who had just managed to escape.\n\nAs Rumlow and his team surrounded the three with their guns drawn, he noticed Jack Rollins attempting to execute Rogers by shooting him in the back of his head, due to Rollins' fury over their humiliating defeat at the Triskelion. However, before Rollins could shoot, Rumlow saw a news helicopter watching overhead and ordered him to stop and wait until they were clear of the media, as he instead continued handcuffing Rogers and put his captives in the back of their van.\n\nRumlow then took their captives to a secure location to execute them free of any other media interference. As they stepped from their van, Rumlow turned to some of his team as he ordered them to dig three graves for Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson. Rumlow and Rollins led a team to the van and opened the doors with their guns drawn, only to find that Rogers and his team had just escaped with help from Maria Hill and a Mouse Hole device to cut their way through the vehicle.[4]\n\nHaving failed again to kill their targets, Rumlow and Jack Rollins had brought Alexander Pierce to the Ideal Federal Savings Bank to begin their questioning of the Winter Soldier, who was seemingly having a mental breakdown, as he then attacked the scientists who were attempting to fix his Prosthetic Arm, forcing Rollins and the guards to hold him at gunpoint.\n\nIgnoring the warnings from the scientists, Rumlow acted as Pierce's personal bodyguard once he began questioning the Winter Soldier, demanding a mission report of the recent battle. Rumlow watched on as Pierce beat the Winter Soldier for not answering until he questioned who Steve Rogers was. Although Pierce tried to dismiss the question, noting he encountered him when he shot Nick Fury, the Winter Soldier had insisted that he had actually known Rogers somehow.\n\nRumlow had watched closely while Pierce demanded that the Winter Soldier refocus so Hydra could achieve their goals and put Project Insight into effect. However, the Winter Soldier still insisted that he had known Rogers, causing Pierce to order that he be placed back into the Memory Suppressing Machine so that his memories could be wiped once again. As the Winter Soldier then screamed in agony, Rumlow left their facility with Pierce to continue with their plans.[4]\n\nHaving been stationed back at the Triskelion, Rumlow was alerted to the return of Captain America when he had gone onto their speaker-systems and then alerted all the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the Triskelion of Hydra's infiltration, as well as Alexander Pierce's plans. Rumlow then stormed into the Triskelion's control room to ensure that everything went to plan.\n\nRumlow ordered Cameron Klein to launch all the Insight Helicarriers, only to find that Klein was clearly unsure about what he should do, as Captain America had exposed STRIKE as Hydra. Questioning if he had a problem with his orders to launch the Helicarriers, Rumlow was then told by Klein that he would not launch them, as he was following Captain America's orders, as Rumlow responded by holding a gun to the back of Klein's head, before then ordering him to step aside.\n\nHowever, Rumlow was then threatened by Sharon Carter, who aimed her gun at Rumlow's head and had expressed her loyalty to Captain America, leading to multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra agents to draw their weapons in a tense standoff. Rumlow told Carter and Klein that they had chosen the wrong side in this conflict, but found that Carter was unwavering, as she held her gun to his head, forcing Rumlow to eventually drop his gun, as he seemingly surrendered their fight.\n\nHowever, the moment Rumlow sensed that Carter had lowered her defenses, he swiftly drew a hidden blade and slashed her across the arm, forcing Carter to drop her gun, which Rumlow had caught and immediately gunned down several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. As a gunfight broke out, Rumlow attempted to execute Klein, only for Carter to kick Klein out of the way. In the middle of all the chaos, Rumlow managed to get onto the computers and launched the Insight Helicarriers.\n\nWith the Helicarriers being launched, Rumlow got back onto his feet and continued shooting at the remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Carter had also managed to rearm herself as she then furiously shot back at Rumlow, who managed to use all the chaos to run towards the door, avoiding all the gunshots and making his way through the Triskelion, seeking to ensure that nothing else stood in their way of completing Hydra's goal to wipe out all of their future enemies in one sweep.\n\nAs he made his way through the Triskelion during the battle, Rumlow had managed to kill several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, using his knife and disarming various agents to take their weapons and shoot others. He received the call informing him that Black Widow and Nick Fury had attacked and captured Pierce. Knowing that the capture of Pierce put Project Insight at risk of being stopped, Rumlow had then made it his priority to protect Pierce so Hydra's plans could go underway.[4]\n\nAs he went to protect Alexander Pierce from being arrested, Rumlow was cornered and ambushed by Sam Wilson. However, he was soon able to knock Wilson to the ground with a head-butt. Rumlow prepared for a long fight and told Wilson that their fight was going to hurt as Hydra did not take any prisoners, while bragging that Wilson was out of his depth in challenging him, smugly asking Wilson if he was even ready for the pain which Rumlow planned on inflicting.\n\nGrowing tired of Rumlow's bragging about his views about Hydra's world view, Wilson simply told him to shut up as they began to fight, as they furiously charged at each other and exchanging blows. While the battle between Captain America and the Winter Soldier raged on the Project Insight Helicarriers, Rumlow had eventually managed to gain the upper hand against Wilson, due to his rough and dirty style of fighting, as he managed to throw Wilson across the room.\n\nBelieving that he had gained the upper hand against Wilson, Rumlow had then leaped onto the table and looked down on his enemy, who was struggling to get back onto his feet, following his fight against Rumlow. With full confidence about Hydra's superiority, Rumlow had then begun taunting Wilson that he was out of his depth with his attempt to fight against Hydra as he looked down upon bleeding and almost defeated Wilson who was now lying on the ground.\n\nHowever, while Rumlow smugly prepared to kill his enemy, he did not spot the incoming Helicarrier IN-01, which had been damaged during their battle and was heading straight for them. Seeing Wilson had spotted something behind him and had turned and ran as fast as he could in the opposite direction, Rumlow turned and saw the danger, but not until it was unfortunately too late and it crashed straight into the side of the Triskelion directly behind the horrified Rumlow.\n\nRumlow attempted to flee but was soon knocked over and crushed by the crumbling building as the bricks and flames trapped his body under the rubble and nearly killed him. Rumlow, however, somehow managed to survive despite being badly wounded, gaining horrific facial and body scars, and was taken away by medics.[4] The incident had also left Rumlow almost completely immune to pain and with a hatred for Captain America whom he blamed for his terrible injuries.[7]\n\nIn the wake of the battle at the Triskelion, Rumlow spent a long time recovering from his injuries. Months later, Rumlow had watched a report on the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. from his hospital bed, and had also learned Alexander Pierce had been killed during the conflict. Having become disillusioned and furious at Hydra's defeat, Rumlow then proceeded to assault his nurse and escaped from the hospital.[1] Seeking to find his new purpose, following the downfall of Hydra, Rumlow became a mercenary and began robbing police stations over various countries.[7]\n\nAs news outlets, including WHiH World News and The Daily reported on his actions, Rumlow took on the name Crossbones, and focused on revenge against Captain America. In 2016, recovering some items from S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to draw out Hydra, Crossbones opened fire to send a message while getting satisfaction by subjecting them to the pain he suffered. Having now regained the Avengers' attention, who followed his trail for six months, Crossbones went to Lagos, Nigeria to set up a deadly ambush.[1]\n\nCrossbones had assembled his group of mercenaries and organized the theft of a biological agent at an Institute for Infectious Diseases laboratory in Lagos, Nigeria, where he intended to sell it to either the Ten Rings or Hydra, whoever was willing to pay more.[8] Crossbones' men drove their truck through the entrance before opening fire, filling the building with poisonous gas, while Crossbones walked inside the building, wearing his Battlefield Suit and a gas mask.\n\nWhile several men stood guard outside to protect against any further attacks, Crossbones and another mercenary had proceeded to make their way through the building, with other soldiers taking control of every floor, wearing their own gasmasks to protect from the gas that had killed the building's entire security staff. Using his Weaponized Gauntlets, Crossbones smashed through several walls with ease until he had found the chemical weapon, ordering his men to bag it up.\n\nHowever, they were soon confronted by the Avengers who interfered and fended off his mercenaries, before seeking Crossbones out. As Crossbones stepped outside, he witnessed Wanda Maximoff sucking all the poison gas out of the building, indicating that the Avengers had arrived to stop their plans, as Crossbones had delighted at the idea that Captain America would be leading the Avengers and would give Crossbones his chance at revenge following their Triskelion battle.\n\nWith only limited time remaining for them to complete their mission, Crossbones and his team then quickly made their way downstairs by using a wire, while Captain America was still in the building searching for him and his soldiers, learning that they had stolen the biological weapon. However, Crossbones soon found Black Widow as she was attacking his men and charged at her, grabbing her by the hair before dragging her backwards, into a scuffle atop an armored truck.\n\nBlack Widow had soon freed herself and fought against the merciless terrorist, proving herself to be the superior fighter as she was able to avoid all of Crossbones' strikes, while countering with several hits to his chest and head, with Crossbones' Battlefield Suit protecting him. However, Crossbones managed to grab Black Widow by the hair, as he dragged her backwards, before she had responded by attempting to electrocute him with one of her Taser Disks on his exposed neck.\n\nCrossbones, however, informed her that he did not feel pain like that anymore, due to his injuries from the Battle at the Triskelion, before locking her inside a tank and dropping a grenade in with her. Leaving some of his own men inside the vehicle as well, Crossbones moved to another armored car, while Black Widow had barely managed to escape by using one of the mercenaries as a human shield to protect her from the deadly explosion, despite causing her great pain.\n\nCrossbones and his remaining mercenaries then got in their armored vehicle and Crossbones took control of the main gun, aiming it at the IFID building just as Captain America was exciting to hunt down the terrorist and regain the stolen biological weapon. While the Captain attempted to escape, Crossbones continued to fire at his enemy until eventually, he was able to shoot him out of the building where he fell several floors down to the ground, while Crossbones drove away.\n\nThey attempted to escape their attackers while Falcon hunted them down, as Crossbones gave the chemical weapon to one of his men to take to the airport before ordering them to ditch the armored truck since they would never outrun them, knowing that Falcon's EXO-7 Falcon was faster than their truck. They crashed and departed, with each of the soldiers running in a different direction without their gear, hoping to mislead the Avengers and escape with the weapon.\n\nAs one of these mercenaries had asked where Crossbones would be meeting them, Crossbones then made it clear that he knew he would die during this fight against Captain America. Before long, all the men had been killed and their biological weapon had been safely secured and taken away by Redwing, preventing any potential terrorist attack. However, Crossbones was less concerned about this failure, than he was about locating Captain America and gaining his revenge.[7]\n\nDuring the chaos, Crossbones then managed to get behind Captain America and threw a magnetic bomb onto his shield, forcing Captain America to throw it aside to avoid the bomb killing innocent lives. As he was distracted by the explosion, Crossbones then ran up to Captain America and then struck him in the back with his Weaponized Gauntlet, causing him to smash through several tables as Crossbones chased after him.\n\nAs Captain America got back onto his feet, Crossbones reloaded his Gauntlet and had struck him again, commenting on how he had been waiting to have a rematch against his former STRIKE teammate. As he used his Battlefield Suit to enhance his strength, Crossbones then smashed his foot onto the ground and threw multiple punches, trying to land a final crippling blow against Captain America. As he became frustrated, Crossbones struck Captain America with a headbutt.\n\nCrossbones then struck Captain America with his Gauntlet, sending him flying backwards, as Crossbones refused to stop and continued swinging hard punches against his enemy, which Captain America struggled to block. Taking full advantage of the situation, Crossbones then pinned Captain America against a wall, noting that all this pain would be his revenge for him having dropped the Triskelion on top of him with a Helicarrier, as Crossbones then drew a hidden blade.\n\nHowever, when Crossbones attempted to impale Captain America in the face with the blade, the strike was avoided and the Gauntlet was smashed into the wall, trapping Crossbones' arm, which had allowed Captain America to knock Crossbones back as he tore the Gauntlet from his arm. When Crossbones then drew his second hidden blade from the second Gauntlet, Captain America proceeded to avoid both strikes from the blade, as he had countered Crossbones' attacks.\n\nAs Captain America had proceeded to land several swift strikes and heavy against Crossbones' head and body, he then took advantage of Crossbones being momentarily stunned by the heavy blows and proceeded to strike him across the face with his hard kick, sending Crossbones flying backwards. As Crossbones landed onto the table, his helmet was now badly damaged, finally ending the conflict, once Crossbones was now too heavily beaten to continue fighting.[7]\n\nHaving taken too hard of a beating, Crossbones accepted defeat and had remained on his knees, removing his damaged helmet while he awaited his confrontation. With Crossbones defeated, Captain America demanded Rumlow to reveal who he was working for, only for Crossbones to instead notice Captain America looking at all his heavy facial scars he had sustained from their Triskelion battle.\n\nWhile Crossbones had noted that his scarring could have been a lot worse, he then commented that the Winter Soldier had remembered his old friend, intending to use Captain America's emotions against him. Seeing that this worked, Crossbones kept claiming that Bucky Barnes had remembered Captain America, stating that Barnes had gotten emotional about it before Hydra had scrambled his brain by putting him back inside of the Memory Suppressing Machine.\n\nCrossbones continued ranting that the Winter Soldier had given him his message to give to Captain America, that when he had to go, he had to go, and that he would take Captain America with him. With Captain America distracted by the stories about his closest friend's terrible suffering, Crossbones had then armed the hidden explosives applied within his Battlefield Suit, as he had intended to take Captain America's life along with his own inside of the massive blast.\n\nJust as Crossbones then activated the bomb, Wanda Maximoff used her powers to contain the explosion as Crossbones screamed in horrific agony while his body was consumed inside the fireball. She was able to whisk his exploding body from Captain America but unintentionally placed him by a building, filled with relief aid workers from Wakanda. Among those who had perished inside of this resulting explosion was Crossbones, as Maximoff could not contain the deadly blast.[7]\n\nThe Attack in Lagos and Crossbones' catastrophic suicide bombing, which had killed several civilians, was deemed to be a public relations disaster for the Avengers. This, combined with the already divisive public opinion of the Avengers due to the Battle of Sokovia, caused the nations of the world to ratify the Sokovia Accords in hopes of preventing any similar conflicts.[7]\n\nOriginally, Rumlow was extremely loyal to Hydra, as well as being slightly cocky, like when he saved Steve Rogers aboard the Lemurian Star. He was greatly impressed with Rogers' abilities as a soldier, such as when Rogers jumped from a Quinjet without a parachute. He had a strong attitude, as well as a tendency to go to extreme lengths to do things, like when he threatened to kill Cameron Klein if he did not launch the Project Insight Helicarriers.\n\nAs for when he took up the Crossbones alias, Rumlow was unpredictable, unapologetic, vicious, arrogant, ruthless and murderous. Following his escape from the hospital, Rumlow completely abandoned Hydra's ideals, quickly becoming obsessed with only one thing - revenge.\n\nRumlow was carelessly willing to sacrifice two of his men to kill Black Widow with a grenade and brutally attacked Captain America with no remorse. When he was finally defeated, he did not hesitate to blow himself up if that meant that his enemies would die with him. However, before his death, Rumlow was proven to be an extremely sadistic person as he lied to Rogers about the latter meeting with Bucky Barnes, when he taunted him, Rumlow seemed to be enjoying from the thing.",
