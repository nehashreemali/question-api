  "content": "Kang the Conqueror was a scientist from the 31st Century who discovered the Multiverse's existence and joined the Council of Kangs in ruling over the foreseeable realities. Deeming the council's actions to be destroying the Multiverse, Kang sparked the Multiversal War, seeking to conquer as many worlds as possible. However, the council decided to banish him to the Quantum Realm, where he allied with Janet van Dyne to rebuild his Time Sphere, until he was betrayed after van Dyne discovered his true nature. Kang was once again trapped in the Quantum Realm, using that time to conquer part of it and build an empire in Axia.\n\nYears later, after taking Darren Cross under his wing, Kang had ordered the capture of Ant-Man and Cassie Lang, holding the latter prisoner unless Ant-Man would succeed in claiming the Multiversal Engine Core to escape the Realm with his new empire and enact a new dynasty. However, Kang's attempts were thwarted by a revolution by the Freedom Fighters. In his last opportunity to escape, he had a brutal duel against Ant-Man, which resulted in Kang being shrunken and decimated by his own Engine Core, though his death inadvertently alerted the Council of Kangs about people interacting with the Multiverse, prompting them to take their own measures.\n\nWhile living on Earth in the 31st century, Kang and Variants of himself discovered the existence of the Multiverse. These Variants made contact with one another, sharing knowledge and technologies in an effort to improve their native timelines.[3] However, Kang realized that the reckless actions of his Variants was causing chaos that was spreading throughout the entire Multiverse. He saw the ultimate demise of the Multiverse due to the collisions of the universes and Incursions.\n\nKang sought to conquer as many timelines he possibly could, starting the Multiversal War between his Variants.[1] All Variants had been fighting one another in an ultimate struggle to annihilate other timelines and leaving only the one they had conquered. During his conquest, Kang fought and killed the Avengers from numerous timelines, to the point when he could not tell one from another. However, the Multiversal War was eventually put to an end, when one of the Variants weaponized Alioth to emerge victorious and created what he called the Sacred Timeline, keeping other Variants from entering it.[3]\n\nWith He Who Remains' death, the Sacred Timeline branched, which allowed his Variants, including Kang, to re-establish contact with it.[3] The Council of Kangs, having deemed Kang too dangerous, chose to banish him into the Quantum Realm in an attempt to prevent a new war, since Kang was still seeking to conquer the Multiverse.[1] Kang was ambushed[4] and put into his Time Sphere, where he was exiled to the Quantum Realm, a dimension where time and space do not abide to the human laws of physics.[1]\n\nDue to his Multiversal Engine Core being sabotaged, Kang stranded through the realm, until the Time Sphere crashed and Kang was confronted by Quantum Wolves, the predators of the realm. However, he was saved by Janet van Dyne, who was also trapped in the Quantum Realm, and Kang helped her by shooting down one of the Quantum Wolves that nearly pounced her. He introduced himself as a scientist who traveled into the Quantum Realm before his ship crashed off-course, and van Dyne helped him in need. She asked if the Time Sphere could get them out of the Quantum Realm, and Kang replied that it could take them anywhere they wanted. Van Dyne had the Time Sphere being brought to her homestead near the crash site, so they could investigate together.[1]\n\nBack at her homestead, Janet van Dyne helped Kang to examine the Time Sphere and find the way to make it operational again. They realized that the problem was with the Multiversal Engine Core and worked tirelessly to recharge it, however, nothing worked. Van Dyne would later remarked that she never met a person like Kang, remarking how lost he was, and that they found friendship in each other. Kang would listen to van Dyne telling him about her life, about her daughter Hope, whom she called \"Jellybean.\"\n\nAs Kang and van Dyne talked, she confided to him that during the last time she saw Hope, van Dyne lied that she would come back to her. Kang told van Dyne that with his Time Sphere, he could give her back the time she could have spent with her daughter. He mused that time is a cage that keeps them all trapped, but turns out to be much smaller than it seemed, after you get out of it. He promised van Dyne that he will do everything he can, so van Dyne could upkeep her promise by coming back to Hope at the very exact moment she promised.[1]\n\nYears later, Kang and Janet van Dyne finally succeed and reactivated the Multiversal Engine Core, which would finally be their way out of the Quantum Realm. However, as they were putting the core into the Time Sphere, it relayed Kang's memories of the Multiversal War to van Dyne which horrified her. Kang was slightly confused by van Dyne's sudden mood change and assured her that they can leave, but she suddenly asked him who Kang is. Kang told her that it was who he needed to be and tried to reason with her, saying that he owes van Dyne and wants to keep his promise by bringing her back to her daughter. Van Dyne asked him what will he do after he gets out to the Quantum Realm, to which Kang replied that he is going to win and activated the Time Sphere, gaining access to his armor.\n\nKang assured van Dyne that he has the power to make it so she never left Hope in the first place, but van Dyne only asked him about the worlds that will die after he gets out. Kang replied that he will spare her world and her daughter, while also remarking that she has no way to stop him. However, van Dyne used her Wasp Suit to steal the core and escape, but Kang created a shock wave to destroy the homestead and knock van Dyne down. He started approaching her and demanding the core back, prompting van Dyne to use the Pym Particle Discs to enlarge the core, rendering it unusable and trapping Kang in the Quantum Realm, without a chance of getting out.[1]\n\nDespite being trapped, Kang recovered his power and the access to the 31st century's technology and weaponry, which allowed him to conquer the Quantum Realm. He built his own empire, using the Quantumnauts as his troops, and ruled over his empire with an iron fist. Janet van Dyne and some of the Quantum Realm inhabitants became Freedom Fighters, seeking to bring down Kang's regime, but their attempts were fruitless. Kang came across of Darren Cross in a malfunctioning Yellowjacket Suit, who was also trapped in the Quantum Realm. Kang rebuilt his disfigured body and turned him to the Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing, making Cross his personal servant.\n\nEventually, van Dyne was able to be liberated from the Quantum Realm by Hank Pym and his Quantum Tunnel, which left Kang without any chance to escape. Some of the former Freedom Fighters chose to switch sides and pledge their loyalty to Kang, such as Krylar. Kang was informed by M.O.D.O.K. that Cassie Lang was using the Quantum Satellite to send signals to the Quantum Realm, which could potentially be used as their way out. Kang had M.O.D.O.K. to hijack the signal and open the rift, which brought van Dyne, Cassie, Pym, Scott Lang, and Hope van Dyne into the Quantum Realm, putting out an order to capture all of them alive.[1]\n\nWhile Krylar's attempt to capture Janet van Dyne, Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne, Kang sent out M.O.D.O.K. to attack the Freedom Fighters settlement and capture Scott and Cassie Lang. As he approached them at the Celestium's prison cell, Kang spoke to Scott and remarked that he is an interesting man. Scott tried to intimidated him by saying that he is an Avenger, but Kang was unimpressed due to all the Avengers he had killed throughout his life, briefly mistaking Scott for Thor.\n\nKang told Scott that he is a man who had lost a lot of time, just like him, and they could potentially help each other, noting Scott's skills as a thief. M.O.D.O.K. tried to butt in and mentioned the last time Scott stole something from him, but Kang threw him against the wall with his telekinesis for speaking in his presence. He retorted that Janet was a better helper, which prompted a surprised reaction from Scott, and Kang was not surprised that Janet never told anyone about him.\n\nKang claimed that Janet stole his only ticket out of the Quantum Realm and Scott was the only man who could steal it back and return it to Kang. As Scott asked why would he help Kang, he informed him and Cassie that only he could stop the arrival of his Variants, claiming they exiled Kang because they were afraid of him. Kang then claimed that in exchange, he could help all of them to get back home, but Scott responded by rejecting his offer.\n\nKang then begun telekinetically torturing Lang, threatening to trap him in an infinite loop of watching Cassie die over and over, until Scott would beg Kang to kill him for good. Scott was visibly afraid of that, and when Cassie tried to tell her father not to listen to the threats, Kang turned his attention to Cassie and began torturing her as well. Kang gave Scott a choice of whether he wanted his daughter to live or die, threatening to break her, until Scott eventually accepted the deal with Kang. He then let both him and Cassie out their cells, and as Scott demanded him to not hurt his daughter again, Kang replied that he must bring him what he wanted.[1]\n\nKang then opened a portal, bring him, Ant-Man, M.O.D.O.K., and Cassie Lang to the ruins of Janet van Dyne's homestead and what used to be the Multiversal Engine Core. M.O.D.O.K. informed Ant-Man that his mission is to get through the eye of the storm and shrink the core back down, while Kang said that he will know what he is looking for when he finds it. Cassie suddenly broke away from the troops and hugged her father, while Kang ordered them to stand down and not shoot her. As the two said their goodbyes, the Quantumnauts took Cassie away, while Kang witnessed Ant-Man jumping into the storm.\n\nThe mission was successful as Ant-Man managed to shrink down the core with the Wasp's help, so Kang stepped in after they were joined by Janet who told Ant-Man that Kang cannot have the core. Kang retorted that Janet was not trustworthy, referencing her previous betrayal that had him trapped in the Quantum Realm for years. Seeing Ant-Man holding the core, Kang questioned what would be his next course of action, asking if he needed to take the core by force. Ant-Man asked Kang about his daughter and reminded Kang of their deal to let them both go after he gets the core, but Kang replied that Cassie will be fine without him.\n\nKang then used his telekinesis to take the core, so Ant-Man and the Wasp both attempted to attack Kang, but he effortlessly knocked them away. Janet then witnessed Hank Pym crashing because of M.O.D.O.K.'s revenge attempt, but before she could run off to her husband, Kang stopped her in her tracks. He remarked that Janet left him to die in the Quantum Realm once before, wondering for how long her family would be able to survive there, and opened a portal to take her to the Celestium.[1]\n\nKang had Janet van Dyne to be brought to him, while he was sitting in his Time Sphere and awaiting her. Kang questioned what did she saw back in the day, which made Janet turn against him, and she replied that what she saw was a megalomaniacal monster Kang actually was. Kang told her that he holds a power to witness the end of the Multiverse itself and could not look away from it no matter what, and when Janet what was the reason for that, Kang answered that it was himself.\n\nHe showed her the branches of the Multiverse and revealed that his Variants was playing with them like children, causing chaos and unwittingly bringing the Multiverse to its doom, so he decided to take control. Janet argued that what he did was starting a war and all he wanted is to wipe away any universe that poses a threat to him, calling him a monster again. Kang, however, claimed that he was merely a conqueror, and he must burn down the old world to build a new one in its place.\n\nShe retorted that Kang never cared about saving anyone and only wanted the revenge on his Variants for his loss. Kang lashed out, claiming that Janet had no idea what he truly lost, saying that he will burn all of his Variants out of time for what they had done to him. Janet could barely believe that Kang would murder trillions to achieve his revenge, but Kang replied that it hardly mattered in the end.[1]\n\nAs the preparations of the Multiversal Engine Core were in progress, Kang had Janet van Dyne to witness the empire he had built and the army he was going to bring for his conquest. He then addressed his Quantumnauts with a speech, stating that together they will forge a history and take revenge on those who dared to banish him, as the Kang Dynasty shall conquer the eternity.\n\nHowever, his speech was cut short, as the broadcast was hijacked by Cassie Lang who rallied the Freedom Fighters and other Quantum Realm inhabitants to rebel against Kang and his forces. Kang then ordered M.O.D.O.K. to find Cassie and kill her once and for all, while his troops held Janet in her place.\n\nKang then put the core into its place and ordered to begin the launch, however, the Celestium was suddenly attacked by Giant-Man, who was furious at Kang for breaking their deal. In response, Kang sent out his forces to bring Giant-Man down, but he was rescued by the Freedom Fighters who started an uprising in Axia.\n\nAs the Freedom Fighters fought his troops and Giant-Man was approaching his citadel, Kang ordered to launch the core immediately, covering the Celestium with a force field. He initially could not breach it, but with the Wasp's help, he managed to get through and damage the citadel, prompting Kang to escape the rubble. Once Kang stood back and witness the ruins of his empire, Janet told him that it was over now, to which Kang only replied that it is never over.[1]\n\nKang then personally descended to participate in the battle, killing any Freedom Fighter on his way.\n\nBeing confronted by Jentorra and Xolum, Kang effortlessly knocked them both away and reflected Xolum's energy beam back at him, which killed him. As the Freedom Fighters were falling back, Kang was faced by Ant-Man, the Wasp and Stature, who immediately charged at him. Kang fought off both the Wasp and Stature, but Ant-Man managed to pummel him into his own citadel, before Kang knocked him back.\n\nKang then ranted about how he has defeated many rebellions, killed many Avengers, and questioned their belief that they can beat him, remarking that Lang \"talks to ants\". Just then, Hank Pym arrived with an army of technologically advanced ants that started laying waste to Kang's forces and attempted to attack Kang himself.\n\nKang put out a force field, barely managing to hold off the ants, but still being able to force through them. However, M.O.D.O.K. suddenly arrived, having had a change of heart due to Stature's advice, and manages to disable Kang's force field at the cost of his own life. Kang was left defenseless against an army of ants that instantly swarmed him and damaged his armor, carrying him away.[1]\n\nKang managed to survive the attack of ants and furiously attack Ant-Man, right after his allies managed to get out of the Quantum Realm through the portal. Having his armor heavily damaged, Kang immediately rushed toward the portal in an attempt to gain his freedom, only to be knocked away by Ant-Man. The two engaged in a fight, in which Kang repeatedly stomped down on his head to the point that his helmet broke. Kang remarked that Lang should have looked the other way and not involve himself in his business, to which Lang replied that he was never great at that and charged at him. Kang ultimately bested Lang in a fight, saying that he could have gone home and be with his daughter, but threw it away due to thinking that he could win.\n\nAs Kang had Lang in a headlock, he suddenly responded by saying that he only needed for both of them to lose and hit the Multiversal Engine Core with blue and red Pym Particle Discs. Realizing what he had done, Kang immediately let go of Lang and rushed towards the portal once again, but was knocked back by the Wasp who came to aid Lang. She proceeded to blast Kang with her stingers, until Lang delivered a finishing blow and punched Kang into the unstable core. As the core started to collapse, Kang was sucked into a vortex and screamed from pain, before disappearing in the one last burst of energy.[1]\n\nReturning to his normal life, Scott Lang began to ponder on Kang's words that a threat bigger than him was coming. He became increasingly paranoid as to whether or not killing Kang was the best idea, remembering how Kang said that everyone would die if he did not escape. Lang tried to brush it off but his doubts remained as he tried not to think about Kang.[1]\n\nMeanwhile, Centurion called Rama-Tut to tell him that the exiled Kang had died. Immortus soon arrived and revealed that the fallen Kang was defeated by Ant-Man. Concerned that the Avengers were slowly discovering the existence of the Multiverse and would destroy everything they had built, Immortus decided to call upon the Council of Kangs to handle the issue.[1]\n\nKang's conquest and attempted escape of the Quantum Realm did not go unnoticed by the Time Variance Authority. However, the TVA did not have to intervene since he was successfully defeated by both Ant-Man and Wasp.[2]\n\nOn the surface, this iteration of Kang was calm and collected, merely showing a desire to escape the Quantum Realm and initially helping Janet van Dyne return to her own timeline to see Hope. He pretended as a traveler lost in time and hid his true nature from van Dyne until the latter found out his true plans through touching his Time Sphere. Beneath this calm and controlled demeanor was a ruthless and cunning conqueror, prone to losing his temper when he did not get what he wanted, as he had been trapped in the Quantum Realm for so long and wanted to leave desperately, to exact revenge on his enemies and to conquer timelines. As his plans to start a new dynasty were foiled by Ant-Man and his allies, Kang became increasingly violent and desperate in his ways and decided to kill Ant-Man and his family even though he promised to spare them if they delivered Kang what he wanted.\n\nThis Kang held deep enmity for the Council of Kangs who imprisoned him and swore to burn them out of time. This desire of revenge against his enemies was his greatest weakness and blinded his rational mind, preferring to beat Scott Lang ruthlessly for foiling his plans instead of just escaping when given the chance to do so. This also made Kang prone to emotional outbursts when he suffers from a defeat.\n\nKang was also extremely ambitious and power-hungry. Before his exile, he had conquered a number of realities and killed countless heroes to establish power. He held no empathy for the people of these timelines and simply massacred them all. In his own twisted way, he believed that conquering the multiverse was to save it from his Variants in the Council of Kangs and prevent incursions from happening. In this sense, he believed that he was doing the right thing and justified his killings and murderous rampages with a “royal purpose”. Kang, due to his instability, was vulnerable to self-deception, since the main justification for his actions was that he saw a creator god of realities by destroying others. Kang even stated that if he couldn’t escape the Quantum Realm, all of reality would be destroyed by his Variants, showing that this Kang truly believed himself to be doing the right thing. Even after being banished, Kang conquered the Quantum Realm which was essentially his prison for eternity, and built his own empire on top of the homes of the original inhabitants, displacing them and forcing them to group as Freedom Fighters, showing that he held no empathy for other people and cared only for his own interests and desires. He also grouped a giant army which he used to monitor and force the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm into oppression, and to wipe out resistance entirely.\n\nThis Kang saw normal people living in different timelines as lesser beings and worthless to him. As Kang possessed the ability to travel through different timelines and universes, he was essentially erased from the equation and thus was able to see the Multiverse in its entirety, consisting of countless timelines. Kang sees himself as superior and that others' lives do not matter as they cannot see beyond their universes. He viewed timelines as simply as new lands to conquer so as to \"preserve peace\" among timelines.\n\nKang was also deceptive, as shown from how he hid his true nature from van Dyne in the Quantum Realm and merely masqueraded as a traveler lost in time, gaining the trust of van Dyne so that she could help him rebuild the Multiversal Engine Core to allow Kang to continue his conquest after escaping.\n\nKang also exerted an extremely condescending manner to both his subjects and his enemies. Considering his cruelty to M.O.D.O.K., Kang only viewed his subjects as pawns to achieve his own goals as he killed Darren Cross immediately after Cross changed sides and became worthless to Kang. He only saved Cross as he saw what Cross could do for him, viewed Cross as a mere replacement for van Dyne in helping him escape, and treated Cross harshly, demanding him not to speak in his presence. To his enemies, Kang was much crueler, using his powers to render his enemies unable to move and forcing them to work with him, such as forcing Ant-Man into working for him after torturing his daughter Cassie in front of her father, and warning Ant-Man that he would have to see Cassie die endlessly if he didn’t comply, showing Kang's tendency to mentally torture his enemies into submission. During the uprising, Kang brutally killed many Freedom Fighters without a thought even when the rebels escaped. Kang looked down on Ant-Man, stating that he only \"talked to ants,\" and underestimated his abilities during the Uprising in Axia as he didn’t expect the heroes to be able to beat him at all, Kang himself having killed countless Avengers from different realities before. Even as ruler of the Quantum Realm, Kang did not show any empathy to the inhabitants whose homes were displaced by Kang himself, and chose to rule with an iron fist, viewing them as lesser beings and thus neglecting their freedom. He also mercilessly killed many members of the Freedom Fighters as they attempted to thwart him in the Uprising of Axia.\n\nDespite his ruthlessness, Kang seemed to at least have some honor, as he offered to change the timeline of Janet van Dyne such that she would not waste decades of time and with her daughter, as his token of thanks for her help in repairing the Time Sphere. He also offered to keep Janet van Dyne's timeline safe from his conquering once he escaped as he sees himself in debt to van Dyne. He seemed to truly see van Dyne as a friend, at least before van Dyne turned against him and joined the Freedom Fighters.",
