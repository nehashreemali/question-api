It’s totally not — I’ve been connected to these things in the past and press has gotten onto it, but it’s not actually a thing, unfortunately.\"[11] However, showrunner Jessica Gao had confirmed Maslany's casting in September.[12]\n\nOn November 20, 2020, The Hollywood Reporter reported that the series would begin production in March 2021 under the working title \"Libra\"[13] alongside Moon Knight.[14]\n\nOn December 10, 2020, during Disney's 2020 Investor Day, Kevin Feige confirmed Tatiana Maslany's casting as She-Hulk.
