  "content": "Ms. Marvel is an American web television miniseries based on the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name. It is the nineteenth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the twelfth installment of Phase Four. The series is produced by Marvel Studios and was released on Disney+.\n\nThe first and only season premiered on June 8, 2022 and concluded on July 13, 2022.

An avid gamer and a voracious fan-fiction scribe, Kamala is a Super Hero mega fan with an oversized imagination—particularly when it comes to Captain Marvel.
