  "content": "Thor: Ragnarok is a 2017 superhero film, based on the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name. The film is a sequel to Thor, Thor: The Dark World, and Avengers: Age of Ultron. It is the seventeenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the fifth installment of Phase Three. The film was released on October 24, 2017, internationally and on November 3, 2017, in the United States.\n\nThe film is directed by Taika Waititi and stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Cate Blanchett as Hela, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Karl Urban as Skurge, with Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin.\n\nThe fourth film in the series, Thor: Love and Thunder, was released on July 8, 2022.\n\nThor's world is about to explode in Marvel's Thor: Ragnarok. His devious brother, Loki, has taken over Asgard, the powerful Hela has emerged to steal the throne for herself and Thor is imprisoned on the other side of the universe. To escape captivity and save his home from imminent destruction, Thor must first win a deadly alien contest by defeating his former ally and fellow Avenger... The Incredible Hulk!\n\nThor has been captured by mysterious enemy forces on Muspelheim. He rambles toward a skeleton sharing his cage about his efforts to defeat some robots on Earth, and laments about his inability to find any of the Infinity Stones he had set out to locate. Surtur releases Thor from his cage, chained and dangling, and taunts him with the knowledge of Odin no longer being on Asgard, also mentioning that Thor's absence has left it vulnerable. He announces that Ragnarök is coming to Asgard by his hand, and that all he must do to achieve this is to join his crown with the Eternal Flame, which burns in Odin's Vault.\n\nThor takes the cue to call Mjølnir, break out of his chains, and fight off Surtur's minions before taking his crown as a trophy. When he attempts to return to Asgard, however, Heimdall does not respond. His replacement, Skurge, only notices Thor's call when one of the women he is trying to impress points it out. Returning to Asgard for the first time in years, Thor is told by Skurge that Heimdall has been declared an enemy of the people and is on the run. Thor is unimpressed and goes to find Odin, who is watching a play about the valiant death of Loki, whilst lazing about and being pampered by various women. Thor sees through \"Odin's\" deception and forces Loki to drop the charade. After ordering for Surtur's crown to be delivered to Odin's Vault, Thor has Volstagg transport him and Loki to Earth to find the real Odin. Unfortunately, upon arrival, Thor and Loki quickly discover that the retirement home Loki had placed Odin in has been demolished. At this point, some passersby reveal that Jane Foster has broken up with Thor (although Thor insists to them that it was a 'mutual dumping').\n\nSuddenly, Loki is snatched away, leaving a mysterious address card behind, pointing Thor toward the New York Sanctum. Here, he finds Doctor Strange, who insists on knowing why Loki has been brought back to Earth. Thor explains that they are simply trying to find Odin and will immediately leave as soon as he is retrieved. Strange reveals that he knows of Odin's whereabouts, but notes that Odin asked not to be disturbed. Nevertheless, he sends Thor and Loki to him. Before Strange sent Thor and Loki to find Odin, he releases Loki from the portal that Loki fell into. Loki shouts at Strange that he had been falling for half an hour and draws his blades just before Strange sends them through the portal.\n\nThor and Loki find Odin, having shaken off Loki's spell, but he is despondent and dying. In his last moments, Odin makes a confession – Hela, the sister Thor and Loki never knew they had, who is also the Goddess of Death, will be released from her prison once he dies; he further reveals that she is far more powerful than her brothers and will only grow stronger when she returns to the fires of Asgard. Odin tells his sons he loves them one last time, before dissipating into energy and dying.\n\nThor becomes enraged at Loki, blaming him for Odin's death. Any thoughts of revenge however are put aside as a black mass forms in the air and Hela, free at last, emerges from her prison. When the brothers refuse her command to kneel, Hela attacks them, and as Thor throws Mjølnir toward her, she easily catches it with one hand and destroys it into pieces.\n\nLoki panics and calls for the Bifrost, but during their transport, Hela intercepts them and forces both Loki and Thor off of the bridge. Volstagg and Fandral, awaiting inside of the Bifrost dome, are killed almost immediately as Hela arrives. Skurge, present only because he has been given janitorial duty, is recruited to her side as Hela sets her eyes on the kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, we find Thor, deposited on an alien planet covered in junk: Sakaar. There are portals and wormholes of different shapes and sizes all across the sky, from which junk and debris from other worlds fall through to the surface. Thor is approached by hostile scavengers, who he manages to fight off without Mjølnir until one of the scavengers uses an electrified net to capture him. The scavengers proceed to beat Thor until a spaceship lands near them.\n\nFrom within, a drunk woman appears, claiming Thor to be \"hers.\" The woman kills the scavengers with her ship's guns, seemingly rescuing Thor. However, she ends up throwing a small disc at his neck which attaches itself to his flesh, allowing her to electrocute and render him unconscious at the push of a button. With the disc connected to his neck preventing him from escaping, the woman takes Thor onto her ship.\n\nBack on Asgard, the Asgardian army, led by Hogun, has assembled to stop Hela from entering the kingdom. Unperturbed by the hundreds of soldiers and several gunships, the Goddess of Death announces Odin's passing and that she has also disposed of Thor and Loki, demanding they recognize her as their new queen. Naturally, Hogun and the soldiers refuse to do so, leading Hela to instead fight the army. Despite the sheer numbers against her, Hela makes quick work of the entire force as she is quick, invincible and able to summon an endless arsenal of swords and spears which she uses to impale the majority of the soldiers.\n\nHela finishes off with Hogun, defiant to the end, who gets a large spear sent through his abdomen. She takes the throne and destroys the royal mural above it, revealing the original hidden behind. It's revealed that she had always been Odin's most powerful weapon in his efforts to create the mighty Asgardian empire, and that only when her ambition outgrew his did he imprison her.\n\nHela breaks into Odin's Vault, declaring the Infinity Gauntlet as fake, the Casket of Ancient Winters as weak, and Surtur's crown. She becomes briefly interested in the Tesseract, but declares the Eternal Flame the greatest of all. She smashes through the floor, revealing the mausoleum beneath. With the power of the Eternal Flame, Hela revives the fallen Asgardian soldiers from her time, along with her massive pet, the Fenris Wolf.\n\nWhile sitting in her throne, Hela notes that when Odin was king, she was his executioner, and that now she is queen, Skurge is her executioner. Meanwhile, Heimdall sneaks into the Bifrost dome and steals the sword, rendering the Bifrost useless. It’s revealed that Heimdall has been slowly organizing a resistance against Hela. Without the sword, Hela’s cannot complete her conquest of all the realms, and she sends her soldiers to hunt down this resistance.\n\nThor awakens to a holographic presentation about Sakaar and Grandmaster, the ruler of the planet and host of the gladiatorial Contest of Champions. The Grandmaster pays the drunk woman from earlier and obtains Thor as a contender, whom he decides to pit against his \"champion\" during a match. He states that Thor will earn his freedom, should he be the victor. Still restrained, Thor discovers Loki, who is mingling and getting on with the Grandmaster and his company quite well. Due to the unusual relativistic effects of how they both arrived, and that as time works differently on Sakaar, Loki has been there for weeks, earning the Grandmaster's favor.\n\nThor is thrown in to the gladiator's quarters where he meets Korg, an exiled Kronan resistance fighter, and his friend Miek. Korg states that no one has ever escaped or beaten this champion. Thor is prepared to fight this man, having his hair cut by an old man and choosing his weapons. He finds the woman there who he recognizes as an Asgardian Valkyrie. When she is unsympathetic to the plight of her home, he calls her a coward before being forced to go out and fight.\n\nThe champion is revealed to be the Hulk. Thor, overjoyed at seeing his former teammate, attempts to talk as well as negotiate with him but makes the mistake of calling him 'Banner'. He even tries Black Widow's calming technique but it fails to work. Hulk overpowers him during the battle and is close to killing him but Thor sees a vision of his father causing his powers to surge. As the fight continues, the tables have turned and Thor is winning but the Grandmaster, unwilling to see Hulk lose since he is a fan favorite, cheats and \"fixes\" the fight by activating the disc on Thor's neck.\n\nThor awakened in a luxurious quarters with Hulk. Hulk refuses to return Earth because he believes he is hated there and therefore will not leave. He is shown to be friends and sparring partners with Valkyrie but agrees to trick her into coming to his quarters so Thor can steal her control device and remove the disc from his neck.\n\nThor tries to get to the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar but Hulk damages it, not wanting Thor to leave. It is only when Thor accidentally activates a recording of Natasha's attempts to get Hulk to turn the Quinjet around that Hulk is pacified and transforms back to Bruce Banner himself. Banner has been in Hulk form since Sokovia and, as a result, the Hulk had completely taken over. Because of this, Banner was powerless and does not remember anything that has happened for the past two years since. He fears that if he becomes the Hulk again, Banner will be gone forever.\n\nThe Grandmaster orders Valkyrie and Loki to track Thor and Banner down. Valkyrie finds them but agrees to help, having knocked out Loki after he made her see a vision of herself and her sisters falling at Hela's hands millennia ago when she was the only survivor which caused her to turn to drink in misery on Sakaar. Loki, not wanting to be stuck on Sakaar, tells Thor he has the Grandmaster's security codes which give him control over his systems. Heimdall has told Thor that they need to go through the largest portal in the sky (which has the unfortunate nickname 'The Devil's Anus') to escape; however, Valkyrie's ship is not strong enough to survive the Anus. They break Korg and Miek out so they can begin a slave revolt as a distraction so they can steal the Grandmaster's personal ship.\n\nBack on Asgard, Skurge has civilians rounded up to demand the location of the sword. When nobody would speak, Hela tells him to execute a randomly chosen woman, though Skurge is visibly uncomfortable with this. Just before he can do so, a civilian agrees to tell Hela what she wants to know rather than see an innocent be put to death.\n\nLoki betrays the group as they are escaping, but having anticipated this, Thor had placed a taser disc on his back, leaving Loki incapacitated and outwitted on the floor. Thor tells his brother that he knows Loki will always be the God of Mischief, but had hoped that he would have shown some capacity for growth before leaving. However, Korg later arrives with a group of slaves and turns off the device, offering Loki a chance to go with them. Loki takes leadership of the group and steals a large ship with them.\n\nThor, Valkyrie and Banner arrive on Asgard. Hela begins an assault on the fortress where Heimdall is hiding the Asgardian civilians but Thor calls her back to the throne room to fight. Banner and Valkyrie fight to help the civilians escape via the Bifrost but they are cut off from behind by the undead army and in front by the enormous Fenris.\n\nDespite knowing he may never turn back, Banner jumps off the ship only to land hard on the Bifrost right in front of Fenris, failing to transform himself and out cold from the painful landing. As Fenris lunges towards the Asgardians, Banner transforms into the Hulk just in time to fight Fenris. At the same time, Loki arrives with Korg, Miek and his Sakaaran allies who all take on Hela's forces to buy time for the refugees to get aboard the ship.\n\nThor is overpowered by Hela who strikes him across the face, cutting out his right eye. She is about to finish him off when he once again has a vision of his father in Norway. Odin tells his son that Asgard is not a place, it is their people and anywhere could be Asgard. Thor states he cannot defeat Hela without Mjølnir, but Odin reminds Thor that he is not a god of hammers. Mjølnir was never the source of Thor's powers but was simply a focus for them. Odin assures that Thor's powers are greater that his ever were. Hela tries to stop the ship carrying the Asgardian refugees and Sakaaran slaves from leaving but Skurge, who has sneaked aboard in disguise in deep regret over how he betrayed Asgard, turns on Hela and kills the rest of her soldiers before she kills him. Meanwhile, as Thor is fully imparted with the revelation that Mjølnir was never the source of his powers, he hits Hela with a gigantic lightning bolt that completely obliterates the balcony the two are on and knocks her into the streets below.\n\nWith his powers in full force, Thor manages to resist Hela and carves through her army, though he soon realizes she is still too much for him after seeing her unharmed state. He and Loki agree that as long as Asgard exists she will grow more powerful. The prophecy says that in order for Ragnarok to happen, Asgard must fall — and Thor has another realisation; it is their place to ensure it, not to stop it; which would by extension stop Hela once and for all. Thor and Valkyrie hold her off while Loki goes to the vault to retrieve Surtur's crown, noticing the Tesseract unguarded along the way. Loki places the crown in the Eternal Flame, allowing Surtur to be reborn with his true power.\n\nAs Hela approaches a weakened Valkyrie, Thor tells his sister that their fight is over and she can have Asgard. Hela scoffs at Thor, telling him he will never be a match for her, seconds before the resurrected Surtur emerges and destroys the palace; Thor cites that while he cannot defeat Hela, Surtur certainly can. The now titanic Surtur begins laying waste to Asgard, and Thor takes advantage of the distraction and knocks Hela off the bridge. Thor and Valkyrie discuss the fact that Surtur must be allowed to destroy Asgard as the prophecy foretold, just as Hulk attacks Surtur.\n\nThor manages to call him off, and Hulk grudgingly gives up on the fight and carries Thor and Valkyrie aboard the ship, which escapes. Hela suddenly emerges from the water and begins to futilely impale Surtur. Unfortunately for Hela, she happens to be in the way of Surtur's sword and is killed when Surtur's sword plunges through her straight into Asgard's core. Everyone watches from the ship as Asgard is utterly annihilated, killing Surtur and leaving only asteroids behind. Thor understands now that the destruction of his home was inevitable, and that Asgard still exists but now in its people.\n\nThor begins wearing an eyepatch, similar to the one worn by his father. He thanks Loki for returning for him, and the two brothers finally reconcile. Thor then goes to the bridge and, with the surviving Asgardians watching on, takes the captain's chair as a throne and assumes his birthright as king of Asgard. With Loki, Hulk, Heimdall, Valkyrie, Korg and Miek by his side, the new king decides to set a course for Earth.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Loki asks Thor whether he will be welcome on Earth after the Battle of New York, and Thor assures that he will be. Thor is sure that everything will be fine until a much, much larger ship appears before them. In the post-credits scene, Grandmaster is faced down by the slaves he had previously been a master of, tries to declare the revolt a draw, but they are not impressed.\n\nIn January 2014, Variety reported that and Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost will be writing the screenplay for Thor: Ragnarok. Kevin Feige will be returning to produce and Chris Hemsworth will be returning in the title role.[4]\n\nOn October 2, 2015, Taika Waititi signed to direct the movie. Other candidates at the direction of the movie were Ruben Fleischer, Rob Letterman and Rawson Marshall Thurber.[5]\n\nOn February 25, 2016, Stellan Skarsgård confirmed that he will not have reprised the role of Dr. Erik Selvig in the movie.[6] On April 11 Natalie Portman was also confirmed to not come back for the sequel, while Tessa Thompson joined the cast as Thor's new romantic interest.[7]\n\nOn May 20, Marvel.com reported that Karl Urban and Jeff Goldblum have joined the cast. Cate Blanchett and Tessa Thompson were confirmed to be playing the major villain Hela and the hero Valkyrie respectively, while Anthony Hopkins and Idris Elba reprised their previous roles.[8]\n\nPrincipal photography started on July 4, 2016, in Queensland, Australia. The working title for the film was \"Creature Report\".[9]\n\nOn July 23, 2016, at San Diego Comic-Con, Hulk's gladiator armor was revealed, along with the first piece of footage, showing Thor's and Hulk's whereabouts.\n\nOn August 4, Mark Ruffalo officially finished shooting his scenes.[10]",
