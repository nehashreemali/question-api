  "content": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (stylized as Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3) is a 2023 superhero film, based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. The film is a sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Endgame, and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. It is the thirty-second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the second installment of Phase Five. The film was released on May 5, 2023.\n\nThe film is written and directed by James Gunn and stars Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Karen Gillan as Nebula, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, featuring Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot, Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket Raccoon, Sean Gunn as Kraglin Obfonteri, Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary, Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, Maria Bakalova as Cosmo the Spacedog, and Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord.\n\nIn Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 our beloved band of misfits are settling into life on Knowhere. But it isn't long before their lives are upended by the echoes of Rocket's turbulent past. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him on a dangerous mission to save Rocket's life—a mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.[1]\n\nWhile the Guardians of the Galaxy restore the outpost on Knowhere, they put a drunken Peter Quill mourning the loss of Gamora to sleep. At that moment, Adam Warlock suddenly attacks the Guardians, who undergo severe injuries when managing to fight him back. The Guardians find Rocket near death when Adam retreats, with Rocket having moments of his past flash before his eyes, meeting Lylla, Teefs and Floor from Batch 89 after being experimented on for the first time.\n\nThe team finds out they can't interact with Rocket, enabling his kill switch, prompting them to find a way to override it and save Rocket by infiltrating OrgoCorp's, Rocket's experimenters, headquarters with help from the Ravagers. Alongside the Ravagers' newest member, Gamora, the Guardians enter the Orgoscope while Adam has returned to the High Evolutionary beside Ayesha, but without Rocket. The High Evolutionary threatens Ayesha to get Rocket back to him before he ends the Sovereign race.\n\nRocket remembers bettering the High Evolutionary's way of perfecting life as Peter, Gamora and Nebula get the pass key while Mantis and Drax get Groot to allow their escape to the Bowie. Seemingly obtaining what they were looking for, an alarm goes off sending Orgosentries toward the team. They thwart them and escape from the Orgoscope.\n\nRocket has a flashback of him and his friends establishing their names and his promise to travel in a spaceship with them while the Guardians view Rocket's experimentation on the file they got, embedding no pass key. They however find that one of the High Evolutionary's recorders, Theel, has this key downloaded in his memory. They set out to find him on Counter-Earth as Ayesha confronts a Ravager, fried by Adam when wanting him to tell Gamora's whereabouts, later following Gamora.\n\nUpon the Guardians' arrival, Rocket is reminded of the High Evolutionary's meltdown concerning Rocket's method being proven to be better. He told Rocket he was never meant to live on Counter-Earth with his friends, who would be shot when Rocket tried to save them, escaping afterwards. With Ayesha's incoming arrival, the Guardians asks a resident's help of finding the recorder, being lead toward the ship ahead. Quill and Groot meet the High Evolutionary and the recorder while War Pig is sent to capture Rocket, though fought by Gamora. The ship begins to lift off as the High Evolutionary blows Counter-Earth up, leading Quill to leap off of it with Theel when Nebula, Drax and Mantis try and save them.\n\nRocket sees a vision of his friends, being invited to join them in time, returning to his friends for now. When Nebula, Drax and Mantis are informed, they are held captive by the High Evolutionary, along with his Star Children, ordering the rest to bring him Rocket. The High Evolutionary's ship is however confronted by the Guardians and Knowhere's cannon. Once the Hell Spawn are released upon the Guardians and Knowhere, and the cannon fires into the laboratory, Drax's, Mantis' and Nebula's cage opens to three Abilisks Mantis manages to control. Adam Warlock, held captive on Quill and Gamora's ship, faces them when Gamora threatens his pet Blurp. They escape the ship with Blurp though, landing upon the laboratory's entrance as the ship self-destructs.\n\nEntering the lab, all Guardians fend off the High Evolutionary's troops. They also free every other captive, leading them to Knowhere. Revisiting his former cage, Rocket finds out he is indeed a raccoon when rescuing a multitude of them. Rocket is soon apprehended by the High Evolutionary, who he fights along with his team members. With the opportunity to end his life, Rocket decides to spare him due to his status as a Guardian of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary would be imprisoned on Knowhere.[2] They have the caged animals hop aboard Knowhere as well, but Quill unfortunately loses his Zune, rushing to retrieve it and try to make it back in time. He slowly drifts in space nonetheless, but was saved by Adam Warlock.\n\nLater, Quill, wanting to spend more time on Earth, Mantis, seeking independence, Drax, raising the Star Children, Nebula, leading Knowhere, and Gamora, returning to the Ravagers, disband from the team, with Rocket now the leader. The new Guardians of the Galaxy, with Warlock, Blurp and Star Child Phyla as new additions, embark on a mission on Krylor.\n\nOn Earth, Quill reunites with his grandfather, Jason Quill, that he has not seen since his kidnapping.
