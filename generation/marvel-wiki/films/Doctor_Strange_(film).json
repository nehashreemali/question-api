  "content": "Doctor Strange is a 2016 superhero film, based on the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name. It is the fourteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the second installment of Phase Three. The film was released on October 25, 2016 internationally and on November 4, 2016 in the United States.\n\nThe film is directed by Scott Derrickson and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange and Dormammu, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo, Rachel McAdams as Christine Palmer, Benedict Wong as Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg as Nic West, Benjamin Bratt as Jonathan Pangborn, Scott Adkins as Lucian Aster, with Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius, and Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One.\n\nA sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, was released on May 6, 2022.\n\nFrom Marvel Studios comes Doctor Strange, the story of the world-famous neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange whose life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his hands. When traditional medicine fails him, he is forced to look for healing, and hope, in an unlikely place - a mysterious enclave known as Kamar-Taj. He quickly learns that this is not just a center for healing but also the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Before long Strange -- armed with newly acquired magical powers - is forced to choose whether to return to his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence.[2]\n\nIn Kathmandu, Nepal, a group of rogue sorcerers infiltrate the Kamar-Taj, an enclave that is known only to the Masters of the Mystic Arts. After beheading the librarian, the group's leader Kaecilius steals a forbidden ritual from a book owned by his former mentor, the Ancient One. As the Zealots escape through a portal to London, the Sorcerer Supreme traps them in a Mirror Dimension that is invisible to the public. She takes down several Zealots but fails to stop Kaecilius and his surviving followers from escaping with the ritual.\n\nElsewhere in New York City, Stephen Strange is an acclaimed doctor and neurosurgeon working at Metro-General Hospital, but is also very arrogant and cares only for the wealth and success his talents bring. One night, as he travels to give a guest talk, he is involved in a car crash after diverting his attention from the road. Although he survives, his hands are badly injured, necessitating the insertion of metal pins into them. As a result, they continuously tremble, leaving Strange barely able to write his name, ending his career. His former lover and co-worker Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange is desperate to heal his injuries and harshly orders her to leave him alone.\n\nAfter months trying experimental surgeries on his hands, using up all his money and resources, Strange seeks out Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously was able to walk again. Pangborn directs Strange to the secret compound Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by another sorcerer under the Ancient One, Karl Mordo. The Ancient One shows Strange her power, revealing the Astral Plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. Strange begs her to teach him, and she eventually agrees despite his arrogance, which reminds her of Kaecilius.\n\nStrange begins his tutelage under the Ancient One and Mordo, and learns from the ancient books in the library which is now protected by the master Wong. It is explained that Earth is protected from other dimensions by a spell formed from three buildings called Sanctums, found in New York City, London, and Hong Kong. The task of the sorcerers is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn chose to forgo this responsibility in favor of channeling energy into walking again; Strange will have to decide between regaining the use of his hands and defending the world.\n\nStrange advances quickly over several months, even secretly reading from the forbidden texts and learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against using such power and breaking the laws of nature, comparing his arrogant yearning for power to that of Kaecilius, who believes that everyone should live as long as the Ancient One after the deaths of his loved ones.\n\nKaecilius and his followers use the stolen pages to begin summoning the powerful Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist and all can live forever. To ensure Dormammu's arrival, Kaecilius and his followers begin targeting the sanctums, firstly destroying the London Sanctum, which accidentally sends Strange from Kamar-Taj to the New York Sanctum. Kaecilius and the Zealots then clash there, where Strange holds them off with the mystical Cloak of Levitation until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive.\n\nStrange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that her long life has come from her own use of Dormammu's power. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One, and escapes to Hong Kong. The Ancient One tells Strange that he too will have to break the rules, to balance out Mordo's steadfast nature, before dying despite the best efforts of Strange and a bewildered Palmer.\n\nStrange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead and the Sanctum destroyed, with the Dark Dimension already engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to turn back time and save Wong, before creating an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment forever. After killing Strange many times to no avail, Dormammu reluctantly agrees to leave Earth if Strange breaks the loop, taking Kaecilius and his Zealots with him, which grants them their immortality, but at a horrific cost.\n\nDisgusted by Strange and the Ancient One's disregard for the consequences of defying nature, Mordo severs all ties to Kamar-Taj and departs on his own. Strange soon returns the Eye, which Wong calls an Infinity Stone, to Kamar-Taj, and then takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies.\n\nMonths later, Strange is visited at the Sanctum by Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to Earth to search for their father Odin. Strange agrees to help on the condition they will return immediately to Asgard. Elsewhere, Mordo visits Pangborn and steals the energy he uses to walk, stating his intention to stop the continued misuse of power by Earth's sorcerers.\n\nKevin Feige only had this to say, \"I think 'Dr. Strange' would kick ass. I think we've done very well at the superhero genre, if you will, this street level superhero aspect of the Marvel Universe. I think with Thor you'll see us cracking into the cosmic side of the Marvel Universe in a very good way that's never been done before in our movies and I'd love to get into that supernatural element. I think that Dr. Strange could be a good way of being the linchpin to that universe with Werewolf By Night, with Blade again someday – that side of the Marvel Universe.\"\n\nIn January 2013, Kevin Feige spoke about characters he considered might be going into development in Phase Three, \"Doctor Strange, which I've been talking about for years, is definitely one of them. He's a great, original character, and he checks the box off this criteria that I have: he's totally different from anything else we have, just like Guardians of the Galaxy.\"\n\nOn June 3, 2014 Scott Derrickson tweeted that his next movie will be Doctor Strange, and that casting directors were looking at Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch for the lead role.\n\nIn September 2014, the film was announced to begin shooting in May 2015 at Pinewood-Shepperton studios in the UK.[5]\n\nOn August 29, 2014, it was announced that Joaquin Phoenix entered final negotiations.[6] On October 1, 2014, it was announced that talks with Phoenix have ended and the studio is actively searching for their lead actor.[7] In December 2014, Deadline reported that Phoenix never had a deal with Marvel Studios.[8]\n\nOn October 27, 2014, it was revealed that Benedict Cumberbatch was in final negotiations to play Doctor Strange.[9] At the end of October, it was announced on the Marvel Event Liveblog it will be released on November 4, 2016.[10] On December 4, 2014, Marvel finalized its deal with Benedict Cumberbatch to portray Stephen Strange.[11]\n\nOn January 22, 2015, it was reported that Marvel was looking to cast Chiwetel Ejiofor in an unspecified role.[12] On June 11, 2015, Chiwetel Ejiofor was cast as Baron Mordo.[13]\n\nOn July 14, 2015, Tilda Swinton was cast as the Ancient One.[14]\n\nOn August 15, 2015, at D23, Kevin Feige confirmed that Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tilda Swinton have joined the cast of Doctor Strange as Karl Mordo and the Ancient One, respectively, while also showing off new concept art for the series that gave fans their first look at the design of star Benedict Cumberbatch's costume.[15]\n\nOn August 27, 2015, Mads Mikkelsen was in early talks to play one of the villians in the film.[16] Marvel officially announced Mikkelsen's role as Kaecilius when they announced that the movie had begun production.",
