  "content": "The Marvels is a 2023 superhero film, based on the Marvel Comics. The film is a sequel to Captain Marvel, Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, and Ms. Marvel, and is set directly after the events of Secret Invasion. It is the thirty-third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the sixth installment of Phase Five. The film released on November 10, 2023.\n\nThe film is directed by Nia DaCosta and stars Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel, Zawe Ashton as Dar-Benn, Park Seo-Joon as Yan, Zenobia Shroff as Muneeba Khan, Mohan Kapur as Yusuf Khan, Saagar Shaikh as Aamir Khan, and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.\n\nIn The Marvels, Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel has reclaimed her identity from the tyrannical Kree and taken revenge on the Supreme Intelligence. But unintended consequences see Carol shouldering the burden of a destabilized universe. When her duties send her to an anomalous wormhole linked to a Kree revolutionary, her powers become entangled with that of Jersey City super-fan Kamala Khan, aka Ms. Marvel, and Carol's estranged niece, now S.A.B.E.R. astronaut Captain Monica Rambeau. Together, this unlikely trio must team up and learn to work in concert to save the universe as \"The Marvels\".[1]\n\nKree Supremor Dar-Benn comes across a Quantum Band, which she equips, and her newfound power creates ripples across the fabric of space, creating a web of interconnected Jump Points that disrupt the essence of interstellar travel. The resulting anomaly affects the entire jump point network, including one near Earth's S.A.B.E.R. Space Station run by Nick Fury. As Monica Rambeau investigates disturbances near the station, Carol Danvers pursues the newly opened Jump Point created by Dar-Benn. Touching their respective jump points, Rambeau finds herself displaced, along with Danvers and Kamala Khan, the owner of the second Quantum Band on Earth who was biding her time in the creation of a story involving her superhero alter-ego Ms. Marvel and Danvers. The trio utilizes their distinct light-based powers to fend off Kree enemies, resulting in the destruction of the Khan family home.\n\nAfter returning to their original places, Fury and Rambeau visit Kamala on Earth. Rambeau theorizes that their light-based powers are connected through quantum entanglement, switching places when any of the three simultaneously use their powers. Danvers, Rambeau and Khan converge at a Skrull refugee colony on Tarnax IV, a planet founded through Danvers' aid, where complex peace negotiations balance on the edge. When negotiations fail, Dar-Benn opens another jump point, siphoning the atmosphere from Tarnax to replenish Hala's air. Danvers, Rambeau, and Khan form a team, dubbed \"the Marvels\" by Khan, after evacuating the colony. They spend time learning to control their switching, eventually coming to master it.\n\nDanvers explains that the Quantum Bands played a significant role in establishing the jump point network, and Dar-Benn, by merging her Quantum Band with the Kree's Universal Weapon, is causing instability in the network. The group realize that Dar-Benn is targeting planets significant to Danvers, holding her responsible for the desolation of Hala. The Marvels reach the water planet Aladna ahead of Dar-Benn, preparing the locals for an impending attack. Dar-Benn arrives and tries to divert the planet's water to Hala, nearly seizing Kamala's Quantum Band. Despite Danvers' insistence that they can stop Dar-Benn, Khan makes them leave, leading to an argument between all three. They make up and realize that Dar-Benn will next be targeting Earth's Sun. The Marvels successfully subdue Dar-Benn, and in her final attempt, she uses both Quantum Bands to create a space rift. This action results in Dar-Benn's destruction, the termination of the Marvels' entanglement, and the formation of a rupture between realities.\n\nFollowing Kamala's successful retrieval of the Bands, she and Danvers seamlessly blend their formidable powers to infuse Rambeau with an unprecedented surge of energy. This newfound strength enables Rambeau to seal the interdimensional rift from the alternate side, stranding herself in the process. As Kamala makes her return to Earth, Danvers soars towards Hala's sun. Employing her powers, Danvers manages to rejuvenate the celestial body. Kamala then began to assemble a new team of young heroes, beginning with Kate Bishop. Rambeau later awakens in an alternate universe, greeted by Binary — a Variant of her mother Maria — and the mutant scientist, Beast.\n\nIn February 2019, before the release of Captain Marvel, Brie Larson expressed her interest in a potential sequel featuring Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel.[7]\n\nOn March 3, 2019, Kevin Feige said that there were some \"pretty amazing\" ideas for a potential sequel to Captain Marvel.[8]\n\nOn July 20, 2019, at San Diego Comic-Con 2019, Kevin Feige announced that many projects, including a Captain Marvel sequel, were in development.[9][10]\n\nOn January 22, 2020, it was reported that Megan McDonnell had been tapped to pen the film's script.
