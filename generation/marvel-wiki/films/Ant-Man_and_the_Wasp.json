  "content": "Ant-Man and the Wasp is a 2018 superhero film, based on the Marvel Comics superheroes of the same names. The film is a sequel to Ant-Man and Captain America: Civil War. It is the twentieth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the eighth installment of Phase Three. The film was released on July 4, 2018, internationally and on July 6, 2018, in the United States.\n\nThe film is directed by Peyton Reed and stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne/Wasp, Michael Peña as Luis, Walton Goggins as Sonny Burch, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr/Ghost, David Dastmalchian as Kurt Goreshter, T.I. as Dave, Judy Greer as Maggie Lang, Bobby Cannavale as Jim Paxton, Randall Park as Jimmy Woo,  Abby Ryder Fortson as Cassie Lang, with Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, with Laurence Fishburne as Bill Foster, and Michael Douglas as Hank Pym.\n\nThe third film in the series, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, was released on February 17, 2023.\n\nFrom the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes a new chapter featuring heroes with the astonishing ability to shrink: Ant-Man and the Wasp. In the aftermath of Captain America: Civil War, Scott Lang grapples with the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father. As he struggles to rebalance his home life with his responsibilities as Ant-Man, he's confronted by Hope van Dyne and Dr. Hank Pym with an urgent new mission. Scott must once again put on the suit and learn to fight alongside The Wasp as the team works together to uncover secrets from their past.[1]\n\nIn 1987, Janet van Dyne shrinks between the molecules of a Soviet nuclear missile, disabling it but permanently entering the microscopic Quantum Realm. Hank Pym raises their daughter Hope believing that Janet is dead.\n\nIn the present day, Scott Lang spends time with his daughter Cassie. Although he was arrested and imprisoned for helping Captain America during a skirmish between the Avengers in violation of the Sokovia Accords, Lang took a plea bargain and was allowed to return to the USA. Lang was sentenced to two years under house arrest, with a twenty-year minimum prison sentence waiting if he leaves his home during his sentence or defies the Sokovia Accords again. As Pym and Hope had provided Lang with the technology he used against the Avengers, the United Nations ruled them to have also breached the Accords. A warrant for their arrest was issued, forcing the two to go on the run while severing all contact with Lang.\n\nDuring his time on house arrest, Lang kept himself busy (including learning close-up magic). He also sets up a security company with his friends Luis, Dave, and Kurt Goreshter to earn an honest income. With just three days left until his release from house arrest, Lang has a dream where he relives one of Janet's memories of when Hope was a child. Despite not wanting to jeopardize his release, Lang contacts Pym on a phone he'd hidden away and leaves a voicemail about the dream, before deciding he sounds like an idiot, going on to apologize for all the trouble he landed on them. Lang smashes the phone.\n\nThat night, as Lang relaxes, he notices something buzzing nearby, before being suddenly knocked out. When he wakes up, Lang finds he has been kidnapped by Hope, who left an enlarged ant as a decoy to avoid suspicion from FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Hope is upset with Lang for using the Ant-Man suit and helping Captain America without telling her, as well as forcing her and her father into hiding. She tells Scott that his dream coincided with Pym briefly opening a quantum tunnel.\n\nSeeing the message as confirmation that Janet is alive, Pym and Hope work in their new lab (which Pym can shrink whenever they need to move) to create a stable tunnel, with the intention that Hope will take a vehicle into the Quantum Realm and retrieve Janet. Lang reunites with Pym, who is also very bitter toward Scott for his actions. However, Pym sets his grudge aside as he and Hope decide Lang is their only hope of locating Janet's coordinates in the Quantum Realm.\n\nHope arranges to buy a part needed for the tunnel from the black market dealer Sonny Burch, however, Burch has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym and Hope's research and double-crosses them. Hope then reveals she has a shrinking suit of her own, one which can fly and has blasters, and uses it to fight Burch and his men off and retrieve the part. Before Hope can leave, however, she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman, referred to as the Ghost. Lang tries to help fight off the Ghost with a prototype suit and they keep hold of the part, but Ghost escapes with Pym's portable lab.\n\nLang announces that he can get them some help. Pym argues with Lang, but eventually agrees to meet with X-Con Security Consultants. After talking, they decide to ask Pym's former partner, Bill Foster, for help in locating the lab. They go to University of California, Berkeley to meet with the Professor. He argues with his former partner about their differences that eventually led to them splitting up. Meanwhile, Woo gets a lead on Pym and arrives at the college. Foster tells them that if they modify the diffraction units on one of their regulators, they can maybe locate the lab. They thank him and quickly leave before Woo meets with Foster, who tells them he hasn't talked to Pym in years.\n\nIn the van, an annoyed Pym says that he got rid of the regulators with the new suit. Lang realizes that he still has his old suit that does have a regulator. They call Luis who tells them that the trophy it is being kept in isn't at the house. Lang remembers that Cassie Lang took it to school that day for show and tell. Ant-Man and the Wasp break into the school and grab the suit. However, Ant-Man's prototype suit glitches, causing him to unwillingly change size. They escape before it gets worse.\n\nAfter locating the lab, the trio finds it in the middle of a forest and breaks in. Ghost restrains Lang, Hope, and Pym when they arrive, and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. She tells them about how her father, Elihas Starr, accidentally killed himself and his wife during a quantum experiment that caused Starr's unstable state. Foster reveals that he has been helping Ava after the accident, who they plan to cure using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet in the Quantum Realm, Pym refuses to help them and the trio manage to escape by staging a fake heart attack with Pym.\n\nPym and Hope contact Janet with the tunnel fitted with the new part. She talks with them through Lang because of their quantum entanglement. She gives them a precise location to find her, but warns that they only have two hours to find her. At X-Con Security Consultants Office, Burch enters and uses a truth serum to get information from Luis then informs a contact at the FBI. However, as they go to leave, Ghost enters having heard the location of Lang. Luis warns Lang, who then confesses to Hope and Pym, which angers them and prompts them to sever ties with him again. Lang is forced to rush home to save his house arrest. This leaves Pym and Hope to be arrested, and for their lab to be taken by Stoltz. However, he is found and killed by Ghost, who then takes the lab. Back at home, Lang is convinced by Cassie to rescue Hope and Pym despite the risks, promising that she'll love him no matter what happens.\n\nLang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody. They meet with Luis at the Pier and discuss a plan. They decide to have Pym dive into the quantum realm to get Janet. They will then shrink the lab and take it away from the enemy before they enlarge it in a secure location to get Janet and Pym home safe. They then wait for Ghost and Foster to activate the lab causing it to enlarge to where they can find the location. Lang and Hope distract Starr while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, but end up fighting Burch and his men allowing Starr to begin the process of taking Janet's energy. A car chase ensues across the streets of San Francisco, ending at Pier 39. Lang takes the lab and enlarges it, while Burch and his goons are apprehended.\n\nPym finally encounters Janet in the Quantum Realm, and they arrive safely from the Quantum Tunnel. Ava attempts to sabotage their return, but when Lang and Hope intervene, she is stopped. Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to stabilize her condition. Lang returns home once again, in time for a suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. He then happily reunites with Cassie, while Hank restores the family home (which he had shrunk and was hiding) on the beach for him and Janet.\n\nLang ventures into the Quantum Realm to collect particles to help heal Starr, while monitored by Pym, Janet, and Hope. Although he is successful in harvesting the particles, Hope's countdown to bring him back suddenly cuts out. It is revealed that, as a result of Thanos's Snap, Pym, Janet, and Hope have all been turned to ash, leaving Lang trapped in the Quantum Realm. In a post-credits scene, an oversized ant plays the drum kit in Lang's house while the television is broadcasting a state of emergency.\n\nIn January 2017, it was revealed the production of the movie would start in June 2017 in Atlanta while Avengers: Infinity War was filming.[2] However, in February 2017, Michael Douglas announced the film will start shooting in July 2017.[3]\n\nOn August 1, 2017, the production of the movie officially began.[4]\n\nOn September 11, 2017, the production of the movie was temporarily shut down because of Hurricane Irma.[5][6]\n\nOn March 30, 2018, a session of extensive reshoots started in Los Angeles, in order to change the intro sequence of the movie that was set in South America, since the scene did not play well with the first test audience.[7]",
