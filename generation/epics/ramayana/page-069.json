That host, with speed,\n Quadruple, as the king decreed,\n With priests to head the bright array,\n Followed the monarch on his way.\n Four days they travelled on the road,\n And eve Videha's kingdom showed.\n Janak had left his royal seat\n The venerable king to greet,\n And, noblest, with these words addressed\n That noblest lord, his happy guest:\n 'Hail, best of kings: a blessed fate\n Has led thee, Monarch, to my state.\n Thy sons, supreme in high emprise,\n Will gladden now their father's eyes.\n And high my fate, that hither leads\n Vas'ishtha, bright with holy deeds,\n Girt with these sages far-renowned,\n Like Indra with the Gods around.\n Joy! joy! for vanquished are my foes:\n Joy! for my house in glory grows,\n With Raghu's noblest sons allied,\n Supreme in strength and valour's pride.\n To-morrow with its early light\n Will shine on my completed rite.\n Then, sanctioned by the saints and thee,\n The marriage of thy Ráma see.'\n \n \n Then Das'aratha, best of those\n Whose speech in graceful order flows,\n With gathered saints on every side,\n Thus to the lord of earth replied:\n 'A truth is this I long have known,\n A favour is the giver's own.\n What thou shalt bid, O good and true,\n We, as our power permits, will do.'\n \n \n That answer of the truthful lord,\n With virtuous worth and honour stored,\n Janak, Videha's noble king,\n Heard gladly, greatly marvelling.\n With bosoms filled with pleasure met\n Long-parted saint and anchoret,\n And linked in friendship's tie they spent\n The peaceful night in great content.\n \n \n Ráma and Lakshman thither sped,\n By sainted Vis'vámitra led,\n And bent in filial love to greet\n Their father, and embraced his feet.\n The aged king, rejoiced to hear\n And see again his children dear,\n Honoured by Janak's thoughtful care,\n With great enjoyment rested there.\n King Janak, with attentive heed,\n Consulted first his daughters' need,\n And ordered all to speed the rite;\n Then rested also for the night.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXX.: The Maidens Sought.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LXVIII.: The Envoys' Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LXX.: The Maidens Sought. »",
