Dadhimukh escapes\n from the infuriated monkeys and\n hastens to Sugríva to report their misconduct.\n Sugríva infers that Hanumán and\n his band have been successful in their\n search, and that the exuberance of spirits\n and the mischief complained of, are but\n the natural expression of their joy. Dadhimukh\n obtains little sympathy from\n Sugríva, and is told to return and send\n the monkeys on with all possible speed.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXVI.: Ráma's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto LXI.: The Feast of Honey.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto LXVI.: R&aacute;ma's Speech. »",
