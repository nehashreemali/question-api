Instead of\n advancing the story it goes back to Canto\n XVII. containing a lamentation of Sítá\n after Rávan has left her, and describes the\n the auspicious signs sent to cheer her, the\n throbbing of her left eye, arm, and side.\n The Canto is found in the Bengal recension.\n Gorresio translates it. and observes:\n \"I think that Chapter XXVIII.--The\n Auspicious Signs--is an addition, a later\n interpolation by the Rhapsodists. It has\n no bond of connexion either with what\n precedes or follows it, and may be struck\n out not only without injury to, but positively\n to the advantage of the poem. The\n metre in which this chapter is written\n differs from that which is generally adopted\n in the course of the poem.'\n 411:1b  The guards are still in the grove, but\n they are asleep; and Sítá has crept to a\n tree at some distance from them.\n 411:2b  \"As the reason assigned in these passages\n for not addressing Sítá in Sanskrit\n such as a Bráhman would use is not that\n she would not understand it, but that it\n would alarm her and be unsuitable to the\n speaker, we must take them as indicating\n that Sanskrit, if not spoken by women of\n the upper classes at the time when the\n Rámáyana was written (whenever that\n may have been), was at least understood\n by them, and was commonly spoken by\n men of the priestly class, and other educated\n persons, By the Sanskrit proper to p. 412\n an [ordinary\n \n \n Next: Canto XXXI.: Hanumán's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto XXVII.: Trijat&aacute;'s Dream.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto XXXI.: Hanum&aacute;n's Speech. »",
