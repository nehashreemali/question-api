and all\n Upon the plain in *numbers *made,(?)\n Impetuous warriors, stood arrayed.\n \n \n \n \n p. 363\n \n \n Red at the sight flashed Lakshman's eyes,\n His bosom heaved tumultuous sighs,\n And forth the fire of fury broke\n Like flame that flashes through the smoke.\n Like some fierce snake the hero stood:\n His bow recalled the expanded hood,\n And in his shaft-head bright and keen\n The flickering of its tongue was seen:\n And in his own all-conquering might\n The venom of its deadly bite.\n Prince Angad marked his angry look,\n And every hope his heart forsook.\n Then, his large eyes with fury red,\n To Angad Lakshman turned and said:\n     'Go tell the king that Lakshman waits\n For audience at the city gates,\n Whose heart, O tamer of thy foes,\n Is heavy with his brother's woes.\n Bid him to Ráma's word attend,\n And ask if he will aid his friend.\n Go, let the king my message learn:\n Then hither with all speed return.'\n     Prince Angad heard and wild with grief\n Cried as he looked upon the chief:\n ''Tis Lakshman's self: impelled by ire\n He seeks the city of my sire.'\n At the fierce words and furious look\n Of Raghu'a son he quailed and shook,\n Back through the city gates he sped,\n And, laden with the tale of dread,\n Sought King Sugríva, filled his ears\n And Rumá's with his doubts and fears.\n To Rumá and the king he bent,\n And clasped their feet most reverent,\n Clasped the dear feet of Tárá, too,\n And told the startling tale anew.\n     But King Sugríva's ear was dulled,\n By love and wine and languor lulled,\n Nor did the words that Angad spake\n The slumberer from his trance awake.\n But soon as Raghu's son came nigh\n The startled Vánars raised a cry,\n And strove to win his grace, while dread\n Each anxious heart disquieted.\n They saw, and, as they gathered round,\n Rose from the mighty throng a sound\n Like torrents when they downward dash,\n Or thunder with the lightning's flash.\n The shouting of the Vánars broke\n Sugriva's slumber, and he woke:\n Still with the wine his eyes were red,\n His neck with flowers was garlanded.\n Roused at the voice of Angad came\n Two Vánar lords of rank and fame;\n One Yaksha, one Prabhava hight,-\n Wise counsellors of gain and right.\n They came and raised their voices high,\n And told that Raghu's son was nigh:\n 'Two brothers steadfast in their truth,\n Each glorious in the bloom of youth,\n Worthy of rule, have left the skies,\n \n \n And clothed their forms in men's disguise.\n One at thy gates, in warlike hands\n Holding his mighty weapon, stands.\n His message is the charioteer\n That brings the eager envoy near,\n Urged onward by his bold intent,\n And by the hest of Ráma sent. 1\n The gathered Vánars saw and fled,\n And raised aloud their cry of dread.\n Son of Queen Tárá, Angad ran\n To parley with the godlike man.\n Still fiery-eyed with rage and hate\n Stands Lakshman at the city gate,\n And trembling Vanars scarce can fly\n Scathed by the lightning of his eye.\n Go with thy son, thy kith and kin,\n The favour of the prince to win,\n And bow thy reverent head that so\n His fiery wrath may cease to glow.\n What righteous Ráma bids thee, do,\n And to thy plighted word be true.'\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 362:1  The rainbow.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXXII.: Hanuman's Counsel.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto XXX.: R&aacute;ma's Lament.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto XXXII.: Hanuman's Counsel. »",
