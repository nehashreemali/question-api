O chiefs, remain.\n Watch Ráma there with keenest eye,\n And all his deeds and movements spy.\n Go forth, no helping art neglect,\n Be brave and prompt and circumspect,\n And be your one endeavour still\n To aid mine arm this foe to kill.\n Oft have I seen your warrior might\n Proved in the forehead of the fight,\n And sure of strength I know so well\n Send you in Janasthán to dwell.'\n     The giants heard with prompt assent\n         The pleasant words he said,\n     And each before his master bent\n         For meet salute, his head.\n     Then as he bade, without delay,\n         From Lanká's gate they passed,\n     And hurried forward on their way\n         Invisible and fast.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LV.: Sítá In Prison.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto LIII.: Sit&aacute;'s Threats.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto LV.: S&iacute;t&aacute; In Prison. »",
