let not Ráma wait,\n But speed, the sage to venerate.'\n     Then with the pupil Lakshman went\n Across the hermit settlement,\n And showed him Ráma where he stood\n With Janak's daughter in the wood.\n The pupil then his message spake\n Which the kind hermit bade him take;\n Then led the honoured Ráma thence\n And brought him in with reverence.\n As nigh the royal Ráma came\n With Lakshman and the Maithil dame,\n He viewed the herds of gentle deer\n Roaming the garden free from fear.\n As through the sacred grove he trod\n He viewed the seat of many a God,\n Brahmá and Agni,  1 Sun and Moon,\n And His who sends each golden boon;  2\n Here Vishnu's stood, there Bhaga's  3 shrine,\n And there Mahendra's Lord divine;\n Here His who formed this earthly frame, 4\n His there from whom all beings came.  5\n Váyu's, 6 and His who loves to hold\n The great noose, Varim  7 mighty-souled:\n Here was the Vasus' 8 shrine to see,\n Here that of sacred Gáyatrí, 9\n The king of serpents  10 here had place,\n And he who rules the feathered race.  11\n Here Kártikeya,  12 warrior lord,\n And there was Justice' King adored.\n Then with disciples girt about\n The mighty saint himself came out:\n Through fierce devotion bright as flame\n Before the rest the Master came:\n And then to Lakshman, fortune blest,\n Ráma these hasty words addressed:\n 'Behold, Agastya's self draws near,\n The mighty saint, whom all revere:\n With spirit raised I meet my lord\n With richest wealth of penance stored.'\n     The strong-armed hero spake, and ran\n Forward to meet the sunbright man.\n Before him, as he came, he bent\n And clasped his feet most reverent,\n Then rearing up his stately height\n Stood suppliant by the anchorite,\n While Lakshman's strength and Sítá's grace\n Stood by the pride of Raghu's race.\n \n \n \n \n p. 244\n \n \n The sage his arms round Rama threw\n And welcomed him with honours due,\n Asked, was all well, with question sweet.\n And bade the hero to a seat.\n With holy oil he fed the flame,\n He brought the gifts which strangers claim,\n And kindly waiting on the three\n With honours due to high degree,\n He gave with hospitable care\n A simple hermit's woodland fare.\n Then sat the reverend father, first\n Of hermits, deep in duty versed.\n And thus to suppliant Ráma, bred\n In all the lore of virtue, said:\n 'Did the false hermit, Prince, neglect\n To hail his guest with due respect,\n He must,--the doom the perjured meet,--\n His proper flesh hereafter eat.\n A car-borne king a lord who sways\n The earth, and virtue's law obeys,\n Worthy of highest honour, thou\n Hast sought, dear guest, my cottage now.'\n He spoke: with fruit and hermit fare,\n With every bloom the branches bare,\n Agastya graceed his honoured guest,\n And thus with gentle words addressed:\n 'Accept this mighty bow, divine.\n Whereon red gold and diamonds shine;\n 'Twas by the Heavenly Artist planned\n For Vishnu's own almighty hand:\n This God-sent shaft of sunbright hue,\n Whose deadly flight is ever true,\n By Lord Mahendra given of yore:\n This quiver with its endless store.\n Keen arrows hurtling to their aim\n Like kindled fires that flash and flame:\n Accept, in golden sheath encased,\n This sword with hilt of rich gold graced.\n Armed, whilom, with this best of bows\n Lord Vishnu slew his demon foes,\n And mid the dwellers in the skies\n Won brilliant glory for his prize.\n The bow, the quivers, shaft, and sword\n Received from me, O glorious lord:\n These conquest to thine arm shall bring,\n As thunder to the thunder's King.'\n     The splendid hermit bade him take\n The noble weapons as he spake,\n And as the prince accepted each\n In words like these renewed his speech:\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 243:1   The God of fire.\n 243:2  Kuera, the God of riches.\n 243:3  The Sun.\n 243:4  Brahma, the creator.\n 243:5  Siva.\n 243:6  The Wind-God.\n 243:7  The God of the sea.\n 243:8  A class of demi-gods, eight in number.\n 243:9  The holiest text of the Vedas, deified.\n 243:10  Vásaki\n 243:11  Garnd *\n 243:12   The War-God.\n \n \n Next: Canto XIII.: Agastya's Counsel.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XI.: Agastya.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XIII.: Agastya's Counsel. »",
