How\n Can less than these be bright as thou?\n But never nymph or heavenly maid\n Or Goddess haunts this gloomy shade.\n Here giants roam, a savage race;\n What led thee to so dire a place?\n Here monkeys leap from tree to tree,\n And bears and tigers wander free;\n Here ravening lions prowl, and fell\n Hyenas in the thickets yell,\n And elephants infuriate roam,\n Mighty and fierce, their woodland home.\n Dost thou not dread, so soft and fair,\n Tiger and lion, wolf and bear?\n Hast thou, O beauteous dame, no fear\n In the wild wood so lone and drear?\n Whose and who art thou? whence and why\n Sweet lady, with no guardian nigh,\n Dost thou this awful forest tread\n By giant bands inhabited?'\n     The praise the high-souled Rávan spoke\n No doubt within her bosom woke. '\n His saintly look and Bráhman guise\n Deceived the lady's trusting eyes.\n With due attention on the guest\n Her hospitable rites she pressed.\n She bade the stranger to a seat,\n And gave him water for his feet.\n The bowl and water-pot he bare,\n And garb which wandering Bráhmans wear\n     Forbade a doubt to rise.\n Won by his holy look she deemed\n The stranger even as he seemed\n     To her deluded eyes.\n Intent on hospitable care,\n She brought her best of woodland fare.\n     And showed her guest a seat.\n She bade the saintly stranger lave\n His feet in water which she gave,\n     And sit and rest and eat.\n He kept his eager glances bent\n On her so kindly eloquent,\n Wife of the noblest king;\n And longed in heart to steal her thence,\n Preparing by the dire offence,\n Death on his head to bring.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 284\n \n \n The lady watched with anxious face\n For Ráma coming from the chase\n     With Lakshman by his side:\n But nothing met her wandering glance\n Save the wild forest's green expanse\n     Extending far aud wide.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 282:1  The favourite wife of the Moon.\n 283:1  The planet Saturn.\n 283:2  Another favourite of the Moon; one\n of the lunar mansions.\n 283:1b  The Rudras, agents in creation, are\n eight in number; they sprang from the\n forehead of Brahmá.\n 283:2b  Maruts, the attendants of Indra.\n 283:3b  Radiant demi-gods.\n \n \n Next: Canto XLVII: Rávan's Wooing.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XLV.: Lakshman's Departure.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XLVII: R&aacute;van's Wooing. »",
