which no fear could stay:\n But her dear lord was far away\n Then rose the fiend, and toward the skies\n Bore his poor helpless struggling prize:\n \n \n \n \n Hurrying through the air above\n The dame who loathed his proffered love\n So might a soaring eagle bear\n A serpent's consort through the air.\n As on he bore her through the sky\n She shrieked aloud her bitter cry.\n As when some wretch's lips complain\n In agony of maddening pain;\n 'O Lakshman, thou whose joy is still\n To do thine eider brother's will,\n This fiend, who all disguises wears,\n From Ráma's side his darling tears.\n Thou who couldst leave bliss, fortune, all,\n Yea life itselt at duty's call,\n Dost thou not see this outrage done\n To hapless me, O Raghu's son?\n 'Tis thine, O victor of the foe,\n To bring the haughtiest spirit low,\n How canst thou such an outrage see\n And let the guilty fiend go free?\n Ah, seldom in a moment's time\n Comes bitter fruit of sin and crime,\n But in the day of harvest pain\n Comes like the ripening of the grain.\n So thou whom fate and folly lead\n To ruin for this guilty deed,\n Shalt die by Ráma's arm ere long\n A dreadful death for hideous wrong.\n Ah, too successful in their ends\n Are Queen Kaikeyí and her friends,\n When virtuous Ráma, dear to fame,\n Is mourning for his ravished dame.\n Ah me, ah me! a long farewell\n To lawn and glade and forest dell\n In Janasthán's wild region, where\n The Cassia trees are bright and fair\n With all your tongues to Ráma say\n That Rávan bears his wife away.\n Farewell, a long farewell to thee,\n O pleasant stream Godávari,\n Whose rippling waves are ever stirred\n By many a glad wild water bird!\n All ye to Ráma's ear relate\n The giant's deed and Sítá's fata.\n O all ye Gods who love this ground\n Where trees of every leaf abound,\n Tell Ráma I am stolen hence,\n I pray you all with reverence.\n On all the living things beside\n That these dark boughs and coverts hide,\n Ye flocks of birds ye troops of deer,\n I call on you my prayer to hear.\n All we to Ráma's ear proclaim\n That Rávan tears away his dame\n Witn forceful arms--his darling wife,\n Dearer to Ráma than his life.\n O, if he knew I dwelt in hell,\n My mighty lord, I know full well,\n Would bring me, conqueror, back to-day,\n Though Yama's self reclaimed his prey.'\n Thus from the air the lady sent\n \n \n p. 288\n \n \n With piteous voice her last lament,\n And as she wept she chanced to see\n The vulture on a lofty tree.\n As Rávan bore her swiftly by,\n On the dear bird she bent her eye,\n And with a voice which woe made faint\n Renewed to him her wild complaint:\n 'O see, the king who rules the race\n Of giants, cruel, fierce and base,\n Rávan the spoiler bears me hence\n The helpless prey of violence.\n This fiend who roves in midnight shade\n By thee, dear bird, can ne'er be stayed,\n For he is armed and fierce and strong\n Triumphant in the power to wrong.\n For thee remains one only task,\n To do, kind friend, the thing I ask.\n To Ráma's ear by thee be borne\n How Sítá from her home is torn,\n And to the valiant Lakshman tell\n The giant's deed and what befell.'\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 287:1  Mercury: to be carefully distinguished\n hum Buddha.\n \n \n Next: Canto L.: Jatáyus.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XLVIII: R&aacute;van's Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto L.: Jat&aacute;yus. »",
