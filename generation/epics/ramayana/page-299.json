My lord!\n While wood and hill and valley sent\n In echoes back the shrill lament.\n Then on a low and sandy isle\n Was reared the hero's funeral pile\n By crowds of toiling Vánars, where\n The mountain stream ran fresh and fair.\n The Vánar chiefs, a noble band,\n Had laid the litter on the sand,\n And stood a little space apart,\n Each mourning in his inmost heart.\n But Tára, when her weeping eye\n Saw Báli, on the litter lie,\n Laid his dear head upon her lap,\n And wailed aloud her dire mishap;\n 'O mighty Vánar, lord and king,\n To whose fond breast brave, and bold,\n Rise, look upon me as of old.\n Rise up, my sovereign, dost thou see\n A crowd of subjects weep for thee?\n Still o'er thy face, though breath has fled.\n The joyous light of life is spread:\n Thus around the sun, although he set,\n A crimson glory lingers yet.\n Death clad in Ráma's form to-day\n Hast dragged thee from the world away.\n One shaft from his tremendous bow\n Dooms us to widowhood and woe.\n Hast thou, O Vánar King, no eyes\n Thy weeping wives to recognize,\n Who for the length of way unmeet\n Have followed thee with weary feet?\n Yet every moon-faced beauty here\n By thee, O King was counted dear.\n Lord of the Vánar race, hast thou\n No eyes to see Sugríva now?\n About thee stands in mournful mood\n A sore-afflicted multitude,\n And Tára and thy lords of state\n Around their monarch weep and wait,\n Arise my lord, with gentle speech,\n As was thy wont, dismissing each,\n Then in the forest will we play\n And love shall make our spirits gay.'\n     The Vánar dames raised Tára, drowned\n In floods of sorrow, from the ground;\n And Angad with Sugríva's aid,\n O'erwhelmed with anguish and dismayed,\n Weeping for his departed sire,\n Placed Bali's body on the pyre:\n Then lit the flame, and round the dead\n Paced slowly with a mourner's tread.\n Thus with full rites the funeral train.\n Performed the service for the slain,\n Then sought the flowing stream and made\n Libations to the parted shade.\n There, setting Angad first in place,\n The chieftains of the Vanar race,\n With Tára and Sugríva, shed\n The water that delights the dead.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 354:1  The Vánar chief, not to be confounded\n with Tárá.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXVI.: The Coronation.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto XXIV.: Sugr&iacute;va's Lament.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto XXVI.: The Coronation. »",
