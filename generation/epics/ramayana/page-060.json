The seven other new saints\n which are here said to have been created\n by Vis'vámitra, should be seven new southern\n stars, a sort of new Ursa. Von Schlegel\n thinks that this mythical fiction of new\n stars created by Vis'vámitra may signify\n that these southern stars, unknown to the\n Indians as long as they remained in the\n neighbourhood of the Ganges, became\n known to them at a later date when they\n colonized the southern regions of Indra.'\n GORRESIO.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXI: S'unahs'epha.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LIX.: The Sons of Vas'ishtha.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LXI: S'unahs'epha. »",
