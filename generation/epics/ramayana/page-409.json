It is said to deceive\n and attract the bees, and is regarded as a\n sign of health and masculine vigour.\n \n \n Next: Canto XI.: The Summons.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto IX.: Vibh&iacute;shan's Counsel.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto XI.: The Summons. »",
