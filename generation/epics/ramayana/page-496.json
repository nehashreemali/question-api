The car\n descends, and the Vánar matrons are added\n to the party. The Bengal recension\n ignores this palpable interruption.\n \n \n Next: Canto CXXVI.: Bharat Consoled.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto CXXIV.: The Departure.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto CXXVI.: Bharat Consoled. »",
