The Gods, content,\n Back to their heavenly mansions went.\n And Vis'vamitra, pious-souled,\n Among the Bráhman saints enrolled,\n On reverend Vas'ishtha pressed\n The honours due to holy guest.\n Successful in his high pursuit,\n The sage, in penance resolute,\n Walked in his pilgrim wanderings o'er\n The whole broad land from shore to shore.\n 'Twas thus the saint, O Raghu's son,\n His rank among the Bráhmans won.\n Best of all hermits, Prince, is he;\n In him incarnate Penance see.\n Friend of the right, who shrinks from ill,\n Heroic powers attend him still.'\n \n \n The Bráhman, versed in ancient lore,\n Thus closed his tale, and said no more,\n To S'atánanda Kus'ik's son\n Cried in delight, Well done! well done!\n Then Janak, at the tale amazed,\n Spoke thus with suppliant hands upraised:\n 'High fate is mine, O Sage, I deem,\n And thanks I owe for bliss supreme,\n That thou and Raghu's children too\n Have come my sacrifice to view.\n To look on thee with blessed eyes\n Exalts my soul and purifies.\n Yea, thus to see thee face to face\n Enriches me with store of grace.\n Thy holy labours wrought of old,\n And mighty penance, fully told,\n Ráma and I with great delight\n Have heard, O glorious Anchorite.\n Unrivalled thine ascetic deeds:\n Thy might, O Saint, all might exceeds.\n No thought may scan, no limit bound\n The virtues that in thee are found.\n The story of thy wondrous fate\n My thirsty ears can never sate.\n The hour of evening rites is near:\n The sun declines in swift career.\n At early dawn, O Hermit, deign\n To let me see thy face again.\n Best of ascetics, part in bliss:\n Do thou thy servant now dismiss.'\n \n \n The saint approved, and glad and kind\n Dismissed the king with joyful mind\n Around the sage King Janak went\n With priests and kinsmen reverent.\n Then Vis'vámitra, honoured so,\n By those high-minded, rose to go,\n And with the princes took his way\n To seek the lodging where they lay.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXVI.: Janak's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LXIV.: Rambh&aacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LXVI.: Janak's Speech. »",
