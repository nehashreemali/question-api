Canto LVI.\n 408:2b  Prajápatis are the ten lords of created\n beings first created by Brahmá; somewhat\n like the Demiurgi of the Gnostics.\n 408:3b  \"This is the number of the Vedic\n divinities mentioned in the Rig-veda. In p. 409\n Ashtaka I. Súkta XXXIV. the Rishi\n Hiranyastúpa invoking the As'vins says:\n À Násatyá tribhirekádasair iha devebniryátam:\n \"O Násatyas (As'vins) come hither\n with the thrice eleven Gods,\" And in\n Súkta XLV. the Rishi Praskanva addressing\n his hymn to Agni (ignis, fire),\n thus invokes him: \"Lord of the red\n steeds, propitiated by our prayers lead\n hither the thirty-three Gods.\" This number\n must certainly have been the actual\n number in the early days of the Vedic\n religion: although it appears probable\n enough that the thirty-three Vedic divinities\n could not then be found co-ordinated\n in so systematic a way as they were arranged\n more recently by the authors of\n the Upanishads. In the later ages of\n Bramanism the number went on increasing\n without measure by successive mythical\n and religious creations which peopled\n the Indian Olympus with abstract beings\n of every kind. But through lasting veneration\n of the word of tha Veda the custom\n regained of giving the name of \"the\n thirty-three Gods\" to the immense phalanx\n of the multiplied deities.\" GORRESIO.\n 409:1  Serpent-Gods who dwell in the regions\n under the earth.\n 409:2  In the mythology of the epics the\n Gandharvas are the heavenly singers or\n musicians who form the orchestra at the\n banquets of the Gods, and they belong to\n the heaven of India in whose battles they\n share.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXIV.: Sítá's Reply.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto XXII.: R&aacute;van's Threat.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto XXIV.: S&iacute;t&aacute;'s Reply. »",
