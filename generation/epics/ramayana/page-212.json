but all the rest\n Refused to hear their lord's behest.\n First Aditi conceived, and she,\n Mother of thirty Gods and three,\n The Vasus and A'dityas bare,\n Kudras, and A'svins, heavenly pair.\n Of Diti sprang the Daityas: fame\n Delights to laud their ancient name.\n In days of yore their empire dread\n O'er earth and woods and ocean spread.\n Danú was mother of a child,\n O hero, As'vagríva styled,\n And Narak next and Kálak came\n Of Kálaká, celestial dame.\n Of Támrá, too, five daughters bright\n In deathless glory sprang to light.\n Ennobling fame still keeps alive\n The titles of the lovely five:\n Immortal honour still she claims\n For Kraunchí, Bhasí, S'yení's names.\n And wills not that the world forget\n S'ukí or Dhritaráshtrí yet.\n Then Kraunchí bare the crane and owl,\n And Bhásí tribes of water fowl:\n Vultures and hawks that race through air\n With storm-fleet pinions S'yení bare.\n All swans and geese on mere and brook\n Their birth from Dhritaráshtrí took,\n And all the river-haunting brood\n Of ducks, a countless multitude.\n From S'ukí Nalá sprang, who bare\n Dame Vinatá surpassing fair.\n From fiery Krodhavas'á, ten\n Bright daughters sprang, O King of men:\n Mrigí and Mrigamadá named,\n Hari and Bhadiamadá famed,\n S'árdúlí, S'vetá fair to see,\n Mátangi bright, and Surabhi,\n Surasá marked with each fair sign,\n And Kadrumá, all maids divine.\n Mrigí, O prince without a peer,\n Was mother of the herds of deer,\n The bear, the yak, the mountain roe\n Their birth to Mrigamandá owe;\n And Bhadramadá joyed to be\n Mother of fair Irávatí,\n Who bare Airávat,  1 huge of mould,\n Mid warders of the earth enrolled,\n From Harí lordly lions trace,\n With monkeys of the wild, their race.\n From the great dame S'árdúlí styled\n Sprung pards, Lángúrs, 2 and tigers wild.\n Mátangi, Prince, gave birth to all\n Mátangas, elephants strong and tall,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n And S'vet'a bore the beasts who stand\n One at each wind, earth's warder band.  1b\n Next Surabhí the Goddess bore\n Two heavenly maids, O Prince, of yore,\n Gandharvi--dear *as fa??* is she--\n And her sweet sister Rohiní.\n With kine this daughter filled each mead,\n And bright Gandharví bore the steed.  2b\n Surasá bore the serpents:  3b all\n The snakes Kadrú their mother call.\n Then Manu, high-souled Kas'yap's  4b wife,\n To all the race of men gave life,\n The Bráhmans first, the Kshatriya caste,\n Then Vais'yas, and the S'údras last.\n Sprang from her mouth the Brahman race;\n Her chest the Kshatriyas' natal place:\n The Vais'yas from her thighs,'tis said,\n The S'údras from her feet were bred.\n From Analá all trees that hang\n Their fair fruit-laden branches sprang.\n The child of beauteous S'ukí bore\n Vinatá, as I taught before:\n And Surasá and Kadrú were\n Born of one dame, a noble pair.\n Kadrú gave birth to countless snakes\n That roam the earth in woods and brakes.\n Arun and Garud swift of flight\n By V'inatá were given to light,\n And sons' of Arun red as morn\n Sampati first, then I was born,\n Me then, O tamer of the toe,\n Jutáyus, son of S'yení, know.\n Thy ready helper will I be,\n And guard thy house, if thou agree:\n When thou and Lakshman urge the chase\n By Sítá's side shall be my place.'\n     With courteous thanks for promised aid,\n         The prince, to rapture stirred,\n     Bent low, and due obeisance paid,\n         Embraced the royal bird.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 247\n \n \n He often in the days gone by\n     Had heard his father tell\n How, linked with him in friendship's tie,\n     He loved Jatáyus well.\n He hastened to his trusted friend\n     His darling to confide,\n And through the wood his steps to bend\n     By strong Jatáyus' side.\n On to the grove, with Lakshman near,\n     The prince his way pursued\n To free those pleasant shades from fear\n     And slay the giant brood.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 245:1  The Madhúka, or, as it is now called,\n Mahuwá, is the Bassia latifolia, a tree\n from whose blossoms a spirit is extracted.\n 245:1b  'I should have doubted whether Manu\n could have been the right reading here,\n but that it occurs again in verse 29, where\n it is in like manner followed in verse 31\n by Analá, so that it would certainly seem\n that the name Manu is intended to stand\n for a female, the daughter of Daksha.\n The Gauda recension, followed by Signor\n Gorresio (III 20, 12), adopts an entirely\n different reading at the end of the line,\n viz.  Balám Atibalám api, \"Balá and\n Atibilá,\" instead of Manu and Analá.\n I see that Professor Roth s.v. adduces the\n authority of the Amara Kosha and of the\n Commentator on Pánini for stating that\n the word sometimes means \"the wife of\n Manu.\" In the following text of the\n Mahábhárata I. 2553. also, Manu appears\n to be the name of a female: Anaradyam,\n Manum, Vansám, Asurám, Márganapriyám,\n Anúpám, Subhagdm, Bhásím iti\n Prádhá vyajayata. \"Prádhá (daughter\n of Daksha) bore Anavadyá, Manu, Vans'á,\n Márganaprivá, Anúpá, Subhagá. and\n Bhásí.\"' Muir's  Sanskrit Text, Vol. I. p.\n 116.\n 246:1  The elephant of Indra.\n 246:2  Golingúlas, described as a kind of\n monkey, of a black colour, and having a\n tail like a cow.\n 246:1b  Eight elephants attached to the four\n quarters and intermediate points of the\n compass, to support and guard the earth.\n 246:2b  Some scholars identify the centaurs\n with the Gandharvas.\n 246:3b  The hooded serpents, says the commentator\n Tírtha, were the offspring of\n Surasá: all others of Kadrú.\n 246:4b  The text reads Kás'yapa, \"a descendant\n of Kas'yapa,\" who according to Rám.\n II. l0, 6, ought to be Vivasvat. But as it\n is stated in the preceding part of this\n passage III. 14, 11 f. that Manu was one\n of Kasyapa's eight wives, we must here\n read Kasyapa. The Ganda recension\n reads (III, 20, 30) Manur manushyams cha\n tutha janayámása Raghana**, instead of\n the corresponding line in the Bombay edition.'\n Muir's Sanskrit Text, Vol I, p. 117.\n \n \n Next: Canto XV.: Panchavatt.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XIII.: Agastya's Counsel.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XV.: Panchavatt. »",
