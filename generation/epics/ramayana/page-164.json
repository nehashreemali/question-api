I will keep\n My watch while Ráma lies asleep:\n For in the whole wide world is none\n Dearer to me than Raghu's son.\n Harbour no doubt or jealous fear:\n I speak the truth with heart sincere:\n For from the grace which he has shown\n Will glory on my name be thrown:\n Great store of merit shall I gain,\n And duteous, form no wish in vain.\n Let me enforced by many a row\n Of followers, armed with shaft and bow\n For well-loved Ráma's weal provide\n Who lies asleep by Sitá's side.\n For through this wood I often go,\n And all its shades conceal I know:\n And we with conquering arms can meet\n A four-fold host arrayed complete.'\n With words like these I spoke, designed\n To move the high-souled Bharat's mind,\n But he upon his duty bent,\n Plied his persuasive argument:\n 'O, how can slumber close mine eyes\n When lowly couched with Sitá lies\n The royal Ráma? can I give\n My heart to joy, or even live?\n He whom no mighty demon, no,\n Nor heavenly God can overthrow,\n See, Guha, how he lies, alas,\n \n \n p. 194\n \n \n With Sítá couched on gathered grass.\n By varied labours, long, severe,\n By many a prayer and rite austere,\n He, Das'aratha's cherished son,\n By Fortune stamped, from Heaven was won.\n Now as his son is forced to fly,\n The king ere long will surely die:\n Reft of his guardian hand, forlorn\n In widowed grief this land will mourn,\n E'en now perhaps, with toil o'erspent,\n The women cease their loud lament,\n And cries of woe no longer ring\n Throughout the palace of the king.\n But ah for sad Kaus'alyá! how\n Fare she and mine own mothef now?\n How fares the king? this night, I think,\n Some of the three in death will sink.\n With hopes upon S'atrughna set\n My mother may survive as yet,\n But the sad queen will die who bore\n The hero, for her grief is sore.\n His cherished wish that would have made\n Dear Ráma king, so long delayed,\n 'Too late! too late!' the king will cry,\n And conquered by his misery die.\n When Fate has brought the mournful day\n Which sees my father pass away,\n How happy in their lives are they\n Allowed his funeral rites to pay.\n Our exile o'er, with him who ne'er\n Turns from the oath his lips may swear,\n May we returning safe and well\n Again in fair Ayodhyá dwell.'\n Thus Bharat stood with many a sigh\n Lamenting, and the night went by.\n Soon as the morning light shone fair\n In votive coils both bound their hair.\n And then I sent them safely o'er\n And left them on the farther shore.\n With Sítá then they onward passed,\n Their coats of bark about them cast,\n     Their locks like hermits' bound,\n The mighty tamers of the foe,\n Each with his arrows and his bow,\n Went over the rugged ground,\n Proud in their strength and undeterred\n Like elephants that lead the herd,\n And gazing oft around.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXXXVII.: Guha's Story.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto LXXXV.: Guha And Bharat.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto LXXXVII.: Guha's Story. »",
