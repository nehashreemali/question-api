the twice-born peers of state\n Together met for high debate.\n Jáválí, lord of mighty fame.\n And Gautam, and Kátyáyan came,\n And Márkandeya's reverend age,\n And Vámadeva, glorious sage:\n Sprung from Mudgalya's seed the one,\n The other ancient Kas'yap's son.\n With lesser lords these Bráhmans each\n Spoke in his turn his several speech,\n And turning to Vas'ishtha, best\n Of household priests him thus addressed:\n The night of bitter woe has past,\n Which seemed a hundred years to last,\n Our king, in sorrow for his son,\n Reunion with the Five has won.\n His soul is where the blessed are,\n While Ráma roams in woods afar,\n And Lakshman, bright in glorious deeds,\n Goes where his well-loved brother leads.\n And Bharat and S'atrughna, they\n Who smite their foes in battle fray,\n Far in the realm of Kekaya stay,\n Where their maternal grandsire's care\n Keeps Rájagriha's city fair.\n Let one of old Ikshváku's race\n Obtain this day the sovereign's place,\n Or havoc and destruction straight\n Our kingless land will devastate.\n In kingless lands no thunder's voice,\n No lightning wreaths the heart rejoice,\n Nor does Parjanya's heavenly rain\n Descend upon the burning plain.\n Where none is king, the sower's hand\n Casts not the seed upon the land;\n The son against the father strives.\n And husbands fail to rule their wives.\n In kingless realms no princes call\n Their friends to meet in crowded hall;\n No joyful citizens resort\n To garden trim or sacred court.\n In kingless realms no Twice-born care\n To sacrifice with text and prayer,\n Nor Bráhmans, who their vows maintain,\n The great solemnities ordain.\n The joys of happier days have ceased:\n No gathering, festival, or feast\n Together calls the merry throng\n Delighted with the play and song.\n In kingless lands it ne'er is well\n With sons of trade who buy and sell:\n No men who pleasant tales repeat\n Delight the crowd with stories sweet.\n In kingless realms we ne'er behold\n Young maidens decked with gems and gold,\n Flock to the gardens blithe and gay\n To spend their evening hours in play.\n No lover in the flying car\n Rides with his love to woods afar.\n In kingless lands no wealthy swain\n Who keeps the herd and reaps the grain,\n Lies sleeping, blest with ample store,\n Securely near his open door.\n Upon the royal roads we see\n No tusked elephant roaming free,\n Of three-score years, whose head and neck\n Sweet tinkling bells of silver deck.\n We hear no more the glad applause\n When his strong bow each rival draws,\n No clap of hands, no eager cries\n That cheer each martial exercise.\n In kingless realms no merchant bands\n Who travel forth to distant lands,\n With precious wares their wagons load.\n \n \n p. 175\n \n \n And fear no danger on the road,\n No sage secure in self-control,\n Brooding on God with mind and soul,\n In lonely wanderings finds his home\n Where'er at eve his feet may roam.\n In kingless realms no man is sure\n He holds his life and wealth secure.\n In kingless lands no warriors smite\n The foeman's host in glorious fight.\n In kingless lands the wise no more.\n Well trained in Scripture's holy lore.\n In shady groves and gardens meet\n To argue in their calm retreat.\n No longer, in religious fear,\n Do they who pious vows revere,\n Bring dainty cates and wreaths of flowers\n As offerings to the heavenly powers.\n No longer, bright as trees in spring,\n Shine forth the children of the king\n Resplendent in the people's eyes\n With aloe wood and sandal dyes.\n A brook where water once has been,\n A grove where grass no more is green,\n Kine with no herdsman's guiding hand--\n So wretched is a kingless land.\n The car its waving banner rears,\n Banner of fire the smoke appears:\n Our king, the banner of our pride,\n A God with Gods is glorified.\n In kingless lands no law is known,\n And none may call his wealth his own,\n Each preys on each from hour to hour,\n As fish the weaker fish devour.\n Then fearless, atheists overleap\n The bounds of right the godly keep,\n And when no royal powers restrain,\n Pre?inence and lordship gain.\n As in the frame of man the eye\n Keeps watch and ward, a careful spy,\n The monarch in his wide domains\n Protects the truth, the right maintains.\n He is the right, the truth is he,\n Their hopes in him the well-born see.\n On him his people's lives depend,\n Mother is he, and sire, nnd friend.\n The world were veiled in blinding night,\n And none could see or know aright,\n Ruled there no king in any state\n The good and ill to separate.\n We will obey thy word and will\n As if our king were living still:\n As keeps his bounds the faithful sea,\n So we observe thy high decree.\n O best of Brámans, first in place,\n     Our kingless land lies desolate:\n Some scion of Ikshváku's race\n     Do thou as monarch consecrate.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXVIII.: The Envoys.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book
