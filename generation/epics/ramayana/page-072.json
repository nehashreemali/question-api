My nieces twain\n Let Bharat and S'atrughna gain,\n And the four youths the selfsame day\n Four maiden hands in theirs shall lay.\n No day so lucky may compare,\n For marriage--so the wise declare--\n With the last day of Phálguni\n Ruled by the genial deity.'\n Then with raised hands in reverence due\n To those arch-saints he spoke anew:\n 'I am your pupil, ever true:\n To me high favour have ye shown;\n Come, sit ye on my royal throne,\n For Das'aratha rules these towers\n E'en as Ayodhyá now is ours.\n Do with your own whate'er ye choose:\n Your lordship here will none refuse.'\n \n \n He spoke, and to Videha's king\n Thus Das'aratha, answering:\n 'Boundless your virtues, lords, wbose sway\n The realms of Mithilá obey.\n With honouring care you entertain.\n Both holy sage and royal train.\n Now to my house my steps I bend--\n May blessings still on you at end--\n Due offerings to the shades to pay.'\n Thus spoke the king, and turned away:\n To Janak first he bade adieu,\n Then followed fast those holy two.\n The monarch reached his palace where\n The rites were paid with solemn care.\n When the next sun began to shine\n He rose and made his gift of kine.\n A bundled thousand cows prepared\n For each young prince the Bráhmans shared.\n Each had her horns adorned with gold;\n And duly was the number told,\n Four hundred thousand perfect tale:\n Each brought a calf, each filled a pail.\n And when that glorious task was o'er,\n The monarch with his children four,\n Showed like the Lord of Life divine\n When the worlds' guardians round him shine.\n \n \n p. 84\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 83:1  The tenth of the lunar asterisms, composed\n of five stars.\n 83:2  'There are two lunar asterisms of this\n name, one following the other immediately,\n forming the eleventh and twelfth of the\n lunar mansions.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXXIII.: The Nuptials.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LXXI.: Janak's Pedigree.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LXXIII.: The Nuptials. »",
