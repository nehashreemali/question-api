Hanumán stays\n Bharat in time, and gives him an account\n of what has befallen Ráma and Sitá in\n the forest and in Lanká.\n 491:1  As Garud the king of birds is the\n mortal enemy of serpents the weapon\n sacred to him is of course best calculated\n to destroy the serpent arrows of Rávan.\n \n \n Next: Canto CVI.: Glory To The Sun.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto CII.: Lakshman Healed.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto CVI.: Glory To The Sun. »",
