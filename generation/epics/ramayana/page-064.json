The nymph obeyed;\n In all her loveliest charms arrayed,\n With winning ways and witching smile\n She sought the hermit to beguile.\n The sweet note of that tuneful bird\n The saint with ravished bosom heard,\n And on his heart a rapture passed\n As on the nymph a look he cast.\n But when he heard the bird prolong\n His sweet incomparable song,\n And saw the nymph with winning smile,\n The hermit's heart perceiv'd the wile.\n And straight he knew the Thousand-eyed\n A plot against his peace had tried.\n Then Kus'ik's son indignant laid\n His curse upon the heavenly maid:\n 'Because thou wouldst my soul engage\n Who fight to conquer love and rage,\n Stand, till ten thousand years have flown,\n Ill-fated maid, transformed to stone.\n A Bráhman then, in glory strong,\n Mighty through penance stern and long,\n Shall free thee from thine altered shape;\n Thou from my curse shalt then escape.'\n But when the saint had cursed her so,\n His breast was burnt with fires of woe,\n Grieved that long effort to restrain\n His mighty wrath was all in vain.\n Cursed by the angry sage's power,\n She stood in stone that selfsame hour.\n Kandarpa heard the words he said,\n And quickly from his presence fled.\n His fall beneath his passion's sway\n Had reft the hermit's meed away.\n Unconquered yet his secret foes,\n The humbled saint refused repose:\n 'No more shall rage my bosom till,\n Sealed be my lips, my tongue be still.\n My very breath henceforth I hold\n Until a thousand years are told:\n Victorious o'er each erring sense,\n I'll dry my frame with abstinence,\n Until by penance duly done\n A Bráhman's rank be bought and won.\n For countless yearn, as still as death.\n I taste no food, I draw no breath,\n And as I toil my frame shall stand\n Unharmed by time's destroying hand.'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXV.: Vis'vámitra's Triumph\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LXIII.: Menak&aacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LXV.: Vis'v&aacute;mitra's Triumph »",
