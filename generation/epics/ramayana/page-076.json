I will not dim\n Mine honour and be false to him.\n So, son of Raghu, leave me still\n The power to wander where I will,\n And swifter than the thought my flight\n Shall place me on Mahendra's height.\n My mansions of eternal joy.\n By penance won, thou mayst destroy.\n My path to these thy shaft may stay.\n Now to the work! No more delay!\n I know thee Lord of Gods; I know\n Thy changeless might laid Madhu low.\n All other hands would surely fail\n To bend this bow. All hail! all hail!\n See! all the Gods have left the skies\n To bend on thee their eager eyes,\n With whose achievements none compete.\n Whose arm in war no God can meet.\n No shame is mine. I ween, for thou,\n Lord of the Worlds, hast dimmed my brow.\n Now, pious Ráma, 'tis thy part\n To shoot afar that glorious dart:\n I, when the fatal shaft is shot,\n Will seek that hill and tarry not.'\n \n \n He ceased. The wondrous arrow flew,\n And Jamadagni's offspring knew\n Those glorious worlds to him were barred,\n Once gained by penance long and hard.\n Then straight the airy quarters cleared,\n And the mid regions bright appeared,\n While Gods and saints unnumbered praised\n Ráma, the mighty bow who raised.\n And Jamadagni's son, o'erawed.\n Extolled his name with highest laud,\n \n \n p. 88\n \n \n With reverent steps around him strode,\n Then hastened on his airy road.\n Far from the sight of all he fled,\n And rested on Mahendra's head.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXXVII.: Bharat's Departure.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LXXV.: The Parle.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LXXVII.: Bharat's Departure. »",
