It is\n composed in a metre different from that\n of the rest of the Canto, and contains\n figures of poetical rhetoric and commonplaces\n which are the delight of more recent poets.\n 359:3  Praushthapada or Bhadra, the modern\n *Bhaden*, corresponds to half of August\n and half of September.\n 359:4  The Sáman or Sáma-veda, the third\n of the four Vedas, is really merely a\n reproduction of parts of the Rig-veda,\n transposed and scattered about piece-meal,\n only 78 verses in the whole being, it is\n said, untraceable to the present recension\n of the Rig-veda.\n 359:5  Áshádha is the month corresponding\n to parts of June and July.\n 359:6  Bharat, who was regent during Ráma's\n absence.\n 359:7  Or with Goriesio, following the gloss\n of another commentary: \"Has completed every\n holy rite and accumulated stores of merit.\"\n \n \n Next: Canto XXIX.: Hanumán's Counsel.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto XXVII.: R&aacute;ma On The Hill.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto XXIX.: Hanum&aacute;n's Counsel. »",
