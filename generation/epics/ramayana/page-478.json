It comes in awkwardly\n and may I think be considered as an interpolation, but I paraphrase a portion of\n it as a relief after so much fighting and\n carnage, and as an interesting glimpse of\n the monotheistic ideas which underlie\n the Hindu religion. The hymn does not\n readily lend itself to metrical translation,\n and I have not attempted here to give a\n faithful rendering of the whole. A literal\n version of the text and the commentary\n given in the Calcutta edition will be found\n in the Additional Notes.\n \n \n A canto is here omitted. It contains\n fighting of the ordinary kind between\n Ráma and Rávan, and a description of\n sights and sounds of evil omen foreboding\n the destruction of the giant.\n \n \n Next: Canto CVIII.: The Battle.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto CIII.: Indra's Car.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto CVIII.: The Battle. »",
