Then anew\n The arrows from his bowstring flew,\n And pierced, well aimed with perfect art,\n Each limb and joint and vital part.\n Transfixed with shafts in every limb.\n Their strength relaxed, their eyes grew dim.\n As two tall standards side by side,\n With each sustaining rope untied.\n Fall levelled by the howling blast,\n So earth's majestic lords at last\n Beneath the arrowy tempest reeled,\n And prostrate pressed the battle field.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 460:1b  Yajnas'atru, Maháphráva, Mahodar,\n Vajradanshtra, S'uka, and Sáran.\n 460:2b  Angad.\n 460:3b  A mysterious weapon consisting of\n serpents transformed to arrows which\n deprived the wounded object of all sense\n and power of motion.\n \n \n Next: Canto XLVI.: Indrajit's Triumph.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto XLIV.: The Night.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto XLVI.: Indrajit's Triumph. »",
