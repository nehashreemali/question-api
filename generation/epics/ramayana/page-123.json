not wood-ward hence;\n Back to his royal residence!'\n     Soon as he saw the aged band.\n Exclaiming in their misery, stand,\n And their sad cries around him rang,\n Swift from his chariot Ráma sprang.\n Then, still upon his journey bent,\n With Sítá and with Lakshman went\n The hero by the old men's side\n Suiting to theirs his shortened stride.\n He could not pass the twice-born throng\n As weariedly they walked along:\n With pitying heart, with tender eye,\n He could not in his chariot fly.\n When the steps of Ráma viewed\n That still his onward course pursued.\n Woe shook the troubled heart of each,\n And burnt with grief they spoke this speech--\n     'With thee, O Ráma, to the wood\n All Bráhmans go and Bráhmanhood:\n Borne on our aged shoulders, see,\n Our fires of worship go with thee.\n Bright canopies that lend their shade\n In Vajapeya 1 rites displayed,\n In plenteous store are borne behind\n Like cloudlets in the autumn wind.\n No shelter from the sun hast thou,\n And, lest his fury burn thy brow,\n These sacrificial shades we bear\n Shall aid thee in the noontide glare.\n Our hearts, who ever loved to pore\n On sacred text and Vedic lore,\n Now all to thee, beloved, turn,\n And for a life in forests yearn.\n Deep in our aged bosoms lies\n The Vedas' lore, the wealth we prize,\n There still, like wives at home, shall dwell,\n Whose love and truth protect them well.\n \n \n \n \n \n p. 148\n \n \n To follow thee our hearts are bent;\n We need not plan or argument.\n All else in duty's law we slight,\n For following thee is following right.\n O noble Prince, retrace thy way:\n O, hear us, Ráma, as we lay,\n With many tears and many prayers,\n Our aged heads and swan-white hairs\n Low in the dust before thy feet;\n O, hear us, Ráma, we entreat.\n Full many of these who with thee run,\n Their sacred rites had just begun.\n Unfinished yet those rites remain;\n But finished if thou turn again.\n All rooted life and things that move\n To thee their deep affection prove.\n To them, when warmed by love, they glow\n And sue to thee, some favour show\n Each lowly bush, each towering tree\n Would follow too for love of thee.\n Bound by its root it must remain;\n But--all it can--its boughs complain,\n As when the wild wind rushes by\n It tells its woe in groan and sigh.\n No more through air the gay birds flit,\n But, foodless, melancholy sit\n Together on the branch and call\n To thee whose kind heart feels for all.'\n \n \n As wailed the aged Bráhmans, bent\n To turn him back, with wild lament,\n Seemed Tamasá herself to aid,\n Checking his progress, as they prayed.\n Sumantra from the chariot freed\n With ready hand each weary steed;\n He groomed them with the utmost heed,\n \n \n Their limbs he bathed and dried,\n Then led them forth to drink and feed\n At pleasure in the grassy mead\n That fringed the river side.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 147:1  An important sacrifice at which seventeen\n victims were immolated.\n \n \n Next: Canto XLVI.: The Halt.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XLIV.: Sumitra's Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XLVI.: The Halt. »",
