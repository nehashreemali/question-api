blest to be\n The mother of a son like thee!\n I know thee well, O chieftain, now:\n Ráma, the prince of men, art thou.\n There stands the high-born Maithil dame,\n There Lakshman, lord of mighty fame.\n My name was Tumburu  1, for song\n Renowned among the minstrel throng:\n Cursed by Kuvera's stern decree\n I wear the hideous shape you see.\n But when I sued, his grace to crave,\n The glorious God this answer gave:\n 'When Ráma, Das'aratha's son,\n Destroys thee and the light is won,\n Thy proper shape once more assume,\n And heaven again shall give thee room.'\n When thus the angry God replied,\n No prayers could turn his wrath aside,\n And thus on me his fury fell\n For loving Rambhá's  2 charms too well.\n Now through thy favour am I freed\n From the stern fate the God decreed,\n And saved, O tamer of the foe,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 233\n \n \n By thee, to heaven again shall go.\n A league, O Prince, beyond this spot\n Stands holy S'arabhanga's cot:\n The very sun is not more bright\n Than that most glorious anchorite:\n To him, O Ráma, quickly turn,\n And blessings from the hermit earn.\n First under earth my body throw,\n Then on thy way rejoicing go.\n Such is the law ordained of old\n For giants when their days are told:\n Their bodies laid in earth, they rise\n To homes eternal in the skies.'\n     Thus, by the rankling dart oppressed,\n Kakutstha's offspring he addressed:\n In earth his mighty body lay,\n His spirit fled to heaven away.\n     Thus spake Virádha ere he died;\n And Ráma to his brother cried:\n 'Now dig we in this grove a pit\n His elephantine bulk to fit.\n And let the hollowed earth enfold\n This mighty giant fierce and bold.'\n     This said, the valiant hero put\n Upon the giant's neck his foot.\n His spade obedient Lakshman plied,\n And dug a pit both deep and wide\n By lofty souled Virádha's side.\n Then Raghu's son his foot withdrew,\n And down the mighty form they threw;\n One awful shout of joy he gave\n And sank into the open grave.\n The heroes, to their purpose true,\n In fight the cruel demon slew,\n     And radiant with delight\n Deep in the hollowed earth they cast\n The monster roaring to the last,\n     In their resistless might.\n Thus when they saw the warrior's steel\n No life-destroying blow might deal,\n     The pair, for lore renowned,\n Deep in the pit their hands had made\n The unresisting giant laid,\n     And killed him neath the ground.\n Upon himself the monster brought\n From Ráma's hand the death he sought\n     With strong desire to gain:\n And thus the rover of the night\n Told Ráma, as they strove in fight,\n That swords might rend and arrows smite\n     Upon his breast in vain.\n Thus Ráma, when his speech he heard,\n The giant's mighty form interred,\n     Which mortal arms defied.\n With thundering crash the giant fell,\n And rock and cave and forest dell\n     With echoing roar replied.\n The princes, when their task was done\n And freedom from the peril won,\n     Rejoiced to see him die.\n Then in the boundless wood they strayed,\n \n \n Like the great sun and moon displayed\n     Triumphant in the sky. 1\n \n \n               *        *        *        *        *\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 232:1  Somewhat inconsistently with this part\n of the story Tumburu is mentioned in Book\n II, Canto XII as one of the Gandharvas\n or heavenly minstrels summoned to perform at Bharadvája's feast.\n 232:2  Rambhá appears in Book I, Canto\n LXIV as the temptress of Visvámitra.\n \n \n Next: Canto V.: S'arabhanga.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto III.: Vir&aacute;dha Attacked.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto V.: S'arabhanga. »",
