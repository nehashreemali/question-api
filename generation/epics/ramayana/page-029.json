Thus it is\n related of Agastya that the Vindhyan\n mountains prostrated themselves before\n him; and yet the same Agastya is believed to\n be regent of the star Canopus,' --GORRESIO.\n \n \n He will appear as the friend and helper\n of Ráma farther on in the poem.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXVIII.: The Death of Tádaká\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto XXVI.: The Forest of T&aacute;dak&aacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto XXVIII.: The Death of T&aacute;dak&aacute; »",
