Too late, too late!\n The king my sire will meet his fate.\n And when my sire has passed away,\n Most happy in their lot are they,\n Allowed, with every pious care,\n Part in his funeral rites to bear.\n And O, may we with joy at last,--\n These years of forest exile past,--\n Turn to Ayodhyá's town to dwell\n With him who keeps his promise well.'\n \n \n While thus the hero mighty-souled,\n In wild lament his sorrow told,\n Faint with the load that on him lay,\n The hours of darkness passed away.\n As thus the prince, impelled by zeal\n For his loved brother, prompt to feel\n Strong yearnings for the people's weal,\n     His words of truth outspake,\n King Guha grieved to see his woe.\n Heart-stricken, gave his tears to flow,\n Tormented by the common blow,\n     Sad, as a wounded snake.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LII.: The Crossing of Gangá.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto L.: The Halt Under The Ingud&iacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto LII.: The Crossing of Gang&aacute;. »",
