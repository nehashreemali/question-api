sons, without delay\n His vow the king resolved to pay:\n And to Vas'ishtha, saintly man,\n In modest words this speech began:\n 'Prepare the rite with all things fit\n As is ordained in Holy Writ,\n And keep with utmost care afar\n Whate'er its sacred forms might mar.\n Thou art, my lord, my trustiest guide,\n Kind-hearted, and my friend beside;\n So is it meet thou undertake\n This heavy task for duty's sake.'\n \n \n Then he, of twice-born men the best,\n His glad assent at once expressed:\n 'Fain will I do whate'er may be\n Desired, O honoured King, by thee.'\n To ancient priests he spoke, who, trained\n In holy rites, deep skill had gained:\n 'Here guards be stationed, good and sage\n Religious men of trusted age.\n And various workmen send and call,\n Who frame the door and build the wall:\n With men of every art and trade,\n Who read the stars and ply the spade,\n \n \n p. 21\n \n \n And mimes and minstrels hither bring,\n And damsels trained to dance and sing.'\n \n \n Then to the learned men he said,\n In many a page of Scripture read:\n 'Be yours each rite performed to see\n According to the king's decree.\n And stranger Bráhmans quickly call\n To this great rite that welcomes all.\n Pavilions for the princes, decked\n With art and ornament, erect,\n And handsome booths by thousands made\n The Bráhman visitors to shade,\n Arranged in order side by side,\n With meat and drink and all supplied.\n And ample stables we shall need\n For many an elephant and steed:\n And chambers where the men may lie,\n And vast apartments, broad and high,\n Fit to receive the countless bands\n Of warriors come from distant lands.\n For our own people too provide\n Sufficient tents, extended wide,\n And stores of meat and drink prepare,\n And all that can be needed there.\n And food in plenty must be found\n For guests from all the country round.\n Of various viands presents make,\n For honour, not for pity's sake,\n That fit regard and worship be\n Paid to each caste in due degree.\n And let not wish or wrath excite\n Your hearts the meanest guest to slight;\n But still observe with special grace\n Those who obtain the foremost place,\n Whether for happier skill in art\n Or bearing in the rite their part.\n Do you, I pray, with friendly mind\n Perform the task to you assigned,\n And work the rite, as bids the law,\n Without omission, slip, or flaw'\n \n \n They answered: 'As thou seest fit\n So will we do and naught omit.'\n The sage Vas'ishtha then addressed\n Sumantra called at his behest:\n 'The princes of the earth invite,\n And famous lords who guard the rite,\n Priest, Warrior, Merchant, lowly thrall,\n In countless thousands summon all.\n Where'er their home be, far or near,\n Gather the good with honour here,\n And Janak, whose imperial sway\n The men of Míthilá  1 obey.\n The firm of vow, the dread of foes,\n Who all the lore of Scripture knows,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Invite him here with honour high,\n King Das'aratha's old ally.\n And Kás'i's  1b lord of gentle speech,\n Who finds a pleasant word for each,\n In length of days our monarch's peer,\n Illustrious king, invite him here.\n The father of our ruler's bride,\n Known for his virtues far and wide,\n The king whom Kekaya's  2b realms obey,\n Him with his son invite, I pray.\n And Lomapád the Angas' king,\n True to his vows and godlike, bring.\n For be thine invitations sent\n To west and south and orient.\n Call those who rule Suráshtra's  3b land,\n Suvíra's  4b realm and Sindhu's strand,\n And all the kings of earth beside\n In friendship's bonds with us allied:\n Invite them all to hasten in\n With retinue and kith and kin.'\n \n \n Vas'ishtha's speech without delay\n Sumantra bent him to obey.\n And sent his trusty envoys forth\n Eastward and westward, south and north.\n Obedient to the saint's request\n Himself he hurried forth, and pressed\n Each nobler chief and lord and king\n To hasten to the gathering.\n Before the saint Vas'ishtha stood\n All those who wrought with stone and wood,\n And showed the work which every one\n In furtherance of the rite had done,\n Rejoiced their ready zeal to see,\n Thus to the craftsmen all said he:\n 'I charge ye, masters, see to this,\n That there be nothing done amiss,\n And this, I pray, in mind be borne,\n That not one gift ye give in scorn:\n Whenever scorn a gift attends\n Great sin is his who thus offends.'\n \n \n And now some days and nights had past,\n And kings began to gather fast,\n And precious gems in liberal store\n As gifts to Das'aratha bore.\n Then joy thrilled through Vas'ishtha's breast\n As thus the monarch he addressed:\n 'Obedient to thy high decree\n The kings, my lord, are come to thee.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 22\n \n \n And it has been my care to greet\n And honour all with reverence meet.\n Thy servants' task is ended quite,\n And all is ready for the rite.\n Come forth then to the sacred ground\n Where all in order will be found.'\n Then Rishyas'ring confirmed the tale:\n Nor did their words to move him fail.\n The stars propitious influence lent\n When forth the world's great ruler went.\n \n \n Then by the sage Vas'ishtha led\n     The priest begun to speed\n Those glorious rites wherein is shed\n     The lifeblood of the steed.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 21:1  Called also Vidcha, later Tirabhukti,\n corrupted into the modern Tirhut, a province\n bounded on the west and east by the\n Gaudakí and Kaus'ikí rivers, on the south\n by the Ganges, and on the north by the\n skirts of the Himálayas.\n 21:1b  The celebrated city of
