Ah, mine own!'\n With voice resembling Ráma's tone.\n When Lakshman hears his brother's cry,\n Impelled by Sitá he will fly,\n Restless with eager love, to aid\n The hunter in the distant shade.\n When both her guards have left her side,\n Even as Indra, thousand-eyed,\n Clasps Sachi, will I bear away\n The Maithil dame an easy prey.\n When thou, my friend, this aid hast lent,\n Go where thou wilt and live content.\n True servant, faithful to thy vow,\n With [*half?} my realm I thee endow.\n Go forth, may luck thy way attend\n That leads thee to the happy end.\n [I:ii m.,ir v}, will quickly be\n \n \n In Dandak wood, and follow thee.\n So will I cheat this Ráma's eyes\n And win without a blow the prize;\n And safe return to Lanká's town\n With thee, my friend, this day shall crown.\n But if thou wilt not aid my will,\n My band this day thy blood shall spill.\n Yea, thou must share the destined task,\n For force will take the help I ask.\n No bliss that rebel's life attends\n Whose stubborn will his lord offends.\n     Thy life, if thou the task assay,\n         jeopardy may stand;\n     Oppose me, and this very day\n         Thou diest by this hand.\n     Now ponder all that thou hast heard\n         Within thy prudent breast:\n     Reflect with care on every word,\n         And do what seems the best.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto XLI.: Márícha's Reply.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XXXIX.: M&aacute;r&iacute;cha's Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XLI.: M&aacute;r&iacute;cha's Reply. »",
