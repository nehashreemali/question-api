He throws a grace\n On old Ikshváku's royal race.\n He feels his years' increasing weight,\n And makes his son associate.\n Great joy to us the choice will bring\n Of Ráma for our lord and king.\n The good and bad to him are known,\n And long will he protect his own.\n No pride his prudent breast may swell,\n Most just, he loves his brothers well,\n And to us all that love extends,\n Cherished as brothers and as friends.\n Long may our lord in life remain,\n Good Das'aratha, free from stain,\n By whose most gracious favour we\n Ráma anointed king shall see.'\n \n \n Such were the words the townsmen spoke\n Heard by the gathering countryfolk,\n Who from the south, north, east, and west,\n Stirred by the joyful tidings, pressed.\n For by their eager longing led\n To Ráma's consecration sped\n The villagers from every side,\n And filled Ayodhyá's city wide.\n This way and that way strayed the crowd,\n While rose a murmur long and loud,\n As when the full moon floods the skies\n And Ocean's waves with thunder rise.\n     That town, like Indra's city fair,\n         While peasants thronged her ways.\n     Tumultuous roared like Ocean, where\n         Each flood-born monster plays.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto VII.: Manthará's Lament.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto V.: R&aacute;ma's Fast.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto VII.: Manthar&aacute;'s Lament. »",
