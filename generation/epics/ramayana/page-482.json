'Hatred dies\n When low in dust the foeman lies.\n Now triumph bids the conflict cease,\n And knits us in the bonds of peace.\n Let funeral rites be duly paid.\n And be it mine thy toil to aid.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto CXII.: The Rákshas Dames.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto CX.: R&aacute;van's Death.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto CXII.: The R&aacute;kshas Dames. »",
