true\n Are the proud words I speak to you.\n The king of Gods who rules on high,\n If wild Air'avat bore him nigh,\n Should fall before me bolt in hand:\n And shall these two my wrath withstand!'\n     He ended and the giant host\n Who heard their chief's triumphant boast,\n Rejoiced with equal pride elate,\n Entangled in the noose of Fate.\n     Then met on high in bright array,\n With eyes that longed to see the fray,\n God and Gandharva, sage and saint,\n With beings pure from earthly taint.\n Blest for good works aforetime wrought,\n Thus each to other spake his thought:\n 'Now joy to Br'ahmans, joy to kine,\n And all whom world count half divine!\n May Raghu's offspring slay in fight\n Pulastya's sons who roam by night!'\n In words like these and more, the best\n Of high-souled saints their hopes expressed,\n Bending their eager eyes from where\n Car-borne with Gods they rode in air.\n Beneath them stretching far, they viewed\n The giants' death-doomed multitude.\n They saw where, urged with fury, far\n Before the host rolled Khara's car,\n And close beside their leader came\n Twelve giant peers of might and fame. 1\n Four other chiefs  2 before the rest\n Behind their leader D'ushan pressed.\n     Impetuous, cruel, dark, and dread,\n         All thirsting for the fray,\n     The hosts of giant warriors sped\n         Onward upon their way.\n     With eager speed they reached the spot\n         Where dwelt the princely two,--\n     Like planets in a league to blot\n         The sun and moon from view.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 255:1  The Sáriká is the Maina, a bird like a\n starling.\n 256:1  Their names which are rather\n unmanageable and of no importance are\n Syenagama, Prithus'y'ama, Yajnas'atru,\n Vihangama, Durjaya, Parav'ira'ksha,\n Purusha, K'alak'amuka, Megham'ali, M'aham'ali*,\n *Varasya, Rudhir'as'ana.\n 256:2  Mah'akap'ala, Sth'ul'aksha, Pram'atha,\n Tris'iras.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXIV.: The Host In Sight.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XXII: Khara's Wrath.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XXIV.: The Host In Sight. »",
