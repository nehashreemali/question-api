show\n The hero, victor of the foe.\n I gaze, but see no Vánars still\n Who wear each varied shape at will.'\n     In eager love thus Bharat cried,\n And thus the Wind-God's son replied:\n 'Look, Bharat, on those laden trees\n That murmur with the song of bees;\n For Ráma's sake the saint has made\n Untimely fruits, unwonted shade.\n Such power in ages long ago\n Could Indra's gracious boon bestow.\n O, hear the Vánars' voices, hear\n The shouting which proclaims them near\n E'en now about to cross they seem\n Sweet Gomati's delightful stream.\n I see, I see the car designed\n By Brahmá's own creative mind,\n The car which, radiant as the moon,\n Moves at the will by Brahmá's boon;\n The car which once was Rávan's pride,\n The victor's spoil when Rávan died.\n Look, there are Raghu's sons: between\n The brothers stands the rescued queen.\n There is Vibhíshan full in view,\n Sugríva and his retinue.'\n     He ceased: then rapture loosed each tongue:\n From men and dames, from old and young,\n One long, one universal cry,\n 'Tis he,'tis Ráma, smote the sky.\n All lighted down with eager speed\n From elephant and car and steed,\n And every joyful eye intent\n On Ráma's moonbright face was bent.\n Entranced a moment Bharat gazed:\n Then reverential hands he raised,\n And on his brother humbly pressed\n The honours due to welcome guest.\n Then Bharat clomb the car to greet\n His king and bowed him at his feet,\n Till Ráma raised him face to face\n And held him in a close embrace.\n Then Lakshman and the Maithil dame\n He greeted as he spoke his name  1\n He greeted next, supreme in place,\n The sovereign of the Vánar race,\n And Jámbaván and Báli's son,\n \n \n \n \n p. 506\n \n \n And lords and chiefs, omitting none. 1\n Sugríva to his heart he pressed\n And thus with grateful words addressed:\n 'Four brothers, Vánar king, were we,\n And now we boast a fifth in thee.\n By kindly acts a friend we know:\n Offence and wrong proclaim the foe,'\n To King Vibhíshan then he spake:\n 'Well hast thou fought fov Ráma's sake.'\n Nor was the brave S'atrughna slow\n His reverential love to show\n To both his brothers, as was meet,\n And venerate the lady's feet.\n Then Ráma to his mother came,\n Saw her pale cheek and wasted frame,\n With gentle words her heart consoled,\n And clasped her feet with loving hold.\n Then at Sumitra's feet he bent,\n And fair Kaikeyi's, reverent,\n Greeted each dame from chief to least,\n And bowed him to the household priest.\n Up rose a shout from all the throng:\n 'O welcome, Ráma, mourned so long.\n Welcome, Kausalyá's joy and pride,'\n Ten hundred thousand voices cried.\n Then Bharat placed, in duty taught,\n On Ráma's feet the shoes he brought:\n 'My King,' he cried, 'receive again\n The pledge preserved through years of pain,\n The rule and lordship of the land\n Entrusted to my weaker hand.\n No more I sigh o'er sorrows past,\n My birth and life are blest at last\n In the glad sight this day has shown,\n When Ráma comes to rule his own.'\n     He ceased: the faithful love that moved\n The prince's soul each heart approved;\n Nor could the Vánar chiefs refrain\n From tender tears that fell like rain.\n Then Ráma, stirred with joy anew,\n His arms about his brother threw,\n And to the grove his course he bent\n Where Bharat's hermit days were spent.\n Alighting in that pure retreat\n He pressed the earth with eager feet.\n Then, at his hest, the car rose high\n And sailing through the northern sky\n Sped homeward to the Lord of Gold\n Who owned the wondrous prize of old.  2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 505:1  In these respectful salutations the\n person who salutes his superior mentions\n his own name even when it is well known\n to the person whom he salutes.\n 506:1  I have omitted the chieftains' names\n as they could not be introduced without\n padding. They are Mainda, Dwivid, Níla\n Rishabh, Sushen, Nala, Gaváksha, Gandhamádan,\n S'arabh, and Panas.\n 506:2  The following addition is found in\n the Bengal recension: But Vais'ravan\n (Kuvera) when he beheld his chariot said\n unto it: 'Go, and carry Ráma, and come\n unto me when my thought shall call thee,\n And the chariot returned unto Ráma:'\n and he honoured it when he had heard\n what had passed.\n \n \n Next: Canto CXXX.: The Consecration.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto CXXVIII.: Hanum&aacute;n's Story.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto CXXX.: The Consecration. »",
