Ajudhyá is the Jerusalem or\n Mecca of the Hindus.\n 12:2  A legislator and saint, the son of\n Brahmá or a personification of Brahmá\n himself, the creator of the world, and\n progenitor of mankind. Derived from\n the root man to think, the word means\n originally man, the thinker, and is found\n in this sense in the Rig-veda.\n \n \n Manu as a legislator is identified with\n the Cretan Minos, as progenitor of mankind\n with the German Mannus: 'Celebrant\n carminibus antiquis, quod unum\n apud illos memoriae et annalium genus\n est, Tuisconem deum terra editum, et\n fllium Mannum, originem gentis conditoresque.'\n TACITUS, Germania, Cap. II.\n 12:3  The Sál (Shorea Robusta) is a valuable\n timber tree of considerable height.\n 12:4  The city of Indra is called Amarávati\n or Home of the Immortals.\n 12:5  Schlegel thinks that this refers to the\n marble of different colours with which\n the houses were adorned. It seems more\n natural to understand it as implying the\n regularity of the streets and houses.\n \n \n Next: Canto VI.: The King.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto IV.: The Rhapsodists.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto VI.: The King. »",
