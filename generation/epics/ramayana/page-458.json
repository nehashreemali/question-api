O fierce and brave,\n Go forth, our threatened Lanká' save.\n Go forth, a dreadful vengeance take:\n For this, O chief, I bade thee wake.\n The Gods and trembling fiends have felt\n The furious blows thine arm has dealt.\n Earth has no warrior, heaven has none\n To match thy might, Paulastya's eon,'\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXIII.: Kumbhakabna's Boast.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto LXI.: The V&aacute;nars' Alarm.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto LXIII.: Kumbhakabna's Boast. »",
