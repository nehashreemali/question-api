Sudámá's farther side,\n And glorious, gazed upon the tide;\n Passed Hládiní, and saw her toss\n Her westering billows hard to cross.\n Then old Ikshváku's famous son\n O'er S'atadrú 1 his passage won,\n Near Ailadhána on the strand,\n And came to Aparparyat's land.\n O'er S'ilás flood he hurried fast,\n Akurvatí's fair stream he passed,\n Crossed o'er A'gneya's rapid rill,\n And S'alyakartan onward still.\n S'ilávahá's swift stream he eyed,\n True to his vows and purified.\n Then crossed the lofty hills, and stood\n In Chaitraratha's mighty wood.\n He reached the confluence where meet\n Sarasvatí 2 and Gangá fleet,\n And through Bhárunda forest, spread\n Northward of Víramatsya, sped.\n He sought Kalinda's child, who fills\n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 179\n \n \n The soul with joy, begirt by hills,\n Reached Yamuná and passing o'er,\n Rested his army on the shore:\n He gave his horses food and rest,\n Bathed reeking limb and drooping crest.\n They drank their fill and bathed them there,\n And water for their journey bare.\n Thence through a mighty wood he sped\n All wild and uninhabited,\n As in fair chariot through the skies,\n Most fair in shape a Storm-God flies.\n At Ans'udhána Gangá, hard\n To cross, his onward journey barred,\n So turning quickly thence he came\n To Prágvat's city dear to fame.\n There having gained the farther side\n To Kutikoshtiká he hied:\n The stream he crossed, and onward then\n To Dharmavardhan brought his men.\n Thence, leaving Toran on the north.\n To Jambuprastha journeyed forth.\n Then onward to a pleasant grove\n By fair Varúha's town he drove,\n And when a while he there had stayed,\n Went eastward from the friendly shade.\n Eastward of Ujjiháná where\n The Priyak trees are tall and fair,\n He passed, and rested there each steed\n Kxhausted with the journey's speed.\n There orders to his men addressed,\n With quickened pace he onward pressed,\n A while at Sarvatirtha spent,\n Then o'er Uttániká he went.\n O'er many a stream beside he sped\n With coursers on the mountains bred,\n And passing Hastiprishthak, took\n The road o'er Kutikás fair brook.\n Then, at Lohitya's village, he\n Crossed o'er the swift Kapívatí,\n Then passed, where Ekas'ála stands,\n The Sthánumatís flood and sands,\n And Gomatí of fair renown\n By Vinata's delightful town.\n When to Kalinga near he drew,\n A wood of Sal trees charmed the view;\n That passed, the sun began to rise,\n And Bharat saw with happy eyes,\n Ayodhá's city, built and planned\n By ancient Manu's royal hand,\n Seven nights upon the road had passed,\n And when he saw the town at last\n Before him in her beauty spread,\n Thus Bharat to the driver said:\n 'This glorious city from afar,\n Wherein pure groves and gardens are,\n Seems to my eager eyes to-day\n A lifeless pile of yellow clay.\n Through all her streets where erst a throng\n Of men and women streamed along,\n Uprose the multitudinous roar:\n To-day I hear that sound no more.\n No longer do mine eyes behold\n The leading people, as of old,\n On elephants, cars, horses, go\n Abroad and homeward, to and fro.\n The brilliant gardens, where we heard\n The wild note of each rapturous bird.\n Where men and women loved to meet,\n In pleasant shades, for pastime sweet,--\n These to my eyes this day appear\n Joyless, and desolate, and drear;\n Each tree that graced the garden grieves,\n And every path is spread with leaves.\n The merry cry of bird and beast,\n That spake aloud their joy has ceased:\n Still is the long melodious note\n That charmed us from each warbling throat,\n Why blows the blessed air no more,\n The incense-breathing air that bore\n Its sweet incomparable scent\n Of sandal and of aloe blent?\n Why are the drum and tabour mute?\n Why is the music of the lute\n That woke responsive to the quill,\n Loved by the happy, hushed and still?\n My boding spirit gathers hence\n Dire sins of awful consequence,\n And omens, crowding on my sight,\n Weigh down my soul with wild affright\n Scarce shall I find my friends who dwell\n Here in Ayodhyá safe and well:\n For surely not without a cause\n This crushing dread my soul o'erawes.\n     Heart sick, dejected, every sense\n Confused by terror's influence,\n On to the town he quickly swept\n Which King Ikshváku's children kept.\n He passed through Vaijayanta's gate,\n With weary steeds, disconsolate.\n And all who near their station held,\n His escort. crying Victory, swelled,\n With heart distracted still he bowed\n Farewell to all the following crowd,\n Turned to the driver and began\n To question thus the weary man:.\n 'Why was I brought, O free from blame,\n So fast, unknown for what I came?\n Yet fear of ill my heart appals,\n And all my wonted courage falls.\n For I have heard in days gone by\n The changes seen when monarchs die;\n And all those signs. O charioteer,\n I see today surround me here:\n Each kinsman's house looks dark and grim,\n No hand delights to keep it trim:\n The beauty vanished. and the pride,\n The doors, unkept, stand open wide.\n No morning rites are offered there,\n No grateful incense loads the air,\n And all therein, with brows o'ercast,\n Sit joyless on the ground and fast.\n Their lovely chaplets dry and dead,\n \n \n p. 180\n \n \n Their courts unswept, with dust o'erspread,\n The temples of the Gods to-day\n No more look beautiful and gay.\n Neglected stands each holy shrine,\n Each image of a Lord divine.\n No shop where flowery wreaths are sold\n Is bright and busy as of old.\n The women and the men I mark\n Absorbed in fancies dull and dark,\n Their gloomy eyes with tears bedewed,\n A poor afflicted multitude.'\n \n \n His mind oppressed with woe and dread,\n Thus Bharat to his driver said,\n Viewed the dire signs Ayodhyá showed,\n And onward to the palace rode.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 178:1  'The S'atadrú, 'the hundred-channeled'\n --the Zaradrus of Ptolemy, Hesydrus\n of Pliny--is the Sutlej.'
