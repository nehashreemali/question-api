He took the proffered seat,\n And as she pressed her son to eat,\n Raised reverent bands, and, touched with shame,\n Made answer to the royal dame:\n \n \n   \"Dear lady, thou hast yet to know\n That danger threats, and heavy woe:\n A grief that will with sore distress\n On Sítá, thee, and Lakshman press.\n What need of seats have such as I?\n This day to Dandak wood I fly.\n The hour is come, a time, unmeet\n For silken couch and gilded seat.\n I must to lonely wilds repair,\n Abstain from flesh, and living there\n On roots, fruit, honey, hermit's food,\n Pass twice seven years in solitude.\n To Bharat's hand the king will yield\n The regent power I thought to wield,\n And me, a hermit, will he send\n My days in Dandak wood to spend.\"\n \n \n As when the woodman's axe has lopped\n A S'al branch in the grove, she dropped:\n So from the skies a Goddess falls\n Ejected from her radiant halls.\n \n \n When Ráma saw her lying low,\n Prostrate by too severe a blow,\n Around her form his arms he wound\n And raised her fainting from the ground.\n His hand upheld her like a mare\n Who feels her load too sore to bear,\n And sinks upon the way o'ertoiled,\n And all her limbs with dust are soiled.\n He soothed her in her wild distress\n With loving touch and soft caress.\n She, meet for highest fortune, eyed\n The hero watching by her side,\n And thus, while Lakshman bent to hear,\n Addressed her son with many a tear:\n \"If, Ráma, thou had ne'er been born\n My child to make thy mother mourn,\n Though reft of joy, a childless queen,\n Such woe as this I ne'er had seen.\n Though to the childless wife there clings\n One sorrow armed with keenest stings,\n 'No child have I: no child have I,'\n No second misery prompts the sigh.\n When long I sought, alas, in vain,\n My husband's love and bliss to gain,\n In Ráma all my hopes I set\n And dreamed I might be happy yet.\n I, of the consorts first and best,\n Must bear my rivals' taunt and jest,\n And brook, though better far than they,\n The soul distressing words they say.\n What woman can be doomed to pine\n In misery more sore than mine,\n Whose hopeless days must still be spent\n In grief that ends not and lament?\n They scorned me when my son was nigh;\n When he is banished I must die.\n Me, whom my husband never prized,\n Kaikeyí's retinue despised\n With boundless insolence, though she\n Tops not in rank nor equals me.\n And they who do me service yet,\n Nor old allegiance quite forget,\n Whene'er they see Kaikeyí's son,\n With silent lips my glances shun.\n How, O my darling, shall I brook\n Each menace of Kaikeyí's look,\n And listen, in my low estate,\n To taunts of one so passionate?\n For seventeen years since thou wast born\n I sat and watched, ah me, forlorn!\n Hoping some blessed day to see\n Deliverance from my woes by thee.\n Now comes this endless grief and wrong,\n So dire I cannot bear it long,\n Sinking, with age and sorrow worn.\n Beneath my rivals' taunts and scorn.\n How shall I pass in dark distress\n My long lone days of wretchedness\n Without my Ráma's face, as bright\n As the full moon to cheer my sight?\n Alas, my cares thy steps to train,\n And fasts, and vows, and prayers are vain.\n Hard, hard, I ween, must be this heart\n To hear this blow nor burst apart,\n As some great river bank, when first\n The floods of Rain-time on it burst.\n     No, Fate that speeds not will not slay,\n         Nor Yama's halls vouchsafe me room,\n     Or, like a lion's weeping prey,\n         Death now had borne me to my doom.\n     Hard is my heart and wrought of steel\n         That breaks not with the crushing blow,\n     Or in the pangs this day I feel\n         My lifeless frame had sunk below.\n     Death waits his hour, nor takes me now:\n         But this sad thought augments my pain,\n     That prayer and largess, fast and vow,\n           And Heavenward service are in vain.\n       Ah me, ah me! with fruitless toil\n           Of rites austere a child I sought:\n       Thus seed cast forth on barren soil\n           Still lifeless lies and comes to naught.\n       If ever wretch by anguish grieved\n           Before his hour to death had fled,\n       I mourning, like a cow bereaved,\n           Had been this day among the dead.\"\n \n \n p. 118\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 116:1  The comparison may to a European\n reader seem a homely one.
