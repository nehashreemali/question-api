And\n yet no other impediment is mentioned.\n Still his restless mind would not allow\n him to remain longer in the same spot.\n So the character of Vis'vámitra is ingeniously\n and skilfully shadowed forth: as he\n had been formerly a most warlike king,\n loving battle and glory, bold, active,\n sometimes unjust, and more frequently\n magnanimous, such also he always shows\n himself in his character of anchorite and\n ascetic.' SCHLEGEL.\n 72:2b  Near the modern city of Ajmere. The\n place is sacred still, and the name is preserved\n in the Hindí. Lassen, however, says\n that this Pushkala or Pushkara, called\n by the Grecian writers Πευκελἀίτις, the\n earliest place of pilgrimage mentioned by\n name, is not to be confounded with the\n modern Pushkara in Ajmere.\n 73:1  Ambarisha is the twenty-ninth in\n descent from Ikshváku, and is therefore\n separated by an immense space of time\n from Tris'anku in whose story Vis'vámitra\n had played so important a part. Yet\n Richíka, who is represented as having\n young sons while Ambarísha was yet reigning,\n being himself the son of Bhrigu and\n to be numbered with the most ancient\n sages, is said to have married the younger\n sister of Vis'vámitra. But I need not again\n remark that there is a perpetual anachronism\n in Indian mythology.' SCHLEGEL.\n \n \n 'In the mythical story related in this\n and the following Canto we may discover,\n I think, some indication of the epoch at\n which the immolation of lower animals\n was substituted for human sacrifice....\n \n \n So when Iphigenia was about to be sacrificed\n at Aulis, one legend tells us that a\n hind was substituted for the virgin.'\n                                                                                       GORRESIO.\n \n \n So the ram caught in the thicket took\n the place of Isaac, or, as the Musalmáns\n say, of Ishmael.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXII.: Ambaresha's Sacrifice.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LX.: Tris'anku's Ascension.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LXII.: Ambaresha's Sacrifice. »",
