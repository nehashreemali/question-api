The poet speaks of hundreds\n of arbudas; and an arbuda is a\n hundred millions.\n 370:2b  Anuhláda or Anuhráda is one of\n the four sons of the mighty Hiranyakasipu,\n an Asur or a Daitya son of Kasyapa\n and Diti and killed by Vishnu in his incarnation\n of the Man-Lion Narasinha. According\n to the Bhágavata Purána the Daitya\n or Asur Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyáksha\n his brother, both killed by Vishnu,\n were born again as Rávan and Kumbhakarna\n his brother.'\n 370:3b  Putoma, a demon, was the father-in-law\n of Indra who destroyed him in order\n to avert an imprecation. Paulomit is a\n patronymic denoting Sachi the daughter\n of Puloma.\n 371:1  \"Observe the variety of colours which\n the poem attributes to all these inhabitants\n of the different mountainous regions,\n some white, others yellow, &c. Such dif-\n ferent colours were perhaps peculiar and\n distinctive characteristics of those various\n races.\" GORRESSIO.\n 371:2  Sushen.\n 371:3  Tara.\n 371:4  Kesari was the husband of Hanumnán's\n mother, and is here called his father.\n 371:5  \"I here unite under one heading two\n animals of p. 372\n but which from some gross resemblances,\n probably helped by an equivoque in the\n language, are closely affiliated in the\n Hindoo myth.....a reddish colour of the\n skin, want of symmetry and ungainliness\n of form, strength in hugging with the fore\n paws or arms, the faculty of climbing,\n shortness of tail(?), sensuality, capacity\n of instruction in dancing and in music,\n are all characteristics which more or less\n distinguish and meet in bears as well as\n in monkeys In the Rámáyanam, the\n wise Jámnavant, the Odysseus of the expedition\n of Lanká, is called now king of\n the bears (rikshaparthivah), now great\n monkey (Mahákapih).
