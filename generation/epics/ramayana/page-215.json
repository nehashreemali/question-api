The cause explain:\n Why art thou come, and what to gain?'\n As S'úrpanakhá questioned so,\n Ráma, the terror of the foe,\n In answer to the monster's call,\n With fearless candour told her all.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 'King Das'aratha reigned of old,\n Like Gods celestial brave and bold.\n I am his eldest son and heir,\n And Ráma is the name I bear.\n This brother, Lakshman, younger born,\n Most faithful love to me has sworn.\n My wife, this princess, dear to fame,\n Is Sitá the Videhan dame.\n Obedient to my sire's behest\n And by the queen my mother pressed,\n To keep the law and merit win,\n I sought this wood to harbour in.\n But speak, for I of thee in turn\n Thy name, and race, and sire would learn.\n Thou art of giant race, I ween.\n Changing at will thy form and mien.\n Speak truly, and the cause declare\n That bids thee to these shades repair.'\n     Thus Ráma spoke: the demon heard,\n And thus replied by passion spurred:\n 'Of giant race, what form soe'er\n My fancy wills, 'tis mine to wear.\n Named S'úrpanakhá here I stray,\n And where I walk spread wild dismay.\n King Rávan is my brother: fame\n Has taught perchance his dreaded name,\n Strong Kumbhakama slumbering deep\n In chains of never-ending sleep:\n Vibhíshan of the duteous mind.\n In needs unlike his giant kind:\n Dúshan and Khara, brave and bold\n Whose fame by every tongue is told:\n Their might by mine is far surpassed;\n But when, O best of men, I cast\n These fond eyes on thy form, I see\n My chosen love and lord in thee.\n Endowed with wondrous might am I:\n Where'er my fancy leads I fly.\n The poor misshapen Sitá leave,\n And me, thy worthier bride receive.\n Look on my beauty, and prefer\n A spouse more meet than one like her:\n I'll eat that ill-formed woman there:\n Thy brother too her fate shall share.\n But come, beloved, thou shalt roam\n With me through all our woodland home;\n Each varied grove with me shalt seek,\n And gaze upon each mountain peak.'\n     As thus she spoke, the monster gazed\n With sparkling eyes where passion blazed:\n Then he, in lore of language learned,\n This answer eloquent returned:\n \n \n               *        *        *        *        *\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 249:1  The chief chamberlain and attendant\n of S'iva or Rodra.\n 249:2  Umá or Párvati, the consort of S'iva.\n 250:1  A star, one of the favourites of the Moon.\n 250:2  The God of love.\n \n \n Next: Canto XVIII.: The Mutilation.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XVI.: Winter.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XVIII.: The Mutilation. »",
