When I trace\n Each sign of trouble on thy face-\n That lotus which the sun has dried,\n That lily by the tempest tried,\n That gold whereon the dust is spread,\n That moon whence all the light is fled--\n Sorrow assails my heart, alas!\n As fire consumes the wood and grass.'\n     Then Rama, as she spoke distressed,\n The feet of Saint Vas'ishtha pressed,\n     Touched them with reverential love,\n         Then near him took his seat:\n     Thus Indra clasps in realms above\n         The Heavenly Teacher's  1 feet.\n     Then with each counsellor and peer,\n         Bharat of duteous mind,\n     With citizens and captains near,\n         Sat humbly down behind.\n     When with his hands to him upraised,\n         In devotee's attire.\n     Bharat upon his brother gazed\n         Whose glory shone like fire,\n     As when the pure Maheridra bends\n         To the great Lord of Life,\n     Among his noble crowd of friends\n         This anxious thought was rife:\n     'What words to Raghu's son to-day\n         Will royal Bharat speak,\n     Whose heart has been so prompt to pay\n         Obeisance fond and meek?'\n     Then steadfast Rama, Lakshman wise,\n         Bharat for truth renowned,\n \n \n \n \n p. 214\n \n \n Shone like three fires that heavenward rise\n     With holy priests around.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 213:1  Vrihaspati, the preceptor of the Gods.\n \n \n Next: Canto CV.: Rama's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto CIII.: The Funeral Libation.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto CV.: Rama's Speech. »",
