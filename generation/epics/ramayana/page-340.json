Gaja says he can leap ten yojans. Gavaksha can leap twenty. Gavaya thirty.* and so on up to ninety.\n 391:1b  Prahlá*da, the son of H***iranyakasipu, was a pious Datya remarkable for his devotion to Vishnu, and was on this account persecuted by his father.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXVI.: Hanumán.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto LXIV.: The Sea.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto LXVI.: Hanum&aacute;n. »",
