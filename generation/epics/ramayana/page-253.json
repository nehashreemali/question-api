why\n This reasonable prayer deny?\n Some pity to thy suitor show,\n For love's hot flames within me glow.\n This isle a hundred leagues in length,\n Encompassed by the ocean's strength,\n Would all the Gods and fiends defy\n Though led by Him who rules the sky.\n No God in heaven, no sage on earth,\n No minstrel of celestial birth,\n \n \n p. 295\n \n \n No spirit in the worlds I see\n A match in power and might for me.\n What wilt tbou do with Ráma, him\n Whose days are short, whose light is dim,\n Expelled from home and royal sway,\n Who treads on foot his weary way?\n Leave the poor mortal to his fate.\n And wed thee with a worthier mate.\n My timid love, enjoy with me\n The prime of youth before it flee.\n Do not one hour the hope retain\n To look on Ráma's face again.\n For whom would wildest thought beguile\n To seek thee in the giants' isle?\n Say who is he has power to bind\n In toils of net the rushing wind.\n Whose is the mighty hand will tame\n And hold the glory of the flame?\n In all the worlds above, below.\n Not one, O fair of form, I know\n Who from this isle in fight could rend\n The lady whom these arms defend.\n Fair Queen, o'er Lanka's island reign,\n Sole mistress of the wide domain.\n Gods, rovers of the night like me,\n And all the world thy slaves will be.\n O'er thy fair brows and queenly head\n Let conscerating balm be shed,\n And sorrow banished from thy breast,\n Enjoy my love and take thy rest.\n Here never more thy soul shall know\n The memory of thy former woe,\n And here shall thou enjoy the meed\n Deserved by every virtuous deed.\n Here garlands glow of flowery twine,\n With gorgeous hues and scent divine.\n Take gold and gems and rich attire:\n Enjoy with me thy heart's desire.\n There stand, of chariots far the best,\n The car my brother once possessed.\n Which, victor in the stricken field,\n I forced the Lord of Gold to yield.\n 'Tis wide and high and nobly wrought,\n Bright as the sun and swift as thought.\n Therein O Sítá, shalt tbou ride\n Delighted by thy lover's side.\n But sorrow mars with lingering trace\n The splendour of thy lotus face.\n A cloud of woe is o'er it spread,\n And all the light of joy is fled.'\n     The lady, by her woe distressed,\n One corner of her raiment pressed\n To her sad cheek like moonlight clear.\n And wiped away a falling tear.\n The rover of the night renewed\n His eager pleading as he viewed\n The lady stand like one distraught,\n Striving to fix her wandering thought:\n ' Think not, sweet Lady, of the shame\n Of broken vows, nor fear the blame.\n The Saints approve with favouring eyes\n \n \n This union knit with marriage ties.\n O beauty, at thy radiant feet\n I lay my heads, and thus entreat.\n One word of grace, one look I crave:\n Have pity on thy prostrate slave.\n These idle words I speak are vain,\n Wrung forth by love's consuming pain,\n And ne'er of Rávan be it said\n He wooed a dame with prostrate head.'\n Thus to the Maithil lady sued\n The monarch of the giant brood,\n And 'She is now mine own,' he thought,\n In Death's dire coils already caught.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LVI.: Sítá's Disdain.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto LIV.: Lank&aacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto LVI.: S&iacute;t&aacute;'s Disdain. »",
