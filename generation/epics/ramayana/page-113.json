For pity's sake\n Accept the word the monarch spake.\n Thy husband's will, O Queen, obey,\n And be the people's hope and stay.\n O, do not, urged by follv, draw\n The king to tread on duty's law,\n The lord who all the world sustains,\n Bright as the God o'er Gods who reigns.\n Our glorious king, by sin unstained,\n Will  never grant what fraud obtained;\n No shade of fault in  him is seen:\n Let Ráma be anointed, Queen.\n Remember, Queen, undying shame\n Will through the world pursue thy name,\n If Ráma leave the king his sire,\n And, banished, to the wood retire.\n Come, from thy breast this fever fling:\n Of his own realm be Ráma king.\n None in this city e'er can dwell\n To tend and love thee half so well.\n When Ráma sits in royal place,\n True to the custom of his race\n Our monarch of the mighty bow\n A hermit to the woods will go.'  1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sumantra thus, palm joined to palm,\n Poured forth his words of bane and balm,\n With keen reproach, with pleading kind,\n Striving to move Kaikeyí's mind.\n In vain he prayed, in vain reproved,\n She heard unsoftened and unmoved.\n Nor could the eyes that watched her view\n One yielding look, one change of hue.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 137:1  It was the custom of the kings of the\n solar dynasty to resign in their extreme\n old age the kingdom to the heir, and spend the remainder of their days in holy meditation in the forest:\n \n     'For such through ages in their life's decline\n       Is the good custom of Ikshváku's line.'\n \n                                                                 Raghuvans'a.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXXVI.: Siddhárth's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XXXIV.: R&aacute;ma In The Palace.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XXXVI.: Siddh&aacute;rth's Speech. »",
