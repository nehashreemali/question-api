O turn thine eye:\n Why are thy cold lips silent, why?\n When first we met as youth and maid.\n When in thy hand my hand was laid,\n Thy promise was thy steps should be\n Through life in duty's path with me.\n Remember, faithful still, thy vow,\n And take me with thee even now.\n Is that broad bosom where I hung,\n That neck to which I fondly clung,\n Where flowery garlands breathed their scent\n By hungry dogs and vultures rent?\n Shall no funereal honours grace\n The parted lord of Raghu's race,\n Whose bounty liberal fees bestowed.\n For whom the fires of worship glowed?\n Kaus'alyá wild with grief will see\n One sole survivor of the three\n Who in their hermit garments went\n To the dark woods in banishment.\n Then at her cry shall Lakshman tell\n How, slain by night, the Vánars fell;\n How to thy side the giants crept,\n And slew the hero as he slept.\n Thy fate and mine the queen will know,\n And broken-hearted die of woe.\n For my unworthy sake, for mine,\n Ráma, the glory of his line,\n Who bridged his way across the main,\n Is basely in a puddle slain;\n And I, the graceless wife he wed,\n Have brought this ruin on his head.\n Me, too, on him, O Rávan, slay:\n \n \n The wife beside her husband lay.\n By his dear body let me rest,\n Cheek close to cheek and breast to breast,\n My happy eyes I then will close.\n And follow whither Ráma goes.'\n     Thus cried the miserable dame;\n When to the king a warder came,\n Before the giant monarch bowed\n And said that, followed by a crowd\n Of counsellors and lords of state,\n Prahasta stood before the gate,\n And, sent by some engrossing care,\n Craved audience of his master there.\n The anxious tyrant left his seat\n And hastened forth the chief to meet:\n Then summoning his nobles all,\n Took counsel in his regal hall.\n     When Lanká's lord had left the queen,\n The head and bow no more were seen.\n The giant king his nobles eyed,\n And, terrible as Yama, cried:\n 'O faithful lords, the time is come:\n Gather our hosts with beat of drum.\n Nigh to the town our foeman draws:\n Be prudent, nor reveal the cause.'\n     The nobles listened and obeyed:\n Swift were the gathered troops arrayed,\n And countless rovers of the night\n Stood burning for the hour of tight.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto XXXIII.: Saramá.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto XXXI.: The Magic Head.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto XXXIII.: Saram&aacute;. »",
