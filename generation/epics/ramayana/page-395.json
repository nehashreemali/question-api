Gorresio remarks:\n 'This comparison of a great lake to the\n sky and of celestial to aquatic objects is\n one of those ideas which the view and\n qualities of natural scenery awake in lively\n fancies. Imagine one of those grand\n and splendid lakes of India covered with\n lotus blossoms, furrowed by wild-ducks\n of the most vivid colours, mantled over\n here and there with flowers and water\n weeds &c. and it will be understood how\n the fancy of the poet could readily compare\n to the sky radiant with celestial azure\n the blue expanse of the water, to the soft\n light of the moon the ****** hue of the\n lotus, to the splendour of the sun the brilliant\n colours of the wild-fowl, to the stars\n the flowers, to the cloud the weeds that\n float upon the water &c.'\n 425:1b  Sunábha is the mountain that rose\n from the sea when Hanúmán passed over\n to Lanká.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXI.: The Feast of Honey.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto LVI: Mount Arishta.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto LXI.: The Feast of Honey. »",
