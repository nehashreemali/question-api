My son, good night!\n Fixt is to-morrow for the rite.'\n \n \n Then Ráma paid the reverence due,\n And quickly to his home withdrew.\n He passed within, nor lingered there,\n But sought his mother's mansion, where\n The dame in linen robes arrayed\n Devoutly in the chapel prayed\n To Fortune's Queen,with utterance checked,\n That she her Ráma would protect.\n There was Sumitrá too, and there\n Was Lakshman led by loving care:\n And when the royal choice they knew\n Sítá in haste was summoned too.\n Absorbed, with half-shut eyes, the queen\n Attended by the three was seen.\n She knew that Pushya's lucky hour\n Would raise her son to royal power,\n So fixed with bated breath each thought\n On God supreme, by all men sought.\n To her, as thus she knelt and prayed,\n Ráma drew near, due reverence paid,\n And then to swell his mother's joy,\n Thus spoke her own beloved boy;\n 'O mother dear, my sire's decree\n Entrusts the people's weal to me.\n To-morrow I, for so his will.\n Anointed king, the throne shall fill.\n The few last hours till night shall end\n Sitá with me must fasting spend,\n For so my father has decreed,\n And holy priests with him agreed.\n What vows soever thou mayst deem\n My consecration's eve beseem,\n Do thou, sweet mother, for my sake\n And for beloved Sitá's make.'\n \n \n When the glad news Kaus'alyá heard,\n So long desired, so long deferred,\n While tears of joy her utterance broke,\n In answer to her son she spoke:\n 'Long be thy life, my darling: now\n Thy prostrate foes before thee bow.\n Live long and with thy bright success\n My friends and dear Sumitrá's bless.\n Surely the stars were wondrous fair\n When thee, sweet son, thy mother bare,\n That thy good gifts such love inspire\n And win the favour of thy sire.\n With thee I travailed not in vain;\n Those lotus eyes reward my pain,\n And all the glory of the line\n Of old Ikshváku will be thine.'\n \n \n He smiled, and on his brother gazed\n Who sate with reverent hands upraised,\n And said: 'My brother, thou must be\n Joint-ruler of this land with me.\n My second self thou, Lakshman, art,\n And in my fortune bearest part.\n Be thine, Sumitrá's son, to know\n The joys from regal power that flow.\n My life itself, the monarch's seat,\n For thy dear sake to me are sweet. 1\n \n \n Thus Ráma to his brother said,\n To both his mothers' bowed his head,\n And then with Sítá by his side\n To his own house the hero hied.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 93:1  Ráhu, the ascending node, is in mythology\n a demon with the tail of a dragon\n whose head was severed from his body\n by Vishnu, but being immortal, the head\n and tail retained their separate existence\n and being transferred to the stellar sphere\n became the authors of eclipses; the first\n especially by endeavouring to swallow the\n sun and moon.\n 93:2  In eclipse.\n 93:3  The seventh of the lunar asterisms.\n \n \n Next: Canto V.: Ráma's Fast.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto III.: Das'aratha's Precepts.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto V.: R&aacute;ma's Fast. »",
