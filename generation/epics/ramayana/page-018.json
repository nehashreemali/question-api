That noblest fire,\n The Sun, was great Sugríva's sire,\n Tára, the mighty monkey, he\n Was offspring of Vrihaspati: 6\n Tára the matchless chieftain, boast\n For wisdom of the Vánar host.\n Of Gandhamádan brave and bold\n The father was the Lord of Gold.\n Nala the mighty, dear to fame,\n Of skilful Vis'vakarmá 7 came.\n From Agni, 8 Nila bright as flame,\n Who in his splendour, might, and worth,\n Surpassed the sire who gave him birth.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The heavenly As'vlns, 1b swift and fair,\n Were fathers of a noble pair,\n Who, Dwivida and Mainda named,\n For beauty like their sires were famed,\n Varun 2b was father of Sushen,\n Of Sarabh, he who sends the rain, 3b\n Hanúmán, best of monkey kind,\n Was son of him who breathes the wind:\n Like thunderbolt in frame was he,\n And swift as Garud's 4b self could flee.\n These thousands did the Gods create\n Endowed with might that none could mate,\n In monkey forms that changed at will;\n So strong their wish the fiend to kill.\n In mountain size, like lions thewed,\n Up sprang the wondrous multitude,\n Auxiliar hosts in every shape,\n Monkey and bear and highland ape.\n In each the strength, the might, the mien\n Of his own parent God were seen.\n Some chiefs of Vánar mothers came,\n Some of she-bear and minstrel dame,\n Skilled in all arms in battle's shock;\n The brandished tree, the loosened rock;\n And prompt, should other weapons fail,\n To fight and slay with tooth and nail.\n Their strength could shake the hills amain,\n And rend the rooted trees in twain,\n Disturb with their impetuous sweep\n The Rivers' Lord, the Ocean deep,\n Rend with their feet the seated ground,\n And pass wide floods with airy bound,\n Or forcing through the sky their way\n The very clouds by force could stay.\n Mad elephants that wander through\n The forest wilds, could they subdue,\n And with their furious shout could scare\n Dead upon earth the birds of air.\n So were the sylvan chieftains formed;\n Thousands on thousands still they swarmed.\n These were the leaders honoured most,\n The captains of the Vánar host,\n And to each lord and chief and guide\n Was monkey offspring born beside.\n Then by the bears' great monarch stood\n The other roamers of the wood,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 29\n \n \n And turned, their pathless homes to seek,\n To forest and to mountain peak.\n The leaders of the monkey band\n By the two brothers took their stand,\n Sugríva, offspring of the Sun.\n And Báli, Indra's mighty one.\n They both endowed with Garud's might,\n And skilled in all the arts of fight,\n Wandered in arms the forest through,\n And lions, snakes, and tigers, slew.\n But every monkey, ape, and bear\n Ever was Báli's special care;\n With his vast strength and mighty arm\n He kept them from all scathe and harm.\n And so the earth with hill, wood, seas,\n Was filled with mighty ones like these,\n Of various shape and race and kind,\n With proper homes to each assigned,\n With Ráma's champions fierce and strong\n     The earth was overspread,\n High as the hills and clouds, a throng\n     With bodies vast and dread. 1\n \n \n               *        *        *        *        *\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 27:1b  The Amrit, the nectar of the Indian\n Gods.\n 28:1  Gandharvas (Southey's Glendoveers)\n are celestial musicians inhabiting Indra's\n heaven and forming the orchestra at all\n the banquets of the principal deities.\n 28:2  Yakshas, demigods attendant especially on Kuvera, and employed by him in the\n care of his garden and treasures.\n 28:3  Kimpurushas, demigods attached also\n to the service of Kuvera, celestial musicians,\n represented like centaurs reversed\n with human figures and horses' heads.\n 28:4  Siddhas, demigods or spirits of undefined\n attributes, occupying with the Vidyádharas\n the middle air or region between\n the earth and the sun.\n \n \n Schlegel translates: 'Divi, Sapientes,\n Fidicines, Praepetes, illustres Genii, Praeconesque\n procrearunt natos, masculos, silvicolas;\n angues porro, Hippocephali Beati,\n Aligeri, Serpentesque frequentes alacriter\n generavere prolem innumerabilem.'\n 28:5  A mountain in the south of India.\n 28:6  The preceptor of the Gods and regent\n of the planet Jupiter.\n 28:7  The celestial architect, the Indian\n Hephaestus, Mulciber, or Vulcan.\n 28:8  The God of Fire.\n 28:1b  Twin children of the Sun, the physicians\n of Swarga or Indra's heaven.\n 28:2b  The deity of the waters.\n 28:3b  Parjanya, sometimes confounded with\n Indra.\n 28:4b  The bird and vehicle of Visnu.
