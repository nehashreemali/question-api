If more we can,\n Devise, O King, and tell thy plan.'\n     His chidren's speech King Sagar heard,\n And answered thus, to anger stirred:\n 'Dig on, and ne'er your labour stay\n Till through earth's depths you force your way.\n Then smite the robber dead, and bring\n The charger back with triumphing.'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 52\n \n \n     The sixty thousand chiefs obeyed:\n Deep through the earth their way they made.\n Deep as they dug and deeper yet\n The immortal elephant they met,\n Famed Virúpáksha  1 vast of size,\n Upon whose head the broad earth lies:\n The mighty beast who earth sustains\n With shaggy hills and wooded plains.\n When, with the changing moon, distressed,\n And longing for a moment's rest,\n His mighty head the monster shakes,\n Earth to the bottom reels and quakes.\n Around that warder strong and vast\n With reverential steps they passed.\n Nor, when the honour due was paid,\n Their downward search through earth delayed.\n But turning from the east aside\n Southward again their task they plied.\n There Mahápadma held his place,\n The best of all his mighty race,\n Like some huge hill, of monstrous girth,\n Upholding on his head the earth.\n When the vast beast the princes saw,\n They marvelled and were tilled with awe.\n The sons of high-souled Sagar round\n That elephant in reverence wound.\n Then in the western region they\n With might unwearied cleft their way.\n There saw they with astonisht eyes\n Saumanas, beast of mountain size.\n Round him with circling steps they went\n With greetings kind and reverent.\n     On, on--no thought of rest or stay--\n They reached the seat of Soma's sway.\n There saw they Bhadra, white as snow,\n With lucky marks that fortune show,\n Bearing the earth upon his head.\n Round him they paced with solemn tread,\n \n \n \n \n \n And honoured him with greetings kind,\n Then downward yet their way they mined.\n They gained the tract 'twixt east and north\n Whose fame is ever blazoned forth, 1b\n And by a storm of rage impelled,\n Digging through earth their course they held.\n     Then all the princes, lofty-souled,\n Of wondrous vigour, strong and bold,\n Saw Vásudeva  2b standing there\n In Kapil's form he loved to wear,\n And near the everlasting God\n The victim charger cropped the sod.\n They saw with joy and eager eyes\n The fancied robber and the prize,\n And on him rushed the furious band\n Crying aloud, Stand, villain! stand!\n 'Avaunt! avaunt!' great Kapil cried,\n His bosom flusht with passion's tide;\n Then by his might that proud array\n All scorcht to heaps of ashes lay. 3b\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 51:1  Said to be so called from the Jambu,\n or Rose Apple, abounding in it, and signifying\n according to the Purána, the central\n division of the world, the known world.\n 51:1b  Here used as a name of Vishnu.\n 51:2b  Kings are called the husbands of their\n kingdoms or of the earth; 'She and his\n kingdom were his only brides.' Raghuvans'a.\n \n \n \n   'Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate\n     A double marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,\n     And then between me and my married wife.'\n                                                 King Richard II. Act V. Sc. I.\n \n \n 51:3b  The thirty-three Gods are said in the\n Aitareya. Bráhmana.Book 1. ch. II. 10. to\n be the eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the\n twelve Àdityas, Prajápati, either Brahmá\n or Daksha, and Vashatkára or deitied\n oblation. This must have been the actual\n number at the beginning of the Vedic\n religion gradually increased by successive\n mythical and religious creations till the\n Indian Pantheon was crowded with abstractions\n of every kind. Through the reverence\n with which the words of the Veda\n were regarded, the immense host of multiplied\n divinities, in later times, still bore\n the name of the Thirty-three Gods.\n 52:1  'One of the elephants which, according\n to an ancient belief popular in India,\n supported the earth with their enormous\n backs; when one of these elephants shook\n his wearied head the earth trembled with\n its woods and hills. An idea, or rather a\n mythical fancy, similar to this, but reduced\n to proportions less grand, is found\n in Virgil when he speaks of Enceladus\n buried under Ætna:\n \n \n \n   'Fama est Enceladi semiustum fulmine corpus\n     Urgeri molo haec, ingentemque insuper Ætnam\n     Impositam, ruptis flammam expirare caminis;\n     Et fessum quoties mutat latus, intremere omnem\n     Murmure Trinacriam, et coelum subtexere fumo.'\n \n                                                                 Æneid.
