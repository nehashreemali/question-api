There came a glad reply\n From priest and mighty saint and all\n The councillors who thronged the hall.\n Then cried the king with joyous heart:\n 'To-morrow let us all depart.'\n \n \n That night the envoys entertained\n With honour and all care remained.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXIX.: Das'aratha's Visit.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LXVII.: The Breaking of The Bow.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LXIX.: Das'aratha's Visit. »",
