I needs must go\n Hence to the shades weighed down by woe.\n The king our sire will see me there,\n And cry, 'O perjured Ráma, where.\n Where is thy faith, that thou canst speed\n From exile ere the time decreed?\n     Ah Sítá, whither hast thou fled\n And left me here disquieted,\n A hapless mourner, reft of hone.\n Too feeble with my woe to cope?\n E'en thus indignant Glory flies\n The wretch who stains his soul with lies.\n If thou, my love, art lost to view,\n I in my woe must perish too.'\n     Thus Rama by big grief distraught\n Wept for the wife he vainly sought.\n And Lakshman whose fraternal breast\n Longed for his weal, the chief addressed\n \n \n p. 302\n \n \n Whose soul gave way beneath the pain\n When all his eager search was vain.\n Like some great elephant who stands\n Sinking upon the treacherous sands:\n 'Not yet, O wisest chief, despair;\n Renew thy toil with utmost care.\n This noble hill where trees are green\n Has many a cave and dark ravine.\n The Maithil lady day by day\n Delighted in the woods to stray.\n Deep in the grove she wanders still.\n Or walks by blossom-covered rill,\n Or fish-loved river stealing through\n Tall clusters of the dark bamboo.\n Or else the dame with arch design\n To prove thy mood, O Prince, and mine,\n Far in some sheltering thicket lies\n To frighten ere she meet our eyes.\n Then come, renew thy labour, trace\n The lady to her lurking-place,\n And search the wood from side to aide\n To know where Sitá loves to bide.\n Collect thy thoughts, O royal chief,\n Nor yield to unavailing grief.'\n     Thus Lakshman, by attention stirred,\n To fresh attempts his brother spurred,\n And Ráma, as he ceased, began\n With Lakshman's aid each spot to scan.\n In eager search their way they took\n Through wood, o'er hill, by pool and brook,\n They roamed each mount, nor spared to seek\n On ridge and crag and towering peak.\n They sought the dame in every spot;\n But all in vain; they found her not.\n Above, below, on every side\n They ranged the hill, and Ráma cried,\n 'O Lakshman, O my brother still\n No trace of Sítá on'the hill!'\n Then Lakshman as he roamed the wood\n Beside his glorious brother stood,\n And while fierce grief his bosom burned\n This answer to the chief retained:\n 'Thou, Ráma, after toil and pain\n Wilt meet the Maithil dame again,\n As Vishnu, Buli's might subdued,\n His empire of the earth renewed.' 1\n     Then Ráma cried in mournful tone,\n His spirit by his woe o'erthrown;\n 'The wood is searched from side to side,\n No distant spot remains untried,\n No lilied pool, no streamlet where\n The lotus buds are fresh and fair.\n Our eyes have searched the hill with all\n His caves and every waterfall,--\n But ah, not yet I find my wife,\n More precious than the breath of life.'\n     As thus he mourned his vanished dame\n A mighty trembling seized his frame,\n \n \n \n \n And by o'erpowering grief assailed,\n His troubled senses reeled and failed.\n Too great to bear his misery grew,\n And many a long hot sigh he drew,\n Then as he wept and sobbed and sighed,\n \"O Sita, O my love!' he cried.\n Then Lakshman, joining palm to palm,\n Tried every art his woe to calm.\n But Ráma in his anguish heard\n Or heeded not one soothing word.\n Still for his spouse he mourned, and shrill\n Rang out his lamentation still,\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 302:1  See Book I.
