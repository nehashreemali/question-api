The footmen\n are merely said to have been 'unnumbered.'\n 488:2b  I omit Cantos XCVII., XCVIII,and\n XCIX, which describe in the usual way\n three single combats between Sugríva and\n Angad on the Vánar side and Virúpaksha,\n Mahodar, and Mahápárs'va on the side of\n the giants. The weapons of the Vánars\n are trees and rocks: the giants fight with\n swords, axes, and bows and arrows. The\n details are generally the same as those of\n preceding duels. The giants fall, one in\n each Canto.\n \n \n Next: Canto C.: Ravan In The Field.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto XCIII.: R&aacute;van's Lament.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto C.: Ravan In The Field. »",
