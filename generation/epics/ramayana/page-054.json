Then she, in lowly mood,\n To that high saint her speech renewed:\n 'So judge not they who wisest are:\n The Brahman's might is mightier far.\n For Brahmans strength from Heaven derive,\n And warriors bow when Bráhmans strive.\n A boundless power 'tis thine to wield:\n To such a king thou shouldst not yield,\n Who, very mighty though he be,--\n So fierce thy strength,--must bow to thee.\n Command me, Saint. Thy power divine\n Has brought me here and made me thine;\n And I, howe'er the tyrant boast,\n Will tame his pride and slay his host.'\n Then cried the glorious sage: 'Create\n A mighty force the foe to mate,'\n \n \n She lowed, and quickened into life,\n Pahlavas, 1 burning for the strife,\n King Vis'vámitra's army slew\n Before the very leader's view.\n The monarch in excessive ire,\n His eyes with fury darting fire,\n Rained every missile on the foe\n Till all the Pahlavas were low.\n She, seeing all her champions slain,\n Lying by thousands on the plain.\n Created, by her mere desire,\n Yavans and S'akas, fierce and dire.\n And all the ground was overspread\n With Yavans and with S'akas dread:\n A host of warriors bright and strong,\n And numberless in closest throng:\n The threads within the lotus stem,\n So densely packed, might equal them.\n In gold-hued mail 'gainst war's attacks,\n Each bore a sword and battle-axe.\n The royal host, where'er these came,\n Fell as if burnt with ravening flame.\n \n \n The monarch, famous through the world\n Again his fearful weapons hurled,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n That made Kámbojas, 1b Barbars, 2b all,\n With Yavans, troubled, flee and fall.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 66:1  It is well known that the Persians\n were called Pahlavas by the Indians. The\n S'akas are nomad tribes inhabiting Central\n Asia, the Scythes of the Greeks, whom the\n Persians also, as Herodotus tells us, called\n S'akas just as the Indians did. Lib. VII 64\n οἱ γὰρ Πέρσαι πάντας τοὺς Σκύθας,\n καλέουσι Σάκας. The name Yavana\n seems to be used rather indefinitely for\n nations situated beyond Persia to the west....\n After the time of Alexander the\n Great the Indians as well as the Persians\n called the Greeks also Yavans.' SCHLEGEL.\n \n \n Lassen thinks that the Pahlavas were\n the same people as the Πάκτυες of Herodotus,\n and that this non-Indian people,\n dwelt on the north-west confines of India.\n \n \n Next: Canto LV.: The Hermitage Burnt.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LIII.: Vis'v&agrave;mitra's Request.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LV.: The Hermitage Burnt. »",
