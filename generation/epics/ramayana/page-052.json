I pray;\n And dost thou win by virtuous sway\n Thy people's love, discharging all\n The duties on a king that fall?\n Are all thy servants fostered well?\n Do all obey, and none rebel?\n Hast thou, destroyer of the foe,\n No enemies to overthrow?\n Does fortune, conqueror! still attend\n Thy treasure, host, and every friend!\n Is it all well? Does happy fate\n On sons and children's children wait!'\n \n \n     He spoke. The modest king replied\n That all was prosperous far and wide.\n \n \n \n \n \n p. 64\n \n \n Thus for awhile the two conversed,\n As each to each his tale rehearsed,\n And as the happy moments flew,\n Their joy and friendship stronger grew.\n When such discourse had reached an end,\n Thus spoke the saint most reverend\n To royal Vis'vamitra, while\n His features brightened with a smile:\n 'O mighty lord of men. I fain\n Would banquet thee and all thy train\n In mode that suits thy station high:\n And do not thou my prayer deny.\n Let my good lord with favour take\n The offering that I fain would make,\n And let me honour, ere we part.\n My royal guest with loving heart.'\n \n \n Him Vis'vámitra thus addressed:\n 'Why make, O Saint, this new request?\n Thy welcome and each gracious word\n Sufficient honour have conferred.\n Thou gavest roots and fruit to eat,\n The treasures of this pure retreat,\n And water for my mouth and feet;\n And--boon I prize above the rest--\n Thy presence has mine eyesight blest.\n Honoured by thee in every way,\n To whom all honour all should pay,\n I now will go. My lord, Good-bye!\n Regard me with a friendly eye.'\n \n \n Him speaking thus Vas'ishtha stayed,\n And still to share his banquet prayed.\n The will of Gádhi's son he bent,\n And won the monarch to consent,\n Who spoke in answer. 'Let it be,\n Great Hermit, as it pleases thee.'\n When, best of those who breathe the prayer,\n He heard the king his will declare,\n He called the cow of spotted skin,\n All spot without, all pure within.\n 'Come, Dapple-skin,' he cried, 'with speed;\n Hear thou my words and help at need.\n My heart is set to entertain\n This monarch and his mighty train\n With sumptuous meal and worthy fare;\n Be thine the banquet to prepare.\n Each dainty cute, each goodly dish,\n Of six-fold taste 1  as each may wish--\n All these, O cow of heavenly power,\n Rain down for me in copious shower:\n Viands and drink for tooth and lip,\n To eat, to suck, to quaff, to sip--\n Of these sufficient, and to spare,\n O plenty-giving cow, prepare.'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 63:1  Divine personages of minute size produced\n from the hair of Brahmá, and probably\n the origin of\n \n \n \n                       'That small infantry\n     Warred on by cranes.'\n \n \n 64:1  Sweet, salt, pungent, bitter, acid, and\n astringent.\n \n \n Next: Canto LIII.: Vis'vàmitra's Request.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LI.: Vis'v&aacute;mitra.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LIII.: Vis'v&agrave;mitra's Request. »",
