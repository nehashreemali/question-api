Sugríva hied\n Within the mountain's caverned side.\n Impelled by love that stirred each thought\n The precious tokens quickly brought,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n And said to Raghu's son, Behold\n This garment and these rings of gold,\n In Ráma's hand with friendly haste\n The jewels and the robe he placed.\n Then, like the moon by mist assailed,\n The tear-dimmed eyes of Ráma failed;\n That burst of woe unmanned his frame,\n Woe sprung from passion for his dame.\n And with his manly strength o'erthrown,\n He fell and cried, Ah me! mine own!\n Again, again close to his breast\n The ornaments and robe he pressed.\n While the quick pants that shook his frame\n As from a furious serpent came.\n On his dear brother standing nigh\n He turned at length his piteous eye;\n And, while his tears increasing ran,\n In bitter wail he thus began:\n 'Look, brother, and behold once more\n The ornaments and robe she wore,\n Dropped while the giant bore away\n In cruel arras his struggling prey,\n Dropped in some quiet spot, I ween,\n Where the young grass was soft and green;\n For still untouched by spot or stain\n Their former beauty all retain.'\n     He spoke with many a tear and sigh,\n And thus his brother made reply:\n 'The bracelets thou hast fondly shown,\n And earrings, are to me unknown,\n But by long service taught I greet\n The anklets of her honoured feet.' 1b\n     Then to Sugríva Ráma, best\n Of Raghu's sons, these words addressed:\n     'Say to what quarter of the sky\n The cruel fiend was seen to fly.\n Bearing afar my captured wife,\n My darling dearer tban my life.\n Speak, Vánar King, that I may know\n Where dwells the cause of all my woe;\n The fiend for whose transgression all\n The giants by this hand shall fall.\n He who the Maithil lady stole\n And kindled fury in my soul,\n Has sought his fate in senseless pride\n And opened Death's dark portal wide.\n Then toll me, Vánar lord, I pray,\n     The dwelling of my foe.\n And he, beneath this hand, to-day\n     To Yama's halls shall go.'\n \n \n \n \n p. 331\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 329:1b  Báli the king de facto.\n 329:2b  With the Indian, as with the ancient\n Greeks, the throbbing of the right eye in\n a man is an auspicious sign, the throbbing\n of the left eye is the opposite. In a woman\n the * of signs are reversed.\n \n \n On the alliance between Ráma and the\n monkeys see ADDITIONAL NOTES.\n 330:1  The Vedas stolen by the demons Madhu\n and Kait'abha.\n \n \n \"The text has (Sanskrit text) which signifies literally \"the lost vedic tradition.\"\n It seems that allusion is here made to the\n Vedas submerged in the depth of the sea,\n but promptly recovered by Vishn'u in one\n of his incarnation, as the brahmanic legend\n relates, with which the ordhodoxy of the\n Bráhmans intended perhaps to allude to\n the prompt restoration and uninterrupted\n continuity of the ancient vedic tradition.\"\n \n \n GORRESIO.\n 330:2  Like the wife of a Nága or Serpent-\n God carried off by an eagle. The enmity\n between the King of birds and the serpent\n is of very frequent occurrence. It seems\n to be a modification of the strife between\n the Vedic Indra and the Ahi, the serpent\n or drought-fiend; between Apollón, and\n the Python, Adam and the Serpent.\n 330:1b  He means that he has never ventured\n to raise his eyes to her arms and face,\n though he has ever been her devoted\n servant.\n \n \n Next: Canto VII.: Ráma Consoled.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto V.: The League.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto VII.: R&aacute;ma Consoled. »",
