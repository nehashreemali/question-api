Sugríva cried,\n And straight Sumitrá's son complied.\n Then took by Lakshman's side his place\n The sovereign of the woodland race,\n Upraised by Vánars, fleet and strong.\n Who bore the glittering load along.\n On high above his royal head\n A paly canopy was spread,\n And chouries white in many a hand\n The forehead of the monarch fanned,\n And shell and drum and song and shout\n Pealed round him as the king passed out.\n \n \n p. 370\n \n \n About the monarch went a throng\n Of Vánar warriors brave and strong,\n As onward to the mountain shade\n Where Ráma dwelt his way he made.\n Soon as the lovely spot he viewed\n Where Ráma lived in solitude,\n The Vánar monarch, far-renowed,\n With Lakshman, lightly stepped to ground,\n And to the son of Raghu went\n Joining his raised hands reverent.\n As their great leader raised his hands,\n So suppliant stood the Vánar bands.\n Well pleased the son of Raghu saw\n Those legions, hushed in reverent awe,\n Stand silent like the tranquil floods\n That raise their hands of lotus buds.\n But Ráma, when the king, to greet\n His friend, had bowed him at his feet,\n Raised him who ruled the Vanar race,\n And held him in a close embrace:\n Then, when his arms he had unknit,\n Besought him by his side to sit,\n And thus with gentle words the best\n Of men the Vánar king addressed:\n     'The prince who well his days divides,\n And knows aright the times and tides\n To follow duty, joy, or gain,\n He, only he, deserves to reign.\n But he who wealth and virtue leaves,\n And every hour to pleasure cleaves,\n False from his bliss like him who wakes\n From slumber on a branch that breaks.\n True king is he who smites his foes,\n And favour to his servants shows,\n And of that fruit makes timely use\n Which virtue, wealth, and joy produce.\n The hour is come that bids thee rise\n To aid me in my enterprise.\n Then call thy nobles to debate,\n And with their help deliberate.'\n     'Lost was my power,' the king replied,\n 'All strength had fled, all hope had died\n The Vánars owned another lord,\n But by thy grace was all restored.\n All this, O conqueror of the foe,\n To thee and Lakshman's aid I owe\n And his should be the villain's shame\n Who durst deny the sacred claim.\n These Vánar chiefs of noblest birth\n Have at my bidding roamed the earth,\n And brought from distant regions all\n Our legions at their monarch's call:\n Fierce bears with monkey troops combined,\n And apes of every varied kind,\n Terrific in their forms, who dwell\n In grove and wood and bosky dell:\n The bright Gaudharvas' brood, the seed\n Of Gods, 1  they change their shapes at need.\n \n \n \n \n Each with his legions in array,\n Hither, O Prince, they make their way,\n They come: and tens of millions swell\n To numbers that no tongue may tell. 1b\n For thee their armies will unite\n With chiefs, Mahendra's peers in might.\n From Meru and from Vindhya's chain\n They come like clouds that bring the rain.\n These round thee to the war will go,\n To smite to earth thy demon foe;\n Will slay the Rákshas and restore\n Thy consort when the fight is o'er.\"\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 370:1  See Book I.
