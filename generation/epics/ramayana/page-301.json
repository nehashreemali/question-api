 1\n And opening flowers of every hue\n Give wondrous beauty to the view.\n See, too, this pleasant water near\n Our cavern home is fresh and clear;\n And lilies gay with flower and bud\n Are glorious on the lovely flood.\n This cave that fares north and east\n Will shelter us till rain has ceased;\n And towering hills thut rise behind\n Will screen us from the furious wind.\n Close by the cavern's portal lies\n And level stone of ample size\n And sable hue, a mighty block\n Long severed from the parent rock.\n Now let thine eye bent northward rest\n \n \n \n \n A while upon that mountain creat,\n High as a cloud that brings the rain,\n And dark as iron rent in twain.\n Look southward, brother, now and view\n A cloudy pile of paler hue\n Like Mount Kailása's topmost height\n Where ores of every tint are bright,\n See, Lakshman, see before our cave\n That clear brook eastward roll its wave\n As though 'twere Ganga's infant rill\n Down streaming from the three-peaked bill\n See, by the water's gentle flow\n As'oka, sal, and sandal grow.\n And every lovely tree most fair\n With leaf and bud and flower is there.\n See there, beneath the bending trees\n That fringe her bank, the river flees,\n Clothed with their beauty like a maid\n In all her robes and gems arrayed,\n While from the sedgy banks are heard\n The soft notes of each amorous bird.\n O see what lovely islets stud\n Like gems the bosom of the flood.\n And sárases and wild swans crowd\n About her till she laughs aloud.\n See, lotus blooms the brook o'erspread,\n Some tender blue, some dazzling red,\n And opening lilies white as snow\n Their buds in rich profusion show.\n There rings the joyous peacock's scream,\n There stands the curlew by the stream,\n And holy hermits love to throng\n Where the sweet waters speed along.\n Ranged on the grassy margin shine\n Gay sandal trees in glittering line,\n And all the wondrous verdure seems\n The offspring of creative dreams,\n O conquering Prince, there cannot be\n A lovelier place than this we see.\n Here sheltered on the beauteous height\n Our days will pass in calm delight.\n \n \n Nor is Kishkindhá's city, gay\n With grove and garden, far away.\n Thence will the breeze of evening bring\n Sweet music as the minstrels sing;\n And, when the Vánars dance, will come\n The sound of labour and of drum.\n Again to spouse and realm restored.\n Girt by his friends, the Vánar lord\n Great glory has acquired; and how\n Can he be less than happy now?'\n This said, the son of Raghu made\n His dwelling in that pleasant shade\n Upon the mountain's shelving side\n That sweetly all his wants supplied.\n But still the hero's troubled mind\n No comfort in his woe could find.\n Yet mourning for his stolen wife\n Dearer to Ráma than his life.\n Chief when he saw the Lord of Night\n Rise slowly o'er the eastern height,\n \n \n p. 358\n \n \n He tossed upon his leafy  bed\n With eyes by sleep unvisited.\n Outwelled the tears in ceaseless flow,\n And every sense was numbed by woe.\n Each pang that pierced the mourner through\n Smote Lakshman's faithful bosom too,\n Who, troubled for his brother's sake,\n With wisest words the prince bespake:\n 'Arise, my brother, and be strong:\n Thy hero heart has mourned too long.\n Thou knowest well that tears and sighs\n Will mar the mightiest enterprise.\n Thine was the soul that loved to dare:\n To serve the Gods was still thy care;\n And ne'er may sorrow's sting subdue\n A heart so resolute and true.\n How canst thou hope to slay in fight\n The giant cruel in his might?\n Unwearied must the champion be\n Who strives with such a foe as he.\n Tear out this sorrow by the root;\n Again be bold and resolute.\n Arise, my brother, and subdue\n The demon and his wicked crew.\n Thou canst destroy the earth, her seas,\n Her rooted hills and giant trees\n Unseated by thy furious hand:\n And shall one fiend thy power withstand?\n Wait through this season of the rain\n Till suns of autumn dry the plain,\n Then shall thy giant foe, and all\n His host and realm, before thee fall.\n I wake thy valour that has slept\n Amid the tears thine eyes have wept;\n As drops of oil in worship raise\n The dormant flame to sudden blaze.'\n \n \n The son of Raghu heard: he knew\n His brother's rede was wise and true;\n And, honouring his friendly guide,\n In gentle words he thus replied:\n 'Whate'er a hero firm and bold,,\n Devoted, true, and lofty-souled\n Should speak by deep affection led,\n Such are the words which thou hast said.\n I cast away each pensive thought\n That brings the noblest plans to naught,\n And each uninjured power will strain\n Until the purposed end we gain.\n Thy prudent words will I obey,\n And till the close of rain-time stay,\n When King Sugríva will invite\n To action, and the streams be bright.\n The hero saved in hour of need\n Repays the debt with friendly deed:\n But hated by the good are they\n Who take the boon and ne'er repay.'\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 357:1  Vitex Negundo.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXVIII.: The Rains.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto XXVI.: The Coronation.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto XXVIII.: The Rains. »",
