no more complain:\n Reproaches and laments are vain.\n For thou art justly punished: we\n Obey our king and are not free.\n Once more, O Báli, lend thine ear\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Another weightiest plea to hear.\n For this, when heard and pondered well.\n Will all complaint and rage dispel.\n My soul will ne'er this deed repent,\n Nor was my shaft in anger sent.\n We take the silvan tribes beset\n With snare and trap and gin and net,\n And many a heedless deer we smite\n From thickest shade, concealed from sight.\n Wild for the slaughter of the game,\n At stately stags our shafts we aim.\n We strike them bounding scared away,\n We strike them as they stand at bay,\n When careless in the shade they lie,\n Or scan the plain with watchful eye.\n They turn away their heads; we aim,\n And none the eager hunter blame.\n Each royal saint, well trained in law\n Of duty, loves his bow to draw\n And strike the quarry, e'en as thou\n Hast fallen by mine arrow now,\n Fiphting with him or unaware,--\n A Vánar thou.--I little care. 1b\n But yet, O best of Vánars, know\n That kings who rule the earth bestow\n Fruit of pure life and virtuous deed.\n And lofty duty's hard-won meed.\n Harm not thy lord the king: abstain\n From ant and word that cause him pain;\n For kings are children of the skies\n Who walk this earth in men's disguise.\n But thou, in duty's claims untaught,\n thy breast with blinding passion fraught,\n Assailest me who still have clung\n To duty, with thy bitter tongue.'\n     He ceased; and Ball sore distressed\n The sovereign claims of law confessed,\n And freed, o'erwhelmed with woe and shame,\n The lord of Raghu's race from blame.\n Then, reverent palm to palm applied,\n To Ráma thus the Vánar cried:\n 'True, best of men, is every word\n That from thy lips these ears have heard,\n It ill beseems a wretch like me\n To bandy empty words with thee.\n Forgive the angry taunts that broke\n From my wild bosom as I spoke.\n And lay not to my charge, O King,\n \n \n \n \n p. 348\n \n \n My mad reproaches' idle sting.\n Thou, in the truth by trial trained,\n Best knowledge of the right hast gained:\n And layest, just and pure within,\n The meetest penalty on sin.\n Through every bond of law I burst,\n The boldest sinner and the worst.\n O let thy right-instructing speech\n Console my heart and wisely teach.'\n     Like some sad elephant who stands\n Fast sinking in the treacherous sands,\n Thus Báli raised despairing eyes;\n Then spake again with sobs and sighs:\n     'Not for myself, O King, I grieve,\n For Tárá or the friends I leave,\n As for sweet Angad, my dear son,\n My noble, only little one.\n For, nursed in luxury and bliss,\n His father he will mourn and miss,\n And like a stream whose fount is dry\n Will waste away and sink and die,--\n My own dear child, my only boy,\n His mother Tárá's hope and joy.\n Spare him, O son of Raghu, spare\n The child entrusted to thy care.\n My Angad and Sugríva treat\n E'en as thy heart considers meet,\n For thou, O chief of men, art strong\n To guard the right and punish wrong.\n O, if thou wilt thine ear incline\n To hear these dying words of mine,\n He and Sugríva will to thee\n As Bharat and as Lakshman be.\n Let not my Tárá, left forlorn,\n Weep for Sugríva's wrathful scorn;\n Nor let him, for her lord's offence,\n Condemn her faithful innocence.\n And well and wisely may he reign\n If thy dear grace his power sustain:\n If, following thee his friend and guide,\n He turn not from thy hest aside:\n Thus may he reign with glory, nay\n Thus to the skies will win his way.\n Though stayed by Tárá's fond recall,\n By thy dear hand I longed to fall.\n Against my brother rushed and fought,\n And gained the death I long have sought.'\n     Then Ráma thus the prince consoled\n From whose clear eyes the mists were rolled:\n 'Grieve not for those thou leavest thus,\n Nor tremble for thyself or us,\n For we will deal with thine and thee\n As duty and the laws decree.\n He who exacts and he who pays,\n Is justly slain or justly slays,\n Shall in the life to come have bliss;\n For each has done his task in this.\n Thou, wandering from the right, art made\n Pure by the forfeit thou hast paid.\n Thy weight of sins is cast aside,\n And duty's claim is satisfied.\n Then grieve no more, O Prince, but clear\n Thy bosom from all doubt and fear,\n For fate, inexorably stern,\n Thou hast no power to move or turn.\n Thy princely Angad still will share\n My tender love. Sugríva's care;\n And to thy offspring shall be shown\n Affection that shall match thine own.'\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 346:1  Hayagríva, Horse-necked, is a form\n of Vishnu\n 346:2  \"As'vatara is the name of a chief of\n the Nágas or serpents which inhabit the\n regions under the earth; it is also the\n name of a Gandharva. As'vatarí ought\n to be the wife of one of the two, but I am\n not sure that this conjecture is right. The\n commentator does not say who this As'vatarí\n is, or what tradition or myth, is alluded\n to. Vimalabodha reads As'vatarí\n in the nominative case, and explains, As'vatarí\n is the sun, and as the sun with his\n rays brings back the moon which has been\n sunk in the ocean and the infernal regions,\n so will I bring back Sítá.\" GORRESIO.\n 346:3  That is, 'Consider what answer you\n can give to your accusers when they\n charge you with injustice in killing me.'\n 347:1  Manu, Book VIII. 318. \"But men who\n have committed offences and have received\n from kings the punishment due to them,\n go pure to heaven and become as clear as\n those who have done well.\"\n 347:2  Mándhátá was one of the earlier descendants\n of Ikshváku. His name is mentioned\n in Ráma's genealogy, p. 81.\n 347:1b  I cannot understand how Válmíki\n could put such an excuse as this into\n Ráma's mouth. Ráma with all solemn\n ceremony, has made a league of alliance\n with Báli's younger brother whom he\n regards as a dear friend and almost as an\n equal, and now he winds up his reasons\n for killing Báli by coolly saying: 'Besides\n you are only a monkey, you know, after\n all, and as such I have every right to kill\n you how, when, and where I like.'\n \n \n Next: Canto XIX.: Tárá's Grief.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto XVII.: B&aacute;li's Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto XIX.: T&aacute;r&aacute;'s Grief. »",
