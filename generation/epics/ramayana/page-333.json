Again Sampáti spoke,\n And hope in every breast awoke:\n 'Though lost my wings, and strength decayed,\n Yet shall my words lend Ráma aid.\n I know the worlds where Vishnu trod, 1b\n I know the realm of Ocean's God;\n How Asurs fought with heavenly foes,\n And Amrit from the churning rose. 2b\n A mighty task before me lies,\n To prosper Ráma's enterprise,\n A task too hard for one whom length\n Of days has rifled of his strength.\n I saw the cruel Rávan bear\n A gentle lady through the air.\n Bright washer form, and fresh and young,\n And sparkling gems about her hung.\n 'O Ráma, Ráma!' cried the dame,\n And shrieked in terror Lakshman's name,\n As, struggling in the giant's hold,\n She dropped her gauds of gems and gold.\n Like sun-light on a mountain shone\n The silken garments she had on,\n And glistened o'er his swarthy form\n As lightning flashes through the storm.\n That giant Rávan, famed of old,\n Is brother of the Lord of Gold. 3b\n The southern ocean roars and swells\n Round Lanká, where the robber dwells\n In his fair city nobly planned\n And built by Vis'vakarmá's 4b hand.\n Within his bower securely barred,\n With monsters round her for a guard,\n Still in her silken vesture clad\n Lies Sitá, and her heart is sad.\n A hundred leagues your course must be\n Beyond this margin of the sea.\n Still to the south your way pursue,\n And there the giant Rávan view.\n Then up, O Vánars, and away!\n For by my heavenly lore I say,\n There will you see the lady's face.\n And hither soon your steps retrace.\n In the first field of air are borne\n The doves and birds that feed on corn.\n The second field supports the crows\n And birds whose food on branches grows.\n Along the third in balanced flight\n Sail the keen osprey and the kite.\n Swift through the fourth the falcon springs\n The fifth the slower vulture wings.\n Up to the sixth the gay swans rise,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 388\n \n \n Where royal Vainateya  1 flies.\n We too, O chiefs, of vulture race,\n Our line from Vinatá may trace,\n Condemned, because we wrought a deed\n Of shame, on flesh and blood to feed.\n But all Suparna's  2 wondrous powers\n And length of keenest sight are ours,\n That we a hundred leagues away\n Through fields of air descry our prey.\n Now from this spot my gazing eye\n Can Rávan and the dame descry.\n Devise some plan to overleap\n This barrier of the briny deep.\n Find the Videhan lady there,\n And joyous to your home repair.\n Me too, O Vánars. to the side\n Of Varun's  3 home the ocean, guide,\n Where due libations shall be paid\n To my great-hearted brother's shade.'\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 387:1  Vritra, 'the coverer, hider, obstructer\n (of rain)' is the name of the Vedic personification\n of an imaginary malignant\n influence or demon of darkness and\n drought supposed to take possession of\n the clouds, causing them to obstruct the\n clearness of the sky and keep back the\n waters. Indra is represented as battling\n with this evil influence, and the pent-up\n clouds being practically represented as\n mountains or castles are shattered by his\n thunderbolt and made to open their receptacle.\n 387:1b  Frequent mention has been made of\n the three steps of Vishnu typifying the\n rising, culmination, and setting of the sun.\n 387:2b  For the Churning of the Sea, see\n Book I, Canto XLV.\n 387:3b  Kuvera, the God of Wealth.\n 387:4b  The Architect of the Gods.\n \n \n Next: Canto LIX.: Sampati's Story.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto LVII.: Angad's Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto LIX.: Sampati's Story. »",
