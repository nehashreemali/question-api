For the month Chaitra is the\n first of the two months assigned to the\n spring; it corresponds with the latter\n half of March and the former half of\n April in our division of the year. Aditi,\n the mother of the Gods, is lady of the\n seventh lunar mansion which is called\n Punarvasu. The five planets and their\n positions in the Zodiac are thus enumerated\n by both commentators: the Sun\n in Aries, Mars in Capricorn, Saturn in\n Libra, Jupiter in Cancer, Venus in Pisces....\n I leave to astronomers to examine\n whether the parts of the description agree\n with one another, and, if this be the case,\n thence to deduce the date. The Indians\n place the nativity of Ráma in the confines\n of the second age (tretá) and the third\n (dwápara): but it seems that this should\n be taken in an allegorical sense....\n We may consider that the poet had an\n eye to the time in which, immediately\n before his own age, the aspects of the\n heavenly bodies were such as he has\n described.' SCHLEGEL.\n 31:2b  The regent of the planet Jupiter.\n 31:3b  Indra=Jupiter Tonans.\n 32:1  'Pushya is the name of a month;\n but here it means the eighth mansion.\n The ninth is called Aslesh, or the snake.\n It is evident from this that Bharat, though\n his birth is mentioned before that of the\n twins, was the youngest of the four\n brothers and Rama's junior by eleven\n months' SCHLEGEL.\n 32:2  A fish, the Zodiacal sign Pisces.\n 32:3   One of the constellations, containing\n stars in the wing of Pegasus.\n 32:4  Ráma means the Delight (of the World);\n Bharat, the Supporter: Lakshman, the\n Auspicious; S'atrughna,  Slayer of' Foes.\n \n \n Next: Canto XX.: Vis'vámitra's Visit.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto XVIII.: Rishyas'ring's Departure.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto XX.: Vis'v&aacute;mitra's Visit. »",
