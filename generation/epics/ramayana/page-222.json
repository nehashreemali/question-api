Then he braced\n His coat of mail around his waist.\n When, bright as blazing fire, upon\n His mighty limbs that armour shone,\n The hero stood like some great light\n Uprising in the dark of night.\n His dreadful shafts were by his side;\n His trusty bow he bent and plied.\n Prepared he stood: the bowstring rang,\n Filling the welkin with the clang.\n \n \n The high-souled Gods together drew\n The wonder of the fight to view,\n The saints made free from spot and stain,\n And bright Gandharvas' heavenly train.\n Each glorious sage the assembly sought,\n Each saint divine of loftiest thought,\n And filled with zeal for Ráma's sake.\n Thus they whose deeds were holy spake:\n \n \n 'Now be it well with Bráhmans, now\n Well with the worlds and every cow!\n Let Ráma in the deadly fray\n The fiends who walk in darkness slay,\n As He who bears the discus 1 slew\n The chieftains of the Asur crew.'\n \n \n Then each with anxious glances viewed\n His fellow and his speech renewed:\n 'There twice seven thousand giants stand\n With impious heart and cruel hand:\n Here Ráma stands, by virtue known:\n How can the hero fight alone?'\n \n \n Thus royal sage and Bráhman saint,\n Spirit, and Virtue free from taint,\n And all the Gods of heaven who rode\n On golden cars, their longing showed.\n Their hearts with doubt and terror rent,\n They saw the giants' armament,\n And Ráma clothed in warrior might,\n Forth standing in the front of fight.\n Lord of the arm no toil might tire,\n He stood majestic in his ire,\n Matchless in form as Rudra 2 when\n His wrath is fierce on Gods or men.\n \n \n While Gods and saints in close array\n Held converse of the coming fray,\n The army of the fiends drew near\n With sight and sound that counselled fear.\n Long, loud and deep their war-cry pealed,\n As on they rushed with flag and shield,\n Each, of his proper valour proud,\n Urging to fight the demon crowd.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n His ponderous bow each warrior tried,\n And swelled his bulk with martial pride.\n 'Mid shout and roar and trampling feet.\n And thunder of the drums they beat,\n Loud and more loud the tumult went\n Throughout the forest's vast extent,\n And all the life that moved within\n The woodland trembled at the din.\n In eager haste all fled to find\n Some tranquil spot, nor looked behind.\n \n \n With every arm of war supplied,\n On-rushing wildly like the tide\n Of some deep sea, the giant host\n Approached where Ráma kept his post.\n Then he, in battle skilled and tried,\n Bent his keen eye on every side,\n And viewed the host of Khara face\n To face before his dwelling-place.\n He drew his arrows forth, and reared\n And strained that bow which foemen feared,\n And yielded to the vengeful sway\n Of fierce desire that host to slay.\n Terrific as the ruinous fire\n That ends the worlds, he glowed in ire;\n And his tremendous form dismayed\n The Gods who roam the forest shade.\n For in the furious wrath that glowed\n Within his soul the hero showed\n Like S'iva when his angry might\n Stayed Daksha's sacrificial rite. 1b\n Like some great cloud at dawn of day\n     When first the sun upsprings,\n And o'er the gloomy mass each ray\n     A golden radiance flings:\n Thus showed the children of the night,\n     Whose mail and chariots threw,\n With gleam of bows and armlets bright,\n     Flashes of flamy hue.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 257:1  Vishnu, who bears a chakra or discus.\n 257:2  S'iva.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXV.: The Battle.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XXIII.: The Omens.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XXV.: The Battle. »",
