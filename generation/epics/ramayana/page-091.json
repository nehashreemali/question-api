Minor degrees of\n merit procure only leases of heavenly\n mansions terminable after periods proportioned\n to the fund which buys them. King\n Yayáti went to heaven and when his term\n expired was unceremoniously ejected, and\n thrown down to earth.\n \n \n Next: Canto XIV.: Ráma Summoned.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XII.: Dasaratha's Lament.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XIV.: R&aacute;ma Summoned. »",
