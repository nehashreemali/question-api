I ween, would tame\n The vigour of the glorious flame.\n If I to cool my fever tried\n To cross the deep from side to side.\n The sea,--so hard my fate,--would dry\n His waters as my feet came nigh.\n In all this world there lives not one\n So cursed as I beneath the sun;\n So strong a net of misery cast\n Around me holds the captive fast,\n Best of all birds that play the wing,\n Loved, honoured by our sire the king,\n The vulture, in my fate enwound,\n Lies bleeding, dying on the ground.'\n     Then Ráma and his brother stirred\n \n \n p. 309\n \n \n By pity mourned the royal bird,\n And, as their hands his limbs caressed,\n Affection for a sire expressed.\n And Ráma to his bosom strained\n The bird with mangled wings distained,\n     With crimson blood-drops dyed.\n He fell, and shedding many a tear,\n     'Where is my spouse than life more dear?\n         Where is my love?' he cried.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXIX.: The Death of Jatáyus.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto LXVII.: R&aacute;ma Appeased.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto LXIX.: The Death of Jat&aacute;yus. »",
