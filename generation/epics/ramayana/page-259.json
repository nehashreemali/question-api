I see\n Thy form half hidden by the tree.\n Stay if thou love me, Sítá, stay\n In pity cease thy heartless play,\n Why mock me now? thy gentle breast\n Was never prone to cruel jest.\n 'Tis vain behind yon bush to steal:\n Thy shimmering silks thy path reveal.\n Fly not, mine eyes pursue thy way;\n For pity's sake, dear Sítá, stay.\n Ah me, ah me, my words are vain;\n My gentle love is lost or slain.\n How could her tender bosom spurn\n Her husband on his home-return?\n Ah no, my love is surely dead,\n Fierce giants on her flesh have fed,\n Rending the soft limbs of their prey\n When I her lord was far away.\n That moon-bright face, that polished brow,\n Red lips, bright teeth--what are they now?\n Alas, my darling's shapely neck\n She loved with chains of gold to deck.--\n That neck that mocked the sandal scent,\n The ruthless fiends have grasped and rent\n Alas, 'twas vain those arms to raise\n Soft as the young tree's tender sprays\n Ah, dainty meal for giants' lips\n Were arms and quivering finger tips.\n Ah, she who counted many a friend\n Was left for fiends to seize and rend,\n Was left by me without defence\n From ravening giants' violence.\n O Lakshman of the arm of might,\n \n \n Say, is my darling love in sight;\n O dearest Sítá. where art thou?\n Where is my darling consort now?'\n     Thus as he cried in wild lament\n From grove to grove the mourner went.\n Here for a moment sank to rest.\n Then started up and onward pressed.\n Thus roaming on like one distraught\n Still for his vanished love he sought.\n He searched in wood and hill and glade,\n By rock and brook and wild cascade.\n Through groves with restless step he sped\n And left no spot unvisited.\n Through lawns and woods of vast extent\n Still searching for his love he went\n     With eager steps and fast.\n For many a weary hour he toiled,\n Still in his fond endeavour foiled,\n     Yet hoping to the last.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 300:1  As'oka is compounded of a not and\n s'oka grief.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXII.: Ráma's Lament.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto LX.: Lakshman Reproved.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto LXII.: R&aacute;ma's Lament. »",
