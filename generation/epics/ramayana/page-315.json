beyond it, dark and drear,\n Lies the departed spirits' sphere,\n And, girt with darkness, far from bliss,\n Is Yama's sad metropolis. 2\n So far, my lords, o'er land and sea\n Vour destined course is plain and free.\n Beyond your steps you may not set,\n Where living thing ne'er journeyed yet.\n With utmost care these realms survey,\n And all you meet upon the way.\n And, when the lady's course is traced,\n Back to your king, O Vánars, haste.\n And he who tells me he has seen.\n After long search, the Maithil queen,\n Shall gain a noble guerdon: he\n In power and bliss shall equal me.\n Dear as my very life, above\n His fellows in his master's love;\n I call him, yea though stained with crime.\n My kinsman from that happy time.'\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 374:1b  Suhotra, S'arári, S'aragulma, Gain,\n Gavák-ha, Gavaya, Sushena, Gandhamádana,\n Ulkámukha, and Ananga.\n 374:2b  The modern Nerbudda.\n 374:3b  Krishnavení is mentioned in the Vishnu\n Purnna as 'the deep Krishnaven' '*\n but there appears to be no clue to its\n identification.\n 374:4b  The modern Godavery.\n 374:5b  The Mekbaias or Mekalas according\n to the Patánas live in the Vindhya hills,\n but here they appear among the peoples\n of the south.\n 374:6b  Utkal is still the native nameof Oriss*.\n 374:7b  The land of the people of the 'ten\n forts.'
