speak\n Before I rend thee peak from peak.'\n     The mountain seemed her track to show,\n But told not all he sought to know.\n Then Das'aratha's son renewed\n His summons as the mount he viewed:\n 'Soon as my flaming arrows fly,\n Consumed to ashes shall thou lie\n Without a herb or bud or tree,\n And birds no more shall dwell in thee.\n And if this stream my prayer deny,\n My wrath this day her flood shall dry,\n Because she lends no aid to trace\n My darling of the lotus face.'\n     Thus Ráma spake as though his ire\n Would scorch them with his glance of fire;\n Then searching farther on the ground\n The footprint of a fiend he found,\n And small light traces here and there,\n Where Sítá in her great despair,\n Shrieking for Ráma's help, had fled\n Before the giant's mighty tread.\n His careful eye each trace surveyed\n Which Sítá and the fiend had made,--\n The quivers and the broken bow\n And ruined chariot of the foe,--\n And told, distraught by fear and grief,\n His tidings to his brother chief:\n     'O Lakshman, here,' he cried 'behold\n My Sítá's earrings dropped with gold.\n Here lie her garlands torn and rent,\n Here lies each glittering ornament.\n O look, the ground on every side\n With blood-like drops of gold is dyed.\n The fiends who wear each strange disguise\n Have seized, I ween, the helpless prize.\n My lady, by their hands o'erpowered,\n Is slaughtered, mangled, and devoured.\n Methinks two fearful giants came\n And waged fierce battle for the dame.\n Whose, Lakshman, was this mighty bow\n With pearls and gems in glittering row\n Cast to the ground the fragments lie,\n And still their glory charms the eye.\n A bow so mighty sure was planned\n For heavenly God or giant's hand.\n Whose was this coat of golden mail\n Which, though its lustre now is pale,\n Shone like the sun of morning, bright\n With studs of glittering lazulite?\n Whose, Lakshman, was this bloom-wreathed shade\n With all its hundred ribs displayed?\n This screen, most meet for royal brow,\n With broken staff lies useless now.\n And these tall asses, goblin-faced,\n With plates of golden harness graced,\n Whose hideous forms are stained with gore\n Who is the lord whose yoke they bore?\n Whose was this pierced and broken car\n That shoots a flame-like blaze afar?\n Whose these spent shafts at random spread,\n Each fearful with its iron head,--\n With golden mountings fair to see,\n Long as a chariot's axle-tree?\n These quivers see, which, rent in twain,\n Their sheaves of arrows still contain.\n Whose was this driver? Dead and cold,\n His hands the whip and reins still hold.\n See, Lakshman, here the foot I trace\n Of man, nay, one of giant race.\n The hatred that I nursed of old\n Grows mightier now a hundred fold\n Against these giants, fierce of heart,\n Who change their forms by magic art.\n Slain, eaten by the giant press,\n Or stolen is the votaress,\n Nor could her virtue bring defence\n To Sítá seized and hurried hence.\n O, if my love be slain or lost\n All hope of bliss for me is crossed.\n The power of all the worlds were vain\n To bring one joy to soothe my pain.\n The spirits with their blinded eyes\n Would look in wonder, and despise\n The Lord who made the worlds, the great\n Creator when compassionate.\n And so, I ween, the Immortals turn\n Cold eyes upon me now, and spurn\n \n \n p. 306\n \n \n The weakling prompt at pity's call,\n Devoted to the good of all.\n But from this day behold me changed,\n From every gentle grace estranged.\n Now be it mine all life to slay,\n And sweep these cursed fiends away.\n As the great sun leaps up the sky,\n And the cold moonbeams fade and die,\n So vengeance rises in my breast.\n One passion conquering all the rest.\n Gandharvas in their radiant place,\n The Yakshas, and the giant race,\n Kinnars and men shall look in vain\n For joy they ne'er shall see again.\n The anguish of my great despair,\n O Lakshman, fills the heaven and air;\n And I in wrath all life will slay\n Within the triple world to-day.\n Unless the Gods in heaven who dwell\n Restore my Sítá safe and well,\n I armed with all the fires of Fate.\n The triple world will devastate.\n The troubled stars from heaven shall fall,\n The moon be wrapped in gloomy pall,\n The fire be quenched, the wind be stilled,\n The radiant sun grow dark and chilled;\n Crushed every mountain's towering pride,\n And every lake and river dried,\n Dead every creeper, plant, and tree,\n And lost for aye the mighty sea.\n Thou shalt the word this day behold\n In wild disorder uncontrolled,\n With dying life which naught defends\n From the fierce storm my bowstring sends.\n My shafts this day, for Sítá's sake,\n The life of every fiend shall take.\n The Gods this day shall see the force\n That wings my arrows on their course,\n And mark how far that course is held,\n By my unsparing wrath impelled.\n No God, not one of Daitya strain,\n Goblin or Rákshas shall remain.\n My wrath shall end the worlds, and all\n Demons and Gods therewith shall fall.\n Each world which Gods, the Dánav race,\n And giants make their dwelling place,\n Shall fall beneath my arrows sent\n In fury when my bow is bent.\n The arrows loosened from my string\n Confusion on the worlds shall bring.\n For she is lost or breathes no more,\n Nor will the Gods my love restore.\n Hence all on earth with life and breath\n This day I dedicate to death.\n All, till my darling they reveal,\n The fury of my shafts shall feel.'\n   Thus as he spake by rage impelled,\n Red grew his eyes, his fierce lips swelled.\n His bark coat round his form he drew\n And coiled his hermit braids anew.\n Like Rudra when he yearned to slay\n The demon Tripur  1 in the fray.\n So looked the hero brave and wise,\n The fury flashing from his eyes.\n Then Ráma, conqueror of the foe,\n From Lakshman's hand received his bow,\n Strained the great string, and laid thereon\n A deadly dart that flashed and shone,\n And spake these words as fierce in ire\n As He who ends the worlds with fire:\n     'As age and time and death and fate\n All life with checkless power await,\n So Lakshman in my wrath to-day\n My vengeful might shall brook no stay,\n Unless this day I see my dame\n In whose sweet form is naught to blame,--\n Yea, as before, my love behold\n Fair with bright teeth and perfect mould,\n This world shall feel a deadly blow\n Destroyed with ruthless overthrow,\n And serpent lords and Gods of air,\n Gandharvas, men, the doom shall share.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXVI.: Lakshman's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto LXIV.: Rama's Lament.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto LXVI.: Lakshman's Speech. »",
