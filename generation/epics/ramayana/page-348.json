That\n scholar justly observes: \"The eleventh\n chapter, Description of Evening, is certainly\n the work of the Rhapsodists and\n an interpolation of later date. The chapter\n might be omitted without any injury\n to the action of the poem, and besides the\n metre, style, conceits and images differ\n from the general tenour of the poem;\n and that continual repetition of the same\n sounds at the end of each hemistich which\n is not exactly rime, but assonance, reveals\n the artificial labour of a more recent age.'\n The following sample will probably be\n enough. I am unable to show the difference\n of style in a translation:\n \n \n \n Fair shone the moon, as if to lend\n His cheering light to guide a friend,\n And, circled by the starry host,\n Looked down upon the wild sea-coast.\n The Vánar cheiftain raised his eyes,\n And saw him sailing through the skies\n Like a bright swan who joys to take\n His pastime on a silver lake;\n Fair moon that calms the mourner's pain.\n Heaves up the waters of the main,\n And o'er the *hie beneath him throws\n A tender light of soft repose,\n The charm that clings to Mandar's hill,\n Gleams in the sea when winds are still,\n And decks the lilly's opening flower,\n Showed in that moon her sweetest power.\n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto VII.: Ravan's Palace.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto IV.: Within The City.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto VII.: Ravan's Palace. »",
