From first to last\n Thine ears have heard whate'er has past.\n Rama the mighty lord and I\n For refuge to Sugríva fly.\n The prince whose arm bright glory gained.\n O'er the whole earth as monarch reigned,\n And richest gifts to others gave,\n Is come Sugríva's help to crave;\n Son of a king the surest friend\n Of virtue, him who loved to lend\n His succour to the suffering weak,\n Is come Sugríva's aid to seek.\n Yes, Raghu's son whose matchless hand\n Protected all this sea-girt land,\n The virtuous prince, my holy guide,\n For refuge seeks Sugríva's side.\n His favour sent on great and small\n Should ever save and prosper all.\n He now to win Sugríva's grace\n Has sought his woodland dwelling-place.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 328\n \n \n Son of a king of glorious fame;--\n Who knows not Das'aratha's name?--\n From whom all princes of the earth\n Received each honour due to worth;--\n Heir of that best of earthly kings,\n Ráma the prince whose glory rings\n Through realms below and earth and skies,\n For refuge to Sugríva flies.\n Nor should the Vánar king refuse\n The boon for which the suppliant sues,\n But with his forest legions speed\n To save him in his utmost need.\n     Sumitrá's son, his eyes bedewed\n With piteous tears, thus sighed and sued.\n Then, trained in all the arts that guide\n The speaker, Hanumán replied:\n     'Yea, lords like you of wisest thought,\n Whom happy fate has hither brought,\n Who vanquish ire and rule each sense,\n Must of our lord have audience.\n Reft of his kingdom, sad, forlorn,\n Once Báli's hate now Báli's scorn,\n Defeated, severed from his spouse,\n Wandering under forest boughs,\n Child of the Sun, our lord and king\n Sugríva will his succours bring,\n And all our Vánar hosts combined\n Will trace the dame you long to find.'\n     With gentle tone and winning grace\n Thus spake the chief of Vánar race,\n And then to Raghu's son he cried:\n 'Come, haste we to Sugrivá's side.'\n     He spoke, and for his words so sweet\n Good Lakshman' paid all honour meet;\n Then turned and cried to Raghu's son:\n 'Now deem thy task already done,\n Because this chief of Vánar kind,\n Son of the God who rules the wind,\n Declares Sugríva's self would be\n Assisted in his need by thee.\n Bright gleams of joy his cheek o'erspread\n As each glad word of hope he said;\n And ne'er will one so valiant deign\n To cheer our hearts with hope in vain.'\n     He spoke, and Hanúmán the wise\n Cast off his mendicant disguise,\n And took again his Vánar form,\n Son of the God of wind and storm.\n High on his ample back in haste\n Baghu's heroic sons he placed.\n And turned with rapid steps to find\n The sovereign of the Vánar kind.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 327:1  \"In our own metrical romances, or\n wherever a poem is meant not for readers\n but for chanters and oral reciters, these\n formulae, to meet the same recurring case,\n exist by scores. Thus every woman in\n these metrical romances who happens to\n be young, is described as \"so bright of ble,\"\n or complexion; always a man goes \"the\n mountenance of a mule\" before he overtakes\n or is overtaken. And so on through.\n a vast bead-roll of cases. In the same\n spirit Homer has his eternal δ᾽αῤ\n ὑποδρα ιδων, or τον δ᾽απαμειβομενος\n προσεφη, &c.\n \n \n To a reader of sensibility, such recurrences\n wear an air of child-like simplicity,\n beautifully recalling the features of\n Homer's primitive age. But they would have\n appeared faults to all commonplace critics\n in literary ages.\"\n \n \n DE QUINCEY. Homer and the Homeridæ.\n 327:2  Brahmans the sacerdotal caste.
