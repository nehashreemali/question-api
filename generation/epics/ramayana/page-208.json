I cried aloud.\n Then from the trembling hermits broke\n One long sad cry, and thus they spoke:\n 'Fiends of the wood, who wear at will\n Each varied shape, afflict us still.\n To thee in our distress we fly:\n O help us, Ráma, or we die.\n When sacred rites of fire are due,\n When changing moons are full or new,\n These fiends who bleeding flesh devour\n Assail us with resistless power.\n They with their cruel might torment\n The hermits on their vows intent:\n We look around for help and see\n Our surest refuge, Prince, in thee.\n We, armed with powers of penance, might\n Destroy the rovers of the night:\n But loth were we to bring to naught\n The merit years of toil have bought.\n Our penance rites are grown too hard,\n By many a check and trouble barred,\n But though our saints for food are slain\n The withering curse we yet restrain.\n \n \n Thus many a weary day distressed\n By giants who this wood infest,\n We see at length deliverance, thou\n With Lakshman art our guardian now.'\n     As thus the troubled hermits prayed,\n I promised, dame, my ready aid,\n And now--for truth I hold most dear--\n Still to my word must I adhere.\n My love, I might endure to be\n Deprived of Lakshman, life, and thee,\n But ne'er deny my promise, ne'er\n To Bráhmans break the oath I sware.\n I must, enforced by high constraint,\n Protect them all. Each suffering saint\n In me, unasked, his help had found;\n Still more in one by promise bound.\n I know thy words, mine own dear dame,\n From thy sweet heart's affection came:\n I thank thee for thy gentle speech,\n For those we love are those we teach.\n 'Tis like thyself, O fair of face,\n 'Tis worthy of thy noble race:\n Dearer than life, thy feet are set\n In righteous paths they ne'er forget.'\n     Thus to the Maithil monarch's child,\n His own dear wife, in accents mild\n     The high-souled hero said:\n Then to the holy groves which lay\n Beyond them fair to see, their way\n     The bow-armed chieftain led.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto XI.: Agastya.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto IX.: Sita's Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XI.: Agastya. »",
