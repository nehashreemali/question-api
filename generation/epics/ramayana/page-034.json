An arrow, swift as thought,\n     Upon his bow he pressed,\n And smote, to utmost fury wrought,\n     Máricha on the breast.\n Deep in his flesh the weapon lay\n     Winged by the mystic spell,\n \n \n \n \n \n p. 45\n \n \n And, hurled a hundred leagues away,\n     In ocean's flood he fell.\n Then Ráma, when he saw the foe\n     Convulsed and mad with pain\n 'Neath the chill-pointed weapon's blow,\n     To Lakshman spoke again:\n 'See, Lakshman, see! this mortal dart\n     That strikes a numbing chill,\n Hath struck him senseless with the smart,\n     But left him breathing still.\n But these who love the evil way,\n     And drink the blood they spill,\n Rejoicing holy rites to stay,\n     Fierce plagues, my hand shall kill.'\n He seized another shaft, the best,\n     Aglow with living flame;\n It struck Suváhu on the chest,\n     And dead to earth he came.\n Again a dart, the Wind-God's own,\n     Upon his string he laid,\n And all the demons were o'erthrown,\n     The saints no more afraid.\n When thus the fiends were slain in fight,\n Disturbers of each holy rite,\n Due honour by the saints was paid\n To Ráma for his wondrous aid:\n So Indra is adored when he\n Has won some glorious victory.\n Success at last the rite had crowned,\n And Visvámitra gazed around,\n And seeing every side at rest,\n The son of Raghu thus addressed:\n 'My joy, O Prince, is now complete:\n     Thou hast obeyed my will:\n Perfect before, this calm retreat\n     Is now more perfect still.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 44:1  Certain ceremonies preliminary to\n sacrifice.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXXIII.: The Sone.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto XXXI: The Perfect Hermitage.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto XXXIII.: The Sone. »",
