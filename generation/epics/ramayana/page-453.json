There is little\n novelty of incident in these Cantos and\n the result are exactly the same as before.\n In Canto LV. Akampan, at the command\n of Rávan, leads forth his troops. Evil\n omens are seen and heard. The enemies\n meet, and many fall on each side, the\n Vánars transfixed with arrows, the\n Rákshases crushed with rooks and trees.\n \n \n In Canto LVI. Akampan sees that the\n Rákshases are worsted, and fights with\n redoubled rage and vigour. The Vánars\n fall fast under his \"nets of arrows.\"\n Hanumán comes to the rescue. He throws\n mountain peaks at the giant which are\n dexterously stopped with flights of arrows;\n and at last beats him down and kills him\n with a tree.\n \n \n In Canto LVII. Rávan is seriously\n alarmed. He declares that he himself,\n Kumbhakarna or Prahasta, must go forth.\n Prahasta sallies out vaunting that the\n fowls of the air shall eat their fill of\n Vánar flesh.\n \n \n In Canto LVIII. the two armies meet.\n Dire is the conflict; ceaseless is the rain\n of stones and arrows. At last Níla meets\n Prahasta and breaks his bow. Prahasta\n leaps from his car, and the giant and the\n Vánar fight on foot. Níla with a huge\n tree crushes his opponent who falls like a\n tree when its roots are cut.\n \n \n Next: Canto LIX.: Rávans Sally.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto LIII.: Vajradanshtra's Sally.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto LIX.: R&aacute;vans Sally. »",
