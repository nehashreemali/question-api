See Canto LXX.\n We are thrown back, therefore, to very\n ancient times, and it occasions some surprise\n to find Vas'ishtha and Vis'vámitra,\n actors in these occurences, still alive in\n Ráma's time.'\n \n \n Next: Canto LVIII.: Tris'anku Cursed.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LVI.: Vis'v&aacute;mitra's Vow.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LVIII.: Tris'anku Cursed. »",
