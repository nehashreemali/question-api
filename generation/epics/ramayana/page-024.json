What their parentage?\n What is their size? What beings lend\n Their power to guard them and befriend?\n How can my son their arts withstand?\n Or I or all my armed band?\n Tell me the whole that I may know\n To meet in war each evil foe\n Whom conscious might inspires with pride.'\n \n \n And Vis'vámitra thus replied:\n 'Sprung from Pulastya's race there came\n A giant known by Rávan's name.\n Once favoured by the Eternal Sire\n He plagues the worlds in ceaseless ire,\n For peerless power and might renowned,\n By giant bands encompassed round.\n Vis'ravas for his sire they hold,\n His brother is the Lord of Gold.\n King of the giant hosts is he,\n And worst of all in cruelty.\n This Rávan's dread commands impel\n Two demons who in might excel,\n Maricha and Suváhu hight,\n To trouble and impede the rite.'\n \n \n Then thus the king addressed the sage:\n 'No power have I, my lord, to wage\n War with this evil-minded foe;\n Now pity on my darling show,\n And upon me of hapless fate,\n For thee as God I venerate.\n Gods, spirits, bards of heavenly birth,  2\n The birds of air, the snakes of earth\n Before the might of Rávan quail,\n Much less, can mortal man avail.\n He draws, I hear, from out the breast\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The valour of the mightiest.\n No, ne'er can I with him contend,\n Or with the forces he may send.\n How can I then my darling lend,\n Godlike, unskilled in battle? No,\n I will not let my young child go.\n Foes of thy rite, those mighty ones,\n Sunda and Upasunda's sons,\n Are fierce as Fate to overthrow:\n I will not let my young child go.\n Maricha and Suváhu fell\n Are valiant and instructed well.\n One of the twain I might attack.\n With all my friends their lord to back.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 35:1  Consisting of horse, foot, chariots, and\n elephants.\n 35:2  'The Gandharvas, or heavenly bards,\n had originally a warlike character but\n were afterwards reduced to the office of\n celestial musicians cheering the banquets\n of the Gods. Dr. Kuhn has shown their\n identity with the Centaurs in name, origin\n and attributes.'
