Sikshá, the science\n of proper articulation and pronunciation:\n 2. Chhandas,metre: 3. Vyakarana, linguistic\n analysis or grammar: 4. Nirukta,\n explanation of difficult Vedic words:\n 5. Jyotisha, Astronomy, or rather the Vedic\n Calendar: 6. Kalpa, ceremonial.\n 405:2b  There appears to be some confusion,\n of time here. It was already morning\n when Hanumán entered the grove, and\n the torches would be needless.\n \n \n Next: Canto XIX.: Síta's Fear.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto XVII.: S&iacute;t&aacute;'s Guard.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto XIX.: S&iacute;ta's Fear. »",
