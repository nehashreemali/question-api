When his pious son Prahlada\n praised Vishun the Daitya tried to kill him,\n when the God appeared in the incarnation\n of the man-lion and tore the tyrant to\n pieces.\n 407:1b  Do unto others as thou wouldst they\n should do unto thee, is a precept frequently\n occurring in the old Indian poems.\n \n \n This charity is to embrace not human\n beings only, but bird and beast as well:\n \"He prayeth best who loveth best all\n things both great and small\"\n 407:2b  It was the custom of Indian warriors\n to mark their arrows with their ciphers or\n names, and it seems to have been regarded\n as a point of honour to give an enemy\n the satisfaction of knowing who had shot\n at him. This passage however contains, if\n my memory serves me well, the first mention\n in the poem of this practice, and as\n arrows have been so frequently mentioned\n and described with almost every conceivable\n epithet, its occurrence here seems\n suspicious. No mention of, or allusion to\n writing has hitherto occurred in the poem.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXII.: Rávan's Threat.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto XX.: R&aacute;van's Wooing.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto XXII.: R&aacute;van's Threat. »",
