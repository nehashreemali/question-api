Up he raised\n His awful head with eyes that blazed\n Like comets, dire as Death in form\n Who threats the worlds with fire and stcrm.\n The giants pointed to their stores\n Of buffaloes and deer and boars,\n And straight he gorged him with a flood\n Of wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood.\n He ceased: the giants ventured near\n And bent their lowly heads in fear.\n Then Kumbhakarna glared with eyes\n Still heavy in their first surprise,\n Still drowsy from his troubled rest,\n And thus the giant band addressed.\n 'How have ye dared my sleep to break?\n No trifling cause should bid me wake.\n Say, is all well? or tell the need\n That drives you with unruly speed\n To wake me. Mark the words I say,\n The king shall tremble in dismay,\n \n \n p. 472\n \n \n Of Vishn'u, he was firm in heart.\n     The Wind-God's son the fight beheld,\n And rushed at Rávan, rage-impelled.\n Down crashed his mighty hand the foe\n Full in the chest received the blow.\n His eyes grew dim, his knees gave way.\n And senseless on the earth he lay.\n     The Wind-God's son to Ráma bore\n Deep-wounded Lakshman stained with gore.\n He whom no foe might lift or bend\n Was light as air to such a friend.\n The dart that Lakshman's side had cleft,\n Untouched, the hero's body left,\n And flashing through the air afar\n Resumed its place in Rávan's car;\n And, waxing well though wounded sore,\n He felt the deadly pain no more.\n And Rávan, though with deep wounds pained,\n Slowly his sense and strength regained,\n And furious still and undismayed\n On bow and shaft his hand he laid.\n     Then Hanumán to Ráma cried:\n 'Ascend my back, great chief, and ride\n Like Vishnu borne on Garud's wing,\n To battle with the giant king.'\n So, burning for the dire attack,\n Rode Ráma on the Vánar's back,\n And with fierce accents loud and slow\n Thus gave defiance to the foe,\n While his strained bowstring made a sound\n Like thunder when it shakes the ground:\n 'Stay, Monarch of the giants, stay,\n The penalty of sin to pay.\n Stay; whither wilt thou fly, and how\n Escape the death that waits thee now?'\n     No word the giant king returned:\n His eyes with flames of fury burned.\n His arm was stretched, his bow was bent,\n And swift his fiery shafts were sent.\n Red torrents from the Vánar flowed:\n Then Ráma near to Rávan' strode,\n And, with keen darts that never failed,\n The chariot of the king assailed.\n With surest aim his arrows flew:\n The driver and the steeds he slew,\n And shattered with the pointed steel\n Car, flag and pole and yoke and wheel.\n As Indra hurls his bolt to smite\n Mount Meru's heaven-ascending height,\n So Ráma with a flaming dart\n Struck Lanká's monarch near the heart,\n Who reeled and fell beneath the blow\n And from loose fingers dropped his bow.\n Bright as the sun, with crescent head,\n From Ráma's bow an arrow sped,\n And from his forehead, proud no more,\n Cleft the bright coronet he wore.\n \n \n Then Ráma stood by Rávan''s side\n And to the conquered giant cried:\n 'Well hast thou fought: thine arm has slain\n Strong heroes of the Vánar train.\n I will not strike or slay thee now,\n For weary, faint with fight art thou.\n To Lanká's town thy footsteps bend,\n And there the night securely spend.\n To-morrow come with car and bow,\n And then my prowess shall thou know.'\n     He ceased: the king in humbled pride\n Rose from the earth and naught replied.\n With wounded limbs and shattered crown\n He sought again his royal town.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 470:1  An ancient king of Ayodhyá said by\n some to have been Prithu's father.\n 470:2  The daughter of King Kus'adhwaja.\n She became an ascetic, and being insulted\n by Rávan in the woods where she was p. 471\n performing penance, destroyed herself by\n entering fire, but was born again as Sitá\n to be in turn the destruction of him who\n had insulted her.\n 471:1  Nandís'vara was S'iva's chief attendant.\n Rávan had despised and laughed at him\n for appearing in the form of a monkey\n and the irritated Nandís'vara cursed him\n and foretold his destruction by monkeys.\n 471:2  Rávan once upheaved and shook\n Mount Kailása the favourite dwelling\n place of S'iva the consort of Umá, and\n was cursed in consequence by the offended\n Goddess.\n 471:3  Rambhá, who has several times been\n mentioned in the course of the poem, was\n one of the nymphs of heaven, and had\n been insulted by Rávan.\n 471:4  Punjikasthalá was the daughter of\n Varun. Rávan himself has mentioned in\n this book his insult to her, and the curse\n pronounced in consequeuce by Brahmá.\n \n \n Next: Canto LX.: Kumbhakarn'a Roused.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto LIX.: R&aacute;vans Sally.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto LX.: Kumbhakarn'a Roused. »",
