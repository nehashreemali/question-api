I\n Will pass into the fire and die.\n Abandoned thus, I will not brook\n Upon Ayodhyá's town to look,\n Once guarded by Ikshváku's race:\n The wood shall be my dwelling place.'\n \n \n Then when the princes' mournful train\n Heard the sad brothers thus complain,\n And saw their misery, at the view\n Their grief burst wilder out anew.\n Faint with lamenting, sad and worn,\n Each like a bull with broken horn,\n The brothers in their wild despair\n Lay rolling, mad with misery, there.\n Then old Vas'ishtha good and true,\n Their father's priest, all lore who knew,\n Raised weeping Bharat on his feet,\n And thus bespake with counsel meet:\n 'Twelve days, my lord, have past away\n \n \n p. 187\n \n \n Since flames consumed thy father's clay:\n Delay no more: as rules ordain,\n Gather what bones may yet remain.\n Three constant pairs are ever found\n To hem all mortal creatures round:  1\n Then mourn not thus, O Prince, for none\n Their close companionship may shun.'\n     Sumantra bade S'atrughna rise,\n And soothed his soul with counsel wise,\n And skilled in truth, his hearer taught\n How all things are and come to naught,\n When rose each hero from the ground,\n A lion lord of men, renowned,\n He showed like Indra's flag, 2 whereon\n Fierce rains have dashed and suns have shone.\n They wiped their red and weeping eyes,\n And gently made their sad replies:\n Then, urged to haste, the royal pair\n Performed the rites that claimed their care.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 186:1  The Sáma-veda, the hymns of which\n are chanted aloud.\n 186:2  Walking from right to left.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXXVIII.: Manthará Punished.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto LXXVI.: The Funeral\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto LXXVIII.: Manthar&aacute; Punished. »",
