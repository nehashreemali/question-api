Fanciful names for war-engines\n and weapons derived from their resemblance\n to various animals are not confined\n to India. The \"War-wolf\" was\n used by Edward I. at the siege of Brechin,\n the \"Cat-house\" and the \"Sow\" were\n used by Edwaid III. at the siege of Dunbar.\n \n \n Next: Canto CII.: Lakshman Healed.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto C.: Ravan In The Field.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto CII.: Lakshman Healed. »",
