death attends\n Our steps until our journey ends.\n Death, when the traveller wins the goal,\n Returns with the returning soul.\n The flowing hair grown* white and thin,\n And wrinkles mark the altered skin.\n The ills of age man's strength assail:\n Ah, what can mortal power avail?\n Men joy to see the sun arise,\n They watch him set with joyful eyes:\n But ne'er reflect, too blind to see,\n How fast their own brief moments flee.\n With lovely change for ever new\n The seasons' sweet return they view,\n Nor think with heedless hearts the while\n That lives decay as seasons smile.\n As haply on the boundless main\n Meet drifting logs and part again.\n So wives and children, friends and gold,\n Oures for a little time we hold:\n Soon by resistless laws of fate\n To meet no more we separate.\n In all this changing world not one\n The common lot of all can shun:\n Then why with useless tears deplore\n The dead whom tears can bring no more?\n As one might stand upon the way\n And to a troop of travellers say:\n 'If ye allow it, sirs, I too\n Will travel on the road with you:'\n So why should mortal man lament\n When on that path his feet are bent\n Which all men living needs must tread,\n Where sire and ancestors have led?\n Life flies as torrents downward fall\n Speeding away without recall,\n So virtue should our thoughts engage,\n For bliss  1b is mortals' heritage,\n \n \n \n \n p. 215\n \n \n By ceaseless care and earnest zeal\n For servants and for people's weal,\n By gifts, by duty nobly done,\n Our glorious sire the skies has won.\n Our lord the king, o'er earth who reigned,\n A blissful home in heaven has gained\n By wealth in ample largess spent,\n And many a rite magnificent:\n With constant joy from first to last\n A long and noble life he passed,\n Praised by the good, no tears should dim\n Our eyes, O brother dear, for him.\n His human body, worn and tried\n By length of days, he cast aside,\n And gained the godlike bliss to stray\n In Brahma's heavenly home for aye.\n \"For such the wise as we are, deep\n In Veda lore, should never weep.\n Those who are firm and ever wise\n Spurn vain lament and idle sighs.\n Be self-possessed: thy grief restrain:\n Go, in that city dwell again.\n Return, O best of men, and be\n Obedient to our sire's decree,\n While I with every care fulfil\n Our holy father's righteous will,\n Observing in the lonely wood\n His charge approved by all the good,'\n \n \n     Thus Ráma of the lofty mind\n         To Bharat spoke his righteous speech,\n     By every argument designed\n         Obedience to his sire to teach,\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 214:1  Garud, the king of birds.\n 214:1b  To be won by virtue.\n \n \n Next: Canto CVI.: Bharat's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto CIV.: The Meeting With The Queens.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto CVI.: Bharat's Speech. »",
