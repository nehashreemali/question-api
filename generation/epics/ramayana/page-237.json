The two\n Who lingered on the spot, he slew.\n I fled from mortal danger, freed\n From the dire shaft by timely speed.\n Now to deep thought my days I give,\n And as a humble hermit live.\n In every shrub, in every tree\n I view that noblest devotee.\n In every knotted trunk I mark\n His deerskin and his coat of bark,\n And see the bow-armed Ráma stand\n Like Yama with his noose in hand.\n I tell thee Rávan, in my fright\n A thousand Rámas mock my sight,\n This wood with every bush and bough\n Seems all one fearful Ráma now.\n Throughout the grove there is no spot\n So lonely where I see him not.\n He haunts me in my dreams by night,\n And wakes me with the wild affright.\n The letter that begins his name\n Sends terror through my startled frame.\n The rapid cars whereon we ride,\n The rich rare jewels, once my pride,\n Have names  1 that strike upon mine ear\n With hated sound that counsels fear.\n His mighty strength too well I know,\n Nor art thou match for such a foe.\n Too strong were Raghus's son in fight\n For Namu*chi or Bali's might.\n Then Ráma to the battle dare,\n Or else be patient and forbear;\n But, wouldst thou see me live in peace,\n Let mention of the hero cease.\n The good whose holy lives were spent\n In deepest thought, most innocent.\n With all their people many a time\n Have perished through another's crime.\n So in the common ruin, I\n Must for another's folly die,\n Do all thy strength and courage can.\n But ne'er will I approve the plan.\n For he, in might supremely great,\n \n \n \n \n The giant world could extirpate,\n Since, when impetuous Khara sought\n The grove of Janasthán and fought\n For Súrpanakhá's sake, he died\n By Ráma's hand in battle tried.\n How has he wronged thee? Soothly swear,\n And Ráma's fault and sin declare.\n     I warn thee, and my words are wise,\n         I seek thy people's weal:\n     But if this rede thou wilt despise.\n         Nor hear my last appeal,\n     Thou with thy kin and all thy friends\n         In fight this day wilt die,\n     When his great bow the hero bends,\n         And shafts unerring fly.'\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 275:1  The Sanskrit words for car and jewels\n begin with ra.\n \n \n Next: Canto XL.: Rávan's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XXXVIII.: M&aacute;r&iacute;cha's Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XL.: R&aacute;van's Speech. »",
