this\n Is all my hope and all my bliss.\n If thou wilt leave thy wife who still\n Entreats thee with undaunted will,\n This very day shall poison close\n The life that spurns the rule of foes.\n How, after, can my soul sustain\n The bitter life of endless pain,\n When thy dear face, my lord, I miss!\n No, death is better far than this.\n Not for an hour could I endure\n The deadly grief that knows not cure,\n Far less a woe I could not shun\n For ten long years, and three, and one.'\n \n \n While fires of woe consumed her, such\n Her sad appeal, lamenting much;\n Then with a wild cry, anguish-wrung,\n About her husband's neck she clung.\n Like some she-elephant who bleeds\n Struck by the hunter's venomed reeds,\n So in her quivering heart she felt\n The many wounds his speeches dealt.\n Then, as the spark from wood is gained,  1\n Down rolled the tear so long restrained:\n The crystal moisture, sprung from woe,\n From her sweet eyes began to flow,\n As runs the water from a pair\n Of lotuses divinely fair.\n And Sítá's face with long dark eyes,\n Pure as the moon of autumn skies,\n Faded with weeping, as the buds\n Of lotuses when sink the floods.\n Around his wife his arms he strained,\n Who senseless from her woe remained,\n And with sweet words, that bade her wake\n To life again, the hero spake:\n 'I would not with thy woe, my Queen,\n Buy heaven and all its blissful sheen.\n Void of all fear am I as He,\n The self-existent God, can be.\n I knew not all thy heart till now,\n Dear lady of the lovely brow\n So wished not thee in woods to dwell;\n Yet there mine arm can guard thee well.\n Now surely thou, dear love, wast made\n To dwell with me in green wood shade.\n And, as a high saint's tender mind\n Clings to its love for all mankind,\n So I to thee will ever cling,\n Sweet daughter of Videha's king.\n The good, of old, O soft of frame,\n Honoured this duty's sovereign claim,\n And I its guidance will not shun,\n True as light's Queen is to the Sun.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n I cannot, pride of Janak's line,\n This journey to the wood decline:\n My sire's behest, the oath he sware,\n The claims of truth, all lead me there.\n One duty, dear the same for aye,\n Is sire and mother to obey:\n Should I their orders once transgress\n My very life were weariness.\n If glad obedience be denied\n To father, mother, holy guide,\n What rites, what service can be done\n That stern Fate's favour may be won?\n These three the triple world comprise,\n O darling of the lovely eyes.\n Earth has no holy thing like these\n Whom with all love men seek to please.\n Not truth, or gift, or bended knee,\n Not honour, worship, lordly fee,\n Storms heaven and wins a blessing thence\n Like sonly love and reverence.\n Heaven, riches, grain, and varied lore,\n With sons and many a blessing more,\n All these are made their own with ease\n By those their elders' souls who please.\n The mighty-souled, who ne'er forget,\n Devoted sons, their filial debt,\n Win worlds where Gods and minstrels are,\n And Brahmá's sphere more glorious far.\n Now as the orders of my sire,\n Who keeps the way of truth, require,\n So will I do, for such the way\n Of duty that endures for aye:\n To take thee, love, to Dandak's wild\n My heart at length is reconciled,\n For thee such earnest thoughts impel\n To follow, and with me to dwell.\n O faultless form from feet to brows,\n Come with me, as my will allows,\n And duty there with me pursue,\n Trembler, whose bright eyes thrill me through.\n In all thy days, come good come ill,\n Preserve unchanged such noble will,\n And thou, dear love, wilt ever be\n The glory of thy house and me.\n Now, beauteous-armed, begin the tasks\n The woodland life of hermits asks.\n For me the joys of heaven above\n Have charms no more without thee, love.\n And now, dear Sítá, be not slow:\n Food on good mendicants bestow,\n And for the holy Bráhmans bring\n Thy treasures and each precious thing.\n Thy best attire and gems collect,\n The jewels which thy beauty decked,\n And every ornament and toy\n Prepared for hours of sport and joy:\n The beds, the cars wherein I ride,\n Among our followers, next, divide.'\n \n \n She conscious that her lord approved\n Her going, with great rapture moved,\n \n \n p. 131\n \n \n Hastened within, without delay,\n Prepared to give their wealth away.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 129:1  The story of Savitri, told in the Mahábhárat,\n has been admirably translated by\n Rückert, and elegantly epitomized by Mrs.\n Manning in India, Ancient and Mediaeval.\n There is a free rendering of the story in\n Idylls from the Sanskrit.\n 130:1  Fire for sacrificial purposes is produced\n by the attrition of two pieces of wood.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXXI.: Lakshman's Prayer.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XXIX.: S&iacute;t&aacute;'s Appeal.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XXXI.: Lakshman's Prayer. »",
