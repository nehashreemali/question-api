Why should I fear\n For one whom Raghu's sons hold dear?\n Has not the pitying fire that spared\n The Vánar for the lady cared?'\n     Such were his thoughts: he pondered long,\n And fear grew faint and hope grew strong.\n Then round him heavenly voices rang,\n And, sweetly tuned, his praises sang:\n 'O glorious is the exploit done\n By Hanumán the Wind-God's son.\n The flames o'er Lanká's city rise:\n The giants' home in ruin lies.\n O'er roof and wall the fires have spread,\n Nor harmed a hair of Sítá's head.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LVI: Mount Arishta.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto LIV.: The Burning of Lank&aacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto LVI: Mount Arishta. »",
