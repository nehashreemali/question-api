Let me drink\n Their lifeblood as to earth they sink.'\n     Then Khara, by his sister pressed,\n Inflamed with fury, gave his hest\n To twice seven giants of his crew,\n Fierce as the God of death to view:\n     'Two men equipped with arms, who wear\n Deerskin and bark and matted hair,\n Leading a beauteous dame, have strayed\n To the wild gloom of Dandak's shade.\n These men, this cursed woman slay,\n And hasten back without delay,\n That this my sister's lips may be\n Red with the lifeblood of the three.\n Giants, my wounded sister longs\n To take this vengeance for her wrongs.\n With speed her dearest wish fulfil,\n And with your might these creatures kill.\n Soon as your matchless strength shall lay\n These brothers dead in battle fray,\n She in triumphant joy will laugh,\n And their hearts' blood delighted quaff.'\n     The giants heard the words he said,\n And forth with S'úrpanakhá sped,\n As mighty clouds in autumn fly\n Urged by the wind along the sky.\n \n \n               *        *        *        *        *\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 252:1  A demon slain by Indra.\n \n \n Next: Canto XX.: The Giants' Death.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XVIII.: The Mutilation.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XX.: The Giants' Death. »",
