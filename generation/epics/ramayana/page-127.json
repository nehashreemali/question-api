Shame\n On that malicious sinful dame,\n Who, keenly bent on cruel deeds,\n No hounds of righht and virtue heeds,\n But with her wicked art has sent\n So good a prince to banishment,\n Wi-o, tender-hearted, ruling well\n His senses in the woods to dwell.\n Ah cruel king! his heart of steel\n For his own son no love could feel,\n \n \n Who with the sinless Ráma parts,\n The darling of the people's hearts.'\n \n \n     These words he heard the peasants say,\n Who dwelt in hamlets by the way,\n And, lord of all the realm by right,\n Through Kosala pursued his flight.\n Through the auspicious flood, at last,\n Of Vesasruti's stream he passed,\n Aud onward to the place he sped\n By Saint Agastya tenanted.\n Still on for many an hour he hied,\n And crossed the stream whose fooling tide\n Rolls onward till she meets the sea,\n The herd-frequented Gomatil\n Borne by his rapid horses o'er,\n He reached that river's further shore.\n And Syandiká's,whose svan-loved stream,\n Resounded with the peacock's scream.\n Then as he journeyed on his road\n To hvs Videhan bride he showed\n The populous land which Manu old\n To King IKshvaku gave to hold.\n The glorious prince, the lord of men\n Looked on the charioteer, and then\n Voiced like a wild swan, loud and clear.\n He spake these words and bade him hear:\n 'When shall I, with returning feet\n My father and my mother meet?\n When shall I lead the hunt once more\n In bloomy woods on Sarju's shore?\n Most eagerly I long to ride\n Urging the chase on Sarju's side.\n For royal saints have seen no blame\n In this, the monarch's matchless game.'\n \n \n Thus speeding on,--no reft or stay,--\n Ikshvaku's son pursued his way.\n Oft his sweet voice the silence broke,\n And thus on varied themes he spoke.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto L.: The Halt Under The Ingudí.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XLVIII.: The Women's Lament.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto L.: The Halt Under The Ingud&iacute;. »",
