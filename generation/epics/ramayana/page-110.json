Victor named;\n And let a thousand coins of gold,\n Great Brahman, with the gift be told.'\n Thus Ráma spoke: nor he declined\n The noble gitts for him designed.\n On Ráma, Lakshman, Sítá he\n Invoked all high felicity.\n \n \n In pleasant words then Ráma gave\n His hest to Lakshman prompt and brave,\n As Brahmá speaks for Him to hear\n Who rules the Gods' celestial sphere:\n 'To the two best of Bráhmans run;\n Agastya bring, and Kus'ik's son,\n And precious gifts upon them rain,\n Like fostering floods upon the grain.\n O long-armed Prince of Raghu's line,\n Delight them with a thousand kine,\n And many a fair and costly gem,\n With gold and silver, give to them.\n To him, so deep in Scripture, who,\n To Queen Kaus'alyá, ever true,\n Serves her with blessing and respect,\n Chief of the Taittiriya sect  1b--\n To him. with women-slaves, present\n A chariot rich with ornament,\n And costly robes of silk beside,\n Until the sage be satisfied.\n On Chitraratha. true aud dear,\n My tuneful bard and charioteer,\n Gems, robes, and plenteous wealth confer--\n Mine ancient friend and minister.\n And these who go with staff in hand,\n Grammarians trained, a numerous band.\n Who their deep study only prize,\n Nor think of other exercise,\n Who toil not, loving dainty fare,\n Whose praises e'en the good declare--\n On these be eighty cars bestowed,\n And each with precious treasures load.\n \n \n \n \n \n p. 133\n \n \n A thousand bulls for them suffice,\n Two hundred elephants of price,\n And let a thousand kine beside\n The dainties of each meal provide.\n The throng who sacred girdles wear,\n And on Káusalyá wait with care--\n A thousand golden coins shall please,\n Son of Sumitrá, each of these.\n Let all, dear Lakshman, of the train\n These special gifts of honour gain;\n My mother will rejoice to know\n Her Bráhmans have been cherished so.'\n \n \n Then Raghu's son addressed the crowd\n Who round him stood and wept aloud,\n When he to all who thronged the court\n Had dealt his wealth for their support:\n 'In Lakshman's house and mine remain,\n And guard them till I come again,'\n To all his people sad with grief.\n In loving ords thus spoke their chief,\n Then bade his treasure-keeper bring\n Gold, silver, and each precious thing.\n Then straight the servants went and bore\n Back to their chief the wealth in store,\n Before the people's eyes it shone,\n A glorious pile to look upon.\n The prince of men with Lakshman's aid\n Parted the treasuures there displaved,\n Gave to the poor, the young, the old,\n And twice-born men, the gems and gold.\n     A Bráhman, long in evil case.\n Named Trijat, born of Garga's race,\n Earned ever toiling in a wood\n With spade and plough his livelihood.\n The youthful wife, his babes who bore,\n Their indigence felt more and more.\n Thus to the aged man she spake:\n 'Hear this my word: my counsel take.\n Come, throw thy spade and plough away;\n To virtuous Ráma go to-day.\n And somewhat of his kindness pray.'\n     He heard the word she spoke: around\n His limbs his ragged cloth he wound.\n And took his journey by the road\n That led to Ráma's fair abode.\n To the fifth court be made his way;\n Nor met the Bráhman check or stay.\n Brighu, Angiras 1 could not be\n Brighter with saintly light than Vie,\n To Ráma's presence on he pressed.\n And thus the noble chief addressed:\n 'O Ráma, poor and weak am I,\n And many children round me cry.\n Scant living in the woods I earn:\n On me thine eye of pity turn.'\n And Ráma, bent on sport and jest,\n The suppliant Bráhman thus addressed:\n \n \n \n \n 'O aged man, one thousand kine,\n Yet undistributed, are mine.\n The cows on thee will I bestow\n As far as thou thy staff canst throw.\n     The Bráhman heard. In eager haste\n He bound his cloth around his waist.\n Then round his head his staff he whirled,\n And forth with mightiest effort hurled.\n Cast from his hand it flew, and sank\n To earth on Sarjú's farther bank,\n Where herds of kine in thousands fed\n Near to the well-stocked bullock shed.\n And all the cows that wandered o'er\n The meadow, far as Sarjú's shore.\n At Ráma's word the herdsmen drove\n To Trijat's cottage in the grove.\n He drew the Bráhman to his breast,\n And thus with calming words addressed:\n 'Now be not angry, Sire. I pray:\n This jest of mine was meant in play.\n These thousand kine, but not alone.\n Their herdsmen too, are all thine own.\n And wealth beside I give thee: speak.\n Thine shall be all thy heart can seek.'\n     Thus Ráma spake.
