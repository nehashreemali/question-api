do not grieve\n For our dear home and all we leave.\n The woods unpeopled seem to weep\n Around us, as their tenants creep\n Or fly to lair and den and nest,\n Both bird and beast, to seek their rest.\n Methinks Ayodhyá's royal town\n Where dwells my sire of high renown,\n With all her men and dames to-night\n Will mourn us vanished from their sight.\n For, by his virtues won, they cling\n In fond affection to their king,\n And thee and me, O brave and true,\n And Bharat and S'atrughna too.\n I for my sire and mother feel\n Deep sorrow o'er my bosom steal,\n Lest mourning us, oppressed with fears,\n They blind their eyes with endless tears.\n Yet Bharat's duteous love will show\n Sweet comfort in their hours of woe,\n And with kind words their hearts sustain,\n Suggesting duty, bliss, and gain.\n I mourn my parents now no more:\n I count dear Bharat's virtues o'er,\n And his kind love and care dispel\n The doubts I had, and all is well.\n And thou thy duty wouldst not shun,\n And, following me, hast nobly done;\n Else, bravest, I should need a band\n Around my wife as guard to stand.\n On this first night, my thirst to slake,\n Some water only will I take:\n Thus, brother, thus my will decides,\n Though varied store the wood provides.'\n \n \n Thus having said to Lakshman, he\n Addressed in turn Sumantra: 'Be\n Most diligent to-night, my friend,\n And with due care thy horses tend.'\n The sun had set: Sumantra tied\n His noble horses side by side,\n Gave store of grass with liberal hand,\n And rested near them on the strand.\n Each paid the holy evening rite,\n And when around them fell the night,\n The charioteer, with Lakshman's aid,\n A lowly bed for Ráma laid.\n To Lakshman Ráma bade adieu,\n And then by, Sítá's side he threw\n His limbs upon the leafy bed\n Their care upon the bank had spread.\n When Lakshman saw the couple slept,\n Still on the strand his watch he kept,\n Still with Sumantra there conversed,\n And Ráma's varied gifts rehearsed.\n All night he watched, nor sought repose,\n Till on the earth the sun arose:\n With him Sumantra stayed awake,\n And still of Ráma's virtues spake.\n Thus, near the river's grassy shore\n Which herds unnumbered wandered o'er,\n Repose, untroubled, Ráma found,\n And all the people lay around.\n The glorious hero left his bed,\n Looked on the sleeping crowd, and said\n To Lakshman, whom each lucky line\n Marked out for bliss with surest sign:\n 'O brother Lakshman, look on these\n Reclining at the roots of trees;\n All care of house and home resigned,\n Caring for us with heart and mind,\n These people of the city yearn\n \n \n p. 149\n \n \n To see us to our home return:\n To quit their lives will they consent,\n But never leave their firm intent.\n Come, while they all unconscious sleep,\n Let us upon the chariot leap,\n And swiftly on our journey speed\n Where naught our progress may impede,\n That these fond citizens who roam\n Far from Ikshváku's ancient home,\n No more may sleep 'neath bush and tree,\n Following still for love of me.\n A prince with tender care should heal\n The self-brought woes his people feel,\n And never let his subjects share\n The burthen he is forced to bear.'\n     Then Lakshman to the chief replied,\n Who stood like Justice by his side:\n 'Thy rede, O sage, I well commend:\n Without delay the car ascend.'\n Then Ráma to Sumantra spoke:\n 'Thy rapid steeds, I pray thee, yoke.\n Hence to the forest will I go:\n Away, my lord, and be not slow.'\n     Sumantra, urged to utmost speed,\n Yoked to the car each generous steed,\n And then, with hand to hand applied,\n He came before the chief and cred:\n 'Hail, Prince, whom mighty arms adorn,\n Hail, bravest of the chariot-borne!\n With Sítá and thy brother thou\n Mayst mount: the car is ready now.'\n     The hero clomb the car with haste:\n His bow and gear within were placed,\n And quick the eddying flood he passed\n Of Tamasá whose waves run fast.\n Soon as he touched the farther side.\n That strong-armed hero, glorified,\n He found a road both wide and clear,\n Where e'en the timid naught could fear.\n Then, that the crowd might be misled,\n Thus Ráma to Sumantra said:\n 'Speed north a while, then hasten back,\n Returning in thy former track,\n That so the people may not learn\n The course I follow: drive and turn.'\n     Sumantra, at the chief's behest.\n Quick to the task himself addressed;\n Then near to Ráma came, and showed\n The chariot ready for the road.\n With Sítá, then, the princely two,\n Who o'er the line of Raghu threw\n A glory ever bright and new,\n     Upon the chariot stood.\n Sumantra fast and faster drove\n His horses, who in fleetness strove\n Still onward to the distant grove,\n     The hermit-haunted wood.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto XLVII.: The Citizens' Return.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XLV.: The Tamas&aacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XLVII.: The Citizens' Return. »",
