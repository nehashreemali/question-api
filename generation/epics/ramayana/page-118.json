Fare thee well.\"\n Her blessing thus Sumitrá gave\n To him whose soul to Ráma clave,\n Exclaiming, when her speech was done,\n ' Go forth, O Lakshman, go, my son.\n Go forth, my son to win success,\n High victory and happiness.\n Go forth thy foemen to destroy,\n And turn again at last with joy.'\n   As Mátali his charioteer\n Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear,\n Sumantra, palm to palm applied,\n In reverence trained, to Ráma cried:\n 'O famous Prince, my car ascend,--\n May blessings on thy course attend,--\n And swiftly shall my horses flee\n And place thee where thou biddest me.\n The fourteen years thou hast to stay\n Far in the wilds, begin to-day;\n For Oueen Kaikeyí cries, Away.\"\n     Then Sítá, best of womankind,\n Ascended, with a tranquil mind,\n Soon as her toilet task was done,\n That chariot brilliant as the sun.\n Ráma and Lakshman true and bold\n Sprang on the car adorned with gold.\n The king those years had counted o'er,\n And given Sítá robes and store\n Of precious ornaments to wear\n When following her husband there.\n The brothers in the car found place\n For nets and weapons of the chase,\n There warlike arms and mail they laid,\n A leathern basket and a spade.\n Soon as Sumantra saw the three\n Were seated in the chariot, he\n Urged on each horse of noble breed,\n Who matched the rushing wind in speed.\n As thus the son of Raghu went\n \n \n Forth for his dreary banishment,\n Chill numbing grief the town assailed,\n All strength grew weak, all spirit failed,\n Ayodhá through her wide extent\n Was filled with tumult and lament:\n Steeds neighed and shook the bells they bore,\n Each elephant returned a roar.\n Then all the city, young and old,\n Wild with their sorrow uncontrolled,\n Rushed to the car, as, from the sun\n The panting herds to water run.\n Before the car, behind, they clung,\n And there as eagerly they hung,\n With torrents streaming from their eyes,\n Called loudly with repeated cries:\n 'Listen, Sumantra: draw thy rein;\n Drive gently, and thy steeds restrain.\n Once more on Ráma will we gaze,\n Now to be lost for many days.\n The queen his mother has, be sure,\n A heart of iron, to endure\n To see her godlike Ráma go,\n Nor feel it shattered by the blow.\n Sítá, well done! Videha's pride,\n Still like his shadow by his side;\n Rejoicing in thy duty still\n As sunlight cleaves to Meru's hill.\n Thou, Lakshman, too, hast well deserved,\n Who from thy duty hast not swerved,\n Tending the peer of Gods above,\n Whose lips speak naught but words of love.\n Thy firm resolve is nobly great,\n And high success on thee shall wait.\n Yea, thou shalt win a priceless meed--\n Thy path with him to heaven shall lead,'\n As thus they spake, they could not hold\n The tears that down their faces rolled,\n While still they followed for a space\n Their darling of Ikshváku's race.\n     There stood surrounded by a ring\n Of mournful wives the mournful king;\n For, 'I will see once more,' he cried,\n 'Mine own dear son,' and forth he hied.\n As he came near, there rose the sound\n Of weeping, as the dames stood round.\n So the she-elephants complain\n When their great lord and guide is slain.\n Kakutstha's son, the king of men,\n The glorious sire, looked troubled then,\n As the full moon is when dismayed\n By dark eclipse's threatening shade.\n Then Das'aratha's son, designed\n For highest fate of lofty mind.\n Urged to more speed the charioteer,\n 'Away, away! why linger here?\n Urge on thy horses,' Rama cried,\n And 'Stay, O stay,' the people sighed.\n Sumantra, urged to speed away,\n The townsmen's call must disobey,\n Forth as the long-armed hero went,\n \n \n p. 143\n \n \n The dust his chariot wheels up sent\n Was laid by streams that ever flowed\n From their sad eyes who filled the road.\n Then, sprung of woe, from eyes of all\n The women drops began to fall,\n As from each lotus on the lake\n The darting fish the water shake.\n When he, the king of high renown,\n Saw that one thought held all the town,\n Like some tall tree he fell and lay,\n Whose root the axe has hewn away.\n Then straight a mighty cry from those\n Who followed Ráma's car arose,\n Who saw their monarch fainting there\n Beneath that grief too great to bear.\n Then 'Ráma, Ráma!\" with the cry\n Of 'Ah, his mother!' sounded high,\n As all the people wept aloud\n Around the ladies' sorrowing crowd.\n When Ráma backward turned his eye,\n And saw the king his father lie\n With troubled sense and failing limb,\n And the sad queen, who followed him,\n Like some young creature in the net,\n That will not, in its misery, let\n Its wild eyes on its mother rest,\n So, by the bonds of duty pressed,\n His mother's look he could not meet.\n He saw them with their weary feet,\n Who, used to bliss, in cars should ride,\n Who ne'er by sorrow should be tried,\n And, as one mournful look he cast,\n 'Drive on,' he cried, 'Sumantra, fast.'\n As when the driver's torturing hook\n Goads on an elephant, the look\n Of sire and mother in despair\n Was more than  Ráma's heart could bear.\n As mother kine to stalls return\n Which hold the calves for whom they yearn,\n So to the car she tried to run\n As a cow seeks her little one.\n Once and again the hero's eyes\n Looked on his mother, as with cries\n Of woe she called and gestures wild,\n 'O Sítá, Lakshman, O my child!'\n 'Stay,' cried the king, 'thy chariot stay:'\n 'On, on,' cried Ráma, 'speed away.'\n As one between two hosts, inclined\n To neither was Sumantra's mind.\n But Ráma spake these words again:\n 'A lengthened woe is bitterest pain.\n On, on; and if his wrath grow hot,\n Thine answer be, ' I heard thee not.'\n Sumantra, at the chief's behest,\n Dismissed the crowd that toward him pressed,\n And, as he bade, to swiftest speed\n Urged on his way each willing steed.\n The king's attendants parted thence,\n And paid him heart-felt reverence:\n In mind, and with the tears he wept,\n Each still his place near Ráma kept.\n As swift away the horses sped,\n His lords to Das'aratha said:\n 'To follow him whom thou again\n Wouldst see returning home is vain.'\n     With failing limb and drooping mien\n         He heard their counsel wise:\n     Still on their son the king and queen\n         Kept fast their lingering eyes.  1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto XLI.: The Citizens' Lament.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XXXIX.: Counsel To S&iacute;t&aacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XLI.: The Citizens' Lament. »",
