The troubled damsel sighed\n Sighs long and hot, and thus replied:\n 'What madness has possessed thy mind,\n To warnings deaf, to dangers blind?\n Canst thou not see the floods of woe\n That threaten o'er thine head to flow:\n First Ráma will the throne acquire,\n Then Ráma's son succeed his sire,\n While Bharat will neglected pine\n Excluded from the royal line.\n Not all his sons, O lady fair,\n The kingdom of a monarch share:\n All ruling when a sovereign dies\n Wild tumult in the state would rise.\n The eldest, be he good or ill,\n Is ruler by the father's will.\n Know, tender mother, that thy son\n Without a friend and all undone.\n Far from the joyous ease of home\n An alien from his race will roam.\n I sped to thee for whom I feel,\n But thy fond heart mistakes my zeal,\n Thy hand a present would bestow\n Because thy rival triumphs so.\n When Ráma once begins his sway\n Without a foe his will to stay,\n Thy darling Bharat he will drive\n To distant lands if left alive.\n By thee the child was sent away\n Beneath his grandsire's roof to stay.\n Even in stocks and stones perforce\n Will friendship spring from intercourse.\n The young S'atrughna too would go\n With Bharat, for he loved him so.\n As Lakshman still to Ráma cleaves,\n He his dear Bharat never leaves.\n There is an ancient tale they tell:\n A tree the foresters would fell\n Was saved by reeds that round it stood,\n For love that sprang of neighbourhood.\n So Lakshman Ráma will defend,\n And each on each for aid depend.\n Such fame on earth their friendship wins\n As that which binds the Heavenly Twins.\n And Ráma ne'er will purpose wrong\n To Lakshman, for their love is strong.\n But Bharat, Oh, of this be sure,\n Must evil at his hands endure.\n Come, Ráma from his home expel\n An exile in the woods to dwell.\n The plan, O Queen, which I advise\n Secures thy weal if thou be wise,\n So we and all thy kith and kin\n Advantage from thy gain shall win.\n Shall Bharat, meet for happier fate,\n Born to endure his rival's hate,\n With all his fortune ruined cower\n And dread his brother's mightier power!\n Up, Queen, to save thy son, arise;\n Prostrate at Ráma's feet he lies.\n So the proud elephant who leads\n His trooping consorts through the reeds\n Falls in the forest shade beneath\n The lion's spring and murderous teeth.\n Scorned by thee in thy bliss and pride\n Kaus'alyá was of old defied,\n And will she now forbear to show\n The vengeful rancour of a foe?\n     O Queen, thy darling is undone\n     When Ráma's hand has once begun\n         Ayodhyá's realm to sway,\n     Come, win the kingdom for thy child\n     And drive the alien to the wild\n         In banishment to-day.'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto IX.: The Plot.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto VII.: Manthar&aacute;'s Lament.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto IX.: The Plot. »",
