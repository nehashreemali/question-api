my will declare\n     The host be all arrayed.\n I to the wood my way will take,\n To Ráma supplication make,\n And for the world's advantage sake,\n     Will lead him home again.'\n Then, ordered thus, the charioteer\n Who listened with delighted ear,\n Went forth and gave his orders clear\n     To captains of the train.\n He gave the popular chiefs the word,\n And with the news his friends he stirred,\n And not a single man deferred\n     Preparing for the road.\n Then Bráhman, Warrior, Merchant, thrall,\n Obedient to Sumantra's call,\n Each in his house arose, and all\n Yoked elephant or camel tall,\n Or ass or noble steed in stall,\n     And full appointed showed.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 190:1  Not Bharat's uncle, but some councillor.\n 190:2  S'atakratu, Lord of a hundred sacrifices, the performance of a hundred As'vamedhas\n or sacrifices of a horse entitling the sacrificer\n to this exalted dignity.\n 190:3  The modern Malabar.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXXXIII.: The Journey Begun.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto LXXXI.: The Assembly.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto LXXXIII.: The Journey Begun. »",
