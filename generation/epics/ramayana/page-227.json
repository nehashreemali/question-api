Much more remains\n That should be said: but time constrains.\n Ere to his rest the sun descend,\n And shades of night the combat end,\n The twice seven thousand of my band\n Who fell beneath thy bloody hand\n Shall have their tears all wiped away\n And triumph in thy fall to-day.'\n \n \n He spoke, and loosing from his hold\n His mighty mace ringed round with gold,\n Like some red bolt alive with fire\n Hurled it at Ráma, mad with ire.\n The ponderous mace which Khara threw\n Sent fiery flashes as it flew.\n Trees, shrubs were scorched beneath the blast,\n As onward to its aim it passed.\n But Ráma, watching as it sped\n Dire as His noose who rules the dead,\n Cleft it with arrows as it came\n On rushing with a hiss and flame.\n Its fury spent and burnt away,\n Harmless upon the ground it lay\n Like a great snake in furious mood\n By herbs of numbing power subdued.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 262:1  Popularly supposed to cause death.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXX.: Khara's Death.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XXVIII.: Khara Dismounted.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XXX.: Khara's Death. »",
