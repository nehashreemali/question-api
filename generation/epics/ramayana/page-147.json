Dr. Hall's Edition) 'States, and\n tribes, and cities have disappeared, even\n from recollection; and some of the natural\n features of the country, especially the\n rivers, have undergone a total alteration.\n \n \n Notwithstanding these impediments, however,\n we should be able to identify at least\n mountains and rivers, to a much greater\n extent than is now practicable, if our\n maps were not so miserably defective in\n their nomenclature. None of our surveyors\n or geographers have been oriental\n scholars. It may be doubted if any of them have been conversant with the spoken language of the country. They have, consequently, put down names at random, according to their own inaccurate appreciation of sounds carelessly, vulgarly, and\n corruptly uttered; and their maps of India are crowded with appellations which bear no similitude whatever either to past\n or present denominations. \"We need not wonder that we cannot discover Sanskrit names in English maps, when, in the immediate vicinity of Calcutta, Barnagore represents Barahanagar, Dakshineswar is\n metamorphosed into Duckinsore, Ulubaria into Willoughbury.......There is scarcely a name in our Indian maps that does not afford proof of extreme indifference to accuracy in nomenclature, and of an incorrectness in estimating sounds, which is, in some degree, perhaps,\n a national defect.'\n \n \n For further information regarding the road from Ayodhya to Rajagriha, see Additional Notes.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXX.: Bharat's Departure.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto LXVIII.: The Envoys.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto LXX.: Bharat's Departure. »",
