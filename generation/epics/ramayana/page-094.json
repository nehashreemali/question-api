Blest is she,\n The Mother of a son like thee.\n Now rise, O Ráma, speed away.\n Go to thy sire without delay:\n For he and Queen Kaikeyí seek\n An interview with thee to speak.'\n \n \n The lion-lord of men, the best\n Of splendid heroes, thus addressed,\n To Sítá spake with joyful cheer:\n 'The king and qneen, my lady dear,\n Touching the throning, for my sake\n Some salutary counsel take.\n The lady ot the full black eye\n Would fain her husband gratify,\n And, all his purpose understood,\n Counsels the monarch to my good.\n A happy fate is mine, I ween,\n When he, consulting with his queen,\n Sumantra on this charge, intent\n Upon my gain and good, has sent.\n An envoy of so noble sort\n Well suits the splendour of the court.\n The consecration rite this day\n Will join me in imperial sway.\n To meet the lord of earth, for so\n His order bids me, I will go.\n Thou, lady, here in comfort stay,\n And with thy maidens rest or play.'\n \n \n Thus Ráma spake. For meet reply\n The lady of the large black eye\n Attended to the door her lord,\n And blessings on his head implored:\n 'The majesty and royal state\n Which holy Bráhmans venerate,\n The consecration and the rite\n Which sanctifies the ruler's might,\n And all imperial powers should be\n Thine by thy father's high decree,\n As He, the worlds who formed and planned,\n The kingship gave to Indra's hand.\n \n \n \n \n \n p. 112\n \n \n Then shall mine eyes my king adore\n When lustral rites and fast are o'er,\n And black deer's skin and roebuck's horn\n Thy lordly limbs and hand adorn.\n May He whose hands the thunder wield\n Be in the east thy guard and shield;\n May Yama's care the south befriend,\n And Varun's arm the west defend;\n And let Kuvera, Lord of Gold,\n The north with firm protection hold.'\n \n \n Then Ráma spoke a kind farewell,\n And hailed the blessings as they fell\n From Sítá's gentle lips; and then,\n As a young lion from his den\n Descends the mountain's stony side,\n So from the hall the hero hied.\n First Lakshman at the door he viewed\n Who stood in reverent attitude,\n Then to the central court he pressed\n Where watched the friends who loved him best.\n To all his dear companions there\n He gave kind looks and greeting fair.\n On to the lofty car that glowed\n Like fire the royal tiger strode.\n Bright as himself its silver shone:\n A tiger's skin was laid thereon.\n With cloudlike thunder, as it rolled,\n It flashed with gems and burnished gold,\n And, like the sun's meridian blaze,\n Blinded the eye that none could gaze.\n Like youthful elephants, tall and strong,\n Fleet coursers whirled the car along:\n In such a car the Thousand-eyed\n Borne by swift horses loves to ride.\n So like Parjanya,  1 when he flies\n Thundering through the autumn skies,\n The hero from the palace sped,\n As leaves the moon some cloud o'erhead.\n Still close to Ráma Lakshman kept,\n Behind him to the car he leapt,\n And, watching with fraternal care,\n Waved the long chouri's silver hair,\n As from the palace gate he came\n Up rose the tumult of acclaim.\n While loud huzza and jubilant shout\n Pealed from the gathered myriads out.\n Then elephants, like mountains vast,\n And steeds who all their kind surpassed,\n Followed their lord by hundreds, nay\n By thousands, led in long array.\n First marched a band of warriors trained,\n With sandal dust and aloe stained;\n Well armed was each with sword and bow,\n And every breast with hope aglow,\n And ever, as they onward went,\n     Shouts from the warrior train,\n And every sweet-toned instrument\n     Prolonged the minstrel strain.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n On passed the tamer of his foes,\n While well clad dames, in crowded rows,\n Each chamber lattice thronged to view,\n And chaplets on the hero threw.\n Then all, of peerless face and limb,\n Sang Ráma's praise for love of him,\n And blent their voices, soft and sweet.\n From palace high and crowded street:\n 'Now, sure, Kaus'alyá's heart must swell\n To see the son she loves so well,\n Thee Ráma, thee, her joy and pride,\n Triumphant o'er the realm preside.'\n Then--for they knew his bride most fair\n Of all who part the soft dark hair,\n His love, his life, possessed the whole\n Of her young hero's heart and soul:--\n 'Be sure the lady's fate repays\n Some mighty vow of ancient days,  1b\n For blest with Ráma's love is she\n As, with the Moon's, sweet Rohiní.'  2b\n \n \n Such were the witching words that came\n From lips of many a peerless dame\n Crowding the palace roofs to greet\n The hero as he gained the street.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 111:1  A star in the spike of Virgo: hence\n the name of the mouth Chaitra at Chait.\n 112:1   The Rain-God.\n \n \n Next: Canto XVII.: Ráma's Approach.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XV.: The Preparations.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XVII.: R&aacute;ma's Approach. »",
