lady's quest\n They turned their footsteps to the west.\n Through lonely woods that round them lay\n Ikshváku's children made their way,\n \n \n \n And armed with bow and shaft and brand\n Pressed onward to the southern land.\n Thick trees and shrubs and creepers grew\n In the wild grove they hurried through.\n 'Twas dark and drear and hard to pass\n For tangled thorns and matted grass.\n Still onward with a southern course\n They made their way with vigorous force\n And passing through the mazes stood\n Beyond that vast and fearful wood.\n With toil and hardship yet unspent\n Three leagues from Janasthán they went,\n And speeding on their way at last\n Within the wood of Krauncha  1 passed:\n A fearful forest wild and black\n As some huge pile of cloudy rack,\n Filled with all birds and beasts, where grew\n Bright blooms of every varied hue.\n On Sítá bending every thought\n Through all the mighty wood they sought,\n And at the lady's loss dismayed\n Here for a while and there they stayed.\n Then turning farther eastward they\n Pursued three leagues their weary way,\n Passed Krauncha's wood and reached the grove\n Where elephants rejoiced to rove.\n The chiefs that awful wood surveyed\n Where deer and wild birds filled each glade,\n Where scarce a step the foot could take\n For tangled shrub and tree and brake.\n There in a mountain's woody side\n A cave the royal brothers spied,\n With dread abysses deep as hell,\n Where darkness never ceased to dwell.\n When, pressing on, the lords of men\n Stood near the entrance of the den,\n They saw within the dark recess\n A huge misshapen giantess;\n A thing the timid heart that shook\n With fearful shape and savage look.\n Terrific fiend, her voice was fierce,\n Long were her teeth to rend and pierce.\n The monster gorged her horrid feast\n Of flesh of many a savage beast,\n While her long locks, at random flung,\n Dishevelled o'er her shoulders hung.\n Their eyes the royal brothers raised,\n And on the fearful monster gazed.\n Forth from her den she came and glanced\n At Lakshman as he first advanced,\n Her eager arms to hold him spread,\n And 'Come and be my love' she said,\n Then as she held him to her breast,\n The prince in words like these addressed:\n 'Behold thy treasure fond and fair:\n Ayomukhi  2 the name I bear.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 311\n \n \n In thickets of each lofty hill,\n On islets of each brook and rill,\n With me delighted shalt thou play,\n And live for many a lengthened day.'\n     Enraged he heard the monster woo;\n His ready sword he swiftly drew,\n And the sharp steel that quelled his foes\n Cut through her breast and ear and nose.\n Thus mangled by his vengeful sword\n In rage and pain the demon roared,\n And hideous with her awful face\n Sped to her secret dwelling place.\n Soon as the fiend had fled from sight,\n The brothers, dauntless in their might,\n Beached a wild forest dark and dread\n Whose tangled ways were hard to tread.\n Then bravest Lakshman, virtuous youth,\n The friend of purity and truth,\n With reverent palm to palm applied\n Thus to his glorious brother cried:\n     'My arm presaging throbs amain,\n My troubled heart is sick with pain,\n And cheerless omens ill portend\n Where'er my anxious eyes I bend.\n Dear brother, hear my words: advance\n Resolved and armed for every chance,\n For every sign I mark to-day\n Foretells a peril in the way.\n This bird of most ill-omened note,\n Loud streaming with discordant throat,\n Announces with a warning cry\n That strife and victory are nigh.'\n     Then as the chiefs their search pursued\n Throughout the dreary solitude,\n They heard amazed a mighty sound\n That broke the very trees around.\n As though a furious tempest passed\n Crashing the wood beneath its blast.\n Then Ráma raised his trusty sword,\n And both the hidden cause explored.\n There stood before their wondering eyes\n A fiend broad-chested, huge of size.\n A vast misshapen trunk they saw\n In height surpassing nature's law.\n It stood before them dire and dread\n Without a neck, without a head.\n Tall as some hill aloft in air,\n Its limbs were clothed with bristling hair,\n And deep below the monster's waist\n His vast misshapen mouth was placed.\n His form was huge, his voice was loud\n As some dark-tinted thunder cloud,\n Forth from his ample chest there came\n A brilliance as of gushing flame.\n Beneath long lashes, dark and keen\n The monster's single eye was seen.\n Deep in his chest, long, fiercely bright,\n It glittered with terrific light.\n He swallowed down his savage fare\n Of lion, bird, and slaughtered bear,\n Aud with huge teeth exposed to view\n \n \n O'er his great lips his tongue he drew.\n His arms unshapely, vast and dread,\n A league in length, he raised and spread.\n He seized with monstrous hands a herd\n Of deer and many a bear and bird.\n Among them all he picked and chose,\n Drew forward these, rejected those.\n Before the princely pair he stood\n Barring their passage through the wood.\n A league of shade the chiefs had passed\n When on the fiend their eyes they cast.\n A monstrous shape without a head\n With mighty arms before him spread,\n They saw that hideous trunk appear\n That struck the trembling eye with fear.\n Then, stretching to their full extent\n His awful arms with fingers bent,\n Bound Raghu's princely sons he cast\n Each grasping limb and held them fast.\n Though strong of arm and fierce in fight,\n Each armed with bow and sword to smite,\n The royal brothers, brave and bold,\n Were helpless in the giant's hold.\n Then Raghu's son, heroic still,\n Felt not a pang his bosom thrill;\n But young, with no protection near,\n His brother's heart was sad with fear,\n And thus with trembling tongue he said\n To Ráma, sore disquieted:\n     'Ah me, ah me, my days are told:\n O see me in the giant's hold.\n Fly, son of Raghu, swiftly flee,\n And thy dear self from danger free.\n Me to the fiend an offering give;\n Fly at thine ease thyself and live.\n Thou, great Katkutstha's son, I ween,\n Wilt find ere long thy Maithil queen,\n And when thou holdest, throned again,\n Thine old hereditary reign,\n With servants prompt to do thy will,\n O think upon thy brother still.'\n As thus the trembling Lakshman cried,\n The dauntless Ráma thus replied:\n 'Brother, from causeless dread forbear.\n A chief like thee should scorn despair.'\n He spoke to soothe his wild alarm:\n Then fierce Kabandha  1 long of arm,\n Among the Dánavs  2 first and best,\n The sons of Raghu thus addressed:\n 'What men are you, whose shoulders show\n Broad as a bull's, with sword and bow,\n Who roam this dark and horrid place.\n Brought by your fate before my face?\n Declare by what occasion led\n These solitary wilds you tread,\n With swords and bows and shafts to pierce,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 312\n \n \n Like bulls whose horns are strong and fierce.\n Why have you sought this forest land\n Where wild with hunger's pangs I stand?\n Now as your steps my path have crossed\n Esteem your lives already lost?\n     The royal brothers heard with dread\n The words which fierce Kabandha said.\n And Ráma to his brother cried,\n Whose cheek by blanching fear was dried.\n     'Alas, we fall, O valiant chief,\n From sorrow into direr grief,\n Still mourning her I hold so dear\n We see our own destruction near.\n Mark, brother, mark what power has time\n O'er all that live, in every chime\n Now, lord of men, thyself and me\n Involved in fatal danger see.\n 'Tis not, be sure, the might of Fate\n That crushes all with deadly weight.\n Ne'er can the brave and strong, who know\n The use of spear and sword and bow,\n The force of conquering time withstand,\n But fall like barriers built of sand.\n     Thus in calm strength which naught could shake\n The son of Das'aratha spake,\n     With glory yet unstained\n Upon Sumitrá's son he bent\n His eyes, and firm in his intent\n     His dauntless heart maintained.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 310:1  Or Curlews' Wood.\n 310:2  Iron-faced.\n 311:1  Kabandha means a trunk.\n 311:2  A class of mythological giants.
