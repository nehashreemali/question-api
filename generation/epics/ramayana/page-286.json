subdue,--'tis friendship's claim,--\n My foe who bears a brother's name.\n Strike Báli down beneath thy feet:\n With suppliant hands I thus entreat,'\n Sugríva ceased, and Ráma pressed\n The grateful Vánar to his breast;\n And thoughts of kindred feeling woke\n In Lakshman's bosom, as he spoke:\n 'On to Kishkindhá, on with speed!\n Thou, Vánar King, our way shalt lead,\n Then challenge Báli forth to fight.\n Thy foe who scorns a brother's right.'\n     They sought Kishkindhá's gate and stood\n Concealed by trees in densest wood,\n Sugríva, to the fight addressed,\n More closely drew his cinctured vest,\n And raised a wild sky-piercing shout\n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 339\n \n \n To call the foeman Báli out.\n Forth came impetuous Báli, stirred\n To fury by the shout he heard.\n So the great sun, ere night has ceased,\n Springs up impatient to the east.\n Then fierce and wild the conflict raged\n As hand to hand the foes engaged,\n As though in battle mid the stars\n Fought Mercury and fiery Mars.  1\n To highest pitch of frenzy wrought\n With fists like thunderbolts they fought,\n While near them Ráma took his stand,\n And viewed the battle, bow in hand.\n Alike they stood in form and might,\n Like heavenly As'vins  2 paired in fight,\n Nor might the son of Raghu know\n Where fought the friend and where the foe;\n So, while his bow was ready bent.\n No life-destroying shaft he sent.\n Crushed down by Báli's mightier stroke\n Sugríva's force now sank and broke,\n Who, hoping naught from Ráma's aid,\n To Rishyamúka fled dismayed,\n Weary, and faint, and wounded sore,\n His body bruised and dyed with gore,\n From Báli's blows, in rage and dread,\n Afar to sheltering woods he fled.\n     Nor Báli farther dared pursue,\n The curbing curse too well he knew.\n 'Fled from thy death!' the victor cried,\n And home the mighty warrior hied.\n Hanúmán, Lakshman, Raghu's son\n Beheld the conquered Vánar run.\n And followed to the sheltering shade\n Where yet Sugríva stood dismayed.\n Near and more near the chieftains came,\n Then, for intolerable shame,\n Not daring yet to lift his eyes,\n Sugríva spoke with burning sighs:\n 'Thy matchless strength I first beheld,\n And dared my foe, by thee impelled.\n Why hast thou tried me with deceit\n And urged me to a sure defeat?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thou shouldst have said, 'I will not slay\n Thy foeman in the coming fray.'\n For had I then thy purpose known\n I had not waged the fight alone.'\n     The Vánar sovereign, lofty-souled,\n In plaintive voice his sorrows told.\n Then Ráma spake: 'Sugríva, list,\n All anger from thy heart dismissed,\n And I will tell the cause that stayed\n Mine arrow, and withheld the aid.\n In dress, adornment, port, and height,\n In splendour, battle-shout, and might,\n No shade of difference could I see\n Between thy foe, O King, and thee.\n So like was each, I stood at gaze,\n My senses lost in wildering maze,\n Nor loosened from my straining bow\n A deadly arrow at the foe,\n Lest in my doubt the shaft should send\n To sudden death our surest friend.\n O, if this hand in heedless guilt\n And rash resolve thy blood had spilt,\n Through every land, O Vánar King,\n My wild and foolish act would ring,\n Sore weight of sin on him must lie\n By whom a friend is made to die;\n And Lakshman, I, and Sítá, best\n Of dames, on thy protection rest.\n On, warrior! for the fight prepare;\n Nor fear again thy foe to dare.\n Within one hour thine eye shall view\n My arrow strike thy foeman through;\n Shall see the stricken Báli lie\n Low on the earth, and gasp and die.\n But come, a badge about thee bind,\n O monarch of the Vánar kind.\n That in the battle shock mine eyes\n The friend and foe may recognize.\n Come, Lakshman, let that creeper deck\n With brightest bloom Sugríva's neck,\n And be a happy token, twined\n Around the chief of lofty mind.'\n     Upon the mountain slope there grew\n A threading creeper fair to view,\n And Lakshman plucked the bloom and round\n Sugríva's neck a garland wound,\n Graced with the flowery wreath he wore,\n The Vánar chief the semblance bore\n Of a dark cloud at close of day\n Engarlanded with cranes at play,\n In glorious light the Vánar glowed\n As by his comrade's side he strode.\n And, still on Ráma's word intent,\n His steps to great Kishkindhá bent.\n \n \n p. 340\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 338:1  The Bengal recension makes it return\n In the form of a swan.\n 338:2  Varuna is one of the oldest of the\n Vedic Gods, corresponding in name and\n partly in character to the οὐρανός of\n the Greeks and is often regarded as the\n supreme deity. He upholds heaven and\n earth, possesses extraordinary power and\n wisdom, sends his messengers through\n both worlds, numbers the very winkings\n of men's eyes, punishes transgressors whom\n he seizes with his deadly noose, and pardons\n the sins of those who are penitent. In\n later mythology he has become the God\n of the sea.\n 339:1  Budha, not to be confounded with the\n great reformer Buddha, is the son of Soma\n or the Moon, and regent of the planet\n Mercury. Angára is the regent of Mars\n who is called the red or the fiery planet.\n The encounter between Michael and Satan\n is similarly said to have been as if\n \n     \"Two planets rushing from aspect malign\n     Of fiercest opposition in midsky\n     Should combat, and their jarring spheres\n     compound.\"\n \n Paradise Lost. Book VI.\n 339:2  The As'vins or Heavenly Twins, the\n Dioskuri or Castor and Pollux of the\n Hindus, have frequently been mentioned.\n See p. 36, Note\n \n \n Next: Canto XIII.: The Return To Kishkindhá.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto XI.: Dundubhi.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto XIII.: The Return To Kishkindh&aacute;. »",
