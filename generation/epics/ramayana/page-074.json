Ráma! soft they cried.\n The gift he took, no word replied.\n Then Bhrigu's son his silence broke\n And thus to Ráma Ráma spoke:\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 85:1   This is another Ráma, son of Jamadagni,\n called Paras'uráma, or Ráma with\n the axe, from the weapon which he\n carried. He was while he lived the terror\n ot the Warrior caste, and his name recalls\n long and fierce struggles between the\n sacerdotal and military order in which\n tne latter suffered severely at the hands\n of their implacable enemy.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXXV.: The Parle.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LXXIII.: The Nuptials.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LXXV.: The Parle. »",
