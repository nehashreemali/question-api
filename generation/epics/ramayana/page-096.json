To the princely youth\n Who loved the right and spoke the truth,\n Cruel, abominable came\n The answer of the ruthless dame:\n 'When Gods and Titans fought of yore,\n Transfixed with darts and bathed in gore\n Two boons to me thy father gave\n For the dear life 'twas mine to save.\n Of him I claim the ancient debt,\n That Bharat on the throne be set,\n And thou, O Ráma, go this day\n To Dandak forest far away.\n Now, Ráma, if thou wilt maintain\n Thy father's faith without a stain,\n And thine own truth and honour clear,\n Then, best of men, my bidding hear.\n Do thou thy father's word obey,\n Nor from the pledge he gave me stray.\n Thy life in Dandak forest spend\n Till nine long years and five shall end.\n Upon my Bharat's princely head\n Let consecrating drops be shed,\n With all the royal pomp for thee\n Made ready by the king's decree.\n Seek Dandak forest and resign\n Rites that would make the empire thine,\n For twice seven years of exile wear\n The coat of bark and matted hair.\n Then in thy stead let Bharat reign\n Lord of his royal sire's domain,\n Rich in the fairest gems that shine,\n Cars, elephants, and steeds, and kine.\n The monarch mourns thy altered fate\n And vails his brow compassionate:\n Bowed down by bitter grief he lies\n And dares not lift to thine his eyes.\n Obey his word: be firm and brave,\n And with great truth the monarch save.'\n     While thus with cruel words she spoke,\n         No grief the noble youth betrayed;\n     But forth the father's anguish broke,\n         At his dear Ráma's lot dismayed.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 113:1  The Sea.\n \n \n Next: Canto XIX.: Ráma's Promise.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XVII.: R&aacute;ma's Approach.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XIX.: R&aacute;ma's Promise. »",
