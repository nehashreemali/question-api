In the great\n Mother of the Gods is, perhaps, figured\n the dry earth: Indra the God of thunder\n rends it open, and there issue from its\n rent bosom the Maruts or exhalations of\n the earth. But such ancient myths are difficult\n to interpret with absolute certainty.'\n GORRESIO.\n 59:2b  Wind.\n 59:3b  Indra, with mahá, great, prefixed.\n \n \n Next: Canto XLVIII.: Indra And Ahalyá\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto XLVI.: Diti's Hope.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto XLVIII.: Indra And Ahaly&aacute; »",
