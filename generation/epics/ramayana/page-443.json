O warrior, stay:\n 'Turn on the foe, and rend and slay:'\n Such were the cries, such words of fear\n Smote through the gloom each listening ear.\n Each swarthy rover of the night\n Whose golden armour flashed with light,\n Showed like a towering hill embraced\n By burning woods about his waist.\n The giants at the Vánars flew,\n And ravening ate the foes they slew:\n With mortal bite like serpent's fang,\n The Vánars at the giants sprang,\n And car and steeds and they who bore\n The pennons fell bedewed with gore,\n No serried band, no firm array\n The fury of their charge could stay\n Down went the horse and rider, down\n Went giant lords of high renown.\n Though midnight's shade was dense and dark,\n With skill that swerved not from the mark\n \n \n \n \n Their bows the sons of Raghu drew,\n And each keen shaft a chieftain slew.\n Uprose the blinding dust from meads\n Ploughed by the cars and trampling steeds,\n And where the warriors fell the flood\n Was dark and terrible with blood.\n Six giants  1b singled Ráma out,\n And charged him with a furious shout\n Loud as the roaring of the sea\n When every wind is raging free.\n Six times he shot: six heads were cleft;\n Six giants dead on earth were left.\n Nor ceased he yet: his bow he strained,\n And from the sounding weapon rained\n A storm of shafts whose fiery glare\n Filled all the region of the air;\n And chieftains dropped before his aim\n Like moths that perish in the flame.\n Earth glistened where the arrows fell,\n As shines in autumn nights a dell\n Which fireflies, flashing through the gloom,\n With momentary light illume.\n \n \n But Indrajit, when Báli's son  2b\n The victory o'er the foe had won.\n Saw with a fury-kindled eye\n His mangled steeds and driver die;\n Then, lost in air, he fled the fight,\n And vanished from the victor's sight.\n The Gods and saints glad voices raised,\n And Angad for his virtue praised;\n And Raghu's sons bestowed the meed\n Of honour due to valorous deed.\n \n \n Compelled his shattered car to quit,\n Rage filled the soul of Indrajit,\n Who brooked not, strong by Brahmá's grace\n Defeat from one of Vánar race.\n In magic mist concealed from view\n His bow the treacherous warrior drew,\n And Raghu's sons were first to feel\n The tempest of his winged steel.\n Then when his arrows failed to kill\n The princes who defied him still,\n He bound them with the serpent noose,  3b\n The magic bond which none might loose.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 460:1  I have omitted several of these single\n combats, as there is little variety in the\n details and each duel results in the victory\n of the Vánar or his ally.\n \n \n Next: Canto XLV.: Indrajit's Victory.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto XLIII.: The Single Combats.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto XLV.: Indrajit's Victory. »",
