let me go\n And wander like a woodland roe.'\n \n \n Then, while no tear the hero shed.\n Thus to the weeping queen he said:\n 'Mother, while lives the husband, he\n Is woman's lord and deity.\n O dearest lady, thou and I\n Our lord and king must ne'er deny;\n The lord of earth himself have we\n Our guardian wise and friend to be.\n And Bharat, true to duty's call,\n Whose sweet words take the hearts of all,\n Will serve thee well, and ne'er forget\n The virtuous path before him set.\n Be this, I pray, thine earnest care,\n That the old king my father ne'er,\n When I have parted hence, may know,\n Grieved for his son, a pang of woe.\n Let not this grief his soul distress,\n To kill him with the bitterness.\n With duteous care, in every thing,\n Love, comfort, cheer the aged king.\n Though, best of womankind, a spouse\n Keeps firmly all her fasts and vows,\n Nor yet her husband's will obeys, '\n She treads in sin's forbidden ways.\n She to her husband's will who bends,\n Goes to high bliss that never ends,\n Yea, though the Gods have found in her\n No reverential worshipper.\n Bent on his weal, a woman still\n Must seek to do her husband's will:\n For Scripture, custom, law uphold\n This duty Heaven revealed of old.\n Honour true Bráhmans for my sake,\n And constant offerings duly make,\n With fire-oblations and with flowers,\n To all the host of heavenly powers.\n Look to the coming time, and yearn\n For the glad hour of my return.\n And still thy duteous course pursue,\n Abstemious, humble, kind, and true.\n The highest bliss shall thou obtain\n When I from exile come again,\n If, best of those who keep the right,\n The king my sire still see the light.'\n \n \n The queen, by Ráma thus addressed,\n Still with a mother's grief oppressed,\n While her long eyes with tears were dim,\n Began once more and answered him:\n 'Not by my pleading maybe stayed\n The firm resolve thy soul has made.\n My hero, thou wilt go; and none\n The stern commands of Fate may shun.\n Go forth, dear child whom naught can bend\n And may all bliss thy steps attend.\n Thou wilt return, and that dear day\n Will chase mine every grief away.\n Thou wilt return, thy duty done,\n Thy vows discharged, high glory won;\n From filial debt wilt thou be free,\n And sweetest joy will come on me.\n My son, the will of mighty Fate\n At every time must dominate,\n If now it drives thee hence to stray\n Heedless of me who bid thee stay.\n Go, strong of arm, go forth, my boy,\n Go forth, again to come with joy,\n And thine expectant mother cheer\n With those sweet tones she loves to hear.\n O that the blessed hour were nigh\n When thou shalt glad this anxious eye,\n With matted hair and hermit dress\n returning from the wilderness.'\n     Kaus'alyá's conscious soul approved,\n         As her proud glance she bent\n     On Ráma constant and unmoved,\n         Resolved on banishment.\n     Such words, with happy omens fraught\n         To her dear son she said,\n     Invoking with each eager thought\n         A blessing on his head.\n \n \n p. 124\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto XXV.: Kaus'alya's Blessing.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XXIII.: Lakshman's Anger.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XXV.: Kaus'alya's Blessing. »",
