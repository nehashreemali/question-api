Allow\n My husband to complete his vow;\n Let us returning, I entreat,\n Kaus'alyá and Sumitrá meet.'\n Then with her hands together placed\n Around the tree she duly paced.\n When Ráma saw his blameless spouse\n A suppliant under holy boughs,\n The gentle darling of his heart,\n He thus to Lakshman spake apart:\n 'Brother, by thee our way be led;\n Let Sitá close behind thee tread:\n I, best of men, will grasp my bow,\n And hindmost of the three will go.\n What fruits soe'er her fancy take,\n Or flowers half hidden in the brake,\n For Janak's child forget not thou\n To gather from the brake or bough.\"\n \n \n Thus on they fared. The tender dame\n Asked Ráma, as they walked, the name\n Of every shrub that blossoms bore,\n Creeper, and tree unseen before:\n And Lakshman fetched, at Sitá's prayer,\n Boughs of each tree with clusters fair.\n Then Janak's daughter joyed to see\n The sand-discoloured river flee,\n Where the glad cry of many a bird,\n The sa'ras and the swan, was heard.\n A league the brothers travelled through\n The forest noble game they slew:\n Beneath the trees their meal they dressed\n And sat them down to eat and rest.\n A while in that delightful shade\n Where elephants unnumbered strayed.\n Where peacocks screamed and monkeys played.\n \n \n p. 161\n \n \n     They wandered with delight.\n Then by the river's side they found\n A pleaaant spot of level ground,\n Where all was smooth and fair around,\n     Their lodging for the night.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 160:1  Another name of the Jumna, daughter\n of the Sun.\n \n \n Next: Canto LVI.: Chitrakuta.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto LIV.: Bharadv&aacute;ja's Hermitage.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto LVI.: Chitrakuta. »",
