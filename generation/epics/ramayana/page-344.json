Crowned with plant and tree,\n And stood above the foamy* sea.  2b\n There with his lofty peaks apraised\n Bright as a hundred suns he blazed,\n And crest and crag of burnished gold\n Flashed on the flood that round him rolled,*\n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 395\n \n \n The Vánar thought the mountain rose\n A hostile bar to interpose,\n And, like a wind-swept cloud, o'erthrew\n The glittering mountain as he flew.\n Then from the falling hill rang out\n A warning voice and joyful shout.\n Again he raised him high in air\n To meet the flying Vánar there,\n And standing on his topmost peak\n In human form began to speak: 1\n 'Best of the Vánars' noblest line,\n A mighty task, O chief, is thine.\n Here for a while, I pray thee, light\n And rest upon the breezy height.\n A prince of Raghu's line was he\n Who gave his glory to the Sea, 2\n Who now to Rama's envoy shows\n High honour for the debt he owes.\n He bade me lift my buried head\n Uprising from my watery bed,\n And woo the Vanar chief to rest\n A moment on my glittering crest,\n Refresh thy weary limbs, and eat\n My mountain fruits for they are sweet.\n I too, O chieftain, know thee well;-\n Three worlds thy famous virtues tell;\n And none, I ween, with thee may vie\n Who spring impetuous through the sky.\n To every guest, though mean and low.\n The wise respect and honour show;\n And how shall I neglect thee, how\n Slight the great guest so near me now?\n Son of the Wind,'tis thine to share\n The might of him who shakes the air;\n And,--for he loves his offspring,--he\n Is honoured when I honour thee.\n Of yore, when Krita's age  3 was new,\n The little hills and mountains flew\n Where'er they listed, borne on wings\n More rapid the feathered king's. 4\n But mighty terror came on all\n The Gods and saints who feared their fall.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And Indra in his anger rent\n Their pinions with the bolts he sent.\n When in his ruthless fury he\n Levelled his flashing bolt at me,\n The great-souled Wind inclined to save,\n And laid me neath the ocean's wave.\n Thus by the favour of the sire\n I kept my cherished wings entire;\n And for this deed of kindness done\n I honour thee his noble son.\n O come, thy weary limbs relieve,\n And honour due from me receive.'\n 'I may not rest,' the Vanar cried;\n 'I must not stay or turn aside.\n Yet pleased am I, thou noblest hill,\n And as the deed accept thy will.'\n     Thus as he spoke he lightly pressed\n With his broad hand the mountain's crest.\n Then bounded upward to the height\n Of heaven, rejoicing in his might,\n And through the fields of boundless blue,\n The pathway of his father, flew.\n Gods, saints, and heavenly bards beheld\n That flight that none had paralleled,\n Then to the Nagas' mother  1b came\n And thus addressed the sun-bright dame:\n 'See, Hauum'an with venturous leap\n Would spring across the mighty deep,-\n A Viinar prince, the Wind-God's seed:\n Come, Suras'a, his course impede.\n In Rakshas form thy shape disguise,\n Terrific, like a hill in size:\n Let thy red eyes with fury glow,\n And high as heaven thy body grow.\n With fearful tusks the chief defy.\n That we his power and strength may try.\n He will with guile thy hold elude,\n Or own thy might, by thee subdued.'\n     Pleased with the grateful honours paid,\n The godlike dame their words obeyed,\n Clad in a shape of terror she\n Sprang from the middle of the sea,\n And, with fierce accents that appalled\n All creatures, to the Vanar called:\n 'Come, prince of Vanars, doomed to be\n My food this day by heaven's decree.\n Such boon from ages long ago\n To Brahma's favouring will I owe.'\n     She ceased, and Hanuman replied,\n By shape and threat unterrified:\n 'Brave Rama with his Maithil spouse\n Lodged in the shade of Dandak's boughs.\n Thence Ravan king of giants stole\n Sita the joy of Rama's soul.\n \n \n \n \n p. 396\n \n \n By Ráma's high behest to her\n I go a willing messenger;\n And never shouldst them hinder one\n Who toils for Das'aratha's son.\n First captive Sítá will I see,\n And him who sent and waits for me,\n Then come and to thy will submit,\n Yea, by my truth I promise it.'\n 'Nay, hope not thus thy life to save;\n Not such the boon that Brahma gave.\n Enter my mouth,' was her reply,\n 'Then forward on thy journey hie!'  1\n \n \n 'Stretch, wider stretch thy jaws,' exclaimed\n The Vánar chief, to ire inflamed;\n And, as the Rákshas near him drew,\n Ten leagues in height his stature grew.\n Then straight, her threatening jaws between,\n A gulf of twenty leagues was seen.\n To fifty leagues he waxed, and still\n Her mouth grew wider at her will.\n Then smaller than a thumb became,\n Shrunk by his power, the Vánar's frame.  2\n He leaped within, and turning round\n Sprang through the portal at a bound.\n Then hung in air a moment, while\n He thus addressed her with a smile:\n 'O Daksha's child,  3 farewell at last!\n For I within thy mouth have passed.\n Thou hast the gift of Brahmá's grace:\n I go, the Maithil queen to trace.'\n Then, to her former shape restored,\n She thus addressed the Vánar lord:\n 'Then forward to the task, and may\n Success and joy attend thy way!\n Go, and the rescued lady bring\n In triumph to her lord and king.'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then hosts of spirits as they gazed\n The daring of the Vánar praised.\n Through the broad fields of ether, fast\n Garud's royal self, he passed,\n The region of the cloud and rain,\n Loved by the gay Gandharva train,\n Where mid the birds that came and went\n Shone Indra's glorious bow unbent,\n And like a host of wandering stars\n Flashed the high Gods' celestial cars.\n Fierce Sinhiká  1b who joyed in ill\n And changed her form to work her will,\n Descried him on his airy way\n And marked the Vánar for her prey.\n 'This day at length,' the demon cried,\n 'My hunger shall be satisfied,'\n And at his passing shadow caught\n Delighted with the cheering thought.\n The Vánar felt the power that stayed\n And held him as she grasped his shade,\n Like some tall ship upon the main\n That struggles with the wind in vain.\n Below, above, his eye he bent\n And scanned the sea and firmament.\n High from the briny deep upreared\n The monster's hideous form appeared,\n 'Sugríva's tale,' he cried,'is true:\n This is the demon dire to view\n Of whom the Vánar monarch told,\n Whose grasp a passing shade can hold.'\n Then, as a cloud in rain-time grows.\n His form, dilating, swelled and rose.\n Wide as the space from heaven to hell\n Her jaws she opened with a yell,\n And rushed upon her fancied prey\n With cloud-like roar to seize and slay.\n The Vánar swift as thought compressed\n His borrowed bulk of limb and chest,\n And stood with one quick bound inside\n The monstrous mouth she opened wide.\n Hid like the moon when Ráhu  2b draws\n The orb within his ravening jaws.\n Within that ample cavern pent\n The demon's form he tore and rent,\n And, from the mangled carcass freed,\n Came forth again with thought-like speed.  3b\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 397\n \n \n Thus with his skill the fiend he slew,\n Then to his wonted stature grew.\n The spirits saw the demon die.\n And hailed the Vánar from the sky:\n 'Well hast thou fought a wondrous fight\n Nor spared the fiend's terrific might,\n On, on! perform the blameless deed,\n And in thine every wish succeed.\n Ne're can they fail in whom combine\n Such valour; thought, and skill as thine.'\n \n \n Pleased with their praises as they sang,\n Again through fields of air he sprang,\n And now, his travail wellnigh done,\n The distint shore was almost won,\n Before him on the margent stood\n In long dark line a waving wood,\n And the fair island, bright and green\n With flowers and trees, was clearly seen,\n And every babbling brook that gave\n Her lord the sea a tribute wave.\n He lighted down on Lamba's peak\n Which tinted metals stain and streak,\n And looked where Lanká's splendid town\n Shone on the mountain like a crown.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 394:1  This Book is called Sundar or the\n Beatiful. To a European taste it is the\n most intolerably tedious of the whole\n poem, abounding in repetition, overloaded\n description, and long aud useless speeches\n which impede the action of the poem.\n Manifest interpolations of whole Cantos\n also occur. I have omitted none of the\n action of the Book, but have occasionally\n omitted long passages of common-place\n description, lamentation, and long stories\n which have been again and again repeated.\n 394:2  Brahmá the Self-Existent.\n 394:1b  Maináka was the son of Rimálaya*\n and Mená or Menaka.\n 394:2b  Thus Milton makes the hills of heaven\n self-moving at command:\n \n \n 'At his comma*d the uprooted hiils retired\n Each to his place, they heard his voice and went Obsequious'\n 395:1  The spirit of the mountain is\n separable from the mountain. Himalaya has\n also been represented as standing in human\n on one of his own peaks.\n 395:2  Sagar or the Sea is said to have\n derived its name from Sagar. The story is\n fully told in Book I, Cantos XLII, XLIII,\n and XLlV.\n 395:3  Kritu is the first of the four ages of\n the world, the golden age, also called\n Satya.\n 395:4  Parvata means a mountain and in the\n Vedas a cloud. Hence in later mythology\n the mountain have taken the place of\n the clouds as the objects of the attacks of\n Indra the Sun-God. The feathered king\n is Garuda.\n 395:1b  \"The children of Surasa were a\n thousand mighty many-headed serpents,\n traversing the sky.\"\n WlLSON'S Vishnu Purana,\n Vol.II. p.73.\n 396:1  She means, says the Commentator,\n pursue thy journey if thou can.\n 396:2  If Milton's spirits are allowed the\n power of infinite self-extension and\n compression the same must be conceded to\n Válmíki's supernatural beings. Given the\n power as in Milton the result in Válmíki\n is perfectly consistent.\n 396:3  \"Daksha is the son of Brahmá and\n one of the Prajápatis or divine progenitors.\n He had sixty daughters, twenty-seven of\n whom married to Kas'yapa produced,\n according to one of the Indian cosmogonies,\n all mundane beings. Does the\n epithet, Descendant of Daksha, given to\n Surasá, mean that she is one of those\n daughters? I think not. This epithet is\n perhaps an appellation common to all\n created beings as having sprung from\n Daksha.\" GORRESIO.\n 396:1b  Sinhiká is the mother of Ráhu the\n dragon's head or ascending node, the chief\n agent in eclipses.\n 396:2b  Ráhu is the demon who causes eclipses\n by attempting to swallow the sun and\n moon.\n 396:3b  According to De Gubernatis, the\n author of the very learned, ingenious, and\n interesting though too fanciful Zoological\n Mythology. Hanuman here represents the\n sun entering into and escaping from a\n cloud. The biblical Jonah, according to\n him, typifies the same phenomenon. Sádi, p. 395\n speaking of sunset, says Yùnas andar-i-dihán-i\n máhi shud: Jonas was within the\n fish's mouth.
