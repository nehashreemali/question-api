'Tis well!\n His daughter Sítá thus bestowed,\n O'er whom the sacred drops had flowed.\n King Janak's heart with rapture glowed.\n Then to Prince Lakshman thus he cried'.\n 'Take Urmilá thine offered bride,\n And clasp her hand within thine own\n Ere yet the lucky hour be flown.'\n Then to Prince Bharat thus cried he;\n 'Come, take the hand of Mándavi.'\n Then to S'atrughna: 'In thy grasp\n The hand of S'rutakirti clasp.\n Now, Raghu's sons, may all of you\n Be gentle to your wives and true;\n \n \n p. 85\n \n \n Keep well the vows you make to-day,\n Nor let occasion slip away.'\n \n \n King Janak's word the youths obeyed;\n The maidens' hands in theirs they laid.\n Then with their brides the princes went\n With ordered steps and reverent\n Bound both the tire and Janak, round\n The sages and the sacred ground.\n \n \n A flowery flood of lucid dyes\n In rain descended from the skies,\n While with celestial voices blent\n Sweet strains from many an instrument,\n And the nymphs danced in joyous throng\n Responsive to the minstrel's song.\n Such signs of exultation they\n Saw on the princes' wedding day.\n Still rang the heavenly music's sound\n When Raghu's sons thrice circled round\n The fire, each one with reverent head,\n And homeward then their brides they led.\n They to the sumptuous palace hied\n That Janak's care had seen supplied.\n The monarch girt with saint and peer\n Still fondly gazing followed near.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXXIV.: Ráma With The Axe.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LXXII.: The Gift of Kine.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LXXIV.: R&aacute;ma With The Axe. »",
