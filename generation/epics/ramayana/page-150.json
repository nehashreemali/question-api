why\n Wilt thou, famed Prince, so lowly lie?\n Not by such grief as this are moved\n Good men like thee, by all approved.\n The earth thy father nobly swayed,\n And rites to Heaven he duly paid.\n At length his race of life was run:\n Thou shouldst not mourn for him, my son.'\n \n \n Long on the ground he wept, and rolled\n From side to side, still unconsoled,\n And then, with bitter grief oppressed,\n His mother with those words addressed:\n \n \n p. 181\n \n \n 'This joyful hope my bosom fed\n When from my grandsire's halls I sped--\n 'The king will throne his eldest son,\n And sacrifice, as should be done.'\n But all is changed, my hope was vain,\n And this sad heart is rent in twain,\n For my dear father's face I miss,\n Who ever sought his loved ones' bliss.\n But in my absence, mother, say,\n What sickness took my sire away?\n Ah, happy Ráma, happy they\n Allowed his funeral rites to pay!\n The glorious monarch has not learned\n That I his darling have returned,\n Or quickly had he hither sped,\n And pressed his kisses on my head.\n Where is that hand whose gentle touch,\n Most soft and kind I loved so much,\n The hand that loved to brush away\n The dust that on his darling lay?\n Quick, bear the news to Ráma's ear;\n Tell the great chief that I am here:\n Brother, and sire, and friend, and all\n Is he, and I his trusty thrall,\n For noble hearts, to virtue true,\n Their sires in elder brothers view.\n To clasp his feet I fain would bow:\n He is my hope and refuge now.\n What said my glorious sire, who knew\n Virtue and vice, so brave and true?\n Firm in his vows, dear lady, say,\n What said he ere he passed away?\n What was his rede to me? I crave\n To hear the last advice he gave.'\n \n \n Thus closely questioned by the youth,\n Kaikeyi spoke the mournful truth:\n 'The high-souled monarch wept and sighed,\n For Ráma, Sítá, Lakshman, cried,\n Then, best of all who go to bliss,\n Passed to the world which follows this.\n 'Ah, blessed are the people who\n Shall Ráma and his Sítá view,   \n And Lakshman of the mighty arm,\n Returning free from scathe and harm.'\n Such were the words, the last of all,\n Thy father, ere he died, let fall,\n By Fate and Death's dread coils enwound,\n As some great elephant is bound.'\n \n \n He heard, yet deeper in despair,\n Her lips this double woe declare,\n And with sad brow that showed his pain\n Questioned his mother thus again:\n 'But where is he, of virtue tried,\n Who fills Kaus'alyá's heart with pride,\n Where is the noble Ráma? where\n Is Lakshman brave, and Sítá fair?'\n \n \n Thus pressed, the queen began to tell\n The story as each thing befell,\n And gave her son in words like these,\n The mournful news she meant to please:\n 'The prince is gone in hermit dress\n To Dandak's mighty wilderness,\n And Lakshman brave and Sítá share\n The wanderings of the exile there.'\n \n \n Then Bharat's soul with fear was stirred\n Lest Ráma from the right had erred,\n And jealous for ancestral fame,\n He put this question to the dame:\n 'Has Ráma grasped with lawless hold\n A Bráhman's house, or land, or gold?\n Has Ráma harmed with ill intent\n Some poor or wealthy innocent?\n Was Ráma, faithless to his vows,\n Enamoured of anothers spouse?\n Why was he sent to Dandak's wild,\n Like one who kills an unborn child?'\n \n \n He questioned thus: and she began\n To tell her deeds and crafty plan.\n Deceitful-hearted, fond, and blind\n As is the way of womankind:\n 'No Bráhman's wealth has Ráma seized,\n No dame his wandering fancy pleased;\n His very eyes he ne'er allows\n To gaze upon a neighbour's spouse,\n But when I heard the monarch planned\n To give the realm to Ráma's hand,\n I prayed that Ráma hence might flee,\n And claimed the throne, my son, for thee.\n The king maintained the name he bare,\n And did according to my prayer.\n And Ráma, with his brother, sent,\n And Sítá, forth to banishment.\n When his dear son was seen no more,\n The lord of earth was troubled sore:\n Too feeble with his grief to strive,\n He joined the elemental Five.\n Up then, most dutiful! maintain\n The royal state, arise, and reign.\n For thee, my darling son, for thee\n All this was planned and wrought by me.\n Come, cast thy grief and pain aside,\n With manly courage fortified.\n This town and realm are all thine own,\n And fear and grief are here unknown.\n Come, with Vas'ishtha's guiding aid,\n     And priests in ritual skilled\n Let the king's funeral dues be paid,\n     And every claim fulfilled.\n Perform his obsequies with all\n     That suits his rank and worth,\n Then give the mandate to install\n     Thyself as lord of earth.'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXXIII.: Kaikeyí Reproached.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto LXXI.: Bharat's Return.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto LXXIII.: Kaikey&iacute; Reproached. »",
