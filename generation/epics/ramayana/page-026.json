Daksha was the son of Brahmá\n and one of the Prajápatis, Demiurgi, or\n secondary authors of creation.\n 36:1b  Youths of the Kshatriya class used\n to leave unshorn the side locks of their\n hair. These were called Káka-paksha,\n or raven's wings.\n 36:2b  The Rákshas  or giant Rávan, king ot\n Lanká.\n 36:3b  The meaning of As'vins (from as'va a\n horse, Persian asp, Greek ἵιππος, Latin\n equus, Welsh *eck, is Horsemen. They\n were twin deities of whom frequent mention\n is made in the Vedas and the Indian\n myths. The As'vins have much in common\n with the Dioscuri of Greece, and\n their mythical genealogy seems to indicate\n that their origin was astronomical. They\n were, perhaps, at first the morning star\n and evening star. They are said to be the\n children of the sun and the nymph As'viní,\n who is one of the lunar asterisms personified.\n In the popular mythology they are\n regarded as the physicians of the Gods.\n GORRESIO.\n 36:4b  The word Kumára, (a young prince, h\n Childe, is also a proper name of Skanda\n or Kártikeya God of War, the son of S'iva\n and Umá. The babe was matured in the\n fire.
