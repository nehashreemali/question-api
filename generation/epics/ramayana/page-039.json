Then Kes'inî\n The mother of one heir would be.\n Sumati, sister of the king  1\n Of all the birds that ply the wing,\n To that illustrious Bráhman sued\n That she might bear the multitude\n Whose fame throughout the world should sound\n For mighty enterprise renowned.\n Around the saint the monarch went,\n Bowing his head, most reverent.\n Then with his wives, with willing feet,\n Besought his own imperial seat.\n Time passed. The elder consort bare\n A son called Asamanj, the heir.\n Then Sumati, the younger, gave\n Birth to a gourd,  2 O hero brave,\n Whose rind, when burst and cleft in two,\n Gave sixty thousand babes to view.\n All these with care the nurses laid\n In jars of oil; and there they stayed,\n Till, youthful age and strength complete,\n Forth speeding from each dark retreat,\n All peers in valour, years, and might,\n The sixty thousand came to light.\n Prince Asamanj, brought up with care,\n Scourge of his foes, was made the heir.\n But liegemen's boys he used to cast\n To Sarjû's waves that hurried past,\n Laughing the while in cruel glee\n Their dying agonies to see.\n This wicked prince who aye withstood\n The counsel of the wise and good,\n Who plagued the people in his hate,\n His father banished from the state.\n His son, kind-spoken, brave, and tall,\n Was Ans'uman, beloved of all.\n     Long years flew by. The king decreed\n To slay a sacrificial steed.\n Consulting with his priestly band\n He vowed the rite his soul had planned,\n And, Veda skilled, by their advice\n Made ready for the sacrifice.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 49:1b  I am compelled to omit Cantos XXXVII\n and XXXVIII, THE GLORY OF UMÀ, and\n THE BIRTH OF KÁRTIKEYA, as both in\n subject and language offensive to modern\n taste.
