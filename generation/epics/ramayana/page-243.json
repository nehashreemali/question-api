Ah, grief, that still\n Eager to do my brother's will,\n Mourning thy woman's nature, I\n Must see thee doubt my truth and die.\n I fly to Ráma's side, and Oh,\n May bliss attend thee while I go!\n May all attendant wood-gods screen\n Thy head from harm, O large-eyed Queen\n And though dire omens meet my sight\n And fill my soul with wild affright,\n May I return in peace and see\n The son of Raghu safe with thee!'\n     The child of Janak heard him speak,\n And the hot tear-drops down her cheek,\n Increasing to a torrent, ran,\n Aa thus once more the dame began:\n 'O Lakshman, if I widowed be\n Godávan's** flood shall cover me,\n Or I will die by cord, or leap,\n Life weary, from yon rocky steep;\n \n \n Or deadly poison will I drink,\n Or 'neath the kindled flames will sink,\n But never, reft of Ráma, can\n Consent to touch a meaner man.'\n     The Maithil dame with many sighs,\n And torrents pouring from her eyes,\n The faithful Lakshman thus adressed,\n And smote her hands upon her breast.\n Sumitrá's son, o'erwhelmed by fears,\n     Looked on the large-eyed queen:\n         He saw that flood of burning tears,\n     He saw that piteous mien.\n         He yearned sweet comfort to afford,\n     He strove to soothe her pain\n         But to the brother of her lord\n   She spoke no word again.\n         His reverent hands once more he raised,\n     His head he slightly bent,\n         Upon her face he sadly gazed,\n     And then toward Ráma went.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto XLVI.: The Guest.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XLIV: Artcha's Death\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XLVI.: The Guest. »",
