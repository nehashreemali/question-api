Vishnu is\n the sun, the three steps being his rising,\n culmination, and setting.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXXII.: Vis'vámitra's Sacrifice.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto XXX.: The Mysterious Powers.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto XXXII.: Vis'v&aacute;mitra's Sacrifice. »",
