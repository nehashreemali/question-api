O my love!' he cries.'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 414:1b  Sítá of course knows nothing of what\n has happened to Ráma since the time\n when she was carried away by Rávan,\n The poet therefore thinks it necessary to\n repeat the whole story of the meeting\n between Ráma and Sugríva, the defeat of\n Báli, and subsequent events. I give the\n briefest possible outline of the story.\n 414:2b  DE GUBERNATIS thinks that this ring\n which the Sun Ráma sends to the Dawn\n Sítá is a symbol of the sun's disc.\n 415:1  S'achí is the loved and lovely wife of\n Indra, and she is taken as the type of a\n woman protected by a jealous and all-powerful husband.\n 415:2  The mountain near Kishkindhá.\n 415:3  Airávat is the mighty elephant on\n which Indra delights to ride.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXXVII.: Sítá's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto XXXV.: Hanuman's Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto XXXVII.: S&iacute;t&aacute;'s Speech. »",
