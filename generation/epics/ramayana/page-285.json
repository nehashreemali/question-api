Báli styled,\n Of Vánar tribes that roam the wild.\n Say why dost thou this gate molest,\n And bellowing thus disturb our rest?\n I know thee, mighty fiend: beware\n And guard thy life with wiser care.'\n He spoke: and thus the fiend returned,\n While red with rage his eyeballs burned:\n 'What! speak when all thy dames are nigh\n And hero-like thy foe defy?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Come, meet me in the fight this day,\n And learn my strength by bold assay.\n Or shall I spare tbee, and relent\n Until the coming night be spent?\n Take then the respite of a night\n And yield thee to each soft delight.\n Then, monarch of the Vánar race.\n With loving arms thy friends embrace.\n Gifts on thy faithful lords bestow,\n Bid each and all farewell, and go.\n Show in the streets once more thy face,\n Instal thy son to fill thy place.\n Dally a while with each dear dame;\n And then my strength thy pride shall tame\n For, should I smite thee drunk with wine\n Enamoured of those dames of thine,\n Beneath diseases bowed and bent,\n Or weak, unarmed, or negligent,\n My deed would merit hate and scorn\n As his who slays the child unborn.'\n Then Báli's soul with rage was tired,\n Queen Tárá and the dames retired;\n And slowly, with a laugh of pride,\n The king of Vánars thus replied:\n 'Me, fiend, thou deemest drunk with wine:\n Unless thy fear the fight decline,\n Come, meet me in the fray, and test\n The spirit of my valiant breast.'\n He spoke in wrath and high disdain;\n And, laying down his golden chain,\n Gift of his sire Mahendra, dared\n The demon, for the fray prepared;\n Seized by the horns the monster, vast\n As a huge hill, and held him fast,\n Then fiercely dragged him round and round,\n And, shouting, hurled him to the ground.\n Blood streaming from his ears, he rose,\n And wild with fury strove the foes.\n Then Báli, match for Indra's might,\n With every arm renewed the fight.\n He fought with fists, and feet, and knees,\n With fragments of the rock, and trees.\n At last the monster's strength, assailed\n By S'akra's  1b conquering offspring, failed.\n Him Bali raised with mighty strain.\n And dashed upon the ground again;\n Where, bruised and shattered, in a tide\n Of rushing blood, the demon died.\n King Báli saw the lifeless corse,\n And bending, with tremendous force\n Raised the huge bulk from where it lay,\n And hurled it full a league away.\n As through the air the body flew,\n Some blood-drops, caught by gales that blew,\n Welled from his shattered jaw and fell\n By Saint Matanga's hermit cell:\n Matanga saw, illustrious sage,\n Those drops defile his hermitage,\n \n \n \n \n p. 337\n \n \n And, as he marvelled whence they came,\n Fierce anger filled his soul with flame:\n 'Who is the villain, evil-souled,\n With childish thoughts unwise and bold,\n Who is the impious wretch,' he cried,\n 'By whom my grove with blood is dyed?'\n \n \n Thus spoke Matanga in his rage,\n And hastened from the hermitage,\n When lo, before his wondering eyes\n Lay the dead bull of mountain size\n His hermit soul was nothing slow\n The doer of the deed to know,\n And thus the Vánar in a burst\n Of wild tempestuous wrath he cursed:\n 'Ne'er let that Vánar wander here,\n For, if he come, his death is near.\n Whose impious hand with blood has dyed\n The holy place where I abide,\n Who threw this demon corse and made\n A ruin of the pleasant shade.\n If e'er he plant his wicked feet\n Within one league of my retreat;\n Yea, if the villain come so nigh\n That very hour he needs must die.\n And let the Vánar lords who dwell\n In the dark woods that skirt my cell\n Obey my words, and speeding hence\n Find them some meeter residence.\n Here if they dare to stay, on all\n The terrors of my curse shall fall.\n They spoil the tender saplings, dear\n As children which I cherish here,\n Mar root and branch and leaf and spray,\n And steal the ripening fruit away.\n One day I grant, no further hour,\n To-morrow shall my curse have power,\n And then each Vánar I may see\n A stone through countless years shall be.'\n The Vánars heard the curse and hied\n From sheltering wood and mountain side.\n King Báli marked their haste and dread,\n And to the flying leaders said:\n 'Speak, Vánar chiefs, and tell me why\n From Saint Matanga's grove ye fly\n To gather round me: is it well\n With all who in those woodlands dwell?'\n He spoke: the Vánar leaders told\n King Báli with his chain of gold\n What curse the saint had on them laid,\n Which drove them from their ancient shade.\n Then royal Báli sought the sage,\n With reverent hands to soothe his rage.\n The holy man his suppliant spurned,\n And to his cell in anger turned.\n That curse on Báli sorely pressed.\n And long his conscious soul distressed.\n Him still the curse and terror keep\n Afar from Rishyamúka's steep.\n He dares not to the grove draw nigh,\n Nay scarce will hither turn his eye.\n We know what terrors warm him hence,\n And roam these woods in confidence.\n Look, Prince, before thee white and dry\n The demon's bones uncovered lie,\n Who, like a hill in bulk and length,\n Fell ruind for his pride of strength.\n See those high Sál trees seven in row\n That droop their mighty branches low,\n These at one grasp would Báli seize,\n And leafless shake the trembling trees.\n These tales I tell, O Prince, to show\n The matchless power that arms the foe.\n How canst thou hope to slay him? how\n Meet Báli in the battle now?'\n \n \n Sugríva spoke and sadly sighed:\n And Lakshman with a laugh replied:\n 'What show of power, what proof and test\n May still the doubts that fill thy breast?'\n \n \n He spoke. Sugríva thus replied:\n 'See yonder Sál trees side by side.\n King Báli here would take his stand\n Grasping his bow with vigorous hand,\n And every arrow, keen and true.\n Would strike its tree and pierce it through\n If Ráma now his bow will bend,\n And through one trunk an arrow send;\n Or if his arm can raise and throw\n Two hundred measures of his bow,\n Grasped by a foot and hurled through air,\n The demon bull that moulders there,\n My heart will own his might and fain\n Believe my foe already slain.'\n \n \n Sugríva spoke inflamed with ire,\n Scanned Ráma with a glance of fire,\n Pondered a while in silent mood.\n And thus again his speech renewed:\n 'All lands with Báli's glories ring,\n A valiant, strong, and mighty king;\n In conscious power unused to yield;\n A hero first in every field.\n His wondrous deeds his might declare,\n Deeds Gods might scarcely do or dare;\n And on this power reflecting still\n I roam on Rishyamúka's hill.\n Awed by my brother's might I rove,\n In doubt and fear, from grove to grove,\n While Hanumán, my chosen friend,\n And faithful lords my steps attend;\n And now, O true to friendship's tie,\n I hail in thee my best ally.\n My surest refuge from my foes,\n And steadfast as the Lord of Snows.\n Still, when I muse how strong and bold\n Is cruel Báli, evil-souled,\n But ne'er, O chief of Raghu's line,\n Have seen what strength in war is thine,\n Though in my heart I may not dare\n Doubt thy great might, despise, compare,\n Thoughts of his fearful deeds will rise\n And fill my soul with sad surmise.\n Speech, form, and trust which naught may move\n \n \n p. 338\n \n \n Thy secret strength and glory prove,\n As smouldering ashes dimly show\n The dormant fires that live below.'\n     He ceased: and Ráma answered, while\n Played o'er his lips a gracious smile:\n 'Not yet convinced? This clear assay\n Shall drive each lingering doubt away.'\n Thus Ráma spoke his heart to cheer,\n To Dundubhi's vast frame drew near:\n He touched it with his foot in play\n And sent it twenty leagues away.\n Sugríva marked what easy force\n Hurled through the air that demon's corse\n Whose mighty bones were white and dried,\n And to the son of Raghu cried:\n 'My brother Báli, when his might\n Was drunk and weary from the fight,\n Hurled forth the monster body, fresh\n With skin and sinews, blood and flesh.\n Now flesh and blood are dried away.\n The crumbling bones are light as hay,\n Which thou, O Raghu's son, hast sent\n Flying through air in merriment.\n This test alone is weak to show\n If thou be stronger or the foe.\n By thee a heap of mouldering bone,\n By him the recent corse was thrown.\n Thy strength, O Prince, is yet untried:\n Come, pierce one tree: let this decide.\n Prepare thy ponderous bow and bring\n Close to thine ear the straining string.\n On yonder Sál tree fix thine eye,\n And let the mighty arrow fly,\n I doubt not, chief, that I shall see\n Thy pointed shaft transfix the tree.\n Then come, assay the easy task,\n And do for love the thing I ask.\n     Best of all lights, the Day-God fills\n         With glory earth and sky:\n     Himálaya is the lord of hills\n         That heave their heads on high.\n     The royal lion is the best\n         Of beasts that tread the earth;\n     And thou, O hero, art confessed\n         First in heroic worth.'\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 335:1  Righteous because he never transgresses\n his bounds, and\n \n       \"over his great tides\n       Fidelity presides.\"\n \n \n 335:2  Himálaya, the Lord of Snow, is the\n father of Umá the wife of S'iva or S'ankar.\n 335:3  Indra's celestial elephant.\n 336:1  Báli was the son of Indra.
