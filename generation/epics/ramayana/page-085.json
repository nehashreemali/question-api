for thou, unhappy dame,\n Deluded by a husband's name,\n With more than mother's love hast pressed\n A serpent to thy heedless breast,\n And cherished him who works thee woe,\n No husband but a deadly foe.\n For like a snake, unconscious Queen,\n Or enemy who stabs unseen,\n King Das'aratha all untrue\n Has dealt with thee and Bharat too.\n Ah, simple lady, long beguiled\n By his soft words who falsely smiled!\n Poor victim of the guileless breast,\n A happier fate thou meritest.\n For thee and thine destruction waits\n When he Prince Ráma consecrates.\n Up, lady, while there yet is time;\n Preserve thyself, prevent the crime.\n Up, from thy careless ease, and free\n Thyself, O Queen, thy son, and me!'\n \n \n Delighted at the words she said,\n Kaikeyí lifted from the bed,\n Like autumn's moon, her radiant head,\n And joyous at the tidings gave\n A jewel to the hump-back slave;\n And as she gave the precious toy\n She cried in her exceeding joy:\n 'Take this, dear maiden, for thy news\n Most grateful to mine ear, and choose\n What grace beside most fitly may\n The welcome messenger repay.\n I joy that Ráma gains the throne:\n Kaus'alyá's son is as mine own.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto VIII: Manthará's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto VI.: The City Decorated.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto VIII: Manthar&aacute;'s Speech. »",
