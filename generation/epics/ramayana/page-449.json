say,\n Thus glorious in thy bright array.'\n He ceased: the king of birds replied,\n While flashed his eye with joy and pride:\n 'In me, O Raghu's son, behold\n One who has loved thee from of old:\n Garud, the lord of all that fly,\n Thy guardian and thy friend am I.\n Not all the Gods in heaven could loose\n These numbing bonds, this serpent noose,\n Wherewith fierce Rávan's son, renowned\n For magic arts, your limbs had bound.\n Those arrows fixed in every limb\n Were mighty snakes, transformed by him.\n Blood thirsty race, they live beneath\n The earth, and slay with venomed teeth.\n On, smite the lord of Lanká's isle,\n But guard you from the giants' guile\n Who each dishonest art employ\n And by deceit brave foes destroy.\n So shall the tyrant Rávan bleed,\n And Sítá from his power be freed.'\n Thus Garud spake: then, swift as thought,\n The region of the sky he sought,\n Where in the distance like a blaze\n Of fire he vanished from the gaze.\n     Then the glad Vánars joy rang out\n In many a wild tumultuous shout,\n And the loud roar of drum and shell\n Startled each distant sentinel.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 464:1  The preceptor of the Gods.\n 465:1  Ráma's grandfather.\n \n \n Next: Canto LI.: Dhúmráksha's Sally.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto XLIX.: R&aacute;ma's Lament\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto LI.: Dh&uacute;mr&aacute;ksha's Sally. »",
