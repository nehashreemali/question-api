This direction is aparájitá,\n i. e. unconquerable. Thence one should do\n work in this direction, and have it done\n there; for such a one '(alone) is able to\n clear off his debts.' HAUG'S Aitareyaya Bráhmanam,\n Vol. II, p. 33.\n \n \n The debts here spoken of are a man's religious\n obligations to the Gods, the Pitaras\n or Manes, and men.\n 52:2b  Vishnu.\n 52:3b  'It appears to me that this mythical\n story has reference to the volcanic phenomena\n of nature. Kapil may very possibly\n be that hidden fiery force which suddenly\n unprisons itself and bursts forth\n in volcanic effects. Kapil is, moreover,\n one of the names of Agni the God of\n Fire.' GORRESIO.\n 53:1  Garud was the son of Kas'yap and\n Vinatá.\n \n \n Next: Canto XLIII.: Bhagirath.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto XLI.: Kapil.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto XLIII.: Bhagirath. »",
