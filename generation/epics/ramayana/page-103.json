Bhaga, Aryaman. 3\n Fortnights and seasons, nights and days,\n Years, months, and hours, protect thy ways,\n Vrihaspati shall still be nigh,\n The War-God, and the Moon on high,\n And N?ad 4 and the sainted seven 5\n Shall watch thee from their starry heaven.\n The mountains, and the seas which ring\n The world, and Varuna the King,\n Sky, ether, and the wind, whate'er\n Moves not or moves, for thee shall care.\n Each lunar mansion be benign,\n With happier light the planets shine;\n All gods, each light in heaven that glows,\n Potect my child where'er he goes.\n The twilight hours, the day and night,\n Keep in the wood thy steps aright.\n Watch, minute, instant, as they flee,\n Shall all bring happiness to thee.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Celestials and the Titan brood\n Protect thee in thy solitude,\n And haunt the mighty wood to bless\n The wanderer in his hermit dress.\n Fear not, by mightier guardians screened,\n The giant or night-roving fiend;\n Nor let the cruel race who tear\n Man's flesh for food thy bosom scare.\n Far be the ape, the scorpion's sting,\n Fly, gnat, and worm, and creeping thing.\n Thee shall the hungry lion spare,\n The tiger, elephant, and bear:\n Safe, from their furious might repose,\n Safe from the horned buffaloes.\n Each savage thing the forests breed,\n That love on human flesh to feed,\n Shall for my child its rage abate,\n When thus its wrath I deprecate.\n Blest be thy ways: may sweet success\n The valour of my darling bless.\n To all that Fortune can bestow,\n Go forth, my child, my Ráma, go.\n Go forth, O happy in the love\n Of all the Gods below, above;\n And in those guardian powers confide\n Thv paths who keep, thy steps who guide.\n May S'ukra, 1b Yama, Sun, and Moon,\n And He who gives each golden boon, 2b\n Won by mine earnest pravers, be good\n To thee, my son, in Dandak wood.\n Fire, wind, and smoke, each text and spell\n From mouths of holy seers that fell,\n Guard Ráma when his limbs he dips,\n Or with the stream makes pure his lips!\n May the great saints and He, the Lord\n Who made the worlds, by worlds adored,\n And every God in heaven beside\n My banished Ráma keep and guide.\n \n \n Thus with due praise the long-eyed dame,\n Ennobled by her spotless fame,\n With wreaths of flowers and precious scent\n Worshipped the Gods, most reverent.\n A high-souled Br?man lit the fire,\n And offered, at the queen's desire,\n The holy oil ordained to burn\n For Ráma's weal and safe return.\n Kaus'aly? best of dames, with care\n Set oil, wreaths, fuel, mustard, there.\n Then when the rites of fire had ceased,\n For Ráma's bliss and health, the priest,\n Standing without gave what remained\n In general offering, 3b as ordained.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 125\n \n \n Dealing among the twice-horn train\n Honey, and curds, and oil, and grain,\n He bade each heart and voice unite\n To bless. the youthful anchorite.\n Then Ráma's mother, glorious dame\n Bestowed, to meet the Bráhman's claim,\n A lordly fee for duty done:\n And thus again addressed her son:\n \n \n 'Such blessings as the Gods o'erjoyed\n Poured forth, when Vritra  1 was destroyed,\n On Indra of the thousand eyes,\n Attend, my child, thine enterprise!\n Yea, such as Vinatá once gave\n To King Suparna  2 swift and brave,\n Who sought the drink that cheers the skies,\n Attend, my child, thine enterprise!\n Yea, such as, when the Amrit rose,  3\n And Indra slew his Daitya foes,\n The royal Aditi bestowed\n On Him whose hand with slaughter glowed\n Of that dire brood of monstrous size,\n Attend, my child, thine enterprise!\n E'en such as peerless Vishnu graced,\n When with his triple step he paced,\n Outbursting from the dwarf's disguise,  4\n Attend, my child, thine enterprise!\n Floods, isles, and seasons as they fly,\n Worlds, Vedas, quarters of the sky,\n Combine, O mighty-armed, to bless\n Thee destined heir of happiness!'\n \n \n The long-eyed lady ceased: she shed\n Pure scent and grain upon his head.\n And that prized herb whose sovereign power\n Preserves from dark misfortune's hour,\n Upon the hero's arm she set,\n To be his faithful amulet.\n While holy tunes she murmured low,\n Aud spoke glad words though crushed by woe,\n Concealing with obedient tongue\n The pangs with which her heart was wrung.\n She bent,she kissed his brow, she pressed\n Her darling to her troubled breast:\n 'Firm in thy purpose, go,' she cried,\n 'Go Ráma, and my bliss betide.\n Attain returning safe and well,\n Triumphant in Ayodhyá, dwell.\n Then shall my happy eyes behold\n The empire by thy will controlled.\n Then grief and care shall leave no trace,\n Joy shall light up thy mother's face,\n And I shall see my darling reign,\n In moonlike glory come again.\n These eyes shall fondly gaze on thee\n So faithful to thy sire's decree,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When thou the forest wild shalt quit\n On thine ancestral throne to sit.\n Yea, thou shalt turn from exile back,\n Nor choicest blessings ever lack,\n Then fill with rapture ever new\n My bosom and thy consort's too.\n     To S'iva and the heavenly host\n         My worship has been paid,\n     To mighty saint, to godlike ghost,\n         To every wandering shade.\n     Forth to the forest thou wilt hie,\n         Therein to dwell so long:\n     Let all the quarters of the sky\n         Protect my child from wrong.'\n     Her blessings thus the queen bestowed;\n         Then round him fondly paced,\n     And often, while her eyes o'erflowed,\n         Her dearest son embraced.\n     Kaus'alyá's honoured feet he pressed,\n         As round her steps she bent,\n     And radiant with her prayers that blessed,\n         To Sitá's home he went.\n \n \n             *      *      *      *      *\n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 124:1  See p. 41.\n 124:2  The first progeny of Brahm?
