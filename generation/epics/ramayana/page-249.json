well done!\n But weak with length of days, at last\n The vulture's strength was failing fast.\n The fiend again assayed to bear\n The lady through the fields of air.\n But when the vulture saw him rise\n Triumphant with his trembling prize,\n Bearing the sword that still was left\n When other arms were lost or cleft,\n Once more, impatient of repose,\n Swift from the earth her champion rose,\n Hung in the way the fiend would take,\n And thus addressing Rávan spake:\n 'Thou, King of giants, rash and blind,\n Wilt be the ruin of thy kind,\n Stealing the wife of Ráma, him\n With lightning sears on chest and limb.\n A mighty host obeys his will\n And troops of slaves his palace fill;\n \n \n p. 290\n \n \n His lords of state are wise and true,\n Kinsmen has he and retinue.\n As thirsty travellers drain the cup,\n Thou drinkest deadly poison up.\n The rash and careless fool who heeds\n No coming fruit of guilty deeds,\n A few short years of life shall see,\n And perish doomed to death like thee.\n Say whither wilt thou fly to loose\n Thy neck from Death's entangling noose.\n Caught like the fish that finds too late\n The hook beneath the treacherous bait?\n Never, O King--of this be sure--\n Will Raghu's fiery sons endure,\n Terrific in their vengeful rage,\n This insult to their hermitage.\n Thy guilty hands this day have done\n A deed which all reprove and shun,\n Unworthly of a noble chief,\n The pillage loved by coward thief.\n Stay, if thy heart allow thee, stay\n And meet me in the deadly fray.\n Soon shall thou stain the earth with gore,\n And fall as Khara fell before.\n The fruits of former deeds o'erpower\n The sinner in his dying hour:\n And such a fate on thee, O King,\n Thy tyranny and madness bring.\n Not e'en the Self-existent Lord,\n Who reigns by all the worlds adored,\n Would dare attempt a guilty deed\n Which the dire fruits of crime succeed.'\n     Thus brave Jatayus, best of birds,\n Addressed the fiend with moving words,\n Then ready for the swift attack\n Swooped down upon the giant's back.\n Down to the bone the talons went\n With many a wound the flesh was rent:\n Such blows infuriate drivers deal\n Their elephants with pointed steel.\n Fixed in his back the strong beak lay,\n The talons stripped the flesh away.\n He fought with claws and beak and wing.\n And tore the long hair of the king.\n Still as the royal vulture beat\n The giant with his wings and feet,\n Swelled the fiend's lips, his body shook\n With furious rage too great to brook.\n About the Maithil dame he cast\n One huge left aim and held her fast.\n In furious rage to frenzy fanned\n He struck the vulture with his hand.\n Jatáyus mocked the vain assay,\n And rent his ten left arms away.\n Down dropped the severed limbs: anew\n Ten others from his body grew:\n Thus bright with pearly radiance glide\n Dread serpents from the hillock side,\n Again in wrath the giant pressed\n The lady closer to his breast,\n And foot and fist sent blow on blow\n In ceaseless fury at the foe.\n So fierce and dire the battle, waged\n Between those mighty champions, raged;\n Here was the lord of giants, there\n The noblest of the birds of air.\n Thus, as his love of Ráma taught,\n The faithful vulture strove and fought.\n But Rávan seized his sword and smote\n His wings and side and feet and throat.\n At mangled side and wing he bled;\n He fell, and life was almost fled.\n The lady saw her champion lie,\n His plumes distained with gory dye,\n And hastened to the vulture's side\n Grieving as though a kinsman died.\n The lord of Lanká's island viewed\n         The vulture as he lay:\n     Whose back like some dark cloud was hued,\n         His breast a paly grey,\n     Like ashes, when by none renewed.\n         The flame has died away.\n     The lady saw with mournful eye,\n         Her champion press the plain,--\n     The royal bird, her true ally\n         Whom Rávan's might had slain.\n     Her soft arms locked in strict embrace\n         Around his neck she kept.\n     And lovely with her moon-bright face\n         Bent o'er her friend and wept,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LII.: Rávan's Flight.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto L.: Jat&aacute;yus.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto LII.: R&aacute;van's Flight. »",
