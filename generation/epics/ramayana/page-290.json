The poet plays\n upon the name by comparing her beauty\n to that of the Lord of stars, the Moon.\n \n \n Next: Canto XVII.: Báli's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto XV.: Tar&aacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto XVII.: B&aacute;li's Speech. »",
