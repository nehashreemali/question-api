A sire have we,\n No women uncontrolled and free.\n Go, and our sire's consent obtain\n If thou our maiden hands wouldst gain.\n No self-dependent life we live:\n If we offend, our fault forgive.'\n 'But led by folly as a slave,\n He would not hear the rede we gave,\n And even as we gently spoke\n We felt the Wind-God's crushing stroke.'\n \n \n The pious king, with grief distressed,\n The noble hundred thus addressed:\n 'With patience, daughters, bear your fate,\n Yours was a deed supremely great\n When with one mind you kept from shame\n The honour of your father's name.\n Patience, when men their anger vent,\n Is woman's praise and ornament;\n Yet when the Gods inflict the blow\n Hard is it to support the woe.\n Patience, my girls, exceeds all price:\n 'Tis alms, and truth, and sacrifice.\n Patience is virtue, patience fame:\n Patience upholds this earthly frame.\n And now, I think, is come the time\n To wed you in jour maiden prime.\n Now, daughters, go where'er you will:\n Thoughts for your good my mind shall fill.'\n \n \n The maidens went, consoled, away:\n The best of kings, that very day,\n Summoned his ministers of state\n About their marriage to debate.\n Since then, because the Wind-God bent\n The damsels' forms for punishment,\n That royal town is known to fame\n By Kanyákubja's  1 borrowed name.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n There lived a sage called Chúli then,\n Devoutest of the sons of men;\n His days in penance rites he spent,\n A glorious saint, most continent.\n To him absorbed in tasks austere\n The child of Urmilá drew near,\n Sweet Somadá, the heavenly maid,\n And lent the saint her pious aid.\n Long time near him the maiden spent,\n And served him meek and reverent,\n Till the great hermit, pleased with her,\n Thus spoke unto his minister:\n 'Grateful am I for all thy care:\n Blest maiden, speak, thy wish declare.'\n The sweet-voiced nymph rejoiced to see\n The favour of the devotee,\n And to that eloquent old man,\n Most eloquent she thus began:\n 'Thou hast, by heavenly grace sustained,\n Close union with the Godhead gained.\n I long, O Saint, to see a son\n By force of holy penance won.\n Unwed, a maiden life I live:\n A son to me, thy suppliant, give.'\n The saint with favour heard her prayer,\n And gave a son exceeding fair.\n Him, Chúli's spiritual child,\n His mother Brahmadatta  1b styled.\n King Brahmadatta, rich and great,\n In Kámpilí maintained his state,\n Ruling, like Indra in his bliss,\n His fortunate metropolis.\n King Kus'anábha planned that he\n His hundred daughters' lord should be.\n To him, obedient to his call,\n The happy monarch gave them all.\n Like Indra then he took the hand\n Of every maiden of the band.\n Soon as the hand of each young maid\n In Brahmadatta's palm was laid,\n Deformity and cares away,\n She shone in beauty bright and gay.\n Their freedom from the Wind-God's might\n Saw Kus'anábha with delight.\n Each glance that on their forms he threw\n Filled him with raptures ever new.\n Then when the rites were all complete,\n Witli highest marks of honour meet\n The bridegroom with his brides he sent\n To his great seat of government.\n \n \n The nymph received with pleasant speech\n Her daughters; and, embracing each,\n Upon their forms she fondly gazed,\n And royal Kus'anábha praised.\n \n \n \n \n \n p. 48\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 46:1  The modern Berar.\n 46:2  According to the Bengal recension the\n first (Kus'ámba) is called Kus'ás'va, and his\n city Kaus'ás'ví.
