Ah, that I\n By Lakshman's side might sink and die\n Life, war and conquest, all are vain\n If Lakshman lies in battle slain.\n Why will those eyes my glances shun?\n Hast thou no word of answer, none?\n Ah, as thy noble spirit flown\n And gone to other worlds alone?\n Could thou not let thy brother seek\n Those worlds with thee? O speak, O speak!\n Rise up once more, my brother, rise,\n Look on me with thy loving eyes.\n Were not thy steps beside me still\n \n \n In gloomy wood, on breezy hill?\n Did not thy gentle care assuage\n Thy brother's grief and fitful rage?\n Didst thou not all his troubles share,\n His guide and comfort in despair?'\n \n \n As Ráma, vanquished, wept and sighed\n The Vánar chieftain thus replied:\n 'Great Prince, unmanly thoughts dismiss,\n Nor yield thy soul to grief like this,\n In vain those burning tears are shed:\n Our glory Lakshman is not dead.\n Death on his brow no mark has set,\n Where beauty's lustre lingers yet.\n Clear is the skin, and tender hues\n Of lotus flowers his palms suifuse.\n O Ráma, cheer thy trembling heart;\n Not thus do life and body part,\n Now, Hanumán, to thee I speak:\n Hie hence to tall Mahodaya's  1 peak\n Where herbs of sovereign virtue grow\n Which life and health and strength bestow\n Bring thou the leaves to balm his pain,\n And Lakshman shall be well again.'\n \n \n He ceased: the Wind-God's son obeyed\n Swift through the clouds his way he made.\n He reached the hill, nor stayed to find\n The wondrous herbs of healing kind,\n From its broad base the mount he tore\n With all the shrubs and trees it bore,\n Sped through the clouds again and showed\n To wise Sushen his woodv load.  2\n Sushen in wonder viewed the hill,\n And culled the sovereign salve of ill.\n Soon as the healing herb he found,\n The fragrant leaves he crushed and ground.\n Then over Lakshman's face he bent,\n Who, healed and strengthened by the scent\n Of that blest herb divinely sweet,\n Rose fresh and lusty on his feet.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto CIII.: Indra's Car.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto CI.: Lakshman's Fall.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto CIII.: Indra's Car. »",
