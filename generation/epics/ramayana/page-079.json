companion chose\n S'atrughna slayer of his foes.  1\n There Bharat for a time remained\n With love and honour entertained,\n King As'vapati's constant care,\n Belovèd as a son and heir.\n Yet ever, as they lived at ease,\n While all around combined to please\n The agèd sire they left behind\n Was present to each hero's mind.\n Nor could the king's fond memory stray\n From his brave children far away,\n Dear Bharat and S'atrughna dear,\n Each Varun's match or Indra's peer.\n     To all the princes, young and brave,\n His soul with fond affection clave;\n Around his loving heart they clung\n Like arms from his own body sprung. 2\n But best and noblest of the four,\n Good as the God whom all adore,\n Lord of all virtues, undefiled,\n His darling was his eldest child.\n For he was beautiful and strong,\n From envy free, the foe of wrong,\n With all his father's virtues blest,\n And peerless in the world confessed.\n With placid soul he softly spoke:\n No harsh reply could taunts provoke.\n He ever loved the good and sage\n Revered for virtue and for age,\n And when his martial tasks were o'er\n Sate listening to their peaceful lore.\n Wise, modest, pure, he honoured eld,\n His lips from lying tales withheld;\n Due reference to the Bráhnmans gave,\n And ruled each passion like a slave.\n Most tender, prompt at duty's call,\n Loved by all men he loved them all.\n Proud of the duties of his race,\n With spirit meet for Warrior's  place,\n He strove to win by glorious deed,\n Throned with the Gods, a priceless meed.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n With him in speech and quick reply\n Vrihaspati might hardly vie,\n But never would his accents flow\n For evil or for empty show.\n In art and science duly trained,\n His student vow he well maintained;\n He learnt the lore for princes fit,\n The Vedas and their Holy Writ,\n And with his well-drawn bow at last\n His mighty father's fame surpassed.\n Of birth exalted, truthful, just,\n With vigorous hand, with noble trust,\n Well taught by aged twice-born men\n Who gain and right could clearly ken,\n Full well the claims and bounds he knew\n Of duty, gain, and pleasure too:\n Of memory keen, of ready tact,\n In civil business prompt to act.\n Reserved, his features ne'er disclosed\n What counsel in his heart reposed.\n All idle rage and mirth controlled,\n He knew the times to give and hold,\n Firm in his faith, of steadfast will,\n He sought no wrong, he spoke no ill:\n Not rashly swift, not idly slow,\n His faults and others' keen to know.\n Each merit, by his subtle sense,\n He matched with proper recompense.\n He knew the means that wealth provide,\n And with keen eye expense could guide.\n Wild elephants could he reclaim,\n And mettled steeds could mount and tame.\n No arm like his the bow could wield,\n Or drive the chariot to the field.\n Skilled to attack, to deal the blow,\n Or lead a host against the foe:\n Yea, e'en infuriate Gods would fear\n To meet his arm in full career.\n As the great sun in noontide blaze\n Is glorious with his world of rays.\n So Ráma with these virtues shone\n Which all men loved to gaze upon.\n \n \n The agèd monarch fain would rest,\n And said within his weary breast,\n 'Oh that I might, while living yet,\n My Ráma o'er the kingdom set.\n And see, before my course be run,\n The hallowed drops anoint my son;\n See all this spacious land obey,\n From side to side, my first-born's sway,\n And then, my life and joy complete,\n Obtain in heaven a blissful seat!'\n In him the monarch saw combined\n The fairest form, the noblest mind,\n And counselled how his son might share,\n The throne with him as Regent Heir.\n For fearful signs in earth and sky,\n And weakness warned him death was nigh:\n But Ráma to the world endeared\n By every grace his bosom cheered,\n \n \n p. 90\n \n \n The moon of every eye, whose ray\n Drove all his grief and fear away.\n So duty urged that hour to seize,\n Himself, his realm, to bless and please.\n \n \n From town and country, far and near,\n He summoned people, prince, and peer.\n To each he gave a meet abode,\n And honoured all and gifts bestowed.\n Then, splendid in his king's attire,\n He viewed them, as the general Sire,\n In glory of a God arrayed,\n Looks on the creatures he has made.\n But Kekaya's king he called not then\n For haste, nor Janak, lord of men;\n For after to each royal friend\n The joyful tidings he would send.\n Mid crowds from distant countries met\n The king upon his throne was set;\n Then honoured by the people, all\n The rulers thronged into the hall.\n On thrones assigned, each king in place\n Looked silent on the monarch's face.\n     Then girt by lords of high renown\n     And throngs from hamlet and from town\n         He showed in regal pride,\n As, honoured by the radiant band\n Of blessed Gods that round him stand,\n Lord Indra, Thousand-eyed.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 89:1  S'atrughna means slayer of foes, and the\n word is repeated as an intensive epithet.\n 89:2   Alluding to the images of Vishnu,\n which have four arms, the four princes\n being portions of the substance of that God.\n \n \n Next: Canto II.: The People's Speech.\n
