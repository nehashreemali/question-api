The commentator\n in the Bombay edition explains the word\n S'ákhántaram as Yájanádiná rakshántaram,\n 'one who by sacrificing for thee, etc.,\n will be another protector.' Gorresio's\n Gauda*? text, which may often be used as a\n commentary on the older one, has the\n following paraphrase of the words in\n question, ch. 60, 3. Múlam utsrijya*? kasmát\n tvam s'ákásv ichhasi lambitum*?. 'Why,\n forsaking the root, dost thou desire to\n hang upon the branches?'\"  MUIR, Sanskrit\n Texts, Vol. I., p. 401.\n 69:2b A Chandála was a man born of the\n illegal and impure union of a S'údra with\n a woman of one of the three higher castes.\n 70:1  The Chandála was regarded as the vilest\n and most abject of the men sprung from\n wedlock forbidden by the law (Mánavadharmas'ástra,\n Lib. X. 12.); a kind of social\n malediction weighed upon his head\n and rejected him from human society.'\n GORRESIO.\n \n \n Next: Canto LIX.: The Sons of Vas'ishtha.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto LVII.: Tris'anku.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto LIX.: The Sons of Vas'ishtha. »",
