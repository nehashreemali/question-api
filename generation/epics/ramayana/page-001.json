It is self-apparent\n that they are not by the author\n of the Rámáyan himself.\n 1:2  'Válmíki was the son of Varuna, the\n regent of the waters, one of whose names\n is Prachetas. According to the Adhyátmá\n Rámáyana, the sage, although a Bráhman\n by birth, associated with foresters and\n robbers. Attacking on one occasion the\n seven Rishis, they expostulated with him\n successfully, and taught him the mantra\n of Ráma reversed, or Mará, Mará, in the\n inaudible repetition of which he remained\n immovable for thousands of years, so that\n when the sages returned to the same spot\n they found him still there, converted into\n a valmik or ant-hill, by the nests of the\n termites, whence his name of Válmíki.'\n \n \n WILSON. Specimens of the Hindu\n Theatre, Vol. I. p. 313.\n \n \n 'Válmíki is said to have lived a solitary\n life in the woods: he is called both a muni\n and a rishi. The former word properly\n signifies an anchorite or hermit; the latter\n has reference chiefly to wisdom. The two\n words are frequently used promiscuously,\n and may both be rendered by the Latin\n cates in its earliest meaning of seer:\n Válmíki was both poet and seer, as he is\n said to have sung the exploits of Ráma by\n the aid of divining insight rather than of\n knowledge naturally acquired.' SCHLEGEL.\n 1:3  Literally, Kokila, the Koil, or Indian\n Cuckoo. Schlegel translates 'luscinium.'\n \n \n Next: Book I\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Title Page: Title Page\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Book I »",
