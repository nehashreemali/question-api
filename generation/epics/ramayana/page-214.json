his brilliant eye\n With the broad lotus leaf may vie.\n By fortune stamped for happy fate,\n His graceful form is tall aud straight.\n In duty skilled, his words are truth:\n He proudly rules each lust of youth.\n Though his strong arm smites down the foe,\n In gentle speech his accents flow.\n Yet every joy has he resigned\n And cleaves to thee with heart and mind.\n Thus by the deeds that he has done\n A name in heaven has Bharat won,\n For in his life he follows yet\n Thy steps, O banished anchoret.\n Thus faithful Bharat, nobly wise,\n The proverb of the world belies:\n 'No men, by mothers' guidance led,\n The footsteps of their fathers tread.'\n How could Kaikeyí, blest to be\n Spouse of the king our sire, and see\n A son like virtuous Bharat, blot\n Her glory with so foul a plot!'\n     Thus in fraternal love he spoke,\n And from his lips reproaches broke:\n But Ráma grieved to hear him chide\n The absent mother, and replied:\n     'Cease, O beloved, cease to blame\n Our royal father's second dame.\n Still speak of Bharat first in place\n Of old Ikshváku's princely race.\n My heart, so firmly bent but now\n To dwell in woods and keep my vow,\n Half melting as I hear thee speak\n Of Bharat's love, grows soft and weak,\n With tender joy I bring to mind\n His speeches ever sweet and kind.\n That dear as Amrit took the sense\n With most enchanting influence.\n Ah, when shall I, no more to part,\n Meet Bharat of the mighty heart?\n When, O my brother, when shall we\n The good and brave S'atrughna see?'\n Thus as he poured his fond lament\n The son of Raghu onward went:\n They reached the river, and the three\n Bathed them in fair Godávarí.\n Libations of the stream they paid\n To every deity and shade,\n With hymns of praise, the Sun on high\n And sinless Gods to glorify.\n Fresh from the purifying tide\n     Resplendent Ráma came,\n With Lakshman ever by his side,\n     And the sweet Maithil dame.\n So Rudra shines by worlds adored,\n     In glory undefiled,\n When Nandi  1 stands beside his lord,\n And King Himálaya's child.  2\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 248:1  The south is supposed to be the residence\n of the departed.\n 248:2  The sun.\n 248:3  The night is divided into three watches\n of four hours each.\n \n \n Next: Canto XVII.: S'u'panakha'\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto XV.: Panchavatt.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto XVII.: S'u'panakha' »",
