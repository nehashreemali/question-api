Sítá\n tells Hanumán again to convey her message\n to Ráma and bid him hasten to rescue\n her. Hanumán replies as before that\n there is no one on earth equal to Ráma,\n who will soon come and destroy Rávan.\n There is not a new idea in the two Cantos:\n all is reiteration.\n 417:2  The expedients to vanquish an enemy\n or to make him come to terms are said to\n be four: conciliation, gifts, disunion, and\n force or punishment. Hanumán considers\n it useless to employ the first three and\n resolves to punish Rávan by destroying\n his pleasure-grounds.\n \n \n Next: Canto XLII.: The Giants Roused.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto XXXVIII.: Sit&aacute;'s Gem.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto XLII.: The Giants Roused. »",
