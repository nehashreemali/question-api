I must endure\n The mighty grief that mocks at cure.'\n     Thus, all his thoughts on Síta bent,\n To Janasthán the chieftain went,\n Hastening on with eager stride,\n And Lakshman hurried by his side.\n With toil and thirst and hunger worn,\n His breast with doubt and anguish torn,\n     He sought the well-known spot.\n Again, again he turned to chide\n With quivering lips which terror dried:\n     He looked, and found her not.\n Within his leafy home he sped,\n Each pleasant spot he visited\n     Where oft his darling strayed.\n 'Tis as I feared', he cried, and there,\n Yielding to pangs too great to bear,\n     He sank by grief dismayed.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LX.: Lakshman Reproved.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto LVIII.: The Brothers' Meeting.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto LX.: Lakshman Reproved. »",
