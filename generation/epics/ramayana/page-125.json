How can we say\n We followed Ráma on his way.\n The mighty chief whose arm is strong,\n Who sweetly speaks, who thinks no wrong?\n Ayodhyá's town with sorrow dumb,\n Without our lord will see us come,\n And hopeless misery will strike\n Elder, and child, and dame alike.\n Forth with that peerless chief we came,\n Whose mighty heart is aye the same:\n How, reft of him we love, shall we\n Retuming dare that town to see?'\n     Complaining thus with varied cry\n They tossed their aged arms on high.\n And their sad hearts with grief were wrung.\n Like cows who sorrow for their young.\n A while they followed on the road\n Which traces of his chariot showed,\n But when at length those traces failed,\n A deep despair their hearts assailed.\n \n \n \n \n \n p. 150\n \n \n The chariot marks no more discerned,\n The hopeless sages backward turned:\n 'Ah, what is this? What can we more?\n Fate stops the way, and all is o'er.'\n With wearied hearts, in grief and shame\n They took the road by which they came,\n And reached Ayodhyá's city, where\n From side to side was naught but care.\n With troubled spirits quite cast down\n They looked upon the royal town,\n And from their eyes, oppressed with woe,\n Their tears again began to flow.\n Of Ráma reft, the city wore\n No look of beauty as before,\n Like a dull river or a lake\n By Garud robbed of every snake.\n Dark, dismal as the moonless sky,\n Or as a sea whose bed is dry,\n So sad, to every pleasure dead,\n They saw the town, disquieted.\n On to their houses, high and vast,\n Where stores of precious wealth were massed,\n The melancholy Bráhmans passed,\n     Their hearts with anguish cleft:\n Aloof from all, they came not near\n To stranger or to kinsman dear,\n Showing in faces blank and drear\n     That not one joy was left.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 149:1  The great pilgrimage to the Himalayas,\n in order to die there.\n \n \n Next: Canto XLVIII.: The Women's Lament.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XLVI.: The Halt.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XLVIII.: The Women's Lament. »",
