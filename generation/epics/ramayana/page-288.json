Sugríva raised a cry\n That shook and rent the echoing sky,\n A shout so fierce and loud and dread\n That stately bulls in terror fled,\n Like dames who fly from threatened stain\n In some ignoble monarch's reign.\n The deer in wild confusion ran\n Like horses turned in battle's van.\n Down fell the birds, like Gods who fall\n When merits fail, 1, at that dread call.\n So fiercely, boldened for the fray,\n The offspring of the Lord of Day\n Sent forth his furious shout as loud\n As thunder from a labouring cloud,\n Or, where the gale blows fresh and free,\n The roaring of the troubled sea.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 340:1  Called respectively Gárhapatra, Áhavaniya,\n and Dakshina, household, sacrificial,\n and southern.\n \n \n Next: Canto XV.: Tará.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto XIII.: The Return To Kishkindh&aacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto XV.: Tar&aacute;. »",
