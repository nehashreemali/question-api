the conquered dame\n Rejoiced in heart nor feared me shame.\n Down in a cave beneath the earth\n The happy mother gave thee birth.\n Once o'er the summit of the wood\n Before thine eyes the new sun stood.\n Thou sprangest up in haste to seize\n What seemed the fruitage of the trees.\n Up leapt the child, a wondrous bound,\n Three hundred leagues above the ground,\n And, though the angered Day-God shot\n His fierce beams on him, feared him not.\n Then from the hand of Indra came\n A red bolt winged with wrath and flame.\n The child fell smitten on a rock.\n His cheek was shattered by the shock,\n Named Hanumán  1b thenceforth by all\n In memory of the fearful fall,\n The wandering Wind-God saw thee lie\n With bleeding cheek and drooping eye,\n And stirred to anger by thy woe\n Forbade each scented breeze to blow.\n The breath of all the worlds was stilled,\n And the sad Gods with terror filled\n Prayed to the Wind, to calm the ire\n And soothe the sorrow of the sire.\n His fiery wrath no longer glowed,\n And Brahmá's self the boon bestowed\n That in the brunt of battle none\n Should slay with steel the Wind-God's son.\n Lord Indra, sovereign of the skies,\n Bent on thee all his thousand eyes,\n And swore that ne'er the bolt which he\n Hurls from the heaven should injure thee,\n 'Tis thine, O mighty chief, to share\n The Wind-God's power, his son and heir.\n Sprung from that glorious father thou.\n And thou alone, canst aid us now.\n This earth of yore, through all her climes,\n I circled one-and-twenty times,\n And gathered, as the Gods decreed,\n Great store of herbs from hill and mead,\n Which, scattered o'er the troubled wave.\n The Amrit to the toilers gave,\n \n \n \n \n p. 393\n \n \n But now my days are wellnigh told,\n My strength is gone, my limbs are old,\n And thou, the bravest and the best,\n Art the sure hope of all the rest.\n Now, mighty chief, the task assay:\n Thy matchless power and strength display\n Rise up, O prince, our second king,\n And o'er the flood of ocean spring.\n So shall the glorious exploit vie\n With his who stepped through earth and sky.'  1\n \n \n He spoke: the younger chieftain heard,\n His soul to vigorous effort stirred,\n And stood before their joyous eyes\n Dilated in gigantic size.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 392:1  The Bengal recension calls him Arishtaneimi's brother \"The commentator says\n \"Arishtanemi is Aruna.\" Aruna the\n charioteer of the sun is the son of Kas'yapa\n and Vinatá and by consequence brother\n of Garuda called Vainat*eya from Vinatá\n his mother,\" GORRESIO.\n 392:2  A nymph of Paradise.\n 392:1b  Hanu or Hanú means jaw.
