No,\n Forth to the forest will I go.\n 'Tis Fate, Sumitrás son, confess,\n That sends me to the wilderness.\n 'Tis Fate alone that gives away\n To'other hands the royal sway\n How could Kaikeyí's purpose bring\n On me this pain and suffering,\n Were not her change of heart decreed\n By Fate whose will commands the deed?\n I know my filial love has been\n The same throughout for every queen,\n And with the same affection she\n Has treated both her son and me.\n Her shameful words of cruel spite\n To stay the consecrating rite,\n And drive me banished from the throne,--\n These I ascribe to Fate alone,\n How could she, born of royal race,\n Whom nature decks with fairest grace,\n Speak like a dame of low degree\n Before the king to torture me?\n But Fate, which none may comprehend,\n To which all life must bow and bend,\n In her and me its power has shown,\n And all my hopes are overthrown.\n What man, Sumitrá's darling, may\n Contend with Fate's resistless sway,\n Whose all-commanding power we find\n Our former deeds alone can bind?\n Our life and death, our joy and pain,\n Anger and fear, and loss and gain,\n Each thing that is, in every state,\n All is the work of none but Fate.\n E'en saints, inspired with rigid zeal.\n When once the stroke of Fate they feel,\n In sternest vows no more engage,\n And fall enslaved by love and rage.\n So now the sudden stroke whose weight\n Descends unlooked for, comes of Fate,\n And with unpitying might destroys\n The promise of commencing joys.\n Weigh this true counsel in thy soul:\n With thy firm heart thy heart control;\n Then, brother, thou wilt cease to grieve\n For hindered rites which now I leave.\n So cast thy needless grief away,\n And strictly my commands obey.\n Those preparations check with speed,\n Nor let my throning rites proceed.\n Those urns that stand prepared to shed\n King-making drops upon my head,\n Shall, with their pure lustrations now\n Inaugurate my hermit's vow.\n \n \n p. 121\n \n \n Yet what have I to do with things\n That touch the state and pomp of kings?\n These hands of mine shall water take\n To sanctify the vow I make.\n Now Lakshman, let thy heart no more\n My fortune changed and lost deplore.\n A forest life more joys may bring\n Than those that wait upon a king,\n Now though her arts successful mar\n         My consecrating rite,\n     Let not the youngest queen too far\n         Thy jealous fear excite.\n     Nor let one thought suggesting ill\n         Upon our father fall,\n     But let thy heart remember still\n         That Fate is lord of all.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto XXIII.: Lakshman's Anger.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XXI.: Kaus'aly&aacute; Calmed.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XXIII.: Lakshman's Anger. »",
