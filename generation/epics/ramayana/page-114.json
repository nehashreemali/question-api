An Indian\n prince in more modern times appears to\n have diverted himself in a similar way.\n \n \n It is still reported in Belgium that Appay\n Deasy was wont to amuse himself \"by\n making several young and beautiful\n women stand side by side on a narrow\n balcony, without a parapet, overhanging\n the deep reservoir at the new palace in\n Nipani. He used then to pass along the\n line of trembling creatures, and suddenly\n thrusting one of them headlong into the\n water below, he used to watch her drowning,\n and derive pleasure from her dying\n agonies.\"--History of the Belgium District.\n By H.
