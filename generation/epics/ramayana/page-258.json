O Lakshman, save?\n Now let my words thy spirit cheer.\n Compose thy thoughts and banish fear.\n In hell, in earth, or in the skies\n There is not, and there cannot rise\n A champion whose strong arm can slay\n Thy Ráma in the battle fray.\n To heavenly hosts he ne'er would yield\n Though Indra led them to the field.\n To soothe her thus I vainly sought:\n Her heart with woe was still distraught.\n While from her eyes the waters ran\n Her bitter speech she thus began:\n 'Too well I see thy dark intent:\n Thy lawless thoughts on me are bent.\n Thou hopest, but thy hope is vain,\n To win my love, thy brother slain.\n Not love, but Bharat's dark decree\n To share his exile counselled thee,\n \n \n p. 300\n \n \n Or hearing now his bitter cry\n Thou surely to his aid wouldst fly.\n For love of me, a stealthy foe\n Thou choosest by his side to go,\n And now thou longest that my lord\n Should die, and wilt no help afford.'\n     Such were the words the lady said:\n With angry fire my eyes were red.\n With pale lips quivering in my rage\n I hastened from the hermitage.'\n He ceased; and frenzied by his pain\n The son of Raghu spoke again:\n 'O brother, for thy fault I grieve,\n The Maithil dame alone to leave.\n Thou knowest that my arm is strong\n To save me from the giant throng,\n And yet couldst leave the cottage, spurred\n To folly by her angry word.\n For this thy deed I praise thee not,--\n To leave her helpless in the cot,\n And thus thy sacred charge forsake\n For the wild words a woman spake.\n Yea thou art all to blame herein,\n And very grievous is thy sin.\n That anger swayed thy faithless breast\n And made thee false to my behest.\n An arrow speeding from my bow\n Has laid the treacherous giant low,\n Who lured me eager for the chase\n Far from my hermit dwelling-place.\n The string with easy hand I drew,\n The arrow as in pastime flew,\n     The wounded quarry bled.\n The borrowed form was cast away,\n Before mine eye a giant lay\n     With bright gold braceleted.\n My arrow smote him in the chest:\n The giant by the pain distressed\n     Raised his loud voice on high.\n Far rang the mournful sound: mine own,\n It seemed, were accent, voice, and tone,\n They made thee leave my spouse alone\n     And to my rescue fly,'\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXI.: Ráma's Lament.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto LIX.: R&aacute;ma's Return.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto LXI.: R&aacute;ma's Lament. »",
