O chief. I recognize.\n O, while these ears can hear thee, say,\n Has Hanumán survived this day?'\n     'Why ask,' Vibhíshan cried,' for one\n Of lower rank, the Wind-God's son?\n Hast thou forgotten, first in place,\n The princely chief of Raghu's race?\n Can King Sugríva claim no care,\n And Angad, his imperial heir?'\n     'Yea, dearer than my noblest friends\n Is he on whom our hope depends.\n For if the Wind-God's son survive,\n All we though dead are yet alive.\n But if his precious life be fled\n Though living still we are but dead:\n He is our hope and sure relief.'\n Thus slowly spoke the aged chief:\n Then to his side Hanúmán came,\n And with low reverence named his name.\n \n \n \n \n Cheered by the face he longed to view\n The wounded chieftain lived anew.\n 'Go forth,' he cried, 'O strong and brave,\n And in their woe the Vánars save.\n 'No might but thine, supremely great,\n May help us in our lost estate,\n The trembling bears and Vánars cheer,\n Calm their sad hearts, dispel their fear.\n Save Raghu's noble sons, and heal\n The deep wounds of the winged steel.\n High o'er the waters of the sea\n To far Himálaya's summits flee.\n Kailása there wilt thou behold,\n Aud Rishabh, with his peaks of gold.\n Between them see a mountain rise\n Whose splendour will enchant thine eyes;\n His sides are clothed above, below,\n With all the rarest herbs that grow.\n Upon that mountain's lofty crest\n Four plants, of sovereign powers possessed,\n Spring from the soil, and flashing there\n Shed radiance through the neighbouring air.\n One draws the shaft: one brings again\n The breath of life to warm the slain;\n One heals each wound; one gives anew\n To faded cheeks their wonted hue.\n Fly, chieftain, to that mountain's brow\n And bring those herbs to save us now.'\n     Hanúmán heard, and springing through\n The air like Vishnu's discus  1b flew.\n The sea was passed: beneath him, gay\n With bright-winged birds, the mountains lay,\n And brook and lake and lonely glen,\n And fertile lands with toiling men.\n On, on he sped: before him rose\n The mansion of perennial snows.\n There soared the glorious peaks as fair\n As white clouds in the summer air.\n Here, bursting from the leafy shade,\n In thunder leapt the wild cascade.\n He looked on many a pure retreat\n Dear to the Gods' and sages' feet:\n The spot where Brahmá dwells apart,\n The place whence Rudra launched his dart;  2b\n Vishnu's high seat and Indra's home,\n And slopes where Yama's servants roam.\n There was Kuvera's bright abode;\n There Brahma's mystic weapon glowed.\n There was the noble hill whereon\n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 486\n \n \n Those herbs with wondrous lustre shone.\n And, ravished by the glorious sight,\n Hanúmán rested on the height.\n He, moving down the glittering peak,\n The healing herbs began to seek:\n But, when he thought to seize the prize,\n They hid them from his eager eyes.\n Then to the hill in wrath he spake:\n 'Mine arm this day shall vengeance take,\n If thou wilt feel no pity, none,\n In this great need of Raghu's son.'\n He ceased: his mighty arms he bent\n And from the trembling mountain rent\n His huge head with the life it bore,\n Snakes, elephants, and golden ore.\n O'er hill and plain and watery waste\n His rapid way again he traced.\n And mid the wondering Vánars laid\n His burthen through the air conveyed.\n The wondrous herbs' delightful scent\n To all the host new vigour lent.\n Free from all darts and wounds and pain\n The sons of Raghu lived again,\n And dead and dying Vánars healed\n Rose vigorous from the battle field.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 485:1  In such cases as this I am not careful\n to reproduce the numbers of the poet,\n which in the text which I follow are\n 670,000,000; the Bengal recension being\n content with thirty million less.\n 485:1b  The discus or quoit, a sharp-edged\n circular missile is the favourite weapon\n of Vishnu.\n 485:2b  To destroy Tripura the triple city in\n the sky, air and earth, built by Maya for\n a celebrated Asur or demon, or as another\n commentator explains, to destroy Randarpa or Love.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXXV.: The Night Attack.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto LXXIII.: Indrajit's Victory.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto LXXV.: The Night Attack. »",
