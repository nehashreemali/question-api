 1 whose valour tilled the land,\n Of mighty arm and stately pride\n Like a wild elephant in stride,\n As fair in face as that fair stone\n Dear to the moon, of moonbeams grown,  2\n With noble gifts and grace that took\n The hearts of all, and chained each look,\n World-cheering as the Lord of Rain\n When floods relieve the parching plain.\n The father, as the son came nigh,\n Gazed with an ever-thirstier eye.\n Sumantra helped the prince alight\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n From the good chariot passing bright,\n And as to meet his sire he went\n Followed behind him reverent.\n Then Ráma clomb, the king to seek\n That terrace like Kailása's peak,\n And reached the presence of the king,\n Sumantra closely following.\n Before his father's face he came,\n Raised suppliant hands and named his name,  1b\n And bowing lowly as is meet\n Paid reverence to the monarch's feet.\n But soon as Das'aratha viewed\n The prince in humble attitude,\n He raised him by the hand in haste\n And his beloved son embraced,\n Then signed him to a glorious throne,\n Gem-decked and golden, near his own.\n Then Ráma, best of Raghu's line,\n Made the fair seat with lustre shine\n As when the orient sun upsprings\n And his pure beam on Meru flings.\n The glory flashed on roof and wall,\n And with strange sheen suffused the hall,\n As when the moon's pure rays are sent\n Through autumn's star-lit firmament.\n Then swelled his breast with joy and pride\n As his dear son the father eyed,\n E'en as himeself more fair arrayed\n In some clear mirror's face displayed.\n The aged monarch gazed awhile,\n Then thus addressed him with a smile,\n As Kas'yap, whom the worlds revere,\n Speaks for the Lord of Gods to hear:\n 'O thou of all my sons most dear,\n In virtue best, thy father's peer,\n Child of my consort first in place,\n Mine equal in her pride of race,\n Because the people's hearts are bound\n To thee by graces in thee found,\n Be thou in Pushya's favouring hour\n Made partner of my royal power.\n I know that thou by nature's bent\n Both modest art and excellent,\n But though thy gifts no counsel need\n My love suggests the friendly rede.\n Mine own dear son, be modest still,\n And rule each sense with earnest will.\n Keep thou the evils far away\n That spring from love and anger's sway.\n Thy noble course alike pursue\n In secret as in open view,\n And every nerve, the love to gain\n Of ministers and subjects, strain.\n The happy prince who sees with pride\n His thriving people satisfied;\n Whose arsenals with arms are stored,\n And treasury with golden hoard,--\n \n \n \n \n \n p. 93\n \n \n His friends rejoice as joyed the Blest\n When Amrit crowned their eager quest.\n So well, my child, thy course maintain,\n And from all ill thy soul refrain.'\n \n \n The friends of Ráma, gathered nigh,\n Longing their lord to gratify,\n Ran to Kaus'alyá's bower to tell\n The tidings that would please her well.\n She, host of dames, with many a gem,\n And gold, and kine rewarded them.\n \n \n Then Ráma paid the reverence due,\n Mounted the chariot, and withdrew,\n And to his splendid dwelling drove\n While crowds to show him honour strove.\n     The people, when the monarch's speech\n         Their willing ears had heard,\n     Were wild with joy as though on each\n         Great gifts had been conferred.\n     With meek and low salute each man\n         Turned to his home away,\n     And there with happy heart began\n         To all the Gods to pray.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 91:1  Whisks, usually made of the long tails\n of the Yak.\n 92:1  Chitraratha, King of the Gandharvas.\n 92:2  The Chandrakánta or Moonstone, a\n sort of crystal supposed to be composed\n of congealed moonbeams.\n 92:1b  A customary mark of respect to a\n superior.\n \n \n Next: Canto IV.: Ráma Summoned.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto II.: The People's Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto IV.: R&aacute;ma Summoned. »",
