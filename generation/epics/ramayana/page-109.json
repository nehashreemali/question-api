His mien was changed, his eyes o'erflowed,\n His breast no more could bear its load.\n The son of Raghu, sore distressed,\n His brother's feet with fervour pressed,\n While thus to Sita he complained.\n And him by lofty vows enchained:\n 'If thou wilt make the woods thy home,\n Where elephant and roebuck roam,\n I too this day will take my bow\n And in the path before thee go.\n Our way will lie through forest ground\n Where countless birds and beasts are found,\n I heed not homes of Gods on high,\n I heed not life that cannot die,\n Nor would I wish, with thee away,\n O'er the three worlds to stretch my sway.'\n \n \n Thus Lakshman spake, with earnest prayer\n His brother's woodland life to share.\n As Rama still his prayer denied\n With soothing words, again he cried:\n 'When leave at first thou didst accord,\n Why dost thou stay me now, my lord?\n Thou art my refuge: O, be kind,\n Leave me not, dear my lord, behind.\n Thou canst not, brother, if thou choose\n That I still live, my wish refuse.'\n \n \n The glorious chief his speech renewed\n To faithful Lakshman as he sued,\n And on the eyes of Ráma gazed\n Longing to load, with hands upraised:\n 'Thou art a hero just and dear,\n Whose steps to virtue's path adhere,\n Loved as my life till life shall end.\n My faithful brother and my friend.\n If to the woods thou take thy way\n With Sítá and with me to-day,\n Who for Kaus'alyá will provide,\n And guard the good Sumitra's side?\n The lord of earth, of mighty power,\n Who sends good things in plenteous shower,\n As Indra pours the grateful rain,\n A captive lies in passion's chain.\n The power imperial for her son\n Has As'vapati's daughter  1 won,\n And she, proud queen, will little heed\n Her miserable rivals' need.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n So Bharat, ruler of the land,\n By Queen Kaikeyí's side will stand,\n Nor of those two will ever think.\n While grieving in despair they sink.\n Now, Lakshman, as thy love decrees,\n Or else the monarch's heart to please,\n Follow this counsel and protect\n My honoured mother from neglect.\n So thou, while not to me alone\n Thy great affection will be shown,\n To highest duty wilt adhere\n By serving those thou shouldst revere.\n Now, son of Raghu, for my sake\n Obey this one request I make,\n Or, of her darling son bereft,\n Kausaly'á has no comfort left.'\n \n \n The faithful Lakshman, thus addressed\n In gentle words which love expressed,\n To him in lore of language learned,\n His answer, eloquent, returned:\n 'Nay, through thy might each queen will share\n Attentive Bharat's love and care.\n Should Bharat, raised as king to sway\n This noblest realm, his trust betray,\n Nor for their safety well provide,\n Seduced by ill-suggesting pride,\n Doubt not my vengeful hand shall kill\n The cruel wretch who counsels ill--\n Kill him and all who lend him aid,\n And the three worlds in league arrayed.\n And good Kausaly'á well can fee\n A thousand champions like to me.\n A thousand hamlets rich in grain\n The station of that queen maintain.\n She may, and my dear mother too,\n Live on the ample revenue.\n Then let me follow thee: herein\n Is naught that may resemble sin.\n So shall I in my wish suceed,\n And aid, perhaps, my brother's need.\n My bow and quiver well supplied\n With arrows hanging at my side,\n My hands shall spade and basket bear,\n And for thy feet the way prepare.\n I'll bring thee roots and berries sweet.\n And woodland fare which hermits eat.\n Thou shall with thy Videhan spouse\n Recline upon the mountain's brows:\n Be mine the toil, be mine to keep\n Watch o'er thee waking or asleep.'\n \n \n Filled by his speech with joy and pride\n Ráma to Lakshman thus replied:\n 'Go then, my brother, bid adieu\n To all thy friends and retinue.\n And those two bows of fearful might,\n Celestial, which, at that famed rite,\n Lord Varun gave to Janak, king\n Of fair Videha with thee bring,\n With heavenly coats of sword-proof mail,\n Quivers, whose arrows never fail,\n \n \n p. 132\n \n \n And golden-hilted swords so keen,\n The rivals of the sun in sheen.\n Tended with care these arms are all\n Preserved in my preceptor's hall.\n With speed, O Lakshman, go, produce,\n And bring them hither for our use.'\n So on a woodland life intent,\n To see his faithful friends he went,\n And brought the heavenly arms which lay\n By Ráma's teacher stored away,\n And Raghu's son to Ráma showed\n Those wondrous arms which gleamed and glowed,\n Well kept, adorned with many a wreath\n Of flowers on case, and hilt, and sheath.\n The prudent Ráma at the sight\n Addressed his brother with delight:\n 'Well art thou come, my brother dear.\n For much I longed to see thee here.\n For with thine aid, before I go,\n I would my gold and wealth bestow\n Upon the Bráhmans sage, who school\n Their lives by stern devotion's rule.\n And for all those who ever dwell\n Within my house and serve me well,\n Devoted servants, true and good,\n Will I provide a livelihood.\n     Quick, go and summon to this place\n         The good Vas'ishtha's son,\n     Suyajna, of the Bráhman race\n         The first and holiest one.\n     To all the Bráhmans wise and good\n         Will I due reverence pay,\n     Then to the solitary wood\n         With thee will take my way.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 131:1  Kaikeyi.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXXII.: The Gift of The
