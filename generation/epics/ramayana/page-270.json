I pray thee say,\n And let this grace our deeds repay.'\n     Danu had lent attentive ear\n The words which Ráma spoke to hear,\n And thus, a speaker skilled and tried.\n To that great orator replied:\n ' No heavenly lore my soul endows,\n Naught know I of thy Maithil spouse.\n Yet will I, when my shape I wear.\n Him who will tell thee all declare.\n Then, Ráma, will my lips disclose\n His name who well that giant knows\n But, till the flames my corse devour\n This hidden knowledge mocks my power.\n For through that curse's withering taint\n My knowledge now is small and faint\n Unknown the giant's very name\n Who bore away the Maithil dame\n Cursed for my evil deeds I wore\n A shape which all the worlds abhor.\n Now ere with wearied steeds the sun\n Through western skies his course have run,\n Deep in a pit my body lay\n \n \n p. 314\n \n \n And burn it in the wonted way.\n When in the grave my corse is placed,\n With fire and funeral honours graced,\n Then I, great chief, his name will tell\n Who knows the giant robber well.\n With him, who guides his life aright,\n In league of trusting love unite,\n And he, O valiant prince, will be\n A faithful friend and aid to thee.\n For, Ráma, to his searching eyes\n The triple world uncovered lies.\n For some dark cause of old, I ween,\n Through all the spheres his ways have been.'\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXXIII.: Kabandha's Counsel.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto LXXI.: Kabandha's Speech.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto LXXIII.: Kabandha's Counsel. »",
