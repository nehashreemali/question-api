One\n of these observances was the recitation of\n the Sávitri, a Vedic hymn to the Sun of\n wonderful beauty.' GORBESIO.\n 37:1b  Tripathaga, Three-path-go, flowing\n in heaven, on earth, and under the earth.\n See Canto XLV\n 37:2b  Tennyson's ' Indian Cama,' the God\n of Love, known also by many other names.\n 37:3b  Uma, or Parvati, was daughter of\n Himálaya, Monarch of mountains, and\n wife of S'iva. See Kálidása's Kumára\n Sambhava, or Birth of the War-God.\n 37:4b  Sthánu, The Unmoving one, a name\n of S'iva.\n 37:5b  The practice of austerities, voluntary\n tortures, and mortifications was anciently\n universal in India, and was held by the\n Indians to be of immense efficacy. Hence\n they mortified themselves to expiate sins,\n to acquire merits, and to obtain superhuman\n gifts and powers; the Gods themselves\n sometimes exercised themselves in\n such austerities, either to raise themselves\n to greater power and grandeur, or to\n counteract the austerities of man which\n threatened to prevail over them and to\n deprive them of heaven.... Such austerities\n were called in India tapas (burning\n ardour, fervent devotion) and he who\n practised them tapasvin.'GORRESIO.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXVI.: The Forest of Tádaká.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto XXIV.: The Spells.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto XXVI.: The Forest of T&aacute;dak&aacute;. »",
