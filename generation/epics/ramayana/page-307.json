say;\n Who dares thy will to disobey?\n Who checks the maddened flames that seize\n On forests full of withered trees?\n   Then Lakshman spoke, her mind to ease,\n His kind reply in words like these:\n   'Thy lord his days in pleasure spends,\n Heedless of duty and of friends.\n Nor dost thou mark, though fondly true,\n The evil path his steps pursue.\n He cares not for affairs of state,\n Nor us forlorn and desolate,\n But sits a mere spectator still,\n A sensual slave to pleasure's will.\n Four months were fixed, the time agreed\n When he should help us in our need:\n But, bound in toils of pleasure fast,\n He sees not that the months are past.\n Where beats the heart which draughts of wine\n To virtue or to gain incline?\n Hast thou nor heard those draughts destroy\n Virtue and gain and love and joy?\n For those who, helped at need, refuse\n Their aid in turn, their virtue lose:\n And they who scorn a friend disdain\n A treasure naught may buy again.\n Thy lord has cast his friend away,\n Nor feared from virtue's path to stray.\n If this he true, declare, O dame\n Who knowest duty's every claim.\n What further work remains for us\n Deceived and disappointed thus.'\n     She listened, for his words were kind.\n Where virtue showed with gain combined,\n And thus in turn the prince addressed,\n As hope was rising in his breast:\n 'No time, no cause of wrath I see\n With those who live and honour thee:\n And thou shouldst bear without offence\n Thy servant's fitful negligence.\n I know the seasons glide away,\n While Ráma maddens at delay\n I know what deed our thanks has earned,\n I know that grace shonld be returned\n But still I know, whatever befall,\n That conquering love is lord of all;\n \n \n p. 366\n \n \n Know where Sugríva's thoughts, possessed\n By one absorbing passion, rest.\n But he whom sensual joys debase\n Heeds not the claim of time and place,\n And sees not with his blinded sight\n His duty or his gain aright.\n O pardon him who loves me! spare\n The Vánar caught in pleasure's snare,\n And once again let Ráma grace\n With favour him who rules our race.\n E'en royal saints, whose chief delight\n Was penance and austerest rite,\n At love's commandment have unbent,\n Beguiled by sweetest blandishment.\n And know, Sugríva, roused at last,\n The order to his lords has passed.\n And, long by love and bliss delayed.\n Wakes all on fire your hopes to aid.\n A countless host his city fills,\n New-gathered from a thousand hills:\n Impetuous chiefs, who wear at need\n Each varied form, his legions lead.\n Come then, O hero, kept aloof\n By modest awe, nor fear reproof:\n A faithful friend untouched by blame\n May look upon another's dame.'\n     He passed within, by Tárá pressed,\n And by his own impatient breast.\n Refulgent there in sunlike sheen\n Sugríva on his throne was seen.\n Gay garlands round his neck were twined,\n And Rumá by her lord recline.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 364:1b  Maireya, a spirituous liquor from the\n blossoms of the Lythrum fruticosum, with\n sugar, &c.\n 364:2b  Their names are as follows:\n Angad, Mainda, Dwida, Gavaya, Gaváksha,\n Gaja, Sarabha, Vidyunmáli,\n Sampáti, Súryáksa, Hanumán, Virabáhu,\n Subáha, Nala, Kúmuda, Sushena, Tára,\n Jámbuvatu, Dadhivakra, *Nila, S'upátala,\n and Sunetra.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXXIV.: Lakshman's Speech\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK IV: Canto XXXII.: Hanuman's Counsel.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK IV: Canto XXXIV.: Lakshman's Speech »",
