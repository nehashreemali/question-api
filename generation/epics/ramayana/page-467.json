Vibhíshan eyed\n The giants chief, and thus replied:\n 'This Ráma, this is Rávan's son:\n High fame his youthful might has won.\n He, best of warriors, bows his ear\n The wisdom of the wise to hear.\n Supreme is he mid those who know\n The mastery of sword and bow.\n Unrivalled in the bold attack\n On elephant's or courser's back,\n He knows, beside, each subtler art,\n To win the foe, to bribe, or part.\n On him the giant hosts rely,\n And fear no ill when he is nigh.\n This peerless chieftain bears the name\n Of Atikáva huge of frame,\n Whom Dhanyamáliní of yore\n To Rávan lord of Lanká bore.'\n     Roused by his bow-string's awful clang,\n To meet their foes the Vánars sprang.\n Armed with tall trees from Lanká's wood,\n And rocks and mountain peaks, they stood.\n The giant's arrows, gold-bedecked,\n The storm of hurtling missiles checked;\n And ever on his foemen poured\n Fierce tempest from his clanging cord;\n Nor could the Vánar chiefs sustain\n His shafts' intolerable rain.\n They fled: the victor gained the place\n Where stood the lord of Raghu's race,\n And cried with voice of thunder: 'Lo,\n Borne on my car, with shaft and bow,\n I, champion of the giants, scorn\n To fight with weaklings humbly born.\n Come forth your bravest, if he dare,\n And right with one who will not spare.'\n     Forth sprang Sumitrá's noble child,  1\n And strained his ready bow, and smiled;\n And giants trembled as the clang\n Through heaven and earth reechoing rang.\n The giant to his string applied\n A pointed shaft, and proudly cried;\n 'Turn, turn, Sumitrá's son and fly,\n For terrible as Death am I\n Fly, nor that youthful form oppose,\n Untrained in war, to warriors' blows.\n What! wilt thou waste thy childish breath\n And wake the dormant fire of death?\n Cast down, rash boy, that useless bow:\n Preserve thy life, uninjured go.'\n     He ceased: and stirred by wrath & pride\n Sumitrá's noble son replied:\n 'By warlike deed, not words alone,\n The valour of the brave is shown.\n Cease with vain boasts my scorn to move,\n \n \n \n \n And with thine arm thy prowess prove.\n Borne on thy car, with sword and bow,\n With all thine arms, thy valour show.\n Fight, and my deadly shafts this day\n Low in the dust thy head shall lay,\n And, rushing fast in ceaseless flood,\n Shall rend thy flesh and drink thy blood.'\n     His giant foe no answer made,\n But on his string an arrow laid.\n He raised his arm, the cord he drew,\n At Lakshman's breast the arrow flew.\n Sumitrá's son, his foemen's dread,\n Shot a fleet shaft with crescent head,\n Which cleft that arrow pointed well,\n And harmless to the earth it fell.\n A shower of shafts from Lakshman's bow\n Fell fast and furious on the foe\n Who quailed not as the missiles smote\n With idle force his iron coat.\n Then came the friendly Wind-God near,\n And whispered thus in Lakshman's ear:\n 'Such shafts as these in vain assail\n Thy foe's impenetrable mail.\n A more tremendous missile try,\n Or never may the giant die.\n Employ the mighty spell, and aim\n The weapon known by Brahma's name.'\n He ceased - Sumitrá's son obeyed:\n On his great bow the shaft was laid,\n And with a roar like thunder, true\n As Indra's flashing bolt, it flew.\n The giant poured his shafts like rain\n To check its course, but all in vain.\n With spear and mace and sword he tried\n To turn the fiery dart aside.\n Winged with a force which naught could check.\n It smote the monster in the neck,\n And, sundered from his shoulders, rolled\n To earth his head and helm of gold.\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 482:1  The demon of eclipse who seizes the\n Sun and Moon.\n 483:1  Lakshman.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXXII.: Rávan's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto LXX.: The Death of Tris'iras.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto LXXII.: R&aacute;van's Speech. »",
