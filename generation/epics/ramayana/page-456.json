Up he raised\n His awful head with eyes that blazed\n Like comets, dire as Death in form\n Who threats the worlds with fire and storm.\n The giants pointed to their stores\n Of buffaloes and deer and boars,\n And straight he gorged him with a flood\n Of wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood.\n He ceased: the giants ventured near\n And bent their lowly heads in fear.\n Then Kumbhakarna glared with eyes\n Still heavy in their first surprise,\n Still drowsy from his troubled rest,\n And thus the giant band addressed.\n 'How have ye dared my sleep to break?\n No trifling cause should bid me wake.\n Say, is all well? or tell the need\n That drives you with unruly speed\n To wake me. Mark the words I say,\n The king shall tremble in dismay,\n \n \n p. 474\n \n \n The fire be quenched and Indra slain\n Ere ye shall break my rest in vain.'\n     Yupáksha answered: 'Chieftain, hear;\n No God or fiend excites our fear.\n But men in arms our walls assail:\n We tremble lest their might prevail.\n For vengeful Ráma vows to slay\n The foe who stole his queen away,\n And, matchless for his warlike deeds,\n A host of mighty Vánars leads.\n Ere now a monstrous Vánar came.\n Laid Lanká waste with ruthless flame,\n And Aksha, Rávan's offspring, blew\n With all his warrior retinue.\n Our king who never trembled yet\n For heavenly hosts in battle met.\n At length the general dread has shared,\n O'erthrown by Ráma's arm and spared.'\n     He ceased: and Kumbhakarna spake:\n 'I will go forth and vengeance take;\n Will tread their hosts beneath my feet,\n Then triumph-flushed our king will meet.\n Our giant bands shall eat their fill\n Of Vánars whom this arm shall kill.\n The princes' blood shall be my draught,\n The chieftains' shall by you be quaffed.'\n He spake, and, with an eager stride\n That shook the earth, to Rávan hied,\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 472:1  An ancient king of Ayodhyá said by\n some to have been Prithu's father.\n 472:2  The daughter of King Kus'adhwaja.\n She became an ascetic, and being insulted\n by Rávan in the woods where she was p. 473\n performing penance, destroyed herself by\n entering fire, but was born again as Sitá\n to be in turn the destruction of him who\n had insulted her.\n 473:1  Nandisvara was S'iva's chief attendant.\n Rávan had despised and laughed at him\n for appearing in the form of a monkey\n and the irritated Nandis'vara cursed him\n and foretold his destruction by monkeys.\n 473:2  Rávan once upheaved and shook\n Mount Kailása the favourite dwelling\n place of S'iva the consort of Umá, and\n was cursed in consequence by the offended\n Goddess.\n 473:3  Rambhá, who has several times been\n mentioned in the course of the poem, was\n one of the nymphs of heaven, and had\n been insulted by Rávan.\n 473:4  Punjikasthalá was the daughter of\n Varun. Rávan himself has mentioned in\n this book his insult to her, and the curse\n pronounced in consequence by Brahma.\n \n \n Next: Canto LXI.: The Vánars' Alarm.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK VI: Canto LX.: Kumbhakarna Roused.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK VI: Canto LXI.: The V&aacute;nars' Alarm. »",
