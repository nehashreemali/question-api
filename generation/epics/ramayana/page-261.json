I implore;\n Lone is the cot so dear before.\n     No, she is slain by giants; they\n Have stolen or devoured their prey,\n Or surely at my mournful cry\n My darling to her lord would fly.\n O Lakshman, see those troops of deer:\n In each sad eye there gleams a tear.\n Those looks of woe too clearly say\n My consort is the giants' prey.\n O noblest, fairest of the fair,\n Where art thou. best of women, where?\n This day will dark Kaikeyí find\n Fresh triumph for her evil mind,\n When I, who with my Sítá came\n Return alone, without my dame.\n But ne'er can I return to see\n Those chambers where my queen should be\n And hear the scornful people speak\n \n \n p. 303\n \n \n Of Ráma as a coward weak.\n For mine will be the coward's shame\n Who let the foeman steal his dame.\n How can I seek my home, or brook\n Upon Videha's king to look?\n How listen, when he bids me tell,\n My wanderings o'er, that all is well?\n He, when I meet his eager view,\n Will mark that Sítá comes not too,\n And when he hears the mournful tale\n His wildered sense will reel and fail.\n 'O Das'aratha.' will he cry,\n 'Blest in thy mansion in the sky!'\n Ne'er to that town my steps shall bend,\n That town which Bharat's arms defend,\n For e'en the blessed homes above\n Would seem a waste without my love.\n Leave me, my brother, here, I pray;\n To fair Ayodhyá bend thy way.\n Without my love I cannot bear\n To live one hour in blank despair.\n Round Bharat's neck thy fond arms twine,\n And greet him with these words of mine:\n 'Dear brother, still the power retain,\n And o'er the land as monarch reign.'\n With salutation next incline\n Before thy mother, his, and mine.\n Still, brother, to my words attend,\n And with all care each dame befriend.\n To my dear mother's ear relate\n My mournful tale and Sítá's fate.'\n     Thus Ráma gave his sorrow vent,\n And from a heart which anguish rent,\n Mourned for his wife in loud lament,-\n     Her of the glorious hair,\n From Lakshman's cheek the colour fled,\n And o'er his heart came sudden dread,\n Sick, faint, and sore disquieted\n     By woe too great to bear.\n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto LXIV.: Rama's Lament.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK III: Canto LXII.: R&aacute;ma's Lament.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK III: Canto LXIV.: Rama's Lament. »",
