I fear, lest borne away\n By frenzy of success, she slay\n Kaus'alyá, through her wicked hate\n Of me, bereft, disconsolate;\n Or her who aye for me has striven\n Sumitrá, to devotion given.\n Hence, Lakshman, to Avodhyá speed,\n Returning in the hour of need.\n With Sítá I my steps will bend\n Where Dandak's mighty woods extend.\n No guardian has Kaus'alyá now:\n O, be her friend and guardian thou.\n Strong hate may vile Kaikeyí lead\n To many a base unrighteous deed,\n Treading my mother 'neath her feet\n When Bharat holds the royal seat.\n Sure in some antenatal time\n Were children, by Kausalyá's crime.\n Torn from their mothers' arms away,\n And hence she mourns this evil day.\n She for her child no toil would spare\n Tending me long with pain and care;\n Now in the hour of fruitage she\n Has lost that son, ah, woe is me.\n O Lakshman, may no matron e'er\n A son so doomed to sorrow bear\n As I, my mother's heart who rend\n With anguish that can never end.\n The Sáriká,  1 methinks, possessed\n More love than glows in Ráma's breast.\n Who, as the tale is told to us.\n Addressed the stricken parrot thus:\n \n \n \n \n \n p. 158\n \n \n 'Parrot, the capturer's talons tear,\n While yet alone thou flutterest there.\n Before his mouth has closed on me:'\n So cried the bird, herself to free.\n Reft of her son, in childless woe,\n My mother's tears for ever flow:\n Ill-fated, doomed with grief to strive.\n What aid can she from me derive?\n Pressed down by care, she cannot rise\n From sorrow's flood wherein she lies.\n In righteous wrath my single arm\n Could, with my bow, protect from harm\n Ayodhyá's town and all the earth:\n But what is hero prowess worth?\n Lest breaking duty's law I sin,\n And lose the heaven I strive to win,\n The forest life today I choose,\n And kingly state and power refuse.'\n \n \n Thus mourning in that lonely spot\n The troubled chief bewailed his lot,\n And filled with tears, his eyes ran o'er;\n Then silent sat, and spake no more.\n To him, when ceased his loud lament,\n Like fire whose brilliant might is spent.\n Or the great sea when sleeps the wave,\n Thus Lakshman consolation gave:\n 'Chief of the brave who bear the bow,\n E'en now Ayodhyá, sunk in woe,\n By thy departure reft of light\n Is gloomy as the moonless night.\n Unfit it seems that thou, O chief.\n Shouldst so afflict thy soul with grief,\n So with thou Sítá's heart consign\n To deep despair as well as mine.\n Not I, O Raghu's son, nor she\n Could live one hour deprived of thee:\n We were, without thine arm to save,\n Like fish deserted by the wave.\n Although my mother dear to meet,\n S'atrughna and the king, were sweet,\n On them, or heaven, to feed mine eye\n Were nothing, if thou wert not by.'\n \n \n Sitting at ease, their glances fell\n Upon the beds, constructed well.\n And there the sons of virtue laid\n Their limps beneath the fig tree's shade.\n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 157:1  The Mainá or Gracula religiosa, a\n favourite cage-bird, easily taught to talk.\n \n \n Next: Canto LIV.: Bharadvája's Hermitage.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto LII.: The Crossing of Gang&aacute;.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto LIV.: Bharadv&aacute;ja's Hermitage. »",
