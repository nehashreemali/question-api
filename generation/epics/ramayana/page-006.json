The tuneful pair\n Like heavenly minstrels sweet and fair\n In music's art divinely skilled,\n Their saintly master's word fulfilled.\n Like Ráma's self, from whom they came,\n They shared their size in face and frame,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 11\n \n \n As though from some fair sculptured stone\n Two selfsame images had grown.\n Sometimes the pair rose up to sing,\n Surrounded by a holy ring,\n Where seated on the grass bad met\n Full many a musing anchoret.\n Then tears bedimmed those gentle eyes,\n As transport took them and surprise,\n And as they listened every one\n Cried in delight, Well done! Well done!\n Those sages versed in holy lore\n Praised the sweet minstrels more and more:\n And wondered at the singers' skill,\n And the bard's verses sweeter still,\n Which laid so clear before the eye\n The glorious deeds of days gone by.\n Thus by the virtuous hermits praised,\n Inspirited their voice they raised.\n Pleased with the song this holy man\n Would give the youths a water-can;\n One gave a fair ascetic dress,\n Or sweet fruit from the wilderness.\n One saint a black-deer's hide would bring,\n And one a sacrificial string:\n One, a clay pitcher from his hoard,\n And one, a twisted munja cord.  1\n One in his joy an axe would find,\n One, braid, their plaited locks to bind.\n One gave a sacrificial cup,\n One rope to tie their fagots up;\n While fuel at their feet was laid,\n Or hermit's stool of fig-tree made.\n All gave, or if they gave not, none\n Forgot at least a benison.\n Some saints, delighted with their lays,\n Would promise health and length of days;\n Others with surest words would add\n Some boon to make their spirit glad.\n In such degree of honour then\n That song was held by holy men:\n That living song which life can give,\n By which shall many a minstrel live.\n In seat of kings, in crowded hall,\n They sang the poem, praised of all.\n And Ráma chanced to hear their lay,\n While he the votive steed  2 would slay,\n And sent fit messengers to bring\n The minstrel pair before the king.\n They came, and found the monarch high\n Enthroned in gold, his brothers nigh;\n While many a minister below,\n And noble, sate in lengthened row.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The youthful pair awhile he viewed\n Graceful in modest attitude,\n And then in words like these addressed\n His brother Lakshman and the rest:\n 'Come, listen to the wondrous strain\n Recited by these godlike twain.\n Sweet singers of a story fraught\n With melody and lofty thought.'\n     The pair, with voices sweet and strong,\n Rolled the full tide of noble song,\n With tone and accent deftly blent\n To suit the changing argument.\n Mid that assembly loud and clear\n Rang forth that lay so sweet to hear,\n That universal rapture stole\n Through each man's frame and heart and soul.\n 'These minstrels, blest with every sign\n That marks a high and princely line,\n     In holy shades who dwell,\n Enshrined in Saint Válmiki's lay,\n A monument to live for aye,\n     My deeds in song shall tell.'\n Thus Ráma spoke: their breasts were fired,\n And the great tale, as if inspired,\n     The youths began to sing,\n While every heart with transport swelled,\n And mute and rapt attention held\n     The concourse and the king,\n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 10:1 The twin sons if Ráma and Sítá,\n born after Ráma had repartiated Sítá,\n and brought up in the hermitage of\n Válmíki. As they were the first rhapsodists\n the combined name Kus'alava signifies\n a reciter of paeans or an improvisatore\n even to the present day.\n 10:2  Perhaps the base, tenor, and treble,\n or quick, slow and middle times. We know\n but little of the ancient music of the Hindus.\n 10:3  Eight flavours or sentiments are usually\n enumerated, love, mirth, tenderness, anger,\n heroism, terror, disgust, and surprise;\n tranquility or content, or paternal tenderness,\n is sometimes considered the ninth.\n WILSON. See the Sáhitya Darpana or\n Mirror of Composition translated by\n Dr. Ballantyne and Bábá Pramadádása\n Mitra in the Bibliotheca Indica.\n 11:1  Saccharum Munja is a plant from whose\n fibres is twisted the sacred string which a\n Bráhman wears over one shoulder after he\n has been initiated by a rite which in some\n respects answers to confirmation.\n 11:2  A description of an As'vamedha or\n horse sacrifice is given in Canto XIII. of this Book.\n \n \n Next: Canto V.: Ayodhyá\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK I: Canto III.: The Argument.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK I: Canto V.: Ayodhy&aacute; »",
