The chief star in the\n constellation is Aldebaran.\n 413:5  Arundhatí was the wife of the great\n sage Vas'ishtha, and regarded as the pattern\n of conjugal excellence. She was raised\n to the heavens as one of the Pleiades.\n 413:6  The Gods do not shed tears; nor do\n they touch the ground when they walk\n or stand. Similarly Milton's angels marched\n above the ground and \"the passive\n air upbore their nimble tread.\"\n \n \n Virgil's 'vera incessu patuit dea' may\n refer to the same belief.\n \n \n Next: Canto XXXIV.: Hanumán's Speech.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: BOOK V: Canto XXXII.: S&iacute;t&aacute;'s Doubt.\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: BOOK V: Canto XXXIV.: Hanum&aacute;n's Speech. »",
