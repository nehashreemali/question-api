It is\n well known that the country along the\n coast to the south of the mouths of the\n Ganges was the seat of this people. Hence\n it may be suspected that this Mahendra\n is what Pliny calls \"promontorium Calingon\".\n The modern name, Cape Palmyras,\n from the palmyras Borassus flabelliformis,\n which abound there agrees\n remarkably with the description of the\n poet who speaks of the groves of these\n trees.
