Hence,\n perhaps, the myth.\n 50:1b  The region here spoken of is called\n in the Laws of Manu Madhyades'a or the\n middle region. 'The region situated between\n the Himálaya and the Vindhya\n Mountains ... is called Madhyades'a,\n or the middle region; the space\n comprised between these two mountains\n from the eastern to the western sea is called\n by sages Áryávartta, the seat of honourable\n men.' (MANU, II, 21, 22.) The Sanskrit\n Indians called themselves Áryans,\n which means honourable, noble, to distinguish\n themselves from the surrounding\n nations of different origin.'
