With tears his eyes grew dim,\n His senses all deserted him.\n He cried, O Ráma, once, then weak\n And fainting could no further speak.\n Unconscious there he lay: at length\n Regathering his sense and strength,\n While his full eyes their torrents shed,\n To wise Sumantra thus he said:\n 'Yoke the light car, and hither lead\n Fleet coursers of the noblest breed,\n And drive this heir of lofty fate\n Beyond the limit of the state.\n This seems the fruit that virtues bear,\n The meed of worth which texts declare--\n The sending of the brave and good\n By sire and mother to the wood.'\n \n \n He heard the monarch, and obeyed,\n With ready feet that ne'er delayed,\n And brought before the palace gate\n The horses and the car of state.\n Then to the monarch's son he sped,\n And raising hands of reverence said\n \n \n p. 141\n \n \n That the light car which gold made fair,\n With best of steeds, was standing there.\n King Das'aratha called in haste\n The lord o'er all his treasures placed.\n And spoke, well skilled in place and time,\n His will to him devoid of crime:\n 'Count all the years she has to live\n Afar in forest wilds, and give\n To Sítá robes and gems of price\n As for the time may well suffice.'\n Quick to the treasure-room he went,\n Charged by that king most excellent,\n Brought the rich stores, and gave them all\n To Sítá in the monarch's hall.\n The Maithil dame of high descent\n Received each robe and ornament,\n And tricked those limbs, whose lines foretold\n High destiny, with gems and gold.\n So well adorned, so fair to view,\n A glory through the hall she threw:\n So, when the Lord of Light upsprings,\n His radiance o'er the sky he flings.\n Then Queen Kaus'alyá spake at last,\n With loving arms about her cast,\n Pressed lingering kisses on her head,\n And to the high-souled lady said:\n 'Ah, in this faithless world below\n When dark misfortune comes and woe,\n Wives, loved and cherished every day,\n Neglect their lords and disobey.\n Yes, woman's nature still is this:--\n After long days of calm and bliss\n When some light grief her spirit tries,\n She changes all her love, or flies.\n Young wives are thankless, false in soul,\n With roving hearts that spurn control.\n Brooding on sin and quickly changed,\n In one short hour their love estranged.\n Not glorious deed or lineage fair,\n Not knowledge, gift, or tender care\n In chains of lasting love can bind\n A woman's light inconstant mind.\n But those good dames who still maintain\n What right, truth, Scripture, rule ordain--\n No holy thing in their pure eyes\n With one beloved husband vies.\n Nor let thy lord my son, condemned\n To exile, be by thee contemned,\n For be he poor or wealthy, he\n Is as a God, dear child, to thee.'\n \n \n When Sítá heard Kaus'alyá's speech\n Her duty and her gain to teach,\n She joined her palms with reverent grace\n And gave her answer face to face:\n 'All will I do, forgetting naught,\n Which thou,O honoured Queen, hast taught.\n I know, have heard, and deep have stored\n The rules of duty to my lord.\n Not me, good Queen, shouldst thou include\n Among the faithless multitude.\n Its own sweet light the moon shall leave\n Ere I to duty cease to cleave.\n The stringless lute gives forth no strain,\n The wheelless car is urged in vain;\n No joy a lordless dame, although\n Blest with a hundred sons, can know.\n From father, brother, and from son\n A measured share of joy is won:\n Who would not honour, love, and bless\n Her lord, whose gifts are measureless?\n Thus trained to think, I hold in awe\n Scripture's command and duty's law.\n Him can I hold in slight esteem?\n Her lord is woman's God, I deem.'\n Kaus'alyá heard the lady's speech,\n Nor failed those words her heart to reach.\n Then, pure in mind, she gave to flow\n The tear that sprang of joy and woe.\n Then duteous Ráma forward came\n And stood before the honoured dame,\n And joining reverent hands addressed\n The queen in rank above the rest:\n 'O mother, from these tears refrain;\n Look on my sire and still thy pain.\n To thee my days afar shall fly\n As if sweet slumber closed thine eye,\n And fourteen years of exile seem\n To thee, dear mother, like a dream.\n On me returning safe and well,\n Girt by my friends, thine eyes shall dwell.'\n \n \n Thus for their deep affection's sake\n The hero to his mother spake,\n Then to the half seven hundred too.\n Wives of his sire, paid reverence due.\n Thus Das'aratha's son addressed\n That crowd of matrons sore distressed:\n 'If from these lips, while here I dwelt,\n One heedless taunt you e'er have felt,\n Forgive me, pray. And now adieu,\n I bid good-bye to all of you.'\n Then straight, like curlews' cries, upwent\n The voices of their wild lament,\n While, as he bade farewell, the crowd\n Of royal women wept aloud,\n And through the ample hall's extent.\n Where erst the sound of tabour, blent\n With drum and shrill-toned instrument,\n     In joyous concert rose,\n Now rang the sound of wailing high,\n The lamentation and the cry,\n The shriek, the choking sob, the sigh\n     That told the ladies' woes.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next: Canto XL.: Ráma's Departure.\n \n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: Book II: Canto XXXVIII.: Care For Kaus'aly&aacute;\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: Book II: Canto XL.: R&aacute;ma's Departure. »",
