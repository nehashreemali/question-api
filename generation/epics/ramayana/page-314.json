your feet shall tread\n Shores of the sea whose waves are red,\n Where spreading wide your eyes shall see\n The guilt-tormenting cotton tree  1\n And the wild spot where Garud  2 dwells\n Which gems adorn and ocean shells,\n High as Kallása, nobly decked,\n Wrought by the heavenly architect.  3\n Hnge giants named Mandehas  4 there\n In each foul shape they love to wear,\n Numbing the soul with terror's chill,\n Hang from the summit of the hill.\n When darts the sun his earliest beam\n They plunge them in the ocean stream,\n New vigour from his rays obtain,\n And hang upon the rocks again\n Speed onward still: your steps shall be\n At length beside the Milky Sea\n Whose everv ripple as it curls\n Gleams glorious with its wealth of pearls.\n Amid that sea like pale clouds spread\n The white Mount Rishabh  5 rears his head.\n About the mountain's glorious waist\n Woods redolent of bloom are braced.\n A lake where lotuses unfold\n Their silver buds with threads of gold,\n Sudar*s'an ever bright and fair\n Where white swans sport, lies gleaming there,\n The wandering Kinnar's  6 dear resort,\n Where heavenly nymphs and Yakshas  7 sport.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n On! leave the Milky Sea behind:\n Another flood your search shall find,\n A waste of waters, wild and drear.\n That chills each living heart with fear.\n There see the horse's awful head,\n Wrath-born, that flames in Ocean's bed. 1b\n There rises up a fearful cry\n From the sea things that move thereby,\n When, helpless, powerless for flight,\n They gaze upon the horrid sight.\n Past to the northern shore, and then\n Beyond the flood three leagues and ten\n Your wondering glances will behold\n Mount Játarúpa  2b bright with gold.\n There like the young moon pale of hue\n The monstrous serpent  3b will ye view,\n The earth's supporter, whose bright eyes\n Resemble lotus leaves in size.\n He rests upon the mountain's brow,\n And all the Gods before him bow.\n Ananta with a thousand heads\n His length in robes of azure spreads.\n A triple-headed palm of gold--\n Meet standard for the lofty-souled--\n Springs towering from the mountain's crest\n Beneath whose shade he loves to rest,\n So that in eastern realms each God\n May use it as a measuring-rod.\n Beyond, with burning gold aglow,\n The eastern steep his peaks will show,\n Which in unrivalled glory rise\n A hundred leagues to pierce the skies,\n And all the neighbouring air is bright\n With golden trees that clothe the height.\n A lofty peak uprises there\n Ten leagues in height and one league square\n *Saumanas*, wrought of glistering gold,\n Ne'er to be loosened from its hold.\n There his first step Lord Vishnu placed\n When through the universe he paced,\n And with his second lightly pressed\n The loftiest peak of Meru's crest.\n When north of Jambudwíp  4b the sun\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n p. 374\n \n \n A portion of his course has run.\n And hangs above this mountain height,\n Then creatures see the genial light.\n Vaikhánases, 1 saints far renowned,\n And Bálaklulvas, 2 love the ground\n Where in their glory half divine.\n Touched by the morning glow, they shine\n The light that flashes from that steep\n Illumines all Sudars'andwip, 3\n And on each creature, as it glows,\n The sight and strength of life bestows.\n Search well that mountain's woody side\n If Rávan there his captive hide.\n The rising sun, the golden hill\n The air with growing splendours fill,\n Till flashes from the east the red\n Of morning with the light they shed.\n This, where the sun begins his state,\n Is earth and heaven's most eastern gate.\n Through all the mountain forest seek\n By waterfall and cave and peak.\n Search every nook and bosky dell,\n If Rávan there with Sítá dwell.\n There, Vánars, there your steps must stay:\n No farther eastward can ye stray.\n Beyond no sun, no moon given light,\n But all is sunk in endless night.\n Thus far, O Vánar lords, may you\n O'er sea and land your search pursue.\n But wild and dark and known to none\n Is the drear space beyond the sun.\n That mountain whence the sun ascends\n Your long and weary journey ends. 4\n Now go, and in a month return,\n And let success my praises earn,\n He who beyond tho month shall stay\n Will with his life the forfeit pay.'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Footnotes\n 面面面面面面面面面面面面面面面面1b:1b  Gandhamádana, Angad, Tára, Indrajánu,\n Rambha, Durmukha, Hanumán,\n Nala, Da mukha, S'arabha, Kumuda,\n Vahni.\n 面面面面面面面面面面面面面面面面2b:2b  Daityas and Dánavas are fiends and\n enemies of the Gods, life the Titans of\n Greek mythology.\n 372:1  I reduce the unwieldy numbers of the\n original to more modest figures.\n 372:2  Sarayú now Sarjú is the river on which\n Ayodhyá was built.\n 372:3  Kaus'iki is a river which flows through\n Behar, commonly called Kosi.\n 372:4  Bhagirath's daughter is Ganga or the\n Ganges.
