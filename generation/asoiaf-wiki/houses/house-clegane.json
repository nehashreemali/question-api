During one autumn year he saved Lord Tytos Lannister from a lioness, although he lost a leg and three dogs while doing so. Lord Tytos rewarded him with lands and a towerhouse. Ser Clegane's son was placed in Tytos's service as his squire.

Their sister died young under queer circumstances.[6] Gregor is known for his unspeakable cruelty; this is mirrored in the Mountain's men, who casually commit atrocities during their campaigns. Sandor was driven away by this behavior, taking service with House Lannister and refusing to take a knight's vows to avoid association with his elder.\n\nGregor was knighted by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the heir of King Aerys II Targaryen. During the Sack of King's Landing, Gregor murdered Rhaegar's son, the infant Prince Aegon Targaryen, before raping and murdering his mother and Rhaegar's bride, Princess Elia Martell.\n\nSandor Clegane, known as the Hound, accompanies the royal party to Winterfell when King Robert I Baratheon offers Lord Eddard Stark the position of Hand of the King. On the return journey, Sandor kills Mycah, the butcher's boy whom Prince Joffrey Baratheon claims struck him.\n\nDuring the Hand's tourney, Sandor defends Ser Loras Tyrell against his brother, Ser Gregor Clegane, when the Mountain tries to kill Loras for riding a mare in heat. In gratitude, Loras cedes the final round and the tourney purse to Sandor.\n\nLord Tywin Lannister sends Gregor to raid the riverlands, slaughtering the smallfolk of Sherrer, Wendish Town, and the Mummer's Ford. In retribution, Lord Beric Dondarrion is sent to kill Gregor, who ambushes Beric's party in a battle at the Mummer's Ford.
