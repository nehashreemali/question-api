  "content": "House Tyrell of Highgarden is one of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, being Lords Paramount of the Mander and the liege lords of the Reach. A large, wealthy house, its wealth is only surpassed among the Great Houses by House Lannister, and the Tyrells can field the greatest armies. Additionally, if they call the ships of the Redwyne fleet, the lords of the Shield Islands, and the coastal lords, they can command a navy that equals if not surpasses the royal fleet of King's Landing.\n\nHighgarden is an ancient seat of rule and the heart of chivalry in the Seven Kingdoms;[1] the Tyrells style themselves 'Defenders of the Marches' and 'High Marshals of the Reach', and traditionally, they have been Wardens of the South in addition to Lords Paramount of the Mander. Their sigil is a golden rose on a green field, and their words are \"Growing Strong\".[2] Members of the family tend to have curly brown hair[2][3][4] and brown eyes.[5][4]\n\nUnlike most other Great Houses, the Tyrells never ruled as kings.[5] Instead, they trace their line of descent through the female line to the legendary Garth the Gardener, the mythical first King of the Reach reigning in the Age of Heroes, and the son of the equally mythic Garth Greenhand.[6] Members of House Gardener, the ruling house of the Kingdom of the Reach, periodically intermarried with lower ranking houses of the Reach such as House Tyrell.[7]\n\nThe Tyrells served as stewards to House Gardener.[8] Ser Alester Tyrell, the founder of the house, was an Andal knight and adventurer who showed such prowess at arms that he was named the champion and sworn shield of King Gwayne V Gardener, the last of the Three Sage Kings.[8][7] Ser Alester's eldest son also became a notable knight, but died in a tourney. Alester's second son, Gareth, was of a more bookish bent and never achieved knighthood, choosing instead to serve as a royal steward. He and his son Leo performed their duties so well, the Gardeners made the office of High Steward hereditary. It is from Gareth that today’s Tyrells descend.[7]\n\nDuring the minority of King Garland VI Gardener, a member of House Tyrell ruled the Reach in his name as Regent.[7]\n\nWhen Lords Manderly and Peake instigated a civil war to see their respective wives, both daughters to the senile old King Garth X Gardener, succeed as Queen of the Reach, Ser Osmund Tyrell, the High Steward, led an alliance of twoscore houses to put down the rebels and reclaimed the ruins of Highgarden which had been sacked by a Dornish king and his raiders. Ser Osmund placed a second cousin of the late Garth X, who has been killed by the raiders, upon the new throne as King Mern VI Gardener.[8]\n\nRelying on the able counsel of Ser Osmund, and later Osmund's son Ser Robert Tyrell, and finally Robert's son Lorent Tyrell, King Mern ruled well, rebuilding Highgarden and doing much and more to restore the power of the Reach and House Gardener.[8] Mern VI was so pleased with them that he gave Ser Robert the hand of his youngest daughter in marriage, thereby allowing the following generations of Tyrells to claim decent from Garth Greenhand.[7] That was the first marriage between the two houses, and nine more unions followed in the passing centuries.[7]\n\nFollowing the defeat and death of King Mern IX Gardener and his other kin at the Field of Fire during Aegon's Conquest, Harlan Tyrell, hereditary high steward of the Reach, surrendered Highgarden to Aegon the Conqueror. As a reward, Harlan was granted the castle along with dominion of the Reach as Lord Paramount of the Mander. As Wardens of the South they frequently warred with the Dornishmen, who remained independent. Harlan disappeared in the Dornish sands during the First Dornish War.[9]\n\nDuring the reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, the Tyrells hosted the famed Tourney of the Field of Roses.[10]\n\nAs the Dance of the Dragons began, Lord Lyonel Tyrell was an infant, and his regent mother was judged likely to align the Reach with the House's \"overmighty\" bannermen, the Hightowers, and the greens.[11] However, House Tyrell  decided to take no part in the war.[12][7] The Tyrell bannermen, on the other hand, were split during the war, with men of the Reach fighting on both sides. Later Ser Ulf White attempted to claim Highgarden for himself, as House Tyrell had taken no part in the Dance and he believed they should be considered traitors.[13]\n\nWhen Daeron I Targaryen, the Young Dragon, attempted the conquest of Dorne, Lord Lyonel commanded the army that invaded via Prince's Pass. After the initial victory, Daeron appointed Lord Tyrell as governor of Dorne. Lord Tyrell liked Dornish women and one night he pulled the rope that would signal for a wench to come to his bed, and a hundred scorpions fell from the canopy instead. His death sparked new revolts, and the conquest was undone in a fortnight.[7][14]\n\nLord Leo \"Longthorn\" Tyrell participated in the tourney at Ashford Meadow, beginning the tourney as one of the champions. Both Prince Aegon Targaryen and Ser Duncan recognized him as a formidable opponent, one that Duncan would better avoid.[15]\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, House Tyrell stayed loyal to King Aerys II Targaryen. Lord Mace Tyrell's forces achieved victory against Lord Robert Baratheon at the Battle of Ashford. Mace likes to take credit for the success,[16][7][3][17] but it was the van under command of Lord Randyll Tarly that put Robert to flight.[3] Mace's cousin, Ser Quentin Tyrell, died in the battle.[18] Mace went on to besiege Storm's End[7] for almost a year.[19] He bent the knee to Lord Eddard Stark after King Aerys II Targaryen had been killed in the Sack of King's Landing.[20] The new King Robert I Baratheon accepted the Tyrells back into the king's peace.\n\nHouse Tyrell is among the houses that Viserys Targaryen believes will rise for him if he lands in Westeros.[21]\n\nSer Loras Tyrell resides at King's Landing with his own retinue.[22] Loras participates in the Hand's tourney, defeating Ser Gregor Clegane but yielding the final tilt to Sandor Clegane after the latter rescues him from Gregor's wrath.[23] He asks the honor of taking the place of the injured Hand of the King, Lord Eddard Stark, in leading a force to bring Gregor to justice for pillaging the riverlands, but Eddard refuses him.[24]\n\nWhen King Robert I Baratheon lays dying, Loras flees King's Landing with Lord Renly Baratheon after Eddard rebuffs Renly's request for his aid in taking Robert's children into custody.[25] After Robert's death, the new king, Joffrey I Baratheon, has Loras, Lord Mace Tyrell, his brothers (of which he has none), uncles, and other two sons Willas and Garlan named among the nobles whom must swear fealty to him or be attainted as traitors.[26] However, no Tyrell travels to King's Landing. Instead, Joffrey's uncle Renly claims the Iron Throne and marries Mace's daughter Margaery at Highgarden.[27]\n\nSer Loras Tyrell is named the Lord Commander of Renly Baratheon's own bodyguards, the Rainbow Guard, while Lord Mace Tyrell is named Renly's Hand of the King.[28] Most of the Tyrell bannermen join them in supporting Renly, giving him the strongest army in the War of the Five Kings.\n\nMace Tyrell closes off the roseroad, resulting in famine in King's Landing.[29]\n\nRenly is murdered at Storm's End. When he sees his lover's body, an enraged Loras kills three of Renly's guards, including Emmon Cuy and Robar Royce, two knights of the Rainbow Guard.[30] Loras returns to Bitterbridge, where Renly's remaining sixty thousand men are located, with some four thousand of Renly's knights.[30] In King's Landing, the small council attempts to make an alliance with the Tyrells by offering to marry Joffrey I Baratheon to Lady Margaery Tyrell. Petyr Baelish, representing Joffrey,[30] travels to Bitterbridge and Highgarden[31] to negotiate the allegiance of the Tyrells. Riders are sent north to warn Lord Tywin Lannister of Stannis's threat to the capital.[32]\n\nThe new alliance between House Tyrell and House Lannister joins forces to battle Stannis Baratheon in the Battle of the Blackwater at King's Landing. Mace and two sons, Garlan and Loras, await Lord Tywin Lannister and his army at Tumbler's Falls. From there, they float down the Blackwater Rush upon a fleet of barges, disembarking half a day's ride from King's Landing.[32] They arrive at the city at dusk,[33] taking Stannis's army from the rear. Lord Tyrell commands the left,[34] and Ser Garlan the vanguard.[4] The van plunges through Stannis's army, while Garlan dresses in the recognizable green armor of the deceased Renly Baratheon, which causes Renly's former supporters, convinced Renly has risen from the grave, to abandon Stannis.[34]\n\nMace is granted a seat on the small council as a reward for his participation in the battle.[35] His son Loras is named to Joffrey's Kingsguard, and his daughter Margaery is betrothed to Joffrey.[35]\n\nThe Tyrells's lack of a royal history, unlike other great houses, causes them to seek more status and power. Prior to Margaery's arrival in King's Landing, wagons of food are sent to the capital for the starving population in her name. When she arrives in the city, she is greeting by cheering crowds. Margaery and her grandmother, Lady Olenna, inquire with Sansa Stark about King Joffrey I Baratheon's nature, and learn how both Joffrey and his mother Cersei have been treating the Stark girl. When Sansa expresses fear that Margaery will refuse the marriage due to the revelation, Margaery and Olenna confide in Sansa that Mace is determined to see Margaery become a queen, while simply calling Joffrey's nature \"a pity\". Margaery and Olenna suggest to Sansa that she travel to Highgarden after Margaery's wedding, secretly plotting to marry Sansa to Margaery's eldest brother, Willas.[5] Margaery and her ladies take Sansa in, taking her hawking, doing needlework with her, and other such pastimes.[36]\n\nSer Garlan Tyrell is granted the titles, lands and incomes of House Florent, including lordship of Brightwater Keep.[3] Mace is named master of ships.[37]\n\nOn the first day of 300 AC, Margaery marries King Joffrey at the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing.[38] During the wedding feast, however, Joffrey dies from poison.[38] Lord Petyr Baelish later reveals to Sansa that Joffrey's death was arranged by himself and Lady Olenna.[31] When Joffrey's uncle, Tyrion Lannister, is falsely accused of the king's murder, Mace serves as one of the judges at his trial.[14] Mace, unaware of his mother Olenna's involvement in the poisoning, is convinced of Tyrion's guilt, and wants him dead, as Margaery had been drinking from the same cup of wine as Joffrey.[14]\n\nLoras attempts to attack Brienne of Tarth, whom he holds responsible for Renly Baratheon's death, when she arrives in King's Landing.[39] To protect her, Ser Jaime Lannister has her arrested.[39] He later discusses Renly's death with Loras and commands Loras to speak with Brienne about what happened,[4] which he does.[40]\n\nAfter Joffrey's death, the Tyrells insist that Margaery is wed to his younger brother Tommen I, the new king.[39][40] Lord Tywin Lannister suggests offering Jaime as a husband for Margaery instead, intending to have Jaime abdicate his place in the Kingsguard. Jaime refuses.[39] Tywin eventually agrees to betroth Tommen to Margaery.[41]\n\nAfter the death of Lord Tywin Lannister, Tommen's Hand of the King, Dowager Queen Cersei Lannister takes over the regency. Cersei is mistrustful of the Tyrells, feeling they overreach themselves.[42] She suspects that they are trying to seize control of the kingdom, and her suspicion grows when Qyburn finds a Gardener coin in the cell where Tyrion Lannister had been held before his escape.[42] Qyburn tells her that the coin is similar to the ones Lady Olenna Tyrell carries with her when traveling, causing Cersei to wrongfully suspect a Tyrell involvement in Tyrion's escape.[43] Cersei commences a campaign of intrigue to remove Tyrells in King's Landing from positions of influence and authority, including Margaery and her brother Loras, a knight of the Kingsguard.[44]\n\nMace refuses to leave King's Landing until Margaery and Tommen are wed.[45] As such, Margaery marries King Tommen I Baratheon in a small ceremony in the Red Keep's royal sept, followed by a small feast.[46] His daughter now wed, Mace leaves King's Landing with Lord Mathis Rowan and half of the Tyrell strength to take Storm's End from Ser Gilbert Farring, while Ser Garlan takes the other half of the Tyrell forces back to the Reach to claim Brightwater Keep.[46] Lord Paxter Redwyne uses the Redwyne fleet to transport Lannister soldiers to Dragonstone, which is held by Rolland Storm.[43]\n\nTaena of Myr claims to the queen regent that Margaery is paying Cersei's maid Senelle to spy on Cersei for her.[46] Cersei asks Margaery leave to take Taena on as her own companion, and uses Taena to feed Margaery only the information she wants her to know, with most of it being untrue. Additionally, Taena informs Cersei of everything Margaery does.[43]\n\nMargaery begins to instruct Tommen on his kingship, telling him he should sit on the Iron Throne and attend the small council meetings,[47] which earns her further hatred of Cersei, who plans to rule herself until Tommen comes of age.[44] Cersei becomes convinced that Margaery is attempting to steal Tommen from her.[48] Meanwhile, Margaery does much to gain favor with the residents of King's Landing by visiting local markets to buy fresh fruits, bread, and fish, ordering dresses from local seamstresses, and making great public shows of charity.[48]\n\nAfter the taking of the Shields by the ironborn, Margaery insists that her father and his forces be allowed to return to the Reach, thereby abandoning the siege of Storm's End, and is shocked when Cersei seems to lack understanding for the threat posed by the ironborn. Ser Loras asks permission to take command of the siege of Dragonstone from Lord Redwyne, so the Redwyne fleet is no longer needed at the island and can return to the Reach to face the ironborn.[49] Although Loras is successful in taking Dragonstone, he is severely injured.[47]\n\nIn order to get rid of Margaery, Cersei attempts to frame her for adultery and treason.[50] When Margaery does not respond to the advances of Cersei's agent, Ser Osney Kettleblack,[44][48] Cersei has him falsely confess to the High Sparrow that he had intercourse with Margaery and her cousins, Elinor and Megga Tyrell.[51] Margaery and her cousins are subsequently arrested by the Faith and confined in the Great Sept. When Septa Moelle reports at court that Margaery's maidenhead has been broken, Grand Maester Pycelle reveals how he provided Margaery with moon tea on several occasions (as per Cersei's instructions). While she is confined by the Faith, Margaery is visited by Cersei and scolds her for framing her. A mob forms in front of the Great Sept, calling out Margaery's name.[52]\n\nWhen he learns about his daughter's arrest, Lord Mace abandons the siege of Storm's End and marches most of his force back to King's Landing. His bannerman, Lord Randyll Tarly, leaves Maidenpool with his own army to give Margaery his aid.[52]\n\nThe evidence against Margaery and her cousins is weak. As such, the High Sparrow agrees to hand them over into the custody of Lord Randyll Tarly, who has arrived in King's Landing.[53] Lord Mace Tyrell arrives next with his force, and refuses to leave the city until Margaery's trial is over and she is declared innocent, despite the Golden Company having landed in the stormlands.[53] Margaery plans to let the Faith sit in judgement of her.[54] Ser Kevan Lannister, King Tommen I Baratheon's new regent, names Mace the Hand of the King, while Mace's bannermen Randyll Tarly and Paxter Redwyne are made masters of justiciar and lord admiral, respectively.[53]\n\nKevan wonders why Mace insists on having his army present when Margaery faces her accusers, if she is as innocent as Mace would have them all believe.[55]\n\nThe known Tyrells during the timespan of the events described in A Song of Ice and Fire are:\n\n\n## History\n\n\n\n## Kingdom of the Reach\n\n\nUnlike most other Great Houses, the Tyrells never ruled as kings.[5] Instead, they trace their line of descent through the female line to the legendary Garth the Gardener, the mythical first King of the Reach reigning in the Age of Heroes, and the son of the equally mythic Garth Greenhand.[6] Members of House Gardener, the ruling house of the Kingdom of the Reach, periodically intermarried with lower ranking houses of the Reach such as House Tyrell.[7]\n\nThe Tyrells served as stewards to House Gardener.[8] Ser Alester Tyrell, the founder of the house, was an Andal knight and adventurer who showed such prowess at arms that he was named the champion and sworn shield of King Gwayne V Gardener, the last of the Three Sage Kings.[8][7] Ser Alester's eldest son also became a notable knight, but died in a tourney.
