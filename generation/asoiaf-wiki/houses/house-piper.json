When Prince Aegon Targaryen rose against King Maegor I Targaryen, the host of Aegon and Rhaena gathered at Pinkmaiden Castle, the home of Melony's brother, Lord Jon Piper. Melony was killed in the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye in 43 AC.[8] Rhaena and her dragon, Dreamfyre, briefly stayed at Pinkmaiden with the Pipers in 51 AC.[10]\n\nLord Petyr Piper declared for the blacks during the Dance of the Dragons,[11] and the Pipers aided in the capture of Stone Hedge. Petyr knighted Pate of Longleaf after the Battle of the Red Fork.[12] Petyr and his favorite grandson died fighting westermen at the Battle at Acorn Hall.[13] Lord Stanton Piper succeeded him and led the remaining Piper forces to the Second Battle of Tumbleton, where he was burned to death alongside Lord Lyonel Deddings by Vermithor.[14]\n\nLord Piper's bailiff hanged Jack-Be-Lucky's father.[15]\n\nAn unnamed daughter of Lord Piper was the third wife of Lord Quellon Greyjoy.[16] They had one son, Robin Greyjoy. When her stepson, Urrigon Greyjoy, lost half his hand during the finger dance, she had her maester try to sew back the missing fingers, instead of sealing the wound with fire and seawater.
