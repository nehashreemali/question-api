Barbrey instead wed Willam Dustin, Lord of Barrowton. After Brandon and Rickard were killed by King Aerys II Targaryen, Lord Eddard Stark wed Catelyn instead of Barbrey.[9] Lord Dustin and Ser Mark Ryswell died fighting beside Eddard at the tower of joy in the aftermath of Robert's Rebellion.[10]\n\nSpearmen from the Rills compose part of the force that  Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, leaves under command of Ronnel Stout and Ser Kyle Condon in the aftermath of the fighting at the fords of the Trident.[11]\n\nMaester Aemon sends a raven to the Rills in a plea for help to defend Castle Black from the wildlings.[12]\n\nThe small council of King Tommen I Baratheon hears that Umbers and Ryswells are joining Ramsay Bolton for the siege of Moat Cailin.[13]\n\nThe Ryswells and Dustins are the first to declare for House Bolton when Lord Roose is named Warden of the North.
