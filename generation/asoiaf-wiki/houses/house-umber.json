The Umber sigil is a roaring giant, brown-haired and wearing a skin, with broken silver chains, on flame-red.[3] According to a semi-canon source, their house words are \"Death Before Chains\".[4]\n\nUmbers can be huge[5][6] and boisterous.[7][8] They often have thick beards and long hair.[9]\n\nAlthough the Umbers deny it, Roose Bolton claims they still practice the tradition of the lord's right to the first night, which was banned during the reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen.[10]\n\nThe Umbers control land along the Bay of Seals, south of the New Gift and extending west to the kingsroad. Their lands include the northern Last River and the Lonely Hills. The kingsroad runs along the western marches of Umber territory for a hundred leagues.[11] Most of their land is east of the kingsroad, but the Umbers graze their sheep in the high meadows of the northern mountains in summer.[12]\n\nThe Umbers control forests of tall pine and old oak.[7]\n\nHouse Umber is an ancient house who once ruled as First Men kings. After many struggles, the Umbers were reduced from royals to vassals of House Stark, the Kings of Winter.[13] Amongst other possibilities, the Night's King is rumored to have been an Umber.[14]\n\nThe Umbers joined the Starks in defeating Gendel and Gorne, brother Kings-Beyond-the-Wall,[15] three thousand years ago.[16]\n\nQueen Alysanne Targaryen and Silverwing visited the Umbers at the Last Hearth in 58 AC.[17]\n\nLord Harmond Umber helped Lord Willam and Artos Stark defeat King Raymun Redbeard in a battle at Long Lake.[18] Lord Greatjon Umber's cousin, the daughter of Mors Umber, was carried off in a wildling raid.[11]\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, the Umbers followed Lord Eddard Stark to war, with Mors's sons dying at the Battle of the Trident.[11]\n\nAfter Lord Eddard Stark's arrest in King's Landing, House Umber answers Robb Stark's call to arms, with Umber men led by the Greatjon following him south, leaving his uncles Mors Crowfood and Hother Whoresbane in command at the Last Hearth. Despite an initial row at Winterfell, the Greatjon becomes one of Robb's strongest supporters and fiercest battle commanders.[19] Lord Umber's eldest son, the Smalljon, rides as one of Robb's personal guard.[20]\n\nWhen the Stark host quarters at Moat Cailin on their march south, the Last Hearth men garrison in the Children's Tower.[21] During the battle in the Whispering Wood, the Greatjon has an independent command,[20] and in the subsequent Battle of the Camps he rides in from the west with the Mallisters and sets fire to the Lannister siege towers.[22]\n\nFollowing the death of Ned Stark, House Umber supports Robb as his heir, with the Greatjon proclaiming him the King in the North while they are at Riverrun.[23]\n\nThe Umber men in the south accompany King Robb on his campaign in the westerlands. The Greatjon captures several gold mines after the Battle of Oxcross,[24] and the Smalljon leads men scaling the walls during the storming of the Crag.[25]\n\nLord Umber's uncles attend the harvest feast at Winterfell. Hother requests ships to fight wildlings in the Bay of Seals, and is told to work with Lord Wyman Manderly to build a fleet. Mors puts himself forward as a match for the widowed Lady Donella Hornwood, but is rejected.[7]\n\nAfter Theon Greyjoy leads the capture of Winterfell by ironborn, he tells his sister Asha that the Umbers are gathering beyond the Last River to help liberate the Stark seat.[26] Theon does not see any Umbers in the army of Ser Rodrik Cassel prior to the battle at Winterfell, however.[27]\n\nThe Greatjon and the Smalljon return with King Robb Stark's army to the riverlands from the westerlands. Lord Umber and his men subdue Lord Rickard Karstark after he murders two captive Lannister squires, Willem Lannister and Tion Frey, at Riverrun, with two Umber men being wounded in the process. The Greatjon punches Rickard when the other bannerman calls Robb \"boy\", and hangs the other seven Karhold men who took part.[9]\n\nThe Greatjon leads Robb's van during the journey from Riverrun to the Twins for the wedding of Lord Edmure Tully to Roslin Frey.[28] At the Red Wedding, the Greatjon becomes drunk, competing with Ser Whalen Frey and Merrett Frey. It takes eight men to subdue him, of whom he kills one, injures two others, and bites half an ear off Ser Leslyn Haigh.[29] The Greatjon is captured and imprisoned at the Twins, and his heir, the Smalljon, is murdered by Bolton or Karstark men while trying to protect Robb.[30] It is unknown who the current heir is.\n\nMaester Aemon sends a raven to the Last Hearth in a plea for help to defend Castle Black from wildlings.[31]\n\nQueen Regent Cersei Lannister informs the small council of King Tommen I Baratheon that Umbers have joined Ramsay Bolton in the effort to remove ironborn from Moat Cailin. Ramsay's father, Lord Roose Bolton, has been named Warden of the North in House Stark's stead.[32]\n\nAfter resolving the siege of Riverrun, Ser Jaime Lannister informs Ser Walder Rivers that Tommen requires that House Frey relinquish all prisoners taken in the Red Wedding.[33]\n\nWith the Greatjon still imprisoned at the Twins,[34] Hother Whoresbane leads half the remaining Umber men under the Bolton banner, although Roose considers them untrustworthy.[35] Mors Crowfood has joined the cause of Stannis Baratheon, who is liberating the north from Bolton and Greyjoy alike.[36] Mors makes it clear that Umber will not fight Umber for any cause.[11]\n\nHother leads three hundred spears and a hundred archers south to Moat Cailin.[37] He later commands the Umber contingent at Winterfell for the wedding of Ramsay Bolton to \"Arya Stark\" (actually Jeyne Poole).[38]\n\nThe Umber men with Mors camp outside of Winterfell and blow horns to disorient Roose's forces. After they escape from Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy and Jeyne are brought by Mors to the crofters' village.[36]\n\nTheon reveals to Stannis that Ser Aenys Frey was killed when Frey forces rode into pits dug by Mors Crowfood's men.
