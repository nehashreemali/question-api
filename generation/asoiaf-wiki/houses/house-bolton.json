  "content": "House Bolton of the Dreadfort is a noble house from the Dreadfort in the north. They are an old line descended from the First Men and dating back to the Age of Heroes.[1][2]\n\nThe Bolton sigil is a red flayed man, on pale pink spotted with red blood drops.[3][4][5][6][7][8] According to George R. R. Martin, their words are \"Our Blades Are Sharp\".[9] According to the Bolton servant \"Reek\", Lord Roose Bolton believes \"a naked man has few secrets, but a flayed man has none\".[10]\n\nThe Boltons are known for their historical practice of flaying their enemies,[11] and they are said to hang the skins of their enemies in a room of the Dreadfort.[3] The family has a reputation for being dishonorable,[12] treacherous,[13] cruel,[14][13] and cunning.[14]\n\nBoltons use pink sealing wax for their messages.[15][16] Ramsay, the Bastard of Bolton, has written in blood instead of maesters' ink.[15][16]\n\nThe Boltons are an ancient and powerful house of the north who once ruled as Red Kings from the Dreadfort, with their land reaching from the Last River and the White Knife to the Sheepshead Hills.[1] It has been suggested that the legendary Night's King was a Bolton.[17] Some Red Kings allied with Marsh Kings to defend against southron invaders.[1]\n\nThe Boltons have a sinister reputation[1] because of their tradition of flaying their enemies,[11][18] with the skins then hung in a room of the Dreadfort.[3] After the Long Night, the Red Kings were bitter rivals of the Kings of Winter, the Starks of Winterfell. The Boltons achieved some successes against the Starks, with Kings Royce II and Royce IV burning Winterfell.[1] According to rumor, some Boltons wore the flayed skins of Stark princes and lords, such as the son of Bael the Bard,[19] as cloaks[1] during the Age of Heroes.[2]\n\nThe last Red King, Rogar the Huntsman, submitted to Winterfell when the coming of the Andals to Westeros was beginning. King Theon Stark, the Hungry Wolf, and the Boltons defeated Argos Sevenstar and his Andals in the Battle of the Weeping Water.[1]\n\nThousands of years ago,[N 1] the Dreadfort rose in an unsuccessful rebellion with the Greystarks of the Wolf's Den against the Starks. The Boltons survived the rebellion, although the Greystarks did not.[14]\n\nThe Chronicles of Longsister state that during the Rape of the Three Sisters by the Kings of Winter, which occurred two thousand years ago,[20] Belthasar Bolton had a Pink Pavilion made from the flayed skins of a hundred Sistermen.[18]\n\nThe Boltons threatened Winterfell during the reign of King Edrick Snowbeard.[21] At some point unspecified centuries ago, the Boltons rebelled against the Starks. The Stark armies besieged the Dreadfort for two years before the Boltons capitulated to King Harlon Stark and dipped their banners once more.[22]\n\n\"A thousand years ago\",[N 2] the Boltons bent their knees to Winterfell and agreed to abandon their practice of flaying.[11] It is rumored the skins of their enemies hang in a room within the Dreadfort, however.[3]\n\nBarba Bolton attended the Maiden's Day Ball in King's Landing, but King Aegon III Targaryen chose to wed Daenaera Velaryon instead. Barba asked the Iron Throne for aid in feeding northmen during winter.[23]\n\nWhen Lord Eddard Stark called the banners of the north to fight in Robert's Rebellion, Lord Roose Bolton took up arms, fighting in the Battle of the Trident. Afterward, he advised Lord Robert Baratheon to slash the throat of Ser Barristan Selmy, a knight in the Kingsguard of King Aerys II Targaryen, but Robert instead sent for his maesters to treat the wounds of the legendary Barristan the Bold.[24]\n\nWhen Domeric Bolton, Roose's accomplished son and heir, learned that he had a bastard half brother, he rode up the Weeping Water to befriend Ramsay Snow. According to Lord Bolton, Domeric was then poisoned by Ramsay.[25] Now heirless, Roose brought Ramsay to the Dreadfort.[26]\n\nAfter the arrest of Lord Eddard Stark, Warden of the North, in King's Landing, Lord Roose Bolton responds to Robb Stark's calling of the banners to Winterfell. A Bolton man knifes a Cerwyn man at the Smoking Log in the winter town outside the castle. Roose and Robett Glover demand a command.[3]\n\nWhen the northern host splits at the Twins, Roose receives his wish, commanding an army of mostly infantry to engage Lord Tywin Lannister.[27] Lord Bolton hopes to catch Tywin unawares by forcing a night march, but the northmen are forced to retreat at the battle on the Green Fork.[28] Roose reforms his army at the mouth of the causeway.[29]\n\nRobb is able to relieve Riverrun, where he is proclaimed King in the North after the Battle of the Camps.[29]\n\nEncamped at the Twins,[30] Roose marries Walda Frey, a granddaughter of Lord Walder Frey.[31][32] Lord Bolton takes the ruby ford and the crossroads in the riverlands.[33][31]\n\nFollowing orders from Ser Edmure Tully, Roose and Ser Helman Tallhart march on Harrenhal.[31] Bolton is able to seize the fortress by making a deal with the Brave Companions within, and he is indirectly aided by Arya Stark and Jaqen H'ghar.[4] At Harrenhal, Roose unwittingly takes the incognito Arya as his cupbearer. He and the Freys under Ser Aenys learn of House Greyjoy's ironborn taking much of the north and of the Lannister-Tyrell victory over Stannis Baratheon in the Battle of the Blackwater. Roose orders Helman to first burn Darry and then join Robett Glover in attacking Duskendale in Robb's name.[34]\n\nMeanwhile, Roose's bastard son, Ramsay Snow, marries and kills Lady Donella Hornwood, taking the Hornwood lands for himself.[35][36] House Manderly responds with fighting in the Hornwood.[36] Ramsay then leads the Dreadfort men in betraying the northmen under Ser Rodrik Cassel in a battle at Winterfell. After dispersing Rodrik's host, Ramsay has his men burn Winterfell, capturing or slaughtering all within.[5]\n\nIn the aftermath of the sack of Winterfell, Bolton men search the kingsroad in the north for the missing Bran and Rickon Stark.[37]\n\nThe northern army sent by Roose into the crownlands is crushed in the battle at Duskendale.[38]\n\nWhen Ser Jaime Lannister is captured by the Brave Companions and brought to Harrenhal, Roose allows him to go on his way if he agrees to place all blame for the loss of his hand on the Brave Companions. Roose sends his captain, Steelshanks Walton, with two hundred men to secure Jaime's passage back to King's Landing.[32][39]\n\nThe same day that Jaime leaves Harrenhal, Roose rides north to attend the wedding of Edmure Tully, Lord of Riverrun, to Roslin Frey at the Twins. He watches as his rearguard under Ser Wylis Manderly is chewed up by Ser Gregor Clegane in the fighting at the fords of the Trident. Lord Bolton leaves six hundred men under the command of Ser Kyle Condon and Ronnel Stout to guard the Trident.[40]\n\nRoose arrives at the Twins with three thousand foot and five hundred horse, most of whom are Bolton or Karstark men.[41] Robb Stark, King in the North, intends for Roose to command the rearguard during his upcoming campaign against the ironborn-held Moat Cailin.[40]\n\nRoose's actions culminate with his personal killing of Robb at the Twins in the Red Wedding, which he planned with Lame Lothar Frey with the approval of Lords Walder Frey and Tywin Lannister.[7][42] House Bolton usurps House Stark, with Roose being named the new Warden of the North by the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, Ramsay Snow is granted a royal writ of legitimacy by King Tommen I Baratheon, becoming Ramsay Bolton.[43] Ramsay has been amusing himself with the torture of the captive Theon Greyjoy.[41]\n\nCersei Lannister, the regent for the young Tommen, relies on House Bolton to hold the north for the Iron Throne.[44] Her small council considers aiding the Boltons against House Greyjoy, the self-styled Kings of the Isles and the North, if Roose is able to defeat Stannis Baratheon.[45]\n\nThe Boltons' authority is contested by Stannis and several northern lords, and is begrudged by nearly all others.[12][22] Lord Roose's strongest supporters are his relatives of House Dustin and House Ryswell.[25]\n\nRoose's horse marches north along with two thousand men from the Twins. His passage is secured thanks to the forced efforts of Theon Greyjoy, whose will has been broken by Ramsay. At the siege of Moat Cailin, Theon is able to convince its ironborn garrison to surrender, and Ramsay has them flayed alive.[46] At Barrowton in the north, Roose instructs Ramsay to behave more discreetly, and arranges the marriage of Ramsay to \"Arya Stark\", who is actually Jeyne Poole, in order to secure dynastic legitimacy.[25]\n\nRamsay Bolton, the Lord of the Hornwood, weds \"Arya\" at Winterfell in the presence of several northern lords,[47] and he claims to be the Lord of Winterfell.[15][48] The Boltons and Freys quarter in Winterfell as the autumn snows fall, awaiting the march on Winterfell by King Stannis. While there, Roose deals with high tensions between the different factions, particularly between the Freys and Lord Wyman Manderly.[49] Theon manages to escape with Jeyne, much to Ramsay's chagrin.[50]\n\nAccording to a letter purportedly sent from Ramsay to Jon Snow, the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch at Castle Black, the Boltons have smashed Stannis's army.[51]\n\nTheon tells Stannis he expects that Ramsay will be marching on the crofters' village while Roose remains safe in Winterfell.[52]\n\nThe known Boltons during the timespan of the events described in A Song of Ice and Fire are:\n\nAfter Roose Bolton is raised to Warden of the North several houses swear fealty to their new overlord, not all willingly.\n\n\n## Culture\n\n\nThe Boltons are known for their historical practice of flaying their enemies,[11] and they are said to hang the skins of their enemies in a room of the Dreadfort.[3] The family has a reputation for being dishonorable,[12] treacherous,[13] cruel,[14][13] and cunning.[14]\n\nBoltons use pink sealing wax for their messages.[15][16] Ramsay, the Bastard of Bolton, has written in blood instead of maesters' ink.[15][16]\n\n\n## History\n\n\n\n## Red Kings\n\n\nThe Boltons are an ancient and powerful house of the north who once ruled as Red Kings from the Dreadfort, with their land reaching from the Last River and the White Knife to the Sheepshead Hills.[1] It has been suggested that the legendary Night's King was a Bolton.[17] Some Red Kings allied with Marsh Kings to defend against southron invaders.[1]\n\nThe Boltons have a sinister reputation[1] because of their tradition of flaying their enemies,[11][18] with the skins then hung in a room of the Dreadfort.[3] After the Long Night, the Red Kings were bitter rivals of the Kings of Winter, the Starks of Winterfell.
