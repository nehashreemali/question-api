They were married ten years, and she died after her third miscarriage.[10]\n\nEthan Glover, who was Brandon Stark's squire and went to King's Landing with him to challenge Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, was the only one of Brandon's companions to survive. Ethan later died at the tower of joy.[11]\n\nAfter getting indications that the Lannisters were involved in the murder attempt on Bran Stark, Lord Eddard Stark tells Catelyn Stark to send word to Ser Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover to raise a hundred bowmen and fortify Moat Cailin.[12]\n\nBran recognizes the mailed fist of the Glovers, silver on scarlet, among the northern banners that answer Robb Stark's call to Winterfell. Galbart's brother, Robett, demands the honor of battle command, though with a smile and a jest.[5] The brothers greet Catelyn when she joins Robb's army at Moat Cailin.[13] When Robb splits his forces at the Twins, Galbart stays with him,[14] while Robett is assigned to the army commanded by Lord Roose Bolton.[15]\n\nTyrion Lannister sees the mailed fist of the Glovers on the northern army he faces in the battle on the Green Fork.[16] Catelyn notices Galbart praying with Robb at the godswood of Riverrun after the victory at the Camps.[17]\n\nThe Glovers play a part in the succession of the Hornwood lands, as they are fostering Larence Snow, the bastard of Lord Halys Hornwood. When Robett and Galbart went south with Robb Stark, they left Robett's wife, Sybelle Glover, in charge of Deepwood Motte. When the castle's steward comes to Winterfell for the harvest feast, Bran realizes it is the steward, not Lady Glover, who is making the decisions at Deepwood.[18] Glover men play bladder and woodharp during the feast.[19]\n\nDuring Robb's campaign in the westerlands, Galbart and Lord Rickard Karstark raid along the coast of the Sunset Sea after the Battle of Oxcross.[20] Robett is held prisoner at Harrenhal, reportedly having been made prisoner of the Brave Companions.
