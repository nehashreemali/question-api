Lord Hoster Tully, the Lord Paramount of the Trident, rules over the riverlands from the Tully seat of Riverrun. Their sigil is a silver trout leaping on a striped field of blue and mud red, and their house words are \"Family, Duty, Honor.\"[1]\n\nMembers of House Tully tend to have fair skin[2] and blue eyes,[3][4][5] including deep blue.[4][6][7]\n\nTullys have had auburn (red-brown),[2][3][4][6][8] red,[9] and brown hair.[6]\n\nHouse Tully follows the Faith of the Seven and worships in a sept found inside their seat of Riverrun. The godswood of Riverrun is used for relaxation instead of religious purposes.[10]\n\nTully funeral customs decree that a deceased member is placed on a small boat. Men might be clad in their armor and surcoat, with a wooden sword and shield. They are placed on their cloak, among stones to make the boat heavy in the water, and driftwood, kindling and scraps of parchment to allow it to catch fire. In honor of the Faith, seven men are chosen to push the funeral boat to the water. Using a flaming arrow, the boat is lit afire in the Red Fork.[11]\n\nHouse Tully is an old noble house of First Men origin. Edmure Tully and his sons were allies of Tristifer IV Mudd, the King of the Rivers and the Hills, during the coming of the Andals to the riverlands, but the Tullys knelt to the Andal conqueror Armistead Vance after Tristifer's death. Ser Edmure's son, Axel Tully, received land at the confluence of the Red Fork and the Tumblestone, where he constructed Riverrun.[12]\n\nUnlike many Great Houses, the Tullys never ruled as kings, but held Riverrun for at least a thousand years as powerful vassals of those who did.[13] They often defended the western Trident from the Kings of the Rock.[12] Lord Elston Tully died supporting Lord Roderick Blackwood against King Humfrey I Teague. Lord Tommen Tully futilely supported Lady Agnes Blackwood against Harwyn Hoare, King of the Iron Islands, and Tommen's natural son Samwell Rivers was slain at the Tumblestone.[14]\n\nHouse Tully rose to prominence during Aegon's Conquest, when Lord Edmyn Tully led the rebel riverlords who deserted Harren Hoare, King of the Isles and the Rivers, and instead supported House Targaryen.[13] Following the burning of Harrenhal, Edmyn was rewarded with dominion over the riverlands by Aegon I Targaryen as the first Lord Paramount of the Trident.[15] Despite being their new liege lords, the Tullys fielded smaller armies than the Blackwoods, Brackens, Freys, and Vances. House Tully was also not as wealthy as the Mootons, nor considered as prestigious as the Mallisters.[9]\n\nOne of Edmyn's daughters married Lord Quenton Qoherys of Harrenhal, while Edmyn himself served two years as Hand of the King to Aegon the Conqueror, the first King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men.[16][12] King Aenys I Targaryen relied on the Tullys during the rebellion of Harren the Red, and King Maegor I Targaryen was supported by the Tullys and the Harroways against Prince Aegon Targaryen in the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye. The Tullys later supported Prince Jaehaerys Targaryen against Maegor.[12] Lord Prentys Tully served Jaehaerys I as master of laws, while his wife, Lady Lucinda Tully, led the household for Queen Alysanne Targaryen.[17]\n\nIn 101 AC during the Great Council, Lord Grover Tully spoke in favor of Prince Viserys Targaryen over Laenor Velaryon as the successor to Jaehaerys I.[12] During the Dance of the Dragons, the Tullys ruled over, in name at least, the quarrelsome riverlords.[18] The aged Lord Grover wanted to support the greens, but his grandson Elmo and great-grandson Kermit supported the blacks. Elmo led the riverlords to battle on the side of Rhaenyra during the Second Battle of Tumbleton. His grandfather died soon after, and Elmo himself followed his grandfather to the grave forty-nine days later. His young son Kermit led the Lads and slew Lord Borros Baratheon in the Battle of the Kingsroad.[12] Kermit's brother, Ser Oscar Tully, founded the Stormbreakers.[19] The Tullys and Blackwoods in particular were strengthened by northmen who married widows at so-called Widow Fairs and remained in the riverlands after the war.[19]\n\nThe Tullys were Targaryen loyalists during the Blackfyre Rebellions.[12] Lord Medgar Tully participated in the tourney at Ashford Meadow, where he challenged Ser Humfrey Hardyng in his first tilt but was defeated.[20] Two years later, during the reign of Aerys I Targaryen, there was a new Lord Tully, a boy of eight (in 211 AC). He was surrounded by women, indicating he had no brothers or uncles.[21]\n\nGiven the riverlands' geographic vulnerability, House Tully has often sought alliances in case of invasion. Lord Hoster Tully sought to wed his brother, Ser Brynden Tully, hero of the War of the Ninepenny Kings, to Bethany Redwyne, but Brynden would have none of it. During the years-long quarrel between the two, Brynden took the moniker \"Blackfish\".[22]\n\nHoster also took a ward, Petyr Baelish, an obscure lordling from the Fingers. Petyr fell in love with Lord Tully's eldest daughter, Catelyn, but was rebuffed. As consolation he took the virginity of Lysa, Hoster's other daughter. Hoster forbade Petyr from marrying either of his daughters due to his low standing, and ordered Lysa to drink moon tea to prevent her from bearing Petyr's child.[23] Hoster accepted an offer from Lord Tywin Lannister to wed Ser Jaime Lannister to Lysa, but Jaime unexpectedly joined the Kingsguard before this could occur.[24] Hoster rebuffed Tywin's offer of his dwarf younger son, Tyrion, as a replacement.[25] Other prospects existed from House Brax and others, but Hoster finally accepted an offer from Lord Rickard Stark that Catelyn be betrothed to Brandon Stark, heir to Winterfell. Petyr dueled Brandon for Catelyn's favor, resulting in his exile from Riverrun.[26]\n\nThe executions of Brandon and Rickard by King Aerys II Targaryen complicated matters, but Lord Hoster threw in with the ensuing rebellion of Lord Robert Baratheon against Targaryen rule, arranging for Catelyn to wed Brandon's brother, Lord Eddard Stark, and for Lysa to marry Lord Jon Arryn. The riverlands was a major theater in Robert's Rebellion, and Lord Hoster fought in the Battle of the Bells.[27] His control over his bannermen was not complete, however, as the Darrys, Mootons, and Rygers supported the Targaryens.[28] Hoster also crushed the royalist Goodbrooks.[29] House Frey delayed their contribution until after the decisive Battle of the Trident, itself fought in the riverlands. After the war, the Tully girls rode off to their husbands' seats, with Ser Brynden accompanying Lysa to the Vale of Arryn to serve as Knight of the Gate.[4]\n\nLord Hoster Tully is an old man, afflicted with an illness which has left him a bed-ridden invalid. His responsibilities fall on his son and heir, Ser Edmure Tully.[26]\n\nAfter the unexpected death of her husband, Lord Jon Arryn, Lysa sends a coded message from the Eyrie to Winterfell warning her sister, Catelyn, of the Lannisters.[30] Catelyn later sails to King's Landing to speak with her husband, Lord Eddard Stark, now Hand of the King to Robert I Baratheon, about an attempt on their son Bran's life. Petyr Baelish, the master of coin, tells Catelyn that the Valyrian steel dagger used by the catspaw belonged to Tyrion Lannister.[1]\n\nWhile returning to Winterfell, Catelyn captures Tyrion at the crossroads inn[28] and brings him to her sister at the Eyrie for trial.[4] Lysa's champion, Ser Vardis Egen, loses a trial by combat to Bronn, allowing Tyrion to go free.[26]\n\nIn response to Catelyn's capture of his son, Lord Tywin Lannister calls his banners to Casterly Rock. Edmure responds by sending Lord Vance and Lord Clement Piper to guard the pass below the Golden Tooth.[26] Tywin sends Ser Gregor Clegane to raid the riverlands[31] and hopefully draw Lord Stark from King's Landing.[32] Instead of retaliating, Hoster sends Ser Raymun Darry, Ser Marq Piper, and Ser Karyl Vance with survivors of the raids to beseech the Iron Throne for justice. Eddard sends Lord Beric Dondarrion to slay Gregor.[31] Instead of concentrating his strength, Edmure has men guard the various villages and holdfasts near the border with the westerlands.[31]\n\nAfter King Robert dies from being gored in the kingswood,[33] Tywin's son, Ser Jaime Lannister, defeats Lords Vance and Piper in a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth.[34] Jaime goes on to capture Edmure in a battle under the walls of Riverrun, routing his host and besieging the Tully seat.[35] Lord Dondarrion is defeated at the Mummer's Ford,[36] and Tywin and his brother, Ser Kevan Lannister, march on the castles of the riverlords.[35]\n\nRobert's heir, King Joffrey I Baratheon, names Lord Hoster, Ser Edmure, and Ser Brynden Tully among the nobles who must swear fealty to him or be declared traitors, forfeiting their lands and titles.[37]\n\nLysa refuses to commit the Vale's forces against the Lannisters.[36] Brynden the Blackfish, disgusted by her behavior, resigns as Knight of the Gate and decides to join Catelyn's son, Robb Stark, at Moat Cailin.[36] Brynden commands the party of Tully men who draw Jaime out of his encampment at Riverrun, and Robb captures the Kingslayer during the battle in the Whispering Wood.[38] Robb then breaks the siege of Riverrun with an ambitious surprise attack led by Brynden. Lord Tytos Blackwood, commanding the garrison in Riverrun, leads a sortie against the Lannister rear and rescues Edmure.[39] After the Battle of the Camps, in the Great Hall of Riverrun, the riverlords and northmen proclaim Robb King in the North.[40]\n\nSer Brynden reconciles with his dying brother Hoster[5] before riding off with Robb, King of the Trident, in his westerlands campaign.[41]\n\nCatelyn rides south to treat with Renly Baratheon at Bitterbridge. Renly insists upon receiving homage from Robb,[42] but the claimant to the Iron Throne is killed at Storm's End.[43]\n\nTully guardsmen prevent the plot to free Jaime Lannister from Riverrun's dungeon.[44][41]\n\nCatelyn returns to Riverrun, where Ser Edmure remained to guard Robb's rear. He takes in smallfolk in an effort to guard them from Lannister raiders, but this reduces Riverrun's stores.[41] In the Battle of the Fords, Edmure leads the riverlords in stopping Tywin's army from crossing the Red Fork.[45]\n\nAfter she hears of the supposed deaths of two of her sons, Bran and Rickon, at Winterfell, Catelyn releases Jaime from captivity in Riverrun.[46]\n\nFor his service allying House Tyrell with the Lannisters and House Baratheon of King's Landing, Lord Petyr Baelish is named Lord Paramount of the Trident by King Joffrey after the Battle of the Blackwater. According to the Iron Throne, Petyr replaces the rebellious Hoster as liege lord of the riverlands.[47]\n\nBecause Catelyn tasked Brienne of Tarth with bringing Jaime to King's Landing in an effort to free her daughters, Sansa and Arya,[48] she is placed under house arrest within Riverrun.[49]\n\nAfter the storming of the Crag, Robb weds Jeyne Westerling, a lesser Lannister vassal, thereby breaking his marriage contract with House Frey. When they return to Riverrun, Robb and Brynden tell Edmure that his victory in the Battle of the Fords unwittingly foiled Robb's strategy to trap Tywin in the west.[50]\n\nIn his last weeks, Lord Hoster slips into delirium, and recalls with regret his order for Lysa to abort Petyr Baelish's child.[49] Edmure and Catelyn are with him as his life ends, but their calls for Lysa to attend go unanswered. On Hoster's death, Edmure becomes Lord of Riverrun in title as well as fact. In accordance with traditional Tully funeral rites, Hoster's body is sent in a boat down the river by seven pallbearing bannermen, and the boat is set alight by a flaming arrow shot by his heir, although the Blackfish has to step in for Edmure.[11]\n\nTo atone for disrupting Robb's plans for Tywin, Edmure agrees to marry a Frey in Robb's stead.[11] The Blackfish is named Warden of the Southern Marches and holds Riverrun while the others march north.[51]\n\nWhile at the Twins for Edmure's marriage to Roslin Frey, the Tullys and Starks are betrayed by the Freys and the Boltons in the Red Wedding. Catelyn, Robb, and many others are murdered under guest right.[52] In mockery of the Tully funeral customs, Catelyn's body is thrown naked from the castle walls into the Green Fork.[53]\n\nLord Edmure is captured by the Freys and House Tully is attainted and stripped of its lands, titles, and incomes. The lordship of Riverrun and its associated lands and incomes are given to the newly-established House Frey of Riverrun, though House Tully's status as overlords of the riverlands has already passed to their former ward, Petyr Baelish, now Lord of Harrenhal.[54] Ser Brynden is besieged by Freys at Riverrun, one of the last strongholds loyal to House Stark in the south.[55]\n\nIn the aftermath of Joffrey's death, Sansa Stark flees King's Landing with the aid of Petyr. Lysa travels to Petyr's tower in the Fingers and marries him there.[56] After a confrontation with Sansa at the Eyrie, Lysa is thrown through the Moon Door to her death by Petyr.[23]\n\nCatelyn's corpse is recovered from the Green Fork by a wolf.[57] The resurrected Catelyn takes over the brotherhood without banners and has them hang Petyr Frey and his great half-uncle, Merrett Frey, at Oldstones.[58]\n\nDuring the siege of Riverrun, Brynden the Blackfish withstands daily threats from Ser Ryman Frey that Edmure will be hanged.[8] Once Ser Jaime Lannister arrives, he is unable to convince Brynden to yield the castle. Jaime instead threatens Edmure with sending rivermen against Riverrun and using a trebuchet to throw the pregnant Roslin's child into Riverrun once it is born.[59] Edmure convinces Brynden to yield Riverrun, although the Blackfish escapes to parts unknown. Edmure is to be held in genteel captivity at Casterly Rock, with his wife Roslin slated to join him after she gives birth.[60]\n\nThoros of Myr reveals that the corpse of Catelyn, now called Lady Stoneheart, received the last kiss from the outlaw lord Beric Dondarrion. She has gone on a campaign of vengeance, killing anyone she finds associated with the Red Wedding.[61] Her outlaws capture Brienne of Tarth and threaten her with hanging.[62]\n\nLord Tytos Blackwood is the last of the riverlords to still fly the banners of Houses Stark and Tully. Jaime negotiates the end of the siege of Raventree, and Tytos claims he has no knowledge of Brynden's whereabouts.[63]\n\nThe known Tullys during the timespan of the events described in A Song of Ice and Fire are:\n\n\n## Culture\n\n\n\n## Traits\n\n\nMembers of House Tully tend to have fair skin[2] and blue eyes,[3][4][5] including deep blue.[4][6][7]\n\nTullys have had auburn (red-brown),[2][3][4][6][8] red,[9] and brown hair.[6]\n\n\n## Customs\n\n\nHouse Tully follows the Faith of the Seven and worships in a sept found inside their seat of Riverrun.
