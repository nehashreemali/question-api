  "content": "House Westerling of the Crag is a noble house from the Crag in the northwestern westerlands. They are sworn to House Lannister of Casterly Rock, and are considered among their principal bannermen.[4] Their sigil is six seashells, white on sand.[5][6] According to semi-canon sources, their words are \"Honor, not Honors\".[7]\n\nThe Westerlings are an ancient and proud house, dating back to the days of the First Men.[5][3] They sometimes wed the Kings of the Rock, House Lannister of Casterly Rock.[5]\n\nWhen the young Prince Aegon Targaryen rallied forces against his uncle, King Maegor I Targaryen, who had seized the crown for himself, House Westerling answered the call and joined his armies.[8] After the death of her husband, Lord Alyn Tarbeck, in the conflict that ensued, Jeyne Westerling was forced to marry King Maegor I Targaryen, becoming one of his Black Brides.[9] Following Maegor's death, House Westerling was among the houses that the Dowager Queen Alyssa preferred to seek a match for her son, the young King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. Westerling, along with Houses Vance, Piper, and Corbay, had fought and died for Jaehaerys' elder brother Aegon against Maegor and that loyalty should be rewarded.[10]\n\nSer Harrold Westerling was asked to join the Kingsguard under Viserys I Targaryen, and he rose to the position of Lord Commander.[11][12] After the Dance of the Dragons, Lord Roland Westerling was one of the original members of the council of seven during the regency of Aegon III.[13]\n\nSer Ormond Westerling participated in the tourney at Ashford Meadow in 209 AC.[14] The Westerling arms were spotted by Ser Duncan the Tall among the gathered heraldry.[15]\n\nAccording to a semi-canon source, the Westerlings supported Ser Tywin Lannister when he suppressed the Reyne-Tarbeck rebellion.[16]\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, Ser Elys Westerling participated in the Sack of King's Landing. Elys witnessed the aftermath of King Aerys II Targaryen's death at the hands of Ser Jaime Lannister.[17]\n\nThe Westerlings' fortunes have faltered over the years, with lands and mines being sold until the Westerlings were reduced to little wealth and influence. They now scarcely have the funds to maintain the Crag, which is now more ruin than stronghold, and they are regarded as having more pride than power.[5] Lord Gawen Westerling wed Sybell of House Spicer, a wealthy house, but one of lowborn origins.[18] This marriage is said to have somewhat sordid origins,[19] and Gawen is rumored to have been entrapped into the marriage.[20][18] Gawen offered his daughter Jeyne as a possible match for Willem or Martyn Lannister, but he was turned down by Ser Kevan Lannister because of her \"doubtful blood\", as her maternal great-grandfather from House Spicer was a mere trader in spices, and her maternal great-grandmother was a maegi from Essos.[18]\n\nLord Gawen Westerling is captured by Lord Jason Mallister in the battle in the Whispering Wood.[21][5]\n\nGawen is held at Seagard during his imprisonment.[1]\n\nAround the time of the Battle of the Fords, Robb Stark, King in the North, and his forces in the westerlands march on the Crag.[22]\n\nSer Rolph Spicer, Gawen's brother-by-law and castellan of the Crag, yields to Robb during the storming of the Crag. Rolph and his sister, Gawen's wife Lady Sybell, discreetly negotiate with their liege, Lord Tywin Lannister, in return for promises of worthy marriages for Sybell's daughters, Jeyne and Eleyna.[23] Rolph and Sybell maneuver Jeyne into comforting Robb, who was wounded by an arrow.[24] After sleeping with Jeyne, Robb chooses to wed her to save her from dishonor. Gawen is freed from Seagard after his daughter marries the King in the North, although they wed without his consent. Rollam Westerling becomes Robb's squire, and Ser Raynald Westerling joins his retinue. When House Westerling joins House Stark in the War of the Five Kings, they bring fifty men, of whom only twelve are knights.[5] Sybell provides a posset to Jeyne, claiming it will make her fertile.[25]\n\nRobb's marriage with Jeyne breaks his alliance with House Frey, as he had promised to marry a daughter of Lord Walder Frey.[5] Sybell, Jeyne, Eleyna, and Rollam remain at Riverrun when Robb departs to the Twins for the wedding of Lord Edmure Tully to Roslin Frey,[26] while Raynald accompanies the king as the royal banner-bearer. Robb is murdered by the Freys and Boltons in the Red Wedding.[27] Raynald releases Grey Wind from the stables, allowing Robb's direwolf a fighting chance during the massacre.[28] Afterwards, Raynald's whereabouts are unknown.\n\nAfter the Red Wedding, the Westerlings are pardoned by King Tommen I Baratheon, and welcomed back into the king's peace. Rolph Spicer is named Lord of Castamere.[29]\n\nDuring the siege of Riverrun, Gawen expresses to Ser Daven Lannister his concern for his family within the castle.[30] Ser Brynden Tully refuses the offer of Ser Jaime Lannister to exchange Ser Edmure Tully for the besieged Westerlings.[31] After the end of the siege is negotiated, Sybell tells Jaime of his father Tywin's plan to wed Raynald to a bride from Casterly Rock. Jaime supposes the bride to be his bastard cousin Joy Hill, not knowing Tywin had already planned to wed her to a Walder Frey's natural son,[32] and Sybell is upset about it, not wanting a bastard wife for Raynald. Sybell reveals that she took measures to prevent Jeyne from becoming pregnant with Robb's child. She also reveals that Raynald knew nothing of their plans, and if Sybell had known what was to happen at the wedding, she would not have allowed him to attend. She believes him to be a captive at the Twins, and Jaime promises to make inquiries and pay for his ransom if need be.[23]\n\nAfter the Westerlings depart Riverrun for their home in the westerlands, Edwyn Frey informs Jaime that the wounded Raynald is believed dead.
