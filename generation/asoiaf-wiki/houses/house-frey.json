  "content": "House Frey of the Crossing is a noble house of the riverlands. Their main seat is the Twins, a pair of castles on each bank of the northern Green Fork of the Trident that serves as a vital bridge across the river. The lord of the house is called the Lord of the Crossing.[4] Their sigil is two blue towers united by a bridge on silver-grey, representing the Twins.[4] Their house words are not mentioned in the books.[N 1]\n\nThe strategic location of the Twins has allowed the house to become quite wealthy,[5] and House Frey rules over wider domains and can call upon more soldiers than their liege lords, House Tully of Riverrun.[6] Under their current lord, Walder Frey, the family has continued to grow in both size and power, and they are now the most powerful bannermen of the Tullys.[7]\n\nMany current Freys share the weaselly[4][8][9][3] or stoatish[10] appearance of their common ancestor, Lord Walder.[4]  According to Haldon Halfmaester, the Freys are renowned for treachery and cruelty.[11]\n\nLord of the crossing is a game played at the Twins by Freys.[12]\n\nThe Freys do not like their northern neighbors, the crannogmen of the Neck ruled by House Reed of Greywater Watch, calling them pejorative names like \"frogeaters\" or \"mudmen\".[13][14]\n\nThe Freys are considered by some to be upstarts[6] and toll collectors.[15]\n\nSome in the service of House Frey wear blue steel ringmail and capes of silvery grey.[16]\n\nHouse Frey dates back six centuries, making it one of the younger noble houses in Westeros. The first Lord Frey was awarded lands and a noble status, and began the construction of a great bridge spanning the Green Fork of the Trident. Construction was finished under the rule of his grandson, who added wooden keeps on both sides of the river. The timber keeps were eventually replaced by stone keeps, which received the name \"the Twins\".[4]\n\nDue to their strategic location, House Frey prospered by exacting tolls for passage across the river, greatly increasing their wealth. House Frey has grown into the most powerful bannermen of House Tully of Riverrun,[7] and the Twins are among the strongest castles of the Seven Kingdoms.[17] However, some older houses look down upon the Freys as upstarts[5] and toll collectors.[15]\n\nWarriors from House Frey tried and failed to conquer Greywater Watch in the Neck.[18]\n\nDuring Aegon's Conquest, House Frey aided Aegon the Conqueror and rebelled against Harren the Black of Harrenhal, the King of the Isles and the Rivers. After the burning of Harrenhal, the Freys joined the other river lords in swearing fealty to House Tully, the new Lords Paramount of the Trident for House Targaryen.[19]\n\nIn 43 AC, Lord Frey supported Aegon the Uncrowned against his uncle, King Maegor I Targaryen.[20]\n\nA young Forrest Frey was mocked as fool Frey for asking for the hand of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen.[21] During the Dance of the Dragons, House Frey sided with the blacks of Queen Rhaenyra against the greens of King Aegon II Targaryen,[22] and Freys aided Prince Daemon Targaryen during the taking of Stone Hedge.[23] Lord Forrest died fighting westermen in the Battle by the Lakeshore,[24] but his widow Sabitha continued House Frey's support of the blacks.[25] After the Dance, six hundred Freys joined Ser Robert Rowan when he marched to the Vale of Arryn in support of Ser Joffrey Arryn.[26]\n\nSer Duncan the Tall recognized the Frey banner among the arms displayed at the tourney at Ashford Meadow.[27] Lord Ambrose Butterwell held a wedding tourney at Whitewalls to celebrate his marriage to his new lady wife who was a member of House Frey. Lord Frey attended the tourney, accompanied by his daughters, his four-year-old son (the current Lord Walder), his well-regarded brother Ser Franklyn, and his nephew Ser Addam.[15] Lord Frey and his retinue abandoned Whitewalls before Daemon II Blackfyre could be crowned in the Second Blackfyre Rebellion.[15]\n\nDuring the tourney at Harrenhal, the squire of a Frey knight accosted Howland Reed. The Frey knight was later defeated by the Knight of the Laughing Tree and told to teach his squire honor.[18]\n\nDuring the long reign of Lord Walder Frey, the house exploded in size as he and his descendants sired many offspring.[4] He offered Brynden Tully his choice of three Frey girls in marriage.[8] When Lord Tytos Lannister acquiesced to Walder's proposal to marry his second son, Emmon, to Tytos's daughter Genna, the ten-year old Tywin Lannister spoke out against the match.[10]\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, Lord Walder arrived at the Battle of the Trident after the outcome was already decided. Lord Hoster Tully has since referred to his bannerman as the Late Lord Frey.[16]\n\nHoster Tully, the Lord Paramount of the Trident, refused a Frey bride for his son, Edmure, and did not attend Walder's wedding to his seventh wife, Annara Farring.[4] Lord Jon Arryn and Lady Lysa Arryn refused to foster Walder's grandsons at court in King's Landing or their own son, Robert Arryn, at the Twins.[4] Several Freys participated in the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day.[4] Walder claims to have hosted three kings at the Twins during his rule.[4]\n\nAfter Chett killed Bessa, Walder Rivers was sent by Lord Walder to judge the criminal and send him to the Wall.[28]\n\nLord Walder Frey and Joyeuse Erenford are to wed on Walder's ninetieth name day.[16]\n\nA score of Frey men are at the crossroads inn when Lady Catelyn Stark seizes Tyrion Lannister.[16] Rather than joining her to bring him to justice, the men report the event to Lord Frey.[29]\n\nSix Freys attend the Hand's tourney in King's Landing: Ser Jared, Ser Hosteen, Ser Danwell, Ser Emmon, Ser Theo, and Ser Perwyn, as well as one of Lord Walder's bastards, Martyn Rivers.[30]\n\nAs he had done in Robert's Rebellion, Lord Walder delays his response to Lord Hoster Tully's calling of banners, although he keeps near four thousand men at the Twins and defends their lands from Lannister outriders commanded by Ser Addam Marbrand.[4] When Robb Stark arrives at the Twins on his march south to free Lord Eddard Stark, he is received by Walder's heir, Ser Stevron. Walder negotiates with Robb's mother, Lady Catelyn, securing a marriage contract with Robb and linking the Freys with the Starks of Winterfell. Furthermore, Arya Stark will wed Elmar when the fighting is done, Catelyn will take two more (Big and Little Walder) as wards, and Robb will take yet another (Olyvar) as his squire. In exchange the Freys lend their swords to his cause and grant the northern army safe passage.[4]\n\nAfter the death of King Robert I Baratheon, Walder and Stevron are named among the nobles the new king, Joffrey I Baratheon, insists must do him homage or be named traitors to the realm.[31]\n\nRobb's army split at the Twins, each force heading to deal with a different Lannister army; Freys ride with both forces. Robb acknowledges that the Freys under Stevron's command fought bravely at the battle in the Whispering Wood;  Perwyn fights there as part of Robb's battle guard. Ser Cleos and Tion fight on the other side of that battle under their cousin, Ser Jaime Lannister, and are captured along with him. Their father, Emmon Frey, also fights on the Lannister side of the war. Other Freys, including Ser Aenys, Jared, Hosteen, Danwell, Elmar, and Ronel Rivers are part of Lord Roose Bolton's army. Jared, Hosteen, Danwell, and Ronel are captured by Lord Tywin Lannister's forces during the battle on the Green Fork. Stevron attends the war council at Riverrun at which Robb Stark is declared King in the North.[8]\n\nCatelyn's wards Big Walder and Little Walder are welcomed to Winterfell, although they are not much to the liking of Bran Stark.[12] The cousins are spared by Theon Greyjoy during his capture of Winterfell[32] and later by Ramsay Snow during his sack of Winterfell.[33]\n\nJared, Hosteen, Danwell and Ronel are briefly in captivity at Harrenhal before being ransomed by two other Freys (presumably Aenys and Elmar) soon after Arya's arrival, rejoining Lord Bolton's army.[34] Aenys participates in the fall of Harrenhal to Roose's host.[35]\n\nMany Freys, including Stevron, Ser Ryman, Black Walder, and Olyvar, join Robb in his campaign through the westerlands. Stevron dies after receiving a minor wound in the Battle of Oxcross, making his son Ryman the heir to the Twins.[36] In the storming of the Crag, Black Walder scales the walls of the castle along with Smalljon Umber.[5]\n\nSer Perwyn accompanies Lady Catelyn on her voyage south to treat with kings Renly and Stannis Baratheon.[37] Martyn Rivers commands the outriders in the riverlands while Ser Brynden Tully is campaigning in the west with Robb Stark, King of the Trident. Martyn meets Catelyn's party when she nears Riverrun on her return trip.[38] Perwyn and Martyn fight in the Battle of the Fords.[39]\n\nCleos Frey, still a captive of Robb's, is sent to King's Landing to offer Robb's terms to his cousin, Tyrion Lannister, but they are rebuffed.[40] Tyrion plants men in Cleos's red cloak guards to try and free Jaime from Riverrun,[41] but they fail and Cleos is imprisoned again.[38]\n\nTo solidify wartime alliances, Roose Bolton marries one of Walder's granddaughters, Walda. After the fall of Winterfell and the Lannister victory over Stannis in the Battle of the Blackwater, the Freys in Lord Bolton's army at Harrenhal believe that Robb should bend the knee.[42]\n\nAt Riverrun, Catelyn frees Jaime from captivity in an effort to exchange him for her daughters, allowing his cousin, Cleos Frey, to accompany him along with her sworn sword, Brienne of Tarth.[9] On the journey to King's Landing, Cleos proves to be a useless fighter, and he is killed by outlaws near Maidenpool.[43]\n\nRobb Stark's marriage to Jeyne Westerling outrages House Frey and breaks their alliance. Ryman and Black Walder angrily depart Robb's army at the Crag,[5] as do Freys led by Perwyn and Martyn Rivers at Riverrun.[5] The Freys with Ser Frey at Harrenhal are also enraged,[42] but they remain with Lord Roose Bolton.[44]\n\nAfter the passing of Hoster Tully, the Lord Paramount of the Trident, Lame Lothar and Bastard Walder arrive at Riverrun with forty men from the Twins. Their father, Lord Walder, suggests that their new liege lord, Robb's uncle Edmure Tully, stand in Robb's place for the marriage alliance and marry Walder's daughter, Roslin.[7]\n\nWhile Robb leads his northmen and some rivermen from Riverrun to the Twins, Roose leads his own host north from Harrenhal. They are welcomed and given guest right by the Freys.[45] However, Walder has secretly negotiated with Lord Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King to Joffrey I Baratheon, and Lord Bolton. They betray the Starks and Tullys at the Red Wedding, breaking guest right and slaughtering their former allies. Jinglebell, Benfrey, and Tytos are killed in the process.[46][47] Perwyn, Olyvar, and Alesander had been sent away beforehand, they being too friendly with the Starks.[46]\n\nThe Freys are rewarded by the Iron Throne for killing King Robb and capturing Lord Edmure. Walder Frey's second son, Emmon, is given the lordship of a junior branch, House Frey of Riverrun, when House Tully is divested of their seat.[48] Ryman and his son, Edwyn, lead two thousand men to join Ser Daven Lannister in the siege of Riverrun, while Black Walder resolves the siege of Seagard by threatening to kill Patrek Mallister.[49]\n\nOther nobles and the smallfolk scorn House Frey for breaking the sacred guest right. Petyr and Merrett are seized and hanged by the revived Lady Catelyn and her incarnation of the brotherhood without banners.\n\nTo solidify the alliance with the Lannisters, Amerei Frey is paired with Lord Lancel Lannister,[50] and Daven Lannister is to wed another Frey.[10] Violating guest right has ruined the Freys' reputation, however, with even Jaime Lannister calling them treacherous.[3][51] House Frey influence in the riverlands increases further by way of the newly-created House Lannister of Darry, the household of which is provided by Lancel's wife, Ami. A score of Freys, including Danwell, Arwood, and Marissa, accompany her to Castle Darry. After \"the Hound's\" attack on Saltpans, Arwood and his kinsmen Harys and Donnel Haigh ride from Darry to investigate, finding Ser Quincy Cox hiding behind his walls.[52]\n\nDead soldiers bearing the colors of House Frey have washed up on the Quiet Isle. According to the Elder Brother, they are buried next to their enemies of House Darry. It is hinted that the enmity between Frey and Darry is not new, but has significant history.[53]\n\nAfter arriving at Riverrun, Ser Jaime Lannister informs Emmon that although he has been granted Riverrun, Emmon is not the liege of the riverlords. The Freys instead owe allegiance to Lord Petyr Baelish, head of House Baelish of Harrenhal and Lord Paramount of the Trident.[10] Jaime removes Ryman from command of the siege of Riverrun in favor of his son Edwyn.[3] When informing Ser Brynden Tully of what will happen if he does not surrender, Jaime says he will send the Freys as a second wave, after the other rivermen but before the westermen. On his journey back to the Twins, Ryman is hanged by outlaws near Fairmarket. Ryman's death leaves his son Edwyn as heir to the Crossing.[2]\n\nAccording to Queen Cersei Lannister, Lord Wyman Manderly is on the verge of allying himself with the Boltons after he agrees to marry both of his granddaughters to members of House Frey and open his port of White Harbor to Lannister shipping.[54]\n\nRhaegar, Jared, and Symond arrive in White Harbor to solidify the alliance between Houses Frey and Manderly.[55] The Manderlys only pretend to accept the peace of King Tommen I Baratheon,[56] however, and the Frey envoys disappear while traveling from White Harbor to Barrowton.[57] Lord Wyman Manderly pleads ignorance about their fate.[58]\n\nBig Walder and Little Walder remain squires of Ramsay Bolton at the Dreadfort.[59] After the siege of Moat Cailin is resolved by Theon Greyjoy and Ramsay, they are joined by Lord Roose Bolton's northmen and Ser Aenys and Ser Hosteen's Freys, who number between fourteen hundred[60] and two thousand,[61] to help Roose in pacifying the north. Roose moves the wedding of Ramsay and \"Arya Stark\" from Barrowton to Winterfell.[57]\n\nWhile quartered at Winterfell during a blizzard, which the Freys are ill prepared for,[62] tensions rise in Roose's army when the Freys place the blame for their missing envoys on Wyman.[58] A brawl results in the deaths of several men when Wyman insults the Freys after Little Walder, the brother of Roose's wife Walda, is found dead in the snow. To relieve the pressure, Roose sends Aenys and Hosteen as a vanguard against Stannis,[63] who is encamped at a crofters' village in the wolfswood.[64]\n\nThe Frey force at Winterfell falls prey to a trap set by Mors Umber outside the walls, killing Aenys. This leaves Hosteen, who loses his horse in the trap, in command of the force.[65]\n\nThe known Freys during the timespan of the events described in A Song of Ice and Fire are:\n\nWith unspecified familiar relationship to the main branch there are also:\n\n\n## Culture\n\n\n\n## Traits\n\n\nMany current Freys share the weaselly[4][8][9][3] or stoatish[10] appearance of their common ancestor, Lord Walder.[4]  According to Haldon Halfmaester, the Freys are renowned for treachery and cruelty.[11]\n\n\n## Customs\n\n\nLord of the crossing is a game played at the Twins by Freys.[12]\n\nThe Freys do not like their northern neighbors, the crannogmen of the Neck ruled by House Reed of Greywater Watch, calling them pejorative names like \"frogeaters\" or \"mudmen\".[13][14]\n\nThe Freys are considered by some to be upstarts[6] and toll collectors.[15]\n\nSome in the service of House Frey wear blue steel ringmail and capes of silvery grey.[16]\n\n\n## History\n\n\n\n## Origin\n\n\nHouse Frey dates back six centuries, making it one of the younger noble houses in Westeros.
