  "content": "House Manderly of White Harbor is a noble family in the north whose seat is the New Castle in the city of White Harbor. Their blazon is a white merman with dark green hair, beard and tail, carrying a black trident, over a blue-green field.[1][2] Their words do not appear in the books, nor has George R. R. Martin submitted them in semi-canon material.\n\nThe Manderlys originated from Dunstonbury in the Reach, but were forced into exile by House Gardener. The Kings of Winter, House Stark of Winterfell, accepted the Manderlys in the north and granted them the Wolf's Den, where the newcomers developed the prosperous city of White Harbor.[3]\n\nThe Lord of White Harbor, Wyman Manderly, claims to influence all lands and houses east of the mouth of the White Knife, including Houses Locke, Woolfield, and Flint of Widow's Watch.[4] The Manderlys' dominion includes the Sheepshead Hills[5] and the Broken Branch,[6] as well as the allegiance of Ramsgate.[7] Their bannermen includes a dozen petty lords and a hundred landed knights.[4]\n\nSeveral known Manderlys, including Torrhen, Wyman, Wylis, and Wendel, have been described as corpulent.[8][1] Marlon Manderly is taller and heavier than Davos Seaworth.[3]\n\nWhile most other northern houses follow the old gods,[9] the Manderlys continue to follow the Faith of the Seven as they did in the south.[10] They also claim membership to the Order of the Green Hand,[3] although that knightly order was destroyed at the Field of Fire during Aegon's Conquest.[11]\n\nManderly guards wield tridents instead of spears.[3]\n\nThe Manderlys are an ancient line who once lived along the banks of the mighty river Mander in the Kingdom of the Reach, and some claim the river was named after them.[12] A noble house of great lords descended from the First Men, they held the castle of Dunstonbury as their seat and had a fierce rivalry with House Peake.[13]\n\nDuring the reign of the Gardeners in the Reach, King Gwayne III Gardener persuaded Lords Manderly and Peake to accept his judgment on their quarrel and do fealty for their lands, without any bloodshed.[14] Like other houses of the Reach, the Manderlys presumably converted from the old gods of the First Men to the Faith of the Seven after the Gardeners welcomed Andals into their kingdom.[13]\n\nNear the end of the long reign of King Garth X Gardener, a problem arose with the succession as the elderly and senile Garth had sired no sons and only daughters, one of whom had married Lord Manderly, and another to Lord Peake. Both lords were determined that their own wife should succeed to the throne, and the rivalry between them was marked by betrayal, conspiracy and murder, and finally escalated into open war with other lords joining the cause on both sides. The anarchy that followed lasted almost a decade until Ser Osmund Tyrell, the High Steward, made common cause with the other lords of the Reach and defeated the Peakes and Manderlys. Osmund then placed a distant cousin of the late Garth X on the throne as King Mern VI Gardener.[13]\n\nAt some point, House Manderly overreached itself, and was driven from the Reach by the Gardeners.[15][16][17] According to Maester Yandel, the exile of House Manderly is credited to Lord Lorimar Peake upon the behest of King Perceon III Gardener, who feared the Manderlys' growing influence and power in the Reach.[18] This allowed House Peake to acquire the Manderlys' seat of Dunstonbury.[18]\n\nBringing their wealth with them, the Manderlys fled to the north, where they were welcomed by the Starks of Winterfell as their own bannermen.[3] The Starks awarded the Wolf's Den to the Manderlys and tasked them with defending the White Knife in return for swearing an oath that they would always be loyal subjects of House Stark. This history instilled the Manderlys with great loyalty to their new liege lords.[3]\n\nWhen exactly House Manderly came north is unknown. In 211 AC, Lady Rohanne Webber dated the flight of the Manderlys as having occurred \"a thousand years\" ago.[16] Lord Godric Borrell defines the time period to \"no more than nine hundred years\" before 300 AC.[15] However, both Wylla Manderly, as well as Maester Yandel date the arrival of the Manderlys in the north back a bit further, \"a thousand years before the Conquest\"[3] and \"some thousand years before the Conquest\",[18] respectively. A semi-canon source lists \"a thousand years before the Conquest\" as well.[17] These accounts thus place the arrival of the Manderlys in the north between 1000 BC and 600 BC.\n\nHouse Manderly built the city of White Harbor with the wealth they had brought from the Reach.[3] They further developed it over the following centuries.[3] It is the smallest of the five cities of Westeros, and is the main northern port for commerce and naval transport.[18] Until the construction of King's Landing during the Conquest (by then still known as the Aegonfort), White Harbor was also the newest city of the Seven Kingdoms.[18] The New Castle, built to replace the aging Wolf's Den, resembles their previous castle Dunstonbury in the Reach.[18] The Manderlys are one of the few great houses of the north to follow the Faith of the Seven instead of the old gods and thus have a strong tradition of knighthood.[9]\n\nIn the aftermath of Aegon's Conquest, Ser Warrick Manderly and Queen Visenya Targaryen suppressed the Sistermen's Rebellion. Lord Steffon Sunderland sent a son to be fostered with the Manderlys.[19]\n\nMara Manderly was a companion to Queen Alysanne Targaryen at Dragonstone in 55 AC. Her father, Lord Theomore Manderly, hosted Alysanne in 58 AC when the queen visited White Harbor as part of her royal progress, with Mara's sister, Jessamyn, serving as her cupbearer.[10] Theomore was to marry Princess Viserra Targaryen in 86 AC,[10] but the high-spirited girl died after falling from a horse while racing drunkenly through the streets of King's Landing.[20] House Manderly supported Princess Rhaenys Targaryen in the Great Council of 101 AC at Harrenhal.[21]\n\nDuring the Dance of the Dragons, Prince Jacaerys Velaryon traveled to White Harbor and Winterfell and convinced the north to join the blacks. After agreeing that his youngest daughter should wed Prince Joffrey Velaryon once fighting ended, Lord Desmond Manderly sent warriors led by his sons, Ser Medrick and Ser Torrhen, to support Rhaenyra Targaryen.[22] The courtly brothers were well regarded in King's Landing, especially when compared to the northmen who served in the host of Lord Cregan Stark.[23] Torrhen served as one of the regents of King Aegon III Targaryen after the war, resigning in 132 AC after the deaths of his father and brother from Winter Fever.[24] When Aegon came of age in 136 AC, he ended the regency and dismissed Lord Manderly, his Hand of the King.[25]\n\nLady Jeyne Manderly wed Rickon Stark, eldest son and supposed heir to Lord Cregan Stark and gave him two daughters, Serena and Sansa.[26] Lady Myriame Manderly married Rodwell Stark and became Lady of Winterfell upon her husband's accession.[26]\n\nMembers of House Manderly were present at the Tourney at Harrenhal of 281 AC.[27][28]\n\nWhen Lord Eddard Stark called the northern banners to join Robert's Rebellion against King Aerys II Targaryen, Lord Wyman Manderly led the Manderlys south. Wyman fought at the Battle of the Trident, rewarding his retainer Ser Bartimus for saving his life by making him castellan of the Wolf's Den, now White Harbor's prison.[4]\n\nLady Manderly, the wife of Lord Wyman, died in around 291 AC.[29]\n\nAfter learning of the assassination attempt on his son Bran's life, Lord Eddard Stark instructs his wife Catelyn to have Lord Wyman Manderly strengthen White Harbor.[30]\n\nAfter leaving the Vale of Arryn, Catelyn meets the Manderlys at White Harbor. Because of Eddard's arrest in King's Landing, a Manderly army, led by Ser Wylis and Ser Wendel, joins Robb Stark at Moat Cailin when marching south against the Lannisters. Their force consists of near fifteen hundred men, including some twenty knights with their squires, 200 mounted lances, swordsmen and freeriders, and the remaining foot armed with spears, pikes and tridents. Wyman remains at White Harbor to watch over the city.[1]\n\nWhen the northern army splits at the Twins, Wendel accompanies Robb to free Riverrun, and although he is already a mature man, he is counted among the thirty young sons of lords that form Robb's personal guard. Meanwhile, Wylis leads the White Harbor infantry with Lord Roose Bolton on his march south, and is captured at the battle on the Green Fork.[31]\n\nWhile at Winterfell for the harvest feast, Lord Wyman meets with Bran Stark, Ser Rodrik Cassel, and Maester Luwin. He offers to mint coins for Robb, informs them of White Harbor's defenses, and proposes to build the king a new warfleet of galleys, with Rodrik saying he will inform Robb of the proposal. Later during the feast, Rodrik commands Hother and Mors Umber to work with Wyman in building longships to combat wildlings.[29]\n\nLady Donella Hornwood (née Manderly) is widowed by the death of Lord Halys Hornwood on the Green Fork. During the harvest feast, Lord Wyman advances his claim for the House Hornwood lands, going on to offer to wed his cousin. However, Donella is forcefully wed when she returns to her lands and is locked away to die by Ramsay Snow, the Bastard of Bolton. In response, Wyman seizes Hornwood to prevent Ramsay from occupying it,[32] and Manderly knights attack Bolton men in the Hornwood forests. News reaches Winterfell via Rodrik, but he does not have the manpower to stop them.[33]\n\nIn the south, Wendel accompanies Lady Catelyn Stark to negotiate with Kings Renly and Stannis Baratheon, bearing the Stark banner at the parley before Storm's End. Meanwhile, Wylis has been held prisoner at Harrenhal, where he frequents the kitchens. Wylis is one of the northmen Tyrion Lannister is willing to trade for his cousins captured at the battle in the Whispering Wood.[34] Wylis is ultimately freed when Roose Bolton captures Harrenhal.\n\nAfter Theon Greyjoy seizes Winterfell, he receives reports that Lord Wyman sent a dozen barges up the White Knife packed with knights and siege engines to help recapture the Starks' seat.[35] During his parley with Rodrik outside the gates of Winterfell, Theon observes a line of mounted Manderly knights. Rodrik's forces are betrayed by House Bolton in the battle at Winterfell, however.[36]\n\nAs Robb marches to the Twins to attend the wedding of Edmure Tully, Ser Wendel Manderly is placed in charge of protecting his baggage train. Ser Wylis commands Lord Roose Bolton's rearguard as they march to the same destination. Wylis is captured for a second time when Gregor Clegane's men attack the army as they cross the ruby ford of the Trident, with Lord Bolton unable to prevent the Mountain from destroying his rearguard.[37] Wylis is returned to captivity at Harrenhal.[38] At the Twins, Wendel dies at the Red Wedding, with an arrow going into his open mouth.[39]\n\nMaester Aemon sends a raven to White Harbor in a plea for help from the Manderlys to defend Castle Black from the wildlings.[40]\n\nAccording to Queen Cersei, the Manderlys are on the verge of allying themselves with the Boltons, with Lord Wyman agreeing to marry both of his granddaughters to members of House Frey and open his port to Lannister ships. The Iron Throne receives reports that Wyman executed Davos when he attempted to negotiate an alliance with Stannis; Cersei responds by allowing the release of Wyman's surviving son, Wylis Manderly. At Harrenhal, Ser Jaime Lannister informs a grateful Wylis he will have an escort to Maidenpool and be put on a ship home to White Harbor.\n\nBrienne of Tarth and her companions see the corpses of the perpetrators of the raid on Saltpans hanged from trees. Among the dead are men with tridents badges sewn on their breasts, presumably Condon or Manderly men-at-arms who became broken men during the War of the Five Kings.[41]\n\nWhen Davos Seaworth arrives in White Harbor hoping to ally Lord Wyman to King Stannis, he sees that twenty-three war galleys have been built without the Lannisters' knowledge. White Harbor is awash with refugees, including those from the Hornwood lands.[42] Despite the objections of his granddaughter, Wylla, Wyman denounces Davos in front of three Frey envoys—Jared, Rhaegar, and Symond—indicating he is ready to make peace with the Iron Throne and pay allegiance to Roose Bolton, the new Warden of the North, who requires that Wyman give up his claim to the Hornwood lands.[3] Wyman fakes Davos's death, however, killing a criminal in his place and altering the body so it resembles the Onion Knight. After Wylis returns safely to White Harbor, Wyman has Robett Glover release Davos from the Wolf's Den. Lord Manderly sends Davos on a mission to find Rickon Stark, known to be alive thanks to Wex Pyke, in a secret bid to unite the northern lords in resistance to Houses Bolton and Frey.[4]\n\nKeeping up his ruse of loyalty, Lord Wyman arrives at Winterfell with three hundred men[43] to answer Roose Bolton's call to arms, and to attend Ramsay Bolton's wedding. At the wedding, he provides some of the food, including three pies implied to be made from the Frey envoys who disappeared after leaving White Harbor.[44][45]\n\nWhile quartered in Winterfell, there is tension within the garrison between the Manderlys and Freys. When Wyman japes about the death of Little Walder Frey, it boils over into bloodshed, with Wyman wounded and several men-at-arms dead on both sides. Lord Bolton, hoping to reduce tensions and hungry mouths within the castle, sends the White Harbor men to engage Stannis's army, which is slowly approaching Winterfell.[46]\n\nHaving escaped from Winterfell and been brought to the crofters' village, Theon Greyjoy tells Stannis Baratheon that Roose Bolton has sent the Freys and Manderlys to confront him. Stannis is angered at Wyman's support of the Boltons, but Theon does not believe Wyman would coordinate with the Freys against Stannis.[47]\n\nThe known Manderlys during the timespan of the events described in A Song of Ice and Fire are:\n\n\n## Traits\n\n\nSeveral known Manderlys, including Torrhen, Wyman, Wylis, and Wendel, have been described as corpulent.[8][1] Marlon Manderly is taller and heavier than Davos Seaworth.[3]\n\nWhile most other northern houses follow the old gods,[9] the Manderlys continue to follow the Faith of the Seven as they did in the south.[10] They also claim membership to the Order of the Green Hand,[3] although that knightly order was destroyed at the Field of Fire during Aegon's Conquest.[11]\n\nManderly guards wield tridents instead of spears.[3]\n\n\n## History\n\n\n\n## Kingdom of the Reach\n\n\nThe Manderlys are an ancient line who once lived along the banks of the mighty river Mander in the Kingdom of the Reach, and some claim the river was named after them.[12] A noble house of great lords descended from the First Men, they held the castle of Dunstonbury as their seat and had a fierce rivalry with House Peake.[13]\n\nDuring the reign of the Gardeners in the Reach, King Gwayne III Gardener persuaded Lords Manderly and Peake to accept his judgment on their quarrel and do fealty for their lands, without any bloodshed.[14] Like other houses of the Reach, the Manderlys presumably converted from the old gods of the First Men to the Faith of the Seven after the Gardeners welcomed Andals into their kingdom.[13]\n\nNear the end of the long reign of King Garth X Gardener, a problem arose with the succession as the elderly and senile Garth had sired no sons and only daughters, one of whom had married Lord Manderly, and another to Lord Peake.
