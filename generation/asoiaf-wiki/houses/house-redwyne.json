  "content": "House Redwyne of the Arbor is one of the main noble houses sworn to Highgarden.[1] Their seat is the Arbor, an island located off the southwestern-most part of Westeros, known for making the best wines in Westeros.[2] The Redwynes control the Redwyne fleet, the largest fleet in Westeros,[3] containing two hundred warships and five times as many merchant carracks, wine cogs, trading galleys, and whalers.[4]\n\nThe sigil of House Redwyne is a burgundy grape cluster on blue, symbolizing the famed wines of the Arbor.[5][6] Their words are not known.\n\nThe current Lord of the Arbor, Paxter Redwyne, is married to his cousin, Mina Tyrell, the sister of his liege, Lord Mace Tyrell.[1] Paxter's elderly aunt,[3] Lady Olenna Redwyne, the \"Queen of Thorns\", is the mother of Mace and Mina.[7]\n\nRedwynes tend to be freckled and orange of hair.[8][9][10][11][12]\n\nThe Redwynes claim descent from Gilbert of the Vines, a legendary son of Garth Greenhand.[13] House Redwyne ruled as Kings of the Arbor until their last monarch was lost at sea, allowing his cousin, King Meryn III Gardener, to make the isle part of the Kingdom of the Reach.[14] Fleets from the Arbor and Oldtown protected the Reach from naval attacks during the coming of the Andals.[15]\n\nRedwynes have married Peakes over the centuries.[16]\n\nAegon I Targaryen and his sister, Visenya Targaryen, may have hawked on the Arbor prior to Aegon's Conquest.[17] After the Targaryen conquest, Visenya and Rhaenys Targaryen helped arrange for the eldest son of Lord Loren Lannister to marry a girl from House Redwyne.[18] The Redwyne fleet aided Aegon in his invasion of the Iron Islands in 2 AC.[19]\n\nThe Redwynes eventually turned against King Maegor I Targaryen in 48 AC.[20]\n\nMaegor's successor, King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, named Lord Manfryd Redwyne as lord admiral and master of ships in 50 AC.[21] Manfryd had a rivalry with Lord Daemon Velaryon.[22] Manfryd proposed the tourney for the completion of the Dragonpit, and his sons Ser Robert and Rickard distinguished themselves in the competition in 55 AC.[23] Three years later, Manfryd's youngest son, Ser Ryam Redwyne, was crowned champion in the tourney at King's Landing on the anniversary of the king's coronation.[23]\n\nFollowing the Shivers, Robert was appointed Commander of the City Watch of King's Landing and his younger brother Ryam joined the Kingsguard of Jaehaerys.[24] In a tourney at Old Oak in 73 AC, Ser Rickard defeated Prince Baelon Targaryen, who was disguised as a mystery knight, and Rickard granted knighthood to the prince after he was unmasked.[24] Ryam was the champion at Oldtown in 89 AC,[24] and he was named co-champion with Ser Clement Crabb at King's Landing in 98 AC.[25] Ser Ryam, by then Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, was named Hand of the King as well after the death of Septon Barth in 98, but the legendary knight was poorly suited for the position.[25]\n\nDuring the Dance of the Dragons, the Arbor declared for King Aegon II Targaryen and the greens.[26]\n\nLords Redwyne, Beesbury, Costayne, Rowan, and Tarly helped escort the High Septon to the capital for the coronation and wedding of King Aegon III Targaryen.[27] House Redwyne were close kin to House Hightower during the regency of Aegon III, and Martyn Hightower served as Lord Redwyne's squire at the Arbor.[28] The second son of Lord Unwin Peake squired for Lord Redwyne before drowning in a sailing accident.[16] Patricia Redwyne attended the Maiden's Day Ball.[16]\n\nLord Redwyne promised to support Alyn Velaryon, Lord of the Tides, with thirty war galleys from the Redwyne fleet when the Oakenfist sailed to confront Dalton Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.[29] Alyn eventually departed for the westerlands after waiting at Oldtown for the Redwynes for some time. The Velaryon fleet later met the Arbor's ships while returning south after the death of the Red Kraken, and Lord Redwyne briefly hosted Alyn Oakenfist at the Arbor.[29]\n\nBethany Redwyne was to marry Ser Brynden Tully, but he refused the match and she was wed to Lord Mathis Rowan instead.[9] On the journey to Casterly Rock for the brokerage of their marriages, Prince Oberyn and Princess Elia Martell visited the Arbor.[30]\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, Lord Paxter Redwyne joined his cousin and goodbrother, Mace Tyrell, in staying loyal to King Aerys II Targaryen. His main contribution to the war was the naval blockade of Storm's End during Mace's siege of the castle, ferrying men across Blackwater Bay and blockading Shipbreaker Bay.[31]\n\nDuring Greyjoy's Rebellion, the Redwyne fleet supported Lord Stannis Baratheon in the sea battle off Fair Isle.[32]\n\nPaxter's twin sons, Horas and Hobber, teased and humiliated Samwell Tarly when he was sent to the Arbor as a page. Lord Paxter's fool also made a jape about Sam.[33]\n\nHouse Redwyne is among the noble houses of the Seven Kingdoms that the exiled Prince Viserys Targaryen believes will rise for him if he lands in Westeros.[34]\n\nThe Redwyne twins, Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, participate in the Hand's tourney in King's Landing.[31] After the death of King Robert I Baratheon, they are named by Lord Petyr Baelish as possible supporters in Lord Eddard Stark's power struggle against Queen Cersei Lannister, though ultimately Eddard chooses to rely on the gold cloaks for their numbers.[35] Petyr has the gold cloaks betray Lord Stark.[36]\n\nAfter the self-coronation of Renly Baratheon, Horas and Hobber are kept as hostages in King's Landing, preventing House Redwyne from joining House Tyrell in declaring for King Renly.[37] The brothers are stopped in an attempt to escape the capital.[38]\n\nAfter Renly's death, as part of his efforts to win House Tyrell and its most powerful vassals, Tyrion Lannister sends Hobber back to their father, Lord Paxter Redwyne, with Petyr Baelish's retinue as a sign of trust, while keeping Horas in the Red Keep as insurance.[39]\n\nLord Baelish negotiates an alliance between House Baratheon of King's Landing and House Tyrell. The Redynes are among the host of Lords Mace Tyrell and Tywin Lannister which routs Stannis Baratheon in the Battle of the Blackwater,[40] and Lord Paxter and his sons are honored after the battle.[41]\n\nLord Tywin Lannister grants Paxter an advisory seat on the small council, along with a remission of taxes on certain vintages from the Arbor for thirty years.[10]\n\nLord Redwyne and his sons become fixtures of the court. As a wedding present, Paxter gives King Joffrey I Baratheon a scale replica of King Joffrey's Valor, which is being built in the Arbor.[42] They attend the royal wedding of Joffrey and witness his death at the wedding feast.[43] Paxter and Hobber are called as witnesses for the prosecution in the trial of Tyrion for the death of Joffrey.[44]\n\nSer Horas and Ser Hobber attend the funeral of Lord Tywin Lannister,[45] and Lord Paxter attends the wedding of King Tommen I Baratheon and Queen Margaery Tyrell.[46]\n\nPaxter's council seat is revoked by Queen Regent Cersei Lannister after Tywin's death. She tasks the Redwyne fleet with the siege of Dragonstone to remove Paxter from the capital and eliminate the nearest military threat.[3]\n\nThe absence of Paxter's fleet and the taking of the Shields by Euron Greyjoy, King of the Isles and the North, leaves the Reach unprotected from ironborn raids. With the majority of the Redwyne ships away in Blackwater Bay and Shipbreaker Bay,[4] the Arbor is attacked by ironmen, and the small defense fleet is overwhelmed.[47]\n\nSer Loras Tyrell takes command of the siege at Dragonstone in order to quickly end it,[4] but he is badly wounded in his victory.[47] After the siege, Lord Paxter sails to defend the Reach.[48]\n\nQueen Regent Cersei arranges for the arrests of Horas and Hobber as part of her intrigues against Queen Margaery.[48]\n\nTyrion discovers a cask of strongwine in Pentos that was once a part of Lord Runceford Redwyne's private stock.[49]\n\nAfter Cersei's arrest by the Faith, Ser Kevan Lannister as regent, re-appoints Paxter to the small council, this time as master of ships. The Redwyne twins, Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, are found innocent.[50]\n\nLord Paxter and his Redwyne fleet are last reported as passing Dorne during their voyage back to the Arbor.[51]\n\nThe known Redwynes during the timespan of the events described in A Song of Ice and Fire are:\n\nWith unspecified familiar relationship with the main branch, other Redwynes include:\n\n\n## Traits\n\n\nRedwynes tend to be freckled and orange of hair.[8][9][10][11][12]\n\n\n## History\n\n\n\n## Kings of the Arbor\n\n\nThe Redwynes claim descent from Gilbert of the Vines, a legendary son of Garth Greenhand.[13] House Redwyne ruled as Kings of the Arbor until their last monarch was lost at sea, allowing his cousin, King Meryn III Gardener, to make the isle part of the Kingdom of the Reach.[14] Fleets from the Arbor and Oldtown protected the Reach from naval attacks during the coming of the Andals.[15]\n\nRedwynes have married Peakes over the centuries.[16]\n\n\n## Targaryen Era\n\n\nAegon I Targaryen and his sister, Visenya Targaryen, may have hawked on the Arbor prior to Aegon's Conquest.[17] After the Targaryen conquest, Visenya and Rhaenys Targaryen helped arrange for the eldest son of Lord Loren Lannister to marry a girl from House Redwyne.[18] The Redwyne fleet aided Aegon in his invasion of the Iron Islands in 2 AC.[19]\n\nThe Redwynes eventually turned against King Maegor I Targaryen in 48 AC.[20]\n\nMaegor's successor, King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, named Lord Manfryd Redwyne as lord admiral and master of ships in 50 AC.[21] Manfryd had a rivalry with Lord Daemon Velaryon.[22] Manfryd proposed the tourney for the completion of the Dragonpit, and his sons Ser Robert and Rickard distinguished themselves in the competition in 55 AC.[23] Three years later, Manfryd's youngest son, Ser Ryam Redwyne, was crowned champion in the tourney at King's Landing on the anniversary of the king's coronation.[23]\n\nFollowing the Shivers, Robert was appointed Commander of the City Watch of King's Landing and his younger brother Ryam joined the Kingsguard of Jaehaerys.[24] In a tourney at Old Oak in 73 AC, Ser Rickard defeated Prince Baelon Targaryen, who was disguised as a mystery knight, and Rickard granted knighthood to the prince after he was unmasked.[24] Ryam was the champion at Oldtown in 89 AC,[24] and he was named co-champion with Ser Clement Crabb at King's Landing in 98 AC.[25] Ser Ryam, by then Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, was named Hand of the King as well after the death of Septon Barth in 98, but the legendary knight was poorly suited for the position.[25]\n\n\n## The Dance and Regency\n\n\nDuring the Dance of the Dragons, the Arbor declared for King Aegon II Targaryen and the greens.[26]\n\nLords Redwyne, Beesbury, Costayne, Rowan, and Tarly helped escort the High Septon to the capital for the coronation and wedding of King Aegon III Targaryen.[27] House Redwyne were close kin to House Hightower during the regency of Aegon III, and Martyn Hightower served as Lord Redwyne's squire at the Arbor.[28] The second son of Lord Unwin Peake squired for Lord Redwyne before drowning in a sailing accident.[16] Patricia Redwyne attended the Maiden's Day Ball.[16]\n\nLord Redwyne promised to support Alyn Velaryon, Lord of the Tides, with thirty war galleys from the Redwyne fleet when the Oakenfist sailed to confront Dalton Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.[29] Alyn eventually departed for the westerlands after waiting at Oldtown for the Redwynes for some time.
