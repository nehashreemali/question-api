  "content": "Syrio Forel is a bravo from Braavos, a master fencer and former first sword to the Sealord of Braavos.[1][2]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Syrio is portrayed by Miltos Yerolemou.[4]\n\nSyrio is a slight, bald man with a beak of a nose.[1] He wears a leather vest[2] and teaches with slender wooden swords[1] with lead cores.[2]\n\nThe bravo has an excellent reputation.[5] Syrio is demanding and creative in his teachings,[1][6] but he is protective of his pupils.[2] He often says, \"Just so.\"[7]\n\nThe day the old first sword died, the Sealord of Braavos sent for Syrio. The bravo, upon entering the Sealord's presence, was asked what was special about the cat, claimed to be from a far off land, seated on the Sealord's lap. Syrio answered him truthfully, telling him that he has seen tomcats like him a thousand times in the alleys of Braavos. Because he saw the reality of what the cat was, common instead of special and male instead of female, Syrio was named first sword.[2] Syrio has seen the Sealord's menagerie.[2]\n\nLord Eddard Stark, the new Hand of the King, hires Syrio to teach his daughter Arya how to use her sword, Needle, believing the slender blade would suit the water dancer style of Braavos. In the Small Hall of the Tower of the Hand, Syrio trains Arya using wooden swords filled with lead. He also mentors her on how to move and think like a warrior: to be perceptive, move with grace, and command her fear.[1] Syrio teaches Arya to see with her ears, nose, and skin, and he covers her eyes with a black cloth and has her do spins and backflips.[5]\n\nTo improve Arya's speed, Syrio has her catch cats in the Red Keep, and he treats her scratches with Myrish fire.[6] After Arya admits to venturing into the depths of the castle, Eddard is skeptical of Syrio's methods.[6]\n\nAt the feast after the Hand's tourney, Sansa Stark asks her younger sister how her dancing has gone. Arya happily tells her she is sore all over, and shows a nasty bruise on her leg. Sansa states that she must be a terrible dancer. Eddard later offers to have Jory Cassel or someone else take over Arya's lessons, but the girl insists on remaining under Syrio's tutelage.[5]\n\nLord Stark is willing to send Syrio with his daughters back to Winterfell when they are to leave King's Landing,[8] but the plans are interrupted by Eddard's arrest after the death of King Robert I Baratheon.[9] Queen Cersei Lannister sends Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard to apprehend Arya during her training with her supposed dancing master.[10]\n\nDuring their training session, Syrio tells Arya how he was chosen by the Sealord of Braavos to become first sword. When Meryn and five House Lannister guards arrive in the Small Hall, Syrio orders Arya to flee while he holds off the red cloaks. With only his wooden practice sword, he kills or disables all five guards and then faces Meryn. Arya screams at him to run away, but her teacher replies, \"The first sword of Braavos does not run.\" Syrio rains down ineffective blows onto Meryn's plate armor until his wooden sword is cut in half. A crying Arya flees the Tower of the Hand, obeying Syrio's orders.[2] According to a semi-canon source, Syrio is killed in King's Landing.[3]\n\nArya remembers Syrio's teachings while evading capture in King's Landing.[11]\n\nArya continues using Syrio's guidance after escaping the capital.[12][13][14] Jaqen H'ghar's speech reminds her of the bravo.[13] Arya hates Meryn for what he did to Syrio, and she adds the knight's name to the list of those she wants dead.[15]\n\nArya practices her swordplay in the godswood of Harrenhal.[16] After stealing a dagger from Lord Roose Bolton, she sharpens it the way Syrio had taught her.[17]\n\nRecalling Syrio's words, Arya is unafraid after escaping Harrenhal,[18] and is observant while with the brotherhood without banners[19] and at Stoney Sept.[20]\n\nArya thinks of Syrio when she arrives at the House of Black and White in Braavos,[21] and she uses his teachings while training as a novice at the temple.[7]\n\nThis page uses content from the English Wikipedia.
