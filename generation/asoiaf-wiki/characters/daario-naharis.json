  "content": "Daario Naharis is a Tyroshi captain of the sellsword company, the Stormcrows.[2]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Daario is portrayed by Ed Skrein (Season 3) and Michiel Huisman (Seasons 4 - 6).[3][4]\n\nDaario is lithe and smooth skinned[5][6] with bright, deep blue eyes which can appear almost purple.[7][8][9] His curly hair reaches his collar, and he keeps his beard cut in three prongs.[5] Daario dyes his hair and trident beard, sometimes in blue[5] and other times in deep purple.[8] His fingernails are also enameled blue. Daario's mustachios are painted gold, and he has a large, curving nose.[5] A golden tooth gleams in his mouth when he smiles.[5]\n\nDaario is dangerous[7][10] and like most sellswords is fickle, faithless, and brutal.[11] He is quick to anger and is reckless.[6][12] The sellsword is mocking,[6] glib,[13] and greedy.[7] He is unable to read the Common Tongue of Westeros.[6]\n\nThe sellsword dresses in loud colors and finery. One yellow outfit, for instance, includes a foam of butter-colored Myrish lace, a doublet with brass medallions in the shape of dandelions, and suede gloves. His high leather boots have ornamental goldwork, and his belt has gilded rings.[5] Another outfit consists of striped pantaloons, high boots of purple leather, a white silk shirt, and a vest of golden rings.[11] Daario also possesses a heavy black cloak.[5]\n\nDaario wears a Dothraki arakh on his left hip and a Myrish stiletto on his right hip. Their golden hilts are a matched pair of naked women who appear wanton, which he sometimes caresses obscenely.[5][11]\n\nDaario is part of the Stormcrows when they take on a contract to defend Yunkai from the forces of Daenerys Targaryen during the Targaryen campaign in Slaver's Bay. Daario is one of the captains of the Stormcrows who attend the parley with Daenerys. She offers the captains gold and plunder if the Stormcrows come over to her side, but is rebuffed by Prendahl na Ghezn, one of the other captains.[5]\n\nThe Stormcrows are a company of freedmen, and therefore the question of breaking the contract with Yunkai has to be put to each man.  While that debate is going on in the camp, Daario, won over by Daenerys, kills Prendahl and his fellow captain, Sallor the Bald, and brings their heads to Daenerys as proof that the Stormcrows are joining her. Ser Jorah Mormont does not trust Daario, but the Stormcrows contribute to Daenerys's victory in the battle near Yunkai.[5]\n\nDaario leads the Targaryen van during the march on Meereen. Each day he gives Daenerys flowers and plants, and he tries to spare her from seeing the bodies of slave children killed by the Great Masters.[7] After the siege of Meereen, Daario leads the Stormcrows in collecting a tenth whenever someone sells themselves into slavery.[8]\n\nDaenerys sends Daario as an ambassador to the Lhazareen with the mission of reopening the land trade routes between Lhazar and Meereen.[13] He leads the Stormcrows in fighting on the Khyzai Pass against the Long Lances.[11]\n\nAfter the Green Grace suggests that Daenerys wed Hizdahr zo Loraq to bring peace, Daario angers the queen by suggesting she slaughter the Great Masters who would assemble at the wedding feast. Daenerys orders the Stormcrows to patrol the Yunkish hinterlands and protect the Khyzai Pass, with Daario reporting to Ser Barristan Selmy, Lord Commander of the Queensguard.[11]\n\nWhile evading the second siege of Meereen, Daario is wounded by a crossbow which cuts his temple. The captain claims to have killed one of his serjeants who wanted to defect to the Yunkai'i.[14] Infatuated with the sellsword,[11][15] Daenerys begins sleeping with Daario after his return to Meereen,[14] and the sellsword angers Barristan by kissing the queen in public.[6] Daario refers to the aged knight as \"Ser Grandfather\".[16]\n\nPrince Quentyn Martell, Ser Archibald Yronwood, and Ser Gerris Drinkwater, who have disguised themselves as sellswords of the Windblown, defect to Daario's Stormcrows. After the Dornish knights reveal their true identities to Daenerys, an angry Daario distrusts them.[6][12]\n\nDaario becomes bad tempered when Dany agrees to weds Hizdahr. Although he does not attend the wedding at the Temple of the Graces, Daenerys secretly hopes that her sellsword lover will intervene and abscond with her.[6] The sellsword becomes more wild after the wedding. Daario, Groleo, Hero, Jhogo, and Hizdahr's sister and two cousins are given as hostages to the Yunkai'i to vouchsafe for Daenerys's good intentions for peace.[12] Daario leaves his blades in Daenerys's care, and she hangs them on the wall beside her bed.[17]\n\nAfter Daenerys disappears from Daznak's Pit on the back of Drogon,[18] the Yunkai'i refuse to release the hostages until her other two dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, are executed.[19] When Barristan and Skahaz mo Kandaq plot against King Hizdahr, the knight wants Daario to be rescued from the Yunkai'i, while the Shavepate suggests that Daario be allowed to die so that the Stormcrows can choose a new leader.[16] As Daario remains a prisoner of the Yunkai'i, command of the Stormcrows passes to the Widower and Jokin.[20]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nDaario is lithe and smooth skinned[5][6] with bright, deep blue eyes which can appear almost purple.[7][8][9] His curly hair reaches his collar, and he keeps his beard cut in three prongs.[5] Daario dyes his hair and trident beard, sometimes in blue[5] and other times in deep purple.[8] His fingernails are also enameled blue.
