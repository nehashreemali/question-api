  "content": "Walder Frey is the Lord of the Crossing and head of House Frey. Though almost ninety years old and infirm, he still maintains an active hand in the running of his house at the Twins.[8]\n\nWalder has become famous for siring many children and surviving many wives. He is to marry his eighth wife and has over a hundred descendants, base and trueborn. Walder has had twenty-two trueborn sons and seven trueborn daughters from his marriages, with an unknown number of bastard sons and daughters. He places a great emphasis on family loyalty, though his descendants jockey ruthlessly for his favor. Many Freys name their sons Walder and daughters Walda hoping that the lord will favor them.[4]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Walder is portrayed by David Bradley.[7]\n\nAs a young child, Walder was chinless and snot-nosed, with a high shrill hiccup of a laugh.[9]\n\nBy the age of ninety, Walder has turned bald, and his head has spotted with age.[4][3] He looks a little like a vulture, but mostly like a weasel.[3] Many of his descendants have inherited his weasel-like look.[4][10] Walder's shoulders are scrawny and his long neck pink. He has a receding chin, under which loose skin dangles. He has runny and clouded eyes, and a toothless mouth, which constantly moves.[3] Walder is troubled with gout, and can no longer stand without assistance.[4]\n\nWalder has always been irascible, sharp of tongue, and blunt of manner, and this has only increased with age.[4] He is a cautious man,[11] but also an ambitious one, and is known to only give aid to a winning cause.[12] He is peevish,[3][13] ill-tempered, envious, and prideful,[13] with a long memory,[14] and can brood long about every slight he has ever suffered.[15] Walder has a prickly manner, and can take insult in the smallest things.[16] He is considered untrustworthy by his liege lord, Hoster Tully.[1][4]\n\nAs a toddler Walder was present at the wedding of his elder sister to Lord Ambrose Butterwell at Whitewalls.[N 1] It is said he caused the marriage when he discovered his sister having intimate relations with a servant. Ser Duncan the Tall thought that Walder was an extremely annoying child, and was sorely tempted to throw him down a well.[9]\n\nWhen Lord Tytos Lannister acquiesced to Walder's proposal to marry his second son, Emmon, to Tytos's daughter Genna, the ten-year-old Tywin Lannister spoke out against the match.[17]\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, Walder and his levies arrived at the Battle of the Trident after the rebels had already won. Hoster Tully, the Lord Paramount of the Trident, has since called his bannerman \"the Late Lord Frey\",[8][13][4] a name Walder despises.[6] Lord Jon Arryn refused to foster Walder's grandsons at court in King's Landing and his own son, Robert Arryn, at the Twins.[4] Lord Hoster Tully refused a Frey bride for his son Edmure, and Hoster did not attend Walder's wedding to his seventh wife, Annara Farring.[4]\n\nAt the crossroads inn, a Frey captain tells Catelyn Stark that Lord Walder is to remarry on his ninetieth name day.[8] After Catelyn abducts Tyrion Lannister,[8] the Frey contingent at the crossroads report back to Walder.[11]\n\nCatelyn's ailing father, Lord Hoster Tully, declines to attend Walder's wedding to Joyeuse Erenford.[4]\n\nWalder is slow in answering House Tully's summons when Ser Edmure calls the banners. Aside from skirmishing with Ser Addam Marbrand's Lannister outriders, the Freys mass their strength within the Twins.[4] Edmure is defeated by Ser Jaime Lannister at Riverrun[12] while Walder gathers his forces.[4]\n\nBecause the use of the Twins becomes a strategic necessity for the host of Catelyn's son, Robb Stark, Walder negotiates marriage contracts with Catelyn. Robb is to marry one of Walder's daughters once there is peace and his sister, Arya, is betrothed to Walder's youngest son, Elmar. In addition, two of Lord Frey's grandsons, Little Walder and Big Walder, are sent to Winterfell as wards and one of his sons, Olyvar, is made squire to Robb.[4]\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Walder's son and heir, Ser Stevron Frey, dies after the Battle of Oxcross, having fought bravely for Robb Stark, the new King in the North and King of the Trident.[18]\n\nLord Roose Bolton marries one of Walder's granddaughters, Walda Frey,[19] in a ceremony at the Twins.[20] Walder had promised Roose to pay the bride's weight in silver for her dowry, so Roose chose the fattest one.[20] Walder mocks his son Merrett for Walda's weight.[21]\n\nWord eventually reaches the Twins of Robb Stark's marriage to Jeyne Westerling instead of a Frey as promised. Ser Ryman Frey, Lord Walder's new heir, withdraws House Frey's support from the king in outrage.[22]\n\nWalder sends his son Lame Lothar to Riverrun to negotiate a rapprochement. Robb and many of his key bannermen return to the Twins under guest right to make amends and marry Lord Edmure Tully to Walder's daughter, Roslin. During the wedding feast, however, Frey and Bolton men ambush Robb and his entire host, slaughtering King Robb, Catelyn Stark, many of their bannermen, and a significant portion of the northern army.[16]\n\nWalder had secretly colluded with Lords Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton to betray the Starks and Tullys in what becomes known as the Red Wedding.[15][23] Walder swears loyalty to King Joffrey I Baratheon, with Walder's second son Emmon receiving Riverrun and its lands as reward.[24]\n\nAccording to one of his sons, Merrett, Lord Walder is not long for the world and when he dies it will be every other Frey for himself. Walder, though a tyrant, believes in taking care of his own, even the ones who disappoint him. When Stevron was heir it was different, as he was raised by Walder to believe that blood was blood, but his sons and grandsons, now the new heirs, do not feel the same way. Merrett and Petyr Frey are hanged by outlaws, the brotherhood without banners, at Oldstones.[21]\n\nSer Daven Lannister is promised to a Frey according to an agreement negotiated by Lord Tywin before his death.[17] Ser Lancel Lannister is betrothed to Walder's granddaughter, Amerei.[26]\n\nWalder sends a raven to King's Landing putting forth several claims to land. Because the Red Wedding is reviled by sparrows, the small council of Queen Regent Cersei Lannister suggests that Walder's eventual successor could name the culprits and thereby rid himself of rivals.[27]\n\nThe Elder Brother at the Quiet Isle says that Lord Frey is hunting outlaws from the Twins.[28]\n\nWhile returning to the Twins from the siege of Riverrun, Walder's new heir, Ryman, is hanged, presumably by the brotherhood without banners. Ser Jaime Lannister tasks Walder Rivers with informing Lord Walder that King Tommen I Baratheon requires all captives taken by the Freys during the Red Wedding.[29]\n\nWalder agrees to a marriage pact with Lord Wyman Manderly, betrothing two of Walder's grandsons, Rhaegar and Little Walder, to Wyman's granddaughters, Wynafryd and Wylla.[30][31]\n\nWalder sends at least 1,400 Frey soldiers under the command of two sons, Ser Aenys and Ser Hosteen, with Lord Bolton when the new Warden of the North returns to the north.[32] Rhaegar and two of Walder's sons, Jared and Symond, vanish after leaving White Harbor. Little Walder, is found slain in Winterfell.[33]\n\nWalder has outlived seven wives, and is currently married to his eighth wife. He has over a hundred descendants, both trueborn and baseborn. He has had twenty-two trueborn sons and seven trueborn daughters from his marriages, with an unknown number of bastard sons and daughters.\n\nDescendants of his third son Aenys Frey and his daughter Perriane Frey:\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nAs a young child, Walder was chinless and snot-nosed, with a high shrill hiccup of a laugh.[9]\n\nBy the age of ninety, Walder has turned bald, and his head has spotted with age.[4][3] He looks a little like a vulture, but mostly like a weasel.[3] Many of his descendants have inherited his weasel-like look.[4][10] Walder's shoulders are scrawny and his long neck pink.
