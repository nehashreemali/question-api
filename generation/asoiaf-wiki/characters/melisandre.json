  "content": "Melisandre is a red priestess of R'hllor and a shadowbinder, hailing from the city of Asshai in the Further East of Essos. She has joined the court of Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone, believing him to be Azor Ahai reborn, a hero destined to defeat the Great Other. She has become an influential advisor to him and his family.[1] She becomes a POV character in A Dance with Dragons.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Melisandre is portrayed by Carice van Houten.\n\nMelisandre is regarded as a beautiful woman by many.[1] She has long hair the color of deep burnished copper,[1] unsettling red eyes,[6][7] and pale, unblemished skin.[1] The priestess is slender, graceful, and taller than most knights.[1] Melisandre has full breasts, a narrow waist, and a heart-shaped face.[1] She has a deep voice[1] which sounds melodic[8][9] and might make a listener envision anise, nutmeg, and cloves.[8]\n\nMelisandre speaks the Common Tongue of Westeros with rich accents of the Jade Sea[1] and Essos.[10] She also speaks High Valyrian and the speech of Asshai.[2] She sings loudly and clearly.[11]\n\nAs is the custom of red priests, Melisandre always dresses in long red fabric.[2][12][13] She wears bloodred fabric underneath a silk gown the color of bright fire on one occasion,[1] and robes of scarlet satin and blood velvet on another.[2] The priestess also wears a scarlet cloak.[14][12] She is never without a red gold choker containing a ruby which fits tightly around her neck.[1] When Melisandre works magic, the ruby setting glows with power,[6] and it may be able to burn her if the magic worked is particularly demanding.[5] The priestess claims to never be cold, despite weather conditions,[13] and she gives off noticeable heat.[15][5]\n\nMelisandre has the ability to see visions in the flames, and completely trusts in the power of her god, R'hllor. Although she acknowledges that her visions can be misinterpreted,[6] she has faith in her ability to correctly interpret them, even if the vision does not entirely agree with the proposed interpretation.[5]\n\nMelisandre is careful to present herself as mysterious, serene and powerful, and she pretends that several acts of magic are much easier than they are in truth. Although Melisandre is genuinely skilled with magic, she enhances this with various smokes and powders that she keeps concealed in her robes.[5] The priestess always keeps candles burning in her chambers at night.[5]\n\nAs a slave called Melony of \"Lot Seven\", Melisandre was sold to a red temple at an early age.[5] She has learned the Common Tongue, High Valyrian, and the tongue of Asshai.[2]\n\nMelisandre has practiced her art for \"years beyond count\".[5]\n\nMelisandre travels to Dragonstone on her own[16] in search of a prophesied prince, Azor Ahai, who will lead the war for the dawn against the Great Other, the enemy to her god, R'hllor.[17] She is convinced that Dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt amidst which Azor Ahai shall be reborn.[18][19] Melisandre comes to believe that Stannis Baratheon, the Lord of Dragonstone, is Azor Ahai reborn,[17] and she becomes a confidant to Stannis's wife, Selyse Florent.[20]\n\nAt the crossroads inn, Lord Tywin Lannister tells his son Tyrion that according to one of the rumors Lord Varys has heard, Lord Stannis Baratheon is bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai to Dragonstone,[21] possibly in reference to Melisandre, although she had arrived on Dragonstone some years ago.[20]\n\nMelisandre resides at Dragonstone, where she has converted Lady Selyse Florent to the faith of R'hllor. She is feared by most of the servants, who call her \"the red woman\" as they do not dare to say her name.[1] Melisandre believes that Stannis fulfills an ancient prophecy from Asshai, and is Azor Ahai reborn.[2] Determined to stop Melisandre's \"madness\" from spreading beyond Dragonstone, Stannis's maester, Cressen, proposes a toast between himself and Melisandre, using poisoned wine. Melisandre drinks most of the wine and remains unharmed, but Cressen dies drinking the remaining fluid.[1]\n\nAlthough Stannis is not as committed to R'hllor as his wife and the queen's men in his court, Melisandre convinces him to burn the statues of the Seven from the castle sept of Dragonstone in sacrifice to R'hllor.[2] Outside of Dragonstone's gates, Melisandre proclaims Stannis to be Azor Ahai reborn and has him pull a burning sword from the fire, declaring it to be the legendary sword Lightbringer.[2] He eventually creates a new sigil for himself, the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.[14]\n\nIn King's Landing, Lord Petyr Baelish reminds the small council that some years past, Varys had reported that Selyse had taken up with a red priest. The councilors decide to use Melisandre's religion and the greyscale of Princess Shireen Baratheon to discredit Stannis.[20]\n\nStannis's brother Renly, Lord of Storm's End, has also declared himself king, and has gathered the support from most stormlanders and men from the Reach. When Stannis sets sail from Dragonstone to besiege Storm's End, Melisandre accompanies him. She urges Stannis to meet with Renly and give him a last chance to swear his loyalty to Stannis.[10] During the meeting, she serves as Stannis's standard bearer.[14] Melisandre had previously seen Renly's death in her flames,[1] and outside the walls of Storm's End[12] she creates a shadow which kills Renly the morning he is to march to battle against Stannis. Catelyn Stark feels Stannis's presence in Renly's pavilion and blames him for Renly's death.[22]\n\nStannis begins to have terrible nightmares after Renly's death, and only Melisandre can soothe him to sleep.[12] Although many stormlords join Stannis after Renly's death, some loyal forces continue to hold Storm's End, and Ser Loras Tyrell returns to Bitterbridge to take control over sixty thousand men Renly had left behind.[23]\n\nThe castellan of Storm's End, Ser Cortnay Penrose, refuses to yield the castle or his ward, Edric Storm. Stannis tells Ser Davos Seaworth that Melisandre has foreseen that Cortnay will die within a day. He also reveals that she has seen Renly smashing Stannis's forces beneath the walls of King's Landing, but Stannis believes that Renly's death has prevented that scenario from happening. At night Stannis has Davos row Melisandre into a tunnel underneath Storm's End, where she births a shadow which Davos recognizes as Stannis's.[12] Cortnay is then thrown to his death by the shadow,[24] though his death is made to look like he jumped from a tower.[25] After Lord Elwood Meadows surrenders Storm's End to Stannis,[26] Melisandre has her king burn the castle's ancient godswood.[27]\n\nWith Storm's End taken, Stannis is ready to march on King's Landing. By stating that men might say Stannis owes his crown to Melisandre's spells if he allows her to take part in the battle to come, Lord Bryce Caron convinces Stannis to send Melisandre back to Dragonstone, where she resides while Stannis and his forces fight at the capital.[28] Stannis is defeated in the Battle of the Blackwater, however, after the arrival of the armies of Lords Tywin Lannister and Mace Tyrell.[29][30] Ser Garlan Tyrell, leading Tywin's vanguard,[31] wears Renly's green armor during the charge of the newcomers,[32] making Melisandre's vision of Renly in his green armor defeating Stannis's forces underneath the walls of King's Landing[12] come true, after a fashion.\n\nMelisandre and Selyse burn Lord Guncer Sunglass and the surviving sons of Ser Hubard Rambton as sacrifices to R'hllor while Stannis is attacking King's Landing.[31]\n\nWhen Davos returns to Dragonstone from Blackwater Bay,[33] Stannis refuses to see anyone but Melisandre. Davos is determined to kill Melisandre,[31] believing her to be responsible for the defeat on the Blackwater and subsequently the deaths of his four eldest sons.[31] According to Melisandre, she learned of this plan through her flames,[18] and Davos is arrested.[31] She later visits Davos in the dungeon, and admits to him that she dare not make another shadow son with Stannis, as it might kill him. Melisandre suggests making one with Davos, but Davos refuses.[18]\n\nMelisandre tells Stannis there is power in a king's blood, and she wishes to sacrifice Edric Storm, the acknowledged bastard son of the late King Robert I Baratheon, to \"wake the stone dragon\". Both Melisandre and Stannis are convinced of the need to quickly unite the Seven Kingdoms under one king, in preparation for the battle against the Great Other, about whom Melisandre has shown Stannis visions in the flames.[10] Stannis refuses to allow Melisandre to sacrifice Edric, however, and the king instead throws leeches filled with Edric's blood into the flames while stating the names of the \"three false kings:\" Balon Greyjoy, Robb Stark, and Joffrey Baratheon.[10]\n\nIn time, Balon falls from Pyke[34] and Robb is killed at the Red Wedding.[35] Melisandre claims it was R'hllor's doing and warns that \"false kings\" will take up the crowns of those who have fallen.[6] When Davos points out that Joffrey is still alive, Stannis refuses Melisandre once more. However, Stannis implies to Davos that he will be willing to sacrifice Edric should Joffrey die.[6]\n\nWhen Davos learns that Joffrey has died at his own royal wedding,[36] he enlists the help of some king's men to smuggle Edric from Dragonstone. Davos reads Stannis and Melisandre a letter from Maester Aemon at Castle Black, informing the realm of the threats the Night's Watch is facing and asking for aid,[11] which neither Stannis nor Melisandre knew about.[6]\n\nWhen Stannis sails for the Wall, Melisandre sacrifices Lord Alester Florent to her god to gain favorable winds for the voyage north.[7][37] Riding west from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Melisandre kills Orell's eagle with fire, making the skinchanger Varamyr go mad from pain and lose control of his other animals during the battle beneath the Wall.[38][13]\n\nMelisandre holds her nightfires at Castle Black.[13] She brings Jon Snow to Stannis, and when Stannis offers to make Jon Lord of Winterfell, she urges Jon to burn the weirwoods and accept Winterfell as a gift from R'hllor. Stannis claims to Jon that Melisandre has seen in her flames that the wildlings will return.[13]\n\nIn a meeting with the high officers of the Night's Watch, Melisandre informs the black brothers that they have to hold nightfires at their gates as a way to battle their enemy. Maester Aemon recognizes she is speaking about the war for the dawn, and asks about the prince that was promised. Melisandre informs him Stannis is the prophesied prince.[39]\n\nWith Stannis intending to have Mance Rayder executed, Melisandre plans to sacrifice him to R'hllor to wake a dragon with the blood of Mance, the King-Beyond-the-Wall.[40] Jon sends Maester Aemon to Oldtown, fearing that Melisandre might otherwise eventually give Aemon to the flames, since he is the son of King Maekar I Targaryen.[40] Jon makes the wildling girl Gilly, who has been nursing both her own infant son and Mance's infant son, accompany Aemon. He secretly forces Gilly to take Mance's son with her, pretending he is her own child, to save Mance's son from Melisandre's flames.[41][42]\n\nWhile sailing on Cinnamon Wind, Aemon tells Sam that Melisandre has misread the signs and deceived herself into believing that Stannis is the prince that was promised. The dying maester now believes that Daenerys Targaryen fits the prophecy.[43]\n\nMelisandre walks atop the Wall every night with Stannis.[15] She is present for a meeting between Stannis and Jon Snow, the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and walks Jon back to his chambers afterwards. Melisandre tells him that she will ask R'hllor for guidance about what to do with Mance, whom Stannis plans to burn, after Jon insists that Mance could be useful to them. She warns Jon to watch out for enemies, stating that she has seen him surrounded by enemies in her flames, and daggers in the dark.[15]\n\nDespite Jon's efforts to change the king's mind, Stannis is determined to sacrifice Mance. Melisandre places a glamor over him, making him appear to be the wildling Rattleshirt. Rattleshirt, in turn, is glamored to look like Mance, and killed in his place.[5][8] Melisandre also destroys the so-called Horn of Joramun.[8] She keeps Mance disguised at Castle Black, and offers his service to Jon Snow, who refuses in the impression that Mance is Rattleshirt.[4] Stannis and Melisandre allow the wildlings south of the Wall, making them swear to R'hllor.[8] The wildlings feign loyalty to R'hllor, however, and in secret keep faith in the old gods.[44]\n\nMelisandre remains at Castle Black when Stannis marches for the northern mountains,[4] attended to by a dozen greybeards, cripples, and drunkards, including Merrel and Morgan. Although Melisandre feels safe without them, she keeps a pair of guards with her for appearances. Judging that Davos has lost enough sons, Melisandre requests Stannis to leave Devan Seaworth, Davos's eldest surviving son, at Castle Black as well, to keep him safe. The youth becomes fascinated with the beautiful woman.[5]\n\nMelisandre's powers are much stronger at the Wall, and she constantly searches her fires for visions. When she looks into the flames, she sees a “wooden face, corpse white” with a thousand red eyes, accompanied by a boy with a wolf's face. She assumes that they are servants of the Great Other. She asks to see Azor Ahai, hoping for Stannis, but sees only Jon surrounded by skulls, his face changing between that of a man and that of a wolf.[5] She continues to hold her nightfires every evening, but as Stannis has taken most of his men with him, not many people attend.[9]\n\nShortly after Jon receives a letter announcing the upcoming wedding of Ramsay Bolton and Arya Stark, Melisandre informs him that she has seen Arya in her flames, a grey girl, fleeing from her marriage on a dying horse. She tells Jon that she can show him how to use his \"power\", but he remains wary of her. She then warns Jon that she has seen that three of the nine rangers he has sent out will die, and that she has seen their faces with empty sockets, weeping blood.[9]\n\nMelisandre tells Mance they can only win Jon's trust by rescuing his sister. Melisandre finds Jon north of the Wall, where the heads of Black Jack Bulwer, Hairy Hal, and Garth Greyfeather have been impaled by the Weeper, making the first of her predictions come true. Jon asks her to look in her flames for the other six rangers. He informs her that Ser Denys Mallister at the Shadow Tower believes the wildlings might try to force their way across the Bridge of Skulls, and Melisandre tells him that she has seen towers by the sea submerged beneath a black and bloody tide. Though she acknowledges to herself that the towers in her vision do not look like those at Eastwatch, Melisandre claims the attack will fall there when asked by Jon.[5] She takes Jon to her chambers, where she suggests sending \"Rattleshirt\" south to save Arya. When Jon protests, she reveals Mance's true identity to him.[5] Claiming to be a bard named \"Abel\", Mance travels to Winterfell with six spearwives to rescue Arya.[43][45]\n\nMelisandre's second prediction comes true when Alys Karstark—not Arya—arrives at Castle Black, fleeing from her cousin Cregan, who wants to force a marriage between them as to lay claim on Karhold.[46] Selyse Florent, who has arrived from Eastwatch, agrees to marry Alys to Sigorn, the Magnar of the Thenns, and Melisandre performs the ceremony.[47] The priestess thinks that Patchface, the fool with Selyse, is dangerous.[47]\n\nWhen Jon plans to send men to Hardhome on a rescue mission, Melisandre urges him not to,[19] claiming it is a lost cause and that she has seen that none of Cotter Pyke's rescue ships will return.[48] Despite Melisandre's warnings to Jon, he is betrayed in the mutiny at Castle Black.[48]\n\nDavid J. Peterson, the official language creator for the television adaptations of Martin's works, devised the High Valyrian word for the color red, mele, from the inspiration of Melisandre and Meleys.[50]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nMelisandre is regarded as a beautiful woman by many.[1] She has long hair the color of deep burnished copper,[1] unsettling red eyes,[6][7] and pale, unblemished skin.[1] The priestess is slender, graceful, and taller than most knights.[1] Melisandre has full breasts, a narrow waist, and a heart-shaped face.[1] She has a deep voice[1] which sounds melodic[8][9] and might make a listener envision anise, nutmeg, and cloves.[8]\n\nMelisandre speaks the Common Tongue of Westeros with rich accents of the Jade Sea[1] and Essos.[10] She also speaks High Valyrian and the speech of Asshai.[2] She sings loudly and clearly.[11]\n\nAs is the custom of red priests, Melisandre always dresses in long red fabric.[2][12][13] She wears bloodred fabric underneath a silk gown the color of bright fire on one occasion,[1] and robes of scarlet satin and blood velvet on another.[2] The priestess also wears a scarlet cloak.[14][12] She is never without a red gold choker containing a ruby which fits tightly around her neck.[1] When Melisandre works magic, the ruby setting glows with power,[6] and it may be able to burn her if the magic worked is particularly demanding.[5] The priestess claims to never be cold, despite weather conditions,[13] and she gives off noticeable heat.[15][5]\n\nMelisandre has the ability to see visions in the flames, and completely trusts in the power of her god, R'hllor.
