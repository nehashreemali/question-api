  "content": "Drogo is a powerful khal of the Dothraki. Daenerys Targaryen is promised to the warlord at the beginning of A Song of Ice and Fire.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Drogo is portrayed by Jason Momoa.[6]\n\nLike most Dothraki, Drogo has copper-colored skin,[2] thick black hair,[7] and almond-shaped eyes[8] the color of onyx.[2] Tall and muscular, he moves gracefully like a panther.[2] The khal has a long, black moustache,[8] and he binds his thick mustachios with gold and bronze rings.[2] A long black braid, scented with oils[2] and decorated with tiny bells of silver[7] or gold,[8] hangs down to his thighs, symbolizing his status among the Dothraki as an undefeated warlord.[2] Daenerys Targaryen thinks that Drogo has a hard and cruel face when she is introduced to him.[2]\n\nA skilled warrior,[2][9] the khal can be tender[7] and protective.[10]\n\nThe bare-chested[8][9] Drogo wears horsehide trousers[8] and painted vests,[10] with his favorite vest being old and faded.[11] He owns a heavy belt of solid gold medallions[8] and a wide belt with heavy medallions of silver, gold, and bronze.[10] The khal wields an arakh,[12] a whip,[11] and a dragonbone bow.[11] Drogo's favorite horse is a lean red stallion, unnamed, as it is not a Dothraki custom to give individual names to animals.[13]\n\nDrogo has a wooden feasting hall with timbered walls and a silk roof in the sacred Dothraki city of Vaes Dothrak.[1] He also possesses a nine-towered manse in Pentos, given to him by the city's ruling magisters as part of their policy of bribing the Dothraki not to loot the Free City.[2]\n\nCohollo, Qotho, and Haggo serve Drogo as bloodriders.[7]\n\nDrogo's father was Khal Bharbo.[10] Cohollo was pledged to the khalakka, or prince, while Drogo was still a child, and he saved young Drogo's life from sellswords on one occasion.[1] Bharbo gave his son a whip when Drogo reached manhood.[11]\n\nBy the age of thirty,[2] Drogo leads a khalasar with forty thousand warriors,[7][1] the largest on the Dothraki sea. The khal has never been defeated in battle.[2] He has given a tall grey stallion to Jhogo.[9]\n\nMagister Illyrio Mopatis, serving as patron to the exiled Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen, arranges a marriage between Princess Daenerys and Khal Drogo during one of Drogo's visits to Pentos. In return for his bride, Drogo is to provide ten thousand Dothraki warriors for her brother's campaign to retake the Iron Throne.[2]\n\nThe wedding takes place in the traditional Dothraki fashion, with Drogo's entire khalasar gathering in a field outside Pentos for a day-long feast, punctuated with several deadly fights and couples having intercourse in the open. In accordance with tradition, Drogo's bloodriders offer fine weapons—a whip, an arakh, and a dragonbone bow—to the new khaleesi, who then gives them to her husband. Drogo's own gift to his bride is a magnificent silver mare. When they ride off to consummate the marriage, Daenerys is terrified of her bridegroom and expects to be raped. Despite his fierce reputation, however, Drogo proves to be a surprisingly considerate lover. Although he and Dany share no common language, he establishes that he understands the word \"no,\" then begins touching her gently, trying to arouse her. He does not begin to have intercourse with her until Dany expresses her approval and initiates it.[7]\n\nDrogo initially ignores Daenerys as his khalasar rides to Vaes Dothrak, only visiting the uncomfortable girl in her tent at night to roughly copulate with her. After Daenerys has a dragon dream, however, she gradually becomes more confident. Daenerys's new role as khaleesi takes her out of her abusive brother's control. After learning seduction techniques from Doreah, Daenerys initiates sex with Drogo outside of her tent, impressing the khal.[13] As Daenerys's new role as khaleesi takes her out of her abusive brother's control, and Daenerys learns from Jhiqui that she is pregnant.[13]\n\nAs Daenerys learns to speak the Dothraki language, Drogo begins to learn the Common Tongue of Westeros, though he has a strong accent.[8] Drogo addresses Daenerys affectionately as \"moon of my life,\"[8] while she calls him \"my sun and stars.\"[1] After Daenerys eats a stallion heart in front of the dosh khaleen of Vaes Dothrak, she and Drogo have sex by the Womb of the World.[8] The dosh khaleen proclaim that Drogo and Daenerys's unborn child, Rhaego, will be the stallion who mounts the world, a prophesied leader in Dothraki legend.[8]\n\nUnlike Daenerys, Viserys shows nothing but contempt for Dothraki culture and becomes increasingly impatient for the aid Khal Drogo had promised him. A drunken Viserys breaks the ancient taboo against bloodshed in Vaes Dothrak by drawing his blade and threatening the life of Daenerys and her unborn child, demanding his crown. Announcing that Viserys will have the crown of gold he deserves, Drogo sidesteps the prohibition against spilling blood in the sacred city by first melting down his belt of gold medallions Drogo and upending the pot of molten gold over Viserys's head, killing him.[8]\n\nDrogo and his bloodriders hunt a hrakkar. It rakes Drogo through his leggings, scarring his leg. He returns to Vaes Dothrak with the carcass slung across a packhorse.[10] Drogo has little interest in invading Westeros, a land that holds nothing in particular that the Dothraki want and is located across the narrow sea, which they have always feared. However, he reconsiders after a wineseller tries to poison Daenerys in the Western Market and claim King Robert I Baratheon's reward. Enraged by the attempt on his wife's life, Drogo reaffirms his commitment to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her sake and seat their son on the throne of her ancestors.[10]\n\nDrogo pillages several towns in Lhazar to harvest slaves to exchange for warships that will take his horde across the sea. While in Lhazar, Drogo's khalasar defeats the rival khalasar of Khal Ogo. Drogo is shot in the arm by an arrow, and one of Ogo's bloodriders cuts off Drogo's left nipple, leaving a flap of bloody skin. Drogo slays the bloodrider and then Ogo himself.[9] Although he does not understand or share her objections to the traditional Dothraki practices of raping and enslaving conquered peoples, Drogo supports Daenerys when she orders his warriors to cease raping the Lhazareen, delighted by his wife's growing courage.[9]\n\nThough Drogo is unconcerned with his seemingly minor wound, Daenerys convinces him to let Mirri Maz Duur, a Lhazareen maegi she had rescued, make him a poultice. The poultice itches, however, and Drogo tears it off, causing the wound to fester. Drogo's condition deteriorates until he falls from his horse, a symbolic event in Dothraki culture that indicates he is no longer fit to lead.[14]\n\nAs Drogo lingers near death, Daenerys convinces Mirri to use her bloodmagic to preserve his life by sacrificing his stallion.[14] Alarmed by the ceremony, Drogo's bloodriders try to intervene but are defeated by Daenerys's khas and Ser Jorah.[14] The maegi betrays Daenerys in revenge for the attack on her village, and the ritual leave Drogo in a catatonic state while causing Rhaego to die in Daenerys's womb.[12] Drogo's khalasar breaks apart, with Pono and Jhaqo leading the largest of the dozen new hosts. Daenerys bathes Drogo, leads him out into the night, and fails in an attempt to arouse him. Realizing that Drogo will never return to his former state, Dany smothers him with a pillow.[12]\n\nDrogo and his treasures are piled upon a funeral pyre, and Daenerys places the three petrified dragon eggs given to her by Illyrio about Drogo's body. Daenerys burns Drogo on the platform along with a bound Mirri Maz Duur. Daenerys enters the conflagration as the platform burns and collapses. The flames magically trade life for life, killing the maegi and hatching three small dragons while leaving Daenerys unharmed.[11]\n\nDaenerys names her black hatchling dragon Drogon after her late husband.[15] She wears the pelt of the hrakkar slain by Drogo as a hooded cloak.[15]\n\nIn Vaes Tolorro, after talking with Ser Jorah Mormont about some of his past and his second wife, Lynesse Hightower, Daenerys realizes that the knight desires her. Daenerys realizes that she does not feel that way about Jorah and compares him unfavorably with Drogo.[15] Daenerys dreams of Drogo and the first ride they had taken together on the night they were wed. In the dream it is not horses they rode, but dragons.[15]\n\nRecalling Drogo's fate, Daenerys insists that Strong Belwas be treated for his cut after fighting Oznak zo Pahl outside Meereen.[16]\n\nNow Queen of Meereen, Daenerys continues to wear the lion pelt given to her by Drogo.[17] Before her wedding to Hizdahr zo Loraq, Daenerys recalls her first night with Drogo.[18]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nLike most Dothraki, Drogo has copper-colored skin,[2] thick black hair,[7] and almond-shaped eyes[8] the color of onyx.[2] Tall and muscular, he moves gracefully like a panther.[2] The khal has a long, black moustache,[8] and he binds his thick mustachios with gold and bronze rings.[2] A long black braid, scented with oils[2] and decorated with tiny bells of silver[7] or gold,[8] hangs down to his thighs, symbolizing his status among the Dothraki as an undefeated warlord.[2] Daenerys Targaryen thinks that Drogo has a hard and cruel face when she is introduced to him.[2]\n\nA skilled warrior,[2][9] the khal can be tender[7] and protective.[10]\n\nThe bare-chested[8][9] Drogo wears horsehide trousers[8] and painted vests,[10] with his favorite vest being old and faded.[11] He owns a heavy belt of solid gold medallions[8] and a wide belt with heavy medallions of silver, gold, and bronze.[10] The khal wields an arakh,[12] a whip,[11] and a dragonbone bow.[11] Drogo's favorite horse is a lean red stallion, unnamed, as it is not a Dothraki custom to give individual names to animals.[13]\n\nDrogo has a wooden feasting hall with timbered walls and a silk roof in the sacred Dothraki city of Vaes Dothrak.[1] He also possesses a nine-towered manse in Pentos, given to him by the city's ruling magisters as part of their policy of bribing the Dothraki not to loot the Free City.[2]\n\nCohollo, Qotho, and Haggo serve Drogo as bloodriders.[7]\n\n\n## History\n\n\nDrogo's father was Khal Bharbo.[10] Cohollo was pledged to the khalakka, or prince, while Drogo was still a child, and he saved young Drogo's life from sellswords on one occasion.[1] Bharbo gave his son a whip when Drogo reached manhood.[11]\n\nBy the age of thirty,[2] Drogo leads a khalasar with forty thousand warriors,[7][1] the largest on the Dothraki sea.
