  "content": "Rickard Stark was Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, and head of House Stark during the reign of King Aerys II Targaryen. He was the only child of Lord Edwyle Stark and Lady Marna Locke.[3] Rickard was the father of the current Lord of Winterfell, Eddard Stark.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Rickard is portrayed by Wayne Foskett in a Season 6 flashback.\n\nIn the crypts of Winterfell, there is a statue of Rickard at his tomb, which is flanked by those of his eldest son, Brandon, and his daughter, Lyanna. Rickard's engraving is said to match his appearance in life with a long, stern face and quiet dignity,[4] and Theon Greyjoy thinks the statue's eyes look sad.[5] There is a stone direwolf at the statue's feet.[6]\n\nAccording to Barbrey Dustin, Rickard was ambitious.[5]\n\nRickard was born at Winterfell[2] the only child of Lord Edwyle Stark and Lady Marna Locke.[3] Rickard married his cousin once removed, Lyarra Stark, and had four children: Brandon (b. 262 AC), Eddard (b. 263 AC), Lyanna (b. 266 AC or 267 AC), and Benjen. Lord Rickard visited King's Landing in 264 AC, leading King Aerys II Targaryen to consider building another Wall and claiming more land in the far north.[8] Lady Olenna Redwyne was loosely acquainted with Rickard.[9]\n\nAfter killing a miller and raping his wife, Lord Roose Bolton had the tongue cut out from the miller's brother to prevent Lord Rickard from learning what happened.[10]\n\nRickard negotiated the betrothal of his heir Brandon to Catelyn Tully of Riverrun.[4] According to a semi-canon source, Rickard accepted a betrothal between his daughter Lyanna and Lord Robert Baratheon of Storm's End when his younger son Eddard carried Robert's proposal to Winterfell.[11] According to Barbrey Dustin, both proposed marriages were the idea of Rickard's maester at the time, Walys.[12]\n\nIn 282 AC, Brandon was traveling to meet Rickard's party coming down from the north in preparation of Brandon's wedding to Catelyn, when news of Lyanna's abduction at the hand of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen reached him.[13] Brandon went to King's Landing with a small company of young nobles to challenge Rhaegar, but was imprisoned with his companions by King Aerys II Targaryen on the charge of conspiring to kill the crown prince in the Red Keep. Aerys next summoned Rickard and the fathers of Brandon's companions to come and answer for the crimes of their sons.[7]\n\nRickard demanded a trial by combat, which was granted by the king. According to Ser Jaime Lannister, Rickard expected to fight one of the Kingsguard. Dressed in his steel armor, he was brought to the throne room, where King Aerys II declared that fire was the champion of House Targaryen. Rickard was suspended from the rafters, and a fire was lit beneath him by the pyromancers. Rickard was slowly cooked to death in his armor, while his son Brandon, with a Tyroshi noose around his neck and a sword just out of his reach, was made to watch his father roast. Trying to reach the sword to save his dying father, Brandon strangled himself.[7] Ser Gerold Hightower and Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard were among those present for Rickard's and Brandon's execution. The other nobles and their sons were also executed by Aerys, with the exception of Ethan Glover.[7]\n\nRickard was succeeded by his second son, Eddard. Together with Lords Jon Arryn, Hoster Tully, and Robert Baratheon, Eddard was a leader of Robert's Rebellion, the revolt against the Targaryens that overthrew their dynasty. Some have blamed Rickard's alliances for the near fall of House Stark.[14]\n\nLord Eddard did not reveal the true manner of Rickard's death to his family; both his wife Catelyn and his son Bran believed Rickard was beheaded.[6][7]\n\nLord Eddard Stark sees the tomb of his father when King Robert I Baratheon visits the crypt of Winterfell.[4]\n\nRickard appears in Theon Greyjoy's nightmare of King Robert's feast of the dead at Winterfell.[15]\n\nMeera Reed takes the heavy sword from Rickard's tomb when Bran Stark and his companions leave the crypt.[16]\n\nSer Jaime Lannister recalls that he stood by and did nothing when King Aerys II Targaryen executed Rickard and Brandon Stark.[17]\n\nBarbrey Dustin, Lady of Barrowton, tells Theon Greyjoy about Rickard and Maester Walys.[5]\n\nRickard was an only child.[3][18] However, according to Old Nan, Rickard might have had a baby brother named Brandon, who died of a summer fever at the age of three.[19] This Brandon is actually Rickard's half-uncle.[3]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nIn the crypts of Winterfell, there is a statue of Rickard at his tomb, which is flanked by those of his eldest son, Brandon, and his daughter, Lyanna.
