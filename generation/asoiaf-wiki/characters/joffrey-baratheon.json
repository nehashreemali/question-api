  "content": "Prince Joffrey Baratheon is known to the Seven Kingdoms as the eldest son and heir of King Robert I Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. A member of House Baratheon of King's Landing, his siblings are Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Joffrey is portrayed by Jack Gleeson.[13]\n\nJoffrey has the Lannister look[14] and is tall and strong for a boy his age,[15] with blond curly hair.[16] Known to be handsome,[17][15] he has deep green eyes and pouty lips.[16] Jon Snow thinks that Joffrey looks like a girl.[17]\n\nTwelve years old at the beginning of A Song of Ice and Fire,[16] Joffrey was strong-willed as a child.[18] Although he can be gallant[17][19] and courteous,[20] he has an uncontrollable temper not unlike his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister, and an unchecked sadistic streak.[21] Joffrey is stubborn and unpredictable.[22] The prince can be vengeful,[23] and Lord Tywin Lannister finds his grandson's decisions foolish.[24][4]\n\nJoffrey has no close friends, and he sees his sworn sword, Sandor Clegane, as a father figure.[25]\n\nJoffrey's surcout is divided, showing both the Baratheon stag of his father, King Robert I, and the Lannister lion of his mother, Queen Cersei.[17] He always wears the finest clothing and accents, as befits the royal heir,[16] including blue wool,[26] black leather,[26] and a deep blue doublet studded with a double row of golden lion's heads.[20] The prince possesses a slim coronet made of gold and sapphires.[20] Joffrey wields a longsword named Lion's Tooth,[26] and his dagger has a jeweled pommel and inlaid goldwork on the blade.[12]\n\nJoffrey is a skilled dancer.[27] He rides his blood bay courser with reckless abandon.[26]\n\nJoffrey grew up as a spoiled and indulgent child with a cruel streak within him. His father, King Robert I Baratheon, is deeply disappointed with his son and feels little affection for Joffrey[28],[29] nor did he like the fact that Joffrey would always cry whenever Robert picked him up.[30] It is implied that Joffrey craves Robert's respect and approval, and many of his acts are done in an effort to live up to his father's standards.[31]\n\nOnce after learning a kitchen cat was pregnant, Joffrey killed the animal and cut open its belly to see the kittens inside. He showed one of the unborn kittens to his father. Robert was so shocked and angry he hit Joffrey so hard it knocked out two of his baby teeth.[32] Queen Cersei Lannister believes Robert would have beaten the boy if she had allowed it.[33] It is also implied Joffrey bullied his younger brother, Tommen.[5]\n\nCersei assigned Sandor Clegane to be her son's sworn shield.[26] While Sandor is widely known as the Hound, Joffrey refers to his guardian as \"dog\".[34]\n\nFor Joffrey's twelfth name day, King Robert organized a tourney in King's Landing in 298 AC, where, amongst others, Lord Walder Frey, Lord Jon Arryn, Lord Stannis Baratheon, and Ser Davos Seaworth were present.[1][35][36] Following the tourney, Joffrey and his siblings traveled with Cersei to Casterly Rock with their grandfather, Lord Tywin Lannister.[37]\n\nJoffrey and the rest of the royal family take the kingsroad to Winterfell after Lord Jon Arryn's death, as King Robert I Baratheon asks Lord Eddard Stark to become the new Hand of the King.[1] Joffrey begins to court the pretty Sansa Stark, Eddard's eldest daughter, to whom he has been betrothed.[38][17] Joffrey spars with Robb Stark in the yard and insults him, wanting to fight with live steel instead of practice swords.[17] He later joins his father during a hunt.[39]\n\nAfter Bran Stark is critically injured after falling from the First Keep, Joffrey's uncle, Tyrion Lannister, slaps Joffrey for speaking rudely of the boy's condition.[40] Tyrion is later blamed[41] when an assassin with a Valyrian steel dagger fails in an attempt to murder the comatose Bran, which furthers the growing enmity between Houses Stark and Lannister.[42]\n\nOn the way from Winterfell to King's Landing, Joffrey spends a day riding and drinking wine with Sansa. Along the Trident, they come upon Arya Stark and her friend Mycah, a  butcher's boy, who are practicing sword fighting. A drunk Joffrey commands Mycah to spar with him. When Mycah does not take up the challenge, Joffrey pricks him with his sword, Lion's Tooth, while ignoring pleas to leave the boy alone. Arya smacks him with her stick, allowing Mycah to escape. An enraged Joffrey slashes at Arya, but is injured when her direwolf, Nymeria, protects her.[26] Arya takes Lion's Tooth from him and hurls it into the river. Humiliated and in pain, Joffrey angrily lashes out at Sansa while Arya and Nymeria flee.[26]\n\nJoffrey later claims before his father's court at Darry that he had been attacked by Mycah and Nymeria. Search parties are sent out to find Mycah, Nymeria and Arya. Sandor Clegane rides down Mycah, while Sansa's direwolf, Lady, is executed after Queen Cersei Lannister interferes. This earns Joffrey the hatred of Arya. Robert's younger brother, Lord Renly Baratheon, openly laughs at his nephew for being beaten and disarmed by a girl younger than him.[43]\n\nWhile drinking with Eddard Stark at the Hand's tourney at King's Landing, King Robert openly despairs of his son and heir, revealing to his old friend that he has often thought of abdicating; the only thing that stops him is the thought of Joffrey sitting on the Iron Throne with his mother whispering in his ear.[44]\n\nAs the new Hand, Ned Stark discovers that Joffrey, along with his siblings, are actually bastards born of incest between Cersei and her twin, Ser Jaime of Robert's Kingsguard.[45][46] Robert never questioned the boy's parentage. Cersei protects her children's secret by arranging for Robert's death by increasing the strength of his favorite wine which he drinks while hunting in the kingswood.[47][48]\n\nFollowing Robert's death, Joffrey summons the council and commands that they make arrangements for his coronation as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. When Ned produces Robert's will, which declares Ned regent and mentions \"the heir\" rather than specifying Joffrey as heir to the Iron Throne, Cersei tears it up and advises Ned to swear fealty to her son. Ned in turn reveals that Joffrey has no claim to the throne and that his uncle, Lord Stannis Baratheon, is the true heir, but Eddard is quickly arrested for treason.[48]\n\nAfter taking the Iron Throne as Robert's heir, Joffrey starts his first court session by naming his grandfather, Lord Tywin Lannister, as the new Hand of the King, appointing his mother Cersei to the small council, and rewarding Janos Slynt with Harrenhal. Against all traditions, Joffrey dismisses the legendary Ser Barristan Selmy from his service and names Jaime Lannister as the new Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. When Barristan storms out in disgust, making a remark about the ease with which Stannis would take the throne from him, Joffrey orders the knight seized and questioned,[34] though Barristan the Bold escapes.[49] The vacancy on the Kingsguard is filled by Joffrey's sworn shield, Sandor Clegane, the first person to serve with the White Swords without having earned knighthood.[34]\n\nFurther during the court session, Sansa, to whom Joffrey is still betrothed, kneels and begs for him to spare her father Eddard's life, asking that Joffrey to do this for love of her. Joffrey promises Sansa that he will be merciful.[34] However, after Eddard publicly confesses his crimes at the Great Sept of Baelor and declares that Joffrey is the true heir to the Iron Throne, Joffrey's mercy turns out to be Eddard's public beheading by Ser Ilyn Payne before Sansa's eyes.[23] This rash act is against his family's wishes to minimize further bloodshed and restore the king's peace and leads to the intensification of hostilities.[24]\n\nEddard's son Robb captures Jaime in the Whispering Wood[50] and is declared the King in the North at Riverrun after the Battle of the Camps.[51] Robb intends to kill Joffrey in retaliation for Ned's death,[51] plunging Westeros into devastating civil war.\n\nJoffrey has Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard strike Sansa on his behalf, and he forces her to look at severed heads on the walls of the Red Keep, including those of her father Eddard and Septa Mordane. Joffrey threatens to force Sansa to look on her brother Robb's head when he kills him, as he boasts, in single combat. Sansa briefly considers pushing Joffrey to his death, but relents.[52] Joffrey fancies himself a warrior, and he considers leading the City Watch of King's Landing into the field. Cersei withholds the news of Renly's coronation at Highgarden from Joffrey lest he insist on marching against him.[24]\n\nStannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and the brother of King Renly and the late King Robert, has his supporters spread the message that Joffrey and his siblings, Prince Tommen and Princess Myrcella, are bastard abominations. Stannis presses his own claim to the Iron Throne.[36][53] After Renly's death at Storm's End, Stannis hopes to present Robert's bastard, Edric Storm, as proof that Joffrey is illegitimate.[54] Arya Stark, incognito in the riverlands, includes Joffrey in a list of those she wants dead.[55]\n\nSer Arys Oakheart tells Sansa Stark that smallfolk refer to the red comet as King Joffrey's Comet. During a small tourney held to honor the boy king's name day, Sansa convinces Joffrey to spare the life of the drunken Ser Dontos Hollard, who becomes Joffrey's new fool.[56] While Tywin Lannister is Joffrey's Hand of the King, Tywin is on campaign during the War of the Five Kings. Tyrion Lannister, Tywin's son and Joffrey's uncle, acts as Hand in Tywin's stead.[56]\n\nJoffrey rules with whim and caprice, proving difficult for even his mother to control, and he is fond of having men fight to the death.[56] Sansa becomes imprisoned to his will, and he frequently has his Kingsguard, with the exception of the Hound, beat her when she displeases him.[56] When Joffrey, furious after learning of the Battle of Oxcross, orders Ser Boros Blount to publicly strip Sansa naked and beat her, they are stopped by Tyrion.[21] Although Joffrey never tries it again, he is determined to eventually have Sansa in his bed whether he marries her or not.[30][57]\n\nJoffrey's cruelty and the decreased quality of life at King's Landing due to food shortages and other hardships make him an unpopular king. When a mob gathers at the Red Keep, the king has them dispersed with a volley of arrows which kills four; the king suggests the starving mob eat the slain.[58] Tensions culminate with bread riots sparked by Joffrey's temper, during which the royal retinue is forced to flee back to the Red Keep.[59] Acting as his temporary Hand, only Tyrion stands up to Joffrey's authority, and the king develops a special hatred for his uncle. Tyrion, in return, holds his nephew in contempt, viewing him as a monster.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Blackwater, Joffrey wears gilded mail and enameled crimson plate, with a golden lion on his helm, and he carries a new blade, Hearteater.[60] The king commands the Three Whores during the battle.[61] When Stannis's men begin to attack the gates of King's Landing, Cersei Lannister has Ser Osmund Kettleblack bring the king to the safety of the Red Keep. Although this leads many of the gold cloaks to abandon their posts[62] and the Hound's fear of wildfire causes him to flee,[63] Stannis is ultimately defeated by the arrival of Lords Tywin Lannister and Mace Tyrell.[62]\n\nFollowing the battle, Joffrey rewards many of the survivors in the throne room. The king puts aside his betrothal to Sansa and instead promises to wed Margaery Tyrell, Mace's daughter and the widow of Renly. He is excused from court after cutting his arm on the Iron Throne. Dontos tells Sansa of a plan for her to escape the capital, giving her a silver hair net with amethysts for her to wear on the night of Joffrey's wedding.[57]\n\nLord Tywin Lannister becomes Joffrey's Hand of the King, replacing Tyrion.[11] Most of Stannis Baratheon's supporters who survived the Blackwater submit to Joffrey.[64] At Dragonstone, Melisandre burns leeches which have fed on Edric Storm in attempts to kill Kings Joffrey, Balon Greyjoy, and Robb Stark.[65]\n\nSansa Stark informs Olenna Tyrell, Margaery's grandmother, of Joffrey's cruel personality, and the Tyrells plan to wed Sansa to Margaery's brother, Willas Tyrell.[14] Tywin, however, quickly arranges for Sansa to marry Tyrion. King Joffrey gives Sansa away during the wedding ceremony, though he discretely touches her breast while doing so. When Joffrey announces it is time for the bedding custom, Tyrion outrages the king by threatening to geld him in defense of his new wife.[27]\n\nJoffrey is delighted when he hears of Robb Stark's death at the Red Wedding and wants his head so he can serve it to Sansa at his own wedding, in addition to wanting to show no mercy to the northern and river lords who surrendered following Robb's death. Tywin instructs Joffrey to be merciful in victory, but then sends the king from his solar in the Tower of the Hand when Joffrey is insulting in response.[4]\n\nBefore his wedding, Joffrey receives a goldenheart bow from Jalabhar Xho, riding boots from Tanda Stokeworth, a jousting saddle from Kevan Lannister, scorpion brooch from Prince Oberyn Martell, silver spurs from Ser Addam Marbrand, and a tourney pavilion from Mathis Rowan. The king is presented with a model of a war galley by Lord Paxter Redwyne, who says King Joffrey's Valor is being built for him at the Arbor. Tyrion gives Joffrey a rare book, Lives of Four Kings, and Mace gifts him a seven-sided wedding chalice.[19]\n\nTywin gives his grandson a Valyrian steel sword as a wedding present, which Joffrey names Widow's Wail. Joffrey slices Lives of Four Kings with his new sword, demanding a better present from Tyrion and Sansa.[19] Since Joffrey boasts that he is no stranger to the metal, Tyrion thinks that Joffrey is referring to the Valyrian steel dagger given to the assassin at Winterfell, though he is unable to fathom why, attributing it to Joffrey's innate cruelty.[12] Jaime later deduces that Joffrey did it in an attempt to impress his father after overhearing a drunken Robert say it would be kinder to put the crippled Bran Stark out of his misery.[31]\n\nJoffrey's marriage to Margaery is on the first day of 300 AC at the Great Sept of Baelor.[12] During his wedding feast in the Red Keep's throne room, Joffrey pours wine from his new chalice atop Tyrion when his uncle refuses to join the dwarfs reenacting the War of the Five Kings, and the king forces Tyrion to serve as his cupbearer.[12] When Joffrey begins choking after eating pigeon pie and drinking wine, Ser Meryn Trant tries to save him by jamming a spoon down his throat. While the entire court looks on, Joffrey's face turns black as he asphyxiates while tearing at his throat. Joffrey lifts a hand in Tyrion's direction as he dies. Margaery's mother, Alerie Hightower, says that the king choked on his pie, but Cersei accuses Tyrion and Sansa of having poisoned her son.[12]\n\nWhile Tyrion is taken into custody by the Kingsguard, Sansa and Ser Dontos Hollard escape King's Landing and reach a ship in Blackwater Bay. Lord Petyr Baelish takes Sansa aboard the ship and then has Ser Lothor Brune's men kill Dontos.[66] Littlefinger reveals to Sansa that he orchestrated Joffrey's murder with Olenna Tyrell.[67] Due to the color of the amethysts in the unknowing Sansa's net[66] used to poison Joffrey's wine,[68] and the actual color of the wine, the wedding has since been referred to by fans as the Purple Wedding.\n\nJoffrey is laid in state in the Red Keep's royal sept in gilded armor, and when Jaime returns to King's Landing he makes love to Cersei in front of the corpse.[69] Joffrey is ultimately laid to rest in the Great Sept of Baelor.[70] Because Joffrey was poisoned, Jaime tasks Ser Boros Blount with tasting all of King Tommen I Baratheon's food and drink.[70] He refuses to recognize Joffrey as his son.[31]\n\nDuring Tyrion's trial for Joffrey's death, witnesses downplay the king's behavior and exaggerate Tyrion's actions.[71][72] Grand Maester Pycelle accuses Tyrion of having poisoned Joffrey with the strangler.[71] Tyrion demands trial by battle, and he is represented by Oberyn, who seeks vengeance for the death of his sister, Princess Elia of Dorne, who was killed years ago by the crown's representative, Ser Gregor Clegane, during the Sack of King's Landing. The Mountain kills the Red Viper in combat, however, and Tyrion is deemed to be guilty by the gods.[72]\n\nBefore Tyrion can be executed for Joffrey's death, Jaime frees his brother from the dungeon with the aid of Varys. Angry at Jaime having deceived him about his first wife, Tysha, Tyrion lies and takes responsibility for Joffrey's death. While escaping the Red Keep with Varys, Tyrion kills his father Tywin in the Tower of the Hand.[73]\n\nJoffrey, with the exception of his mother Cersei,[25] is not particularly mourned by anyone; even his biological father, Jaime, feels that Joffrey deserved his fate[31] and wants Tommen to be different.[74] Tyrion believes that Joffrey would have become a worse king than the Mad King.[73] Arys Oakheart thinks the only good thing that could be said of Joffrey is that he was tall and strong for his age.[15] Because of Joffrey, Ser Kevan Lannister considers Cersei to be an unfit mother.[75]\n\nAs Queen Regent, Cersei promises a lordship to whomever brings her Tyrion's head.[75]\n\nJoffrey's younger brother, King Tommen I Baratheon, weds his widow, Margaery Tyrell.[76] Cersei is troubled by Tommen's meekness in comparison to Joffrey.[75] Because Myrcella is older than Tommen, Arianne Martell tries[15] but fails to crown Myrcella as queen.[77]\n\nOne of Cersei's dromonds is named Brave Joffrey in the late king's honor.[25]\n\nHaving fled to Essos, Tyrion lies to Griff by claiming to have poisoned Joffrey at his wedding feast.[78]\n\nJoffrey Baratheon may be inspired by Edward of Lancaster.[79]\n\nThis page uses content from the English Wikipedia.

Search parties are sent out to find Mycah, Nymeria and Arya. Sandor Clegane rides down Mycah, while Sansa's direwolf, Lady, is executed after Queen Cersei Lannister interferes. This earns Joffrey the hatred of Arya. Robert's younger brother, Lord Renly Baratheon, openly laughs at his nephew for being beaten and disarmed by a girl younger than him.[43]\n\nWhile drinking with Eddard Stark at the Hand's tourney at King's Landing, King Robert openly despairs of his son and heir, revealing to his old friend that he has often thought of abdicating; the only thing that stops him is the thought of Joffrey sitting on the Iron Throne with his mother whispering in his ear.[44]\n\nAs the new Hand, Ned Stark discovers that Joffrey, along with his siblings, are actually bastards born of incest between Cersei and her twin, Ser Jaime of Robert's Kingsguard.[45][46] Robert never questioned the boy's parentage.

Stannis presses his own claim to the Iron Throne.[36][53] After Renly's death at Storm's End, Stannis hopes to present Robert's bastard, Edric Storm, as proof that Joffrey is illegitimate.[54] Arya Stark, incognito in the riverlands, includes Joffrey in a list of those she wants dead.[55]\n\nSer Arys Oakheart tells Sansa Stark that smallfolk refer to the red comet as King Joffrey's Comet.

Dontos tells Sansa of a plan for her to escape the capital, giving her a silver hair net with amethysts for her to wear on the night of Joffrey's wedding.[57]\n\n\n## A Storm of Swords\n\n\nLord Tywin Lannister becomes Joffrey's Hand of the King, replacing Tyrion.[11] Most of Stannis Baratheon's supporters who survived the Blackwater submit to Joffrey.[64] At Dragonstone, Melisandre burns leeches which have fed on Edric Storm in attempts to kill Kings Joffrey, Balon Greyjoy, and Robb Stark.[65]\n\nSansa Stark informs Olenna Tyrell, Margaery's grandmother, of Joffrey's cruel personality, and the Tyrells plan to wed Sansa to Margaery's brother, Willas Tyrell.[14] Tywin, however, quickly arranges for Sansa to marry Tyrion. King Joffrey gives Sansa away during the wedding ceremony, though he discretely touches her breast while doing so. When Joffrey announces it is time for the bedding custom, Tyrion outrages the king by threatening to geld him in defense of his new wife.[27]\n\nJoffrey is delighted when he hears of Robb Stark's death at the Red Wedding and wants his head so he can serve it to Sansa at his own wedding, in addition to wanting to show no mercy to the northern and river lords who surrendered following Robb's death. Tywin instructs Joffrey to be merciful in victory, but then sends the king from his solar in the Tower of the Hand when Joffrey is insulting in response.[4]\n\nBefore his wedding, Joffrey receives a goldenheart bow from Jalabhar Xho, riding boots from Tanda Stokeworth, a jousting saddle from Kevan Lannister, scorpion brooch from Prince Oberyn Martell, silver spurs from Ser Addam Marbrand, and a tourney pavilion from Mathis Rowan. The king is presented with a model of a war galley by Lord Paxter Redwyne, who says King Joffrey's Valor is being built for him at the Arbor. Tyrion gives Joffrey a rare book, Lives of Four Kings, and Mace gifts him a seven-sided wedding chalice.[19]\n\nTywin gives his grandson a Valyrian steel sword as a wedding present, which Joffrey names Widow's Wail. Joffrey slices Lives of Four Kings with his new sword, demanding a better present from Tyrion and Sansa.[19] Since Joffrey boasts that he is no stranger to the metal, Tyrion thinks that Joffrey is referring to the Valyrian steel dagger given to the assassin at Winterfell, though he is unable to fathom why, attributing it to Joffrey's innate cruelty.[12] Jaime later deduces that Joffrey did it in an attempt to impress his father after overhearing a drunken Robert say it would be kinder to put the crippled Bran Stark out of his misery.[31]\n\nJoffrey's marriage to Margaery is on the first day of 300 AC at the Great Sept of Baelor.[12] During his wedding feast in the Red Keep's throne room, Joffrey pours wine from his new chalice atop Tyrion when his uncle refuses to join the dwarfs reenacting the War of the Five Kings, and the king forces Tyrion to serve as his cupbearer.[12] When Joffrey begins choking after eating pigeon pie and drinking wine, Ser Meryn Trant tries to save him by jamming a spoon down his throat. While the entire court looks on, Joffrey's face turns black as he asphyxiates while tearing at his throat. Joffrey lifts a hand in Tyrion's direction as he dies. Margaery's mother, Alerie Hightower, says that the king choked on his pie, but Cersei accuses Tyrion and Sansa of having poisoned her son.[12]\n\nWhile Tyrion is taken into custody by the Kingsguard, Sansa and Ser Dontos Hollard escape King's Landing and reach a ship in Blackwater Bay. Lord Petyr Baelish takes Sansa aboard the ship and then has Ser Lothor Brune's men kill Dontos.[66] Littlefinger reveals to Sansa that he orchestrated Joffrey's murder with Olenna Tyrell.[67] Due to the color of the amethysts in the unknowing Sansa's net[66] used to poison Joffrey's wine,[68] and the actual color of the wine, the wedding has since been referred to by fans as the Purple Wedding.\n\nJoffrey is laid in state in the Red Keep's royal sept in gilded armor, and when Jaime returns to King's Landing he makes love to Cersei in front of the corpse.[69] Joffrey is ultimately laid to rest in the Great Sept of Baelor.[70] Because Joffrey was poisoned, Jaime tasks Ser Boros Blount with tasting all of King Tommen I Baratheon's food and drink.[70] He refuses to recognize Joffrey as his son.[31]\n\nDuring Tyrion's trial for Joffrey's death, witnesses downplay the king's behavior and exaggerate Tyrion's actions.[71][72] Grand Maester Pycelle accuses Tyrion of having poisoned Joffrey with the strangler.[71] Tyrion demands trial by battle, and he is represented by Oberyn, who seeks vengeance for the death of his sister, Princess Elia of Dorne, who was killed years ago by the crown's representative, Ser Gregor Clegane, during the Sack of King's Landing. The Mountain kills the Red Viper in combat, however, and Tyrion is deemed to be guilty by the gods.[72]\n\nBefore Tyrion can be executed for Joffrey's death, Jaime frees his brother from the dungeon with the aid of Varys. Angry at Jaime having deceived him about his first wife, Tysha, Tyrion lies and takes responsibility for Joffrey's death. While escaping the Red Keep with Varys, Tyrion kills his father Tywin in the Tower of the Hand.[73]\n\n\n## A Feast for Crows\n\n\nJoffrey, with the exception of his mother Cersei,[25] is not particularly mourned by anyone; even his biological father, Jaime, feels that Joffrey deserved his fate[31] and wants Tommen to be different.[74] Tyrion believes that Joffrey would have become a worse king than the Mad King.[73] Arys Oakheart thinks the only good thing that could be said of Joffrey is that he was tall and strong for his age.[15] Because of Joffrey, Ser Kevan Lannister considers Cersei to be an unfit mother.[75]\n\nAs Queen Regent, Cersei promises a lordship to whomever brings her Tyrion's head.[75]\n\nJoffrey's younger brother, King Tommen I Baratheon, weds his widow, Margaery Tyrell.[76] Cersei is troubled by Tommen's meekness in comparison to Joffrey.[75] Because Myrcella is older than Tommen, Arianne Martell tries[15] but fails to crown Myrcella as queen.[77]\n\nOne of Cersei's dromonds is named Brave Joffrey in the late king's honor.[25]\n\n\n## A Dance with Dragons\n\n\nHaving fled to Essos, Tyrion lies to Griff by claiming to have poisoned Joffrey at his wedding feast.[78]\n\n\n## Quotes by Joffrey\n\n\n\n## Quotes about Joffrey\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n\n\n## House Baratheon\n\n\n\n## House Lannister\n\n\n\n## Behind the Scenes\n\n\nJoffrey Baratheon may be inspired by Edward of Lancaster.[79]",
