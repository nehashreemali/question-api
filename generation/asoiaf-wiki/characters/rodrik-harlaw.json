  "content": "Rodrik Harlaw is the Lord of Harlaw, Lord of the Ten Towers, and head of House Harlaw. He is nicknamed Rodrik the Reader because he is always reading, which is uncommon amongst the ironborn.[3] He is the captain of the Sea Song.\n\nLord Harlaw's kin include Boremund the Blue, Ser Harras, Hotho, and Sigfryd Harlaw.[3] Other bannermen include Lords Myre, Kenning, Stonetree, and Volmark.[1]\n\nAn average-looking man, Rodrik has brown hair and eyes, and a short, neat beard that is grey. He has requested a Myrish lens to assist with his vision.[3]\n\nRodrik unsuccessfully advised Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, not to rebel against King Robert I Baratheon. Rodrik had two tall sons who died in the sea battle off Fair Isle during Greyjoy's Rebellion.[3]\n\nWhen the Faith of the Seven was still tolerated in the Iron Islands, Rodrik kept septons at Ten Towers to help care for his books, which he reads in the Book Tower. Rodrik's sister, Gwynesse, insists that she should rule Ten Towers, as she is seven years his elder.[3]\n\nRodrik is a widower,[2] who does not expect to wed again, and his heir is his cousin Harras, the Knight of Grey Garden.[3]\n\nAfter the death of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Isles and the North, Rodrik supports his niece, Balon's daughter Asha, and calls her supporters to Harlaw.[5] Rodrik is visited by Lords Baelor Blacktyde and Tristifer Botley  prior to the kingsmoot on Old Wyk, which has been called by Aeron Greyjoy.[3]\n\nRodrik assembles those faithful to Princess Asha at the Ten Towers. Hotho Harlaw, who wants Rodrik to marry his daughter, brings his lord a copy of Archmaester Marwyn's Book of Lost Books. In the Book Tower, Rodrik tries to convince Asha not to attend the kingsmoot, fearing a bad outcome. He offers to name Asha as the heir to Ten Towers, with the island of Harlaw passing to Ser Harras Harlaw, but she refuses.[3]\n\nAt the kingsmoot Rodrik is one of the first to call Asha's name. However, her uncle, Euron Greyjoy, is chosen king instead.[6]\n\nAfter the taking of the Shields, Rodrik is spotted by Lord Captain Victarion Greyjoy and Nute the Barber talking with Lords Gorold Goodbrother and Dunstan Drumm in the yard of Lord Hewett's castle on Oakenshield. They discuss their fears that the gains from the battle are little compared to the enmity of the Reach they have earned. During the feast in House Hewett's hall, King Euron tells the ironborn they will conquer Westeros. Rodrik is skeptical of Euron's planning as well as his claims of having sailed the Smoking Sea and seen Valyria. With Euron giving Greyshield to Harras, Hotho feels that he is now Rodrik's heir.[4]\n\nAt Deepwood Motte, Asha recalls how after Euron was named the new king at the kingsmoot, Rodrik told her to flee while her uncle was busy. He also recommended she read Archmaester Haereg's History of the Ironborn, which recounts the only time a kingsmoot decision was overturned.[7]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nAn average-looking man, Rodrik has brown hair and eyes, and a short, neat beard that is grey.
