  "content": "Garlan Tyrell, known as Garlan the Gallant, is a knight of House Tyrell and the second son of Lord Mace Tyrell and Lady Alerie Hightower. His personal coat of arms is two golden roses on green, to denote his status as second son.[10][9] Garlan is married to Lady Leonette of House Fossoway.[9]\n\nGarlan is similar in appearance to his younger brother, Ser Loras Tyrell, but he is taller,[N 1] more broadly built, and has a beard. Garlan is five years older than Loras.[11]\n\nGarlan is an exceptionally skilled swordsman, preferring to train against three or four swordsmen, so as to better prepare himself for actual battle,[9] but his lack of interest in gaining glory makes him less famous than Loras.\n\nGarlan was plump in his youth. His elder brother, Willas, shrewdly dubbed him \"the Gallant\" to save him from the indignity that befell an uncle, nicknamed Garth the Gross.[12]\n\nSer Garlan takes part in the Battle of the Blackwater, playing the part of the late Renly Baratheon by dressing in his armor, to scare the ignorant men-at-arms among Stannis Baratheon's army.[3] \"Renly's ghost\", actually Garlan,[13] leads the Tyrell-Lannister army's vanguard and slays his opposite number, Ser Guyard Morrigen, in single combat.[2]\n\nIn the Red Keep following the battle, Garlan introduces Margaery Tyrell, his sister and Renly's widow, to King Joffrey I Baratheon. Joffrey agrees to set aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark and instead marry Margaery.[11]\n\nGarlan is raised to Lord of Brightwater Keep, the seat of attainted House Florent, as a reward for the Battle of the Blackwater.[5]\n\nGarlan speaks and dances with Sansa during her wedding to Tyrion Lannister. He tries to assuage Sansa's fears about marrying Tyrion, despite the fact that most of the Tyrells are avoiding any interaction with Sansa in the wake of their attempts to marry Sansa off to Willas Tyrell having been foiled. Garlan remarks that Tyrion is a \"bigger man than he seems\" and states that she would be happier with him than Loras, which implies that he knows of his brother's sexual orientation.[12]\n\nGarlan and his wife, Leonette Fossoway, attend the royal wedding of Joffrey to Margaery. While there, he speaks to Tyrion, praising his plans which helped save King's Landing from Stannis Baratheon's forces, and tells Tyrion that he is \"made to do great deeds\". He also rebukes Joffrey for publicly shaming Tyrion and destroying Tyrion's wedding gift, Lives of Four Kings. Garlan unsuccessfully tries to save the boy king when he chokes to death.[14]\n\nWhile the Kingsguard meet in the White Sword Tower, Garlan guards the new king, Tommen I Baratheon.[13]\n\nFrom King's Landing, Garlan brings half of the Tyrell strength back to the Reach to press his claim on Brightwater Keep,[15] which is held by Ser Colin Florent.[16] He is preparing to take Brightwater when news of the taking of the Shields by ironborn reaches him. Garlan begins to gather men from across the Reach to retake the Shield Islands.[17]\n\nAfter Queen Margaery is imprisoned by the Faith Militant, she tells Queen Regent Cersei Lannister that she would want Garlan to represent her in a possible trial by combat. Cersei explains that Garlan would not be able to represent a queen because he is not a member of the Kingsguard.[18]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nGarlan is similar in appearance to his younger brother, Ser Loras Tyrell, but he is taller,[N 1] more broadly built, and has a beard.
