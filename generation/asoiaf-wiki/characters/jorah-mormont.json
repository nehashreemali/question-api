  "content": "Jorah Mormont is an exiled knight, the former head of House Mormont and Lord of Bear Island. He fled Westeros to escape execution for trading in slaves and took up work as a mercenary in the Free Cities, eventually entering the service of the last Targaryens. He becomes one of the most trusted companions of Daenerys Targaryen.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Jorah is portrayed by Iain Glen.[8]\n\nJorah is a burly[9] middle-aged man,[10] swarthy[11] and with coarse black hair covering his chest, arms, and back.[2][9][12] He is bearded[13] and balding,[4] but still strong and fit.[10] The knight has heavy black brows[14] over his dark,[2][15] deepset eyes.[14] Taller than Daenerys Targaryen,[16] Jorah is shorter but more muscular than Ser Barristan Selmy.[15] He is also shorter and slimmer than Moqorro.[17] Daenerys considers the brawny knight[11] not particularly handsome.[1]\n\nJorah wears wool and leather, with his dark green tunic displaying the standing black bear of House Mormont.[10] For the heat of Essos, he also owns horsehair leggings,[2] loose trousers of mottled sandsilk,[4] and open-toed riding sandals that lace up to his knee.[4] The knight has vests in the Dothraki style, including painted[2] and bleached white vests.[4]\n\nJorah armors himself in mail and leather[4] as well as gauntlets, greaves, and a flat-topped greathelm of dark grey steel.[3] His jerkin has iron studs.[15] The knight wields a longsword[3] and a dagger,[4] and he hangs his scabbard from a a twisted horsehair belt.[4] Jorah is respected by the Dothraki for his swordsmanship.[18] Despite being a northman, the Dothraki of Drogo's khalasar refer to him as \"Jorah the Andal\".[2]\n\nJorah is a brave warrior[19] and a fierce protector.[4] He can be jealous[20] and possessive,[11] however, and he is often distrustful of others.[14] Jorah hates Lord Eddard Stark,[21] and Eddard considers the exile to be dishonorable[22] and a traitor.[23]\n\nJorah was married at a young age to a girl from House Glover as desired by his father Jeor Mormont, Lord of Bear Island. While they were married for ten years, Jorah's wife was unable to carry a child to term. She eventually died following her third miscarriage.[19] Presumably prior to Robert's Rebellion,[N 1] Jeor gave up the lordship of House Mormont by joining the Night's Watch, which made Jorah the Lord of Bear Island in his own right.[19]\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, Jorah fought on the side of the rebels. He was present during the Battle of the Trident in 283 AC[24] and saw the aftermath of the Sack of King's Landing.[20]\n\nAfter the death of his first wife, Jorah received multiple marriage offers from other houses. Before he made his decision, however, Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, rose in rebellion in 289 AC.[19] Jorah showed courage during Greyjoy's Rebellion, being one of the first men through the breach during the siege of Pyke. He received a knighthood from King Robert I Baratheon in recognition of his bravery.[7][19] According to Magister Illyrio Mopatis, Jorah was anointed by the High Septon when he became a knight,[10] though it is unknown which religion Jorah follows, nor whether the High Septon was present at Pyke.\n\nDuring a tourney at Lannisport to celebrate the victory over the Greyjoy rebels, Jorah met Lynesse Hightower, who was half his age and became smitten with her beauty. He asked for her favor to wear during the tournament, for which she gave her permission. Jorah unexpectedly defeated all challengers. He faced Ser Jaime Lannister last, and after they broke nine lances to no result, King Robert I Baratheon granted Jorah the victory. Jorah named Lynesse his queen of love and beauty, and asked Lynesse's father, Lord Leyton Hightower, for her hand in marriage that same night. Surprisingly, Leyton agreed. Jorah and Lynesse were married at Lannisport, after which they returned to Bear Island.[19]\n\nThe marriage did not remain happy for long. Having spent her life as part of wealthy House Hightower in Oldtown, Lynesse was unprepared for life on harsh and isolated Bear Island and quickly grew miserable. Jorah attempted to reproduce the lifestyle to which his wife was accustomed but only succeeded in driving himself into financial ruin,[19] by lavishing her with expensive gifts, hiring a cook from Oldtown, and a harper from Lannisport. Having built a fine ship, Jorah attended festivals with his wife in those two cities as well, and he borrowed from moneylenders while in Braavos. Jorah participated in various tourneys, but he never duplicated his success at Lannisport.[19]\n\nDesperate to pay off his debts, Jorah took part in one of the Seven Kingdoms' oldest taboos, slavery. When House Mormont's liege lord, Eddard Stark, learned that Jorah had sold poachers to a Tyroshi slaver, he condemned him to death. However, when the Warden of the North arrived on Bear Island to execute him in 293 AC, Jorah had already fled with Lynesse.[22][19] To his credit, Jorah left behind Longclaw, the ancestral Valyrian steel sword of the Mormonts.[25] Jorah's aunt, Lady Maege Mormont, sent the blade to Jeor at Castle Black.[26]\n\nRather than join his father in taking the black, Jorah took Lynesse with him into exile. While Jorah wanted to go to Braavos, Lynesse wanted a warmer home,[12] so they fled to Lys instead, where Jorah sold his ship. Within half a year they had no money left, so Jorah sold his service as a sellsword. However, while Jorah was fighting the Braavosi on the Rhoyne, Lynesse took Tregar Ormollen as her lover, and moved into the merchant prince's manse. When Jorah returned to Lys, Tregar informed him that he would be enslaved for his debts, unless he gave up Lynesse and left Lys.[19]\n\nHeartbroken, Jorah went to Volantis, where he spent the better part of a year.[12] He remained near the Free Cities[19] travelling as far east as Vaes Dothrak,[13] and, having spent time with the Dothraki, eventually came to speak their language and learn their customs,[13][18] and became known as \"Jorah the Andal\".[2] He has not traveled to the red waste, however.[19] Jorah became familiar with Ben Plumm and the Second Sons.[27] At some point Jorah also became a spy for Lord Varys, King Robert I Baratheon's master of whisperers on the small council.[22]\n\nJorah is present at the feast held in Drogo's manse in Pentos, where Princess Daenerys Targaryen is presented to the Dothraki khal.[10] Jorah enters the service of the Beggar King, Viserys Targaryen, and he becomes a constant companion to the two Targaryens. During the wedding of Daenerys to Drogo, Jorah gifts her a small stack of old histories and songs of the Seven Kingdoms written in the Common Tongue.[13] When the khalasar leaves Pentos the next day, both he and Viserys accompany them.[1] Despite having sworn his sword to Viserys, Jorah's regard for Viserys is low. During the khalasar's march to Vaes Dothrak, he displays more loyalty towards Daenerys.[1]\n\nJorah is secretly in the employment of Varys, the master of whisperers for King Robert I Baratheon. Hoping to earn a royal pardon and return to Westeros from his exile, Jorah reports on the Targaryens' movements to King's Landing. He is quick to inform Robert about Daenerys's marriage to Drogo.[22] When Daenerys becomes pregnant, Jorah informs Varys as well, resulting in Robert's decision to have Daenerys, her child, and Viserys assassinated.[23]\n\nJorah counsels Daenerys on the Dothraki way of thinking and living.[21] At Vaes Dothrak, he threatens Viserys when the latter attempts to steal dragon eggs, Magister Illyrio Mopatis's gifts to Daenerys. Jorah is given a place of respect at the feast after Daenerys eats the stallion heart. Jorah is unable to calm Viserys when the would-be king enters the hall drunk, and the knight watches as Drogo has Viserys killed with molten gold.[18]\n\nJorah accompanies Daenerys and her escort to the western market, where he insists on visiting a caravan captain alone. Illyrio has sent a letter warning that King Robert has promised a lordship to whomever slays Viserys, Daenerys, or her child. Jorah returns to Daenerys's side just in time to confront a merchant about attempting to sell her poisoned wine.[2] For his role in saving Daenerys and her unborn son, Drogo allows Jorah to choose any horse from his herds, with the exception of his own stallion, and Daenerys's silver. After Jorah warns Drogo that there will be more attempts, Drogo declares he will invade the Seven Kingdoms.[2]\n\nJorah remains with the khalasar as they travel south towards Lhazar. He participates in battle when Drogo falls upon the khalasar of Khal Ogo, who had just sacked a town of the Lhazareen. Daenerys orders Jorah to stop Drogo's men from raping the Lhazareen women, and although Jorah admires Daenerys’s intent, he tries to explain that she cannot save all the women.[3]\n\nDrogo is wounded in the battle, and although Mirri Maz Duur has seen to his wound, the khal ignores the maegi's instructions, and his wound begins to fester.[3][4] When Drogo falls off his horse, Jorah urges Daenerys to flee to Asshai before Drogo dies, as her child will otherwise be killed and she will be forced to join the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dothrak.[4] Daenerys has Mirri perform blood magic on Drogo, which causes chaos in the khalasar. Jorah duels Qotho when Drogo's bloodrider wishes to stop the ritual. Although Qotho's arakh cuts off half Jorah's ear and wounds his hip, the knight is able to kill his opponent. When Daenerys goes into labor and the midwives refuse to come, Jorah takes her into the tent, unaware that Mirri has forbidden anyone from entering.[4]\n\nDaenerys's child, Rhaego, is a stillborn monstrosity. When Daenerys wakes up from her fevered sleep, a weakened Jorah is unable to tell her the truth about the child, so Mirri tells her. Daenerys and Jorah believe that by carrying her into the tent during the ritual, Jorah inadvertently caused her son's death. Jorah escorts Daenerys to Drogo, revealing that his khalasar is gone and Drogo is now catatonic.[28] Daenerys euthanizes her husband.[28]\n\nPreparations are made for Drogo's funeral pyre, but Jorah fears that Daenerys plans to commit suicide by entering the pyre. He begs her to come with him to Yi Ti, Qarth, the Jade Sea, and Asshai. Daenerys promises she does not intend to die with Drogo, and when she later asks the men from her khas and Jorah to swear their service to her, Jorah is the only one to do so. Daenerys promises him a dragon-forged Valyrian steel longsword and names him the first of her Queensguard. Jorah suggests selling the dragon eggs, but Daenerys has them placed upon Drogo's pyre. She has Jorah and Rakharo bind Mirri to the pyre. Jorah shouts at Daenerys when she walks into the burning pyre, which kills Mirri. When the flames have gone and the ground has cooled off the next morning, Daenerys is amidst the ashes, unhurt, with three living dragons. Jorah wordlessly falls to his knees, while the remaining Dothraki swear Daenerys their loyalty.[16]\n\nJorah's hip has not yet fully healed. When they arrive at Vaes Tolorro, he finds a peach for Daenerys and counsels her to remain in the city for a while, until her khalasar has recovered its strength. Jorah tells Daenerys about his marriages to a Glover, who died, and Lynesse Hightower, who abandoned him. When Jorah mentions that she resembles Lynesse, Daenerys realizes that Jorah is in love with her.[19] Daenerys tends to Jorah's wound, and it begins to heal.[19]\n\nJorah accompanies the khalasar to Qarth. He is mistrustful of the Qartheen, especially the merchant prince Xaro Xhoan Daxos, the warlock Pyat Pree, and the shadowbinder Quaithe, and he counsels Daenerys to not linger in the city for long. Daenerys sends Jorah to the port of Qarth to learn about tidings from the Seven Kingdoms. He returns with Quhuru Mo, captain of the Cinnamon Wind, who tells them that King Robert I Baratheon is dead, Joffrey I Baratheon has ascended the Iron Throne, and it is rumored that Robert's brothers, Stannis and Renly, are going to claim the Iron Throne. A skeptical Jorah disagrees with Daenerys openly declaring her intent to take the throne herself, as she lacks an army, gold, and ships.[29]\n\nUnlike Xaro, Jorah is intrigued when Daenerys dresses in the Qartheen fashion, baring a breast.[14] Although Jorah warns Daenerys that she will not receive any help from the Pureborn of Qarth, she visits them anyway, taking Rhaegal with her. Jorah remains behind at Xaro's palace to guard the other two dragons, Drogon and Viserion. Upon her return, Jorah guesses that Xaro hopes to obtain a dragon by marrying Daenerys. Advising her to travel further east for safety, but not to Asshai as suggested by Quaithe, Jorah explains that Illyrio Mopatis lacks the power to seat her upon the Iron Throne. He also explains Daenerys must gain the support of some of the high lords of Westeros, but admits he does not know how to accomplish that.[14]\n\nDaenerys sends Jorah to Pyat Pree to arrange a meeting with the Undying Ones.[14] Skeptical of the House of the Undying, Jorah urges Daenerys to take him with her but Pyat insists she enter alone. Jorah warns Daenerys to remember Mirri Maz Duur before she enters, and remains outside of the House of the Undying until Daenerys emerges again. He kneels besides Daenerys while her bloodriders keep the warlock from attacking her.[30]\n\nJorah accompanies Daenerys to the docks of Qarth, seeking a ship to take them from Qarth following the destruction of the House of the Undying. Daenerys discusses her visions from the building and the claims of the Undying Ones. Two men, Strong Belwas and his squire, Arstan Whitebeard, save Daenerys from a Sorrowful Man. They claim to have been sent by Illyrio to bring Daenerys back to Pentos. When Jorah remarks that Arstan is rather old to be a squire, Arstan admits to knowing Jorah, having seen him fight at Pyke and participate in the subsequent tourney at Lannisport. Although Jorah admits Arstan looks familiar, he does not recall having met him.[31]\n\nWhile Balerion sails toward Pentos, Jorah reacts with hostility when Arstan provides Daenerys with more accurate information about the dragons once held by House Targaryen and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen's fighting abilities. Jorah is also bothered by Arstan insinuating knowledge of Lynesse Hightower and the tourney at Lannisport.[15]\n\nThat night, Jorah visits Daenerys in her cabin, where he again speaks of his distrust for Arstan, Belwas, and Illyrio Mopatis, claiming that Arstan does not act like a squire. Suggesting that Daenerys go to Pentos with an army, Jorah proposes they sail for Astapor in Slaver's Bay, where Unsullied are trained and sold, telling her the story about the Three Thousand of Qohor. Excited by the idea of acquiring the beginnings of her own army, Daenerys agrees on the approach. However, Jorah kisses her and offers himself in marriage.[15] An uncomfortable Daenerys ensures she is no longer alone with the knight,[20] and she does not dream of him.[20]\n\nWhen she visits the Plaza of Pride to view the Unsullied of Astapor, Daenerys leaves Jorah on Balerion, taking Arstan with her instead. Arstan is against Jorah's plan to have Daenerys buy the eunuch soldiers, and he reminds her that Jorah had been a slaver himself. When she returns to the ship, Jorah informs Daenerys that three slavers inspected her ships' trading goods. When Jorah supports purchasing the Unsullied, an angry Daenerys slaps him. When Daenerys later tells him that she refuses to shed the blood of innocents, Jorah tells her about Aegon's Conquest and the Sack of King's Landing, where many women were raped. He states that the Unsullied do not rape, sack, or plunder. Regardless, Daenerys wishes to lead free men into battle who believe in her cause.[20]\n\nJorah accompanies Daenerys to the Plaza of Pride, where she strikes a deal with the Good Masters. Later, Daenerys confides in Jorah and her bloodriders. The next day, Jorah goes with Daenerys and her people to buy the Unsullied.[32] She frees the eunuchs during the fall of Astapor, asking them to join her by their own choice, and ordering those who do so to chose officers from among themselves. Grey Worm, who is chosen for the highest rank, is trained by Jorah, who finds him promising.[11] Jorah urges Daenerys to abandon the freedmen who have followed her from Astapor, but Daenerys finds herself unable to do so.[11]\n\nAt Yunkai, Jorah states his belief that the army of the Yellow City can easily be defeated by Daenerys's forces. He is present for each of the three meetings with the captains of the free companies and the Wise Masters, and for once agrees with Arstan when the latter argues Mero, the captain of the Second Sons, is not to be trusted. When Daenerys tells her council of her plans, Jorah approves. He later brings Daario Naharis of the Stormcrows, who was caught sneaking into the camp, to Daenerys, and counsels against using the Stormcrows in battle against Yunkai after Daario declares the loyalty of the company. Jorah leaves hurt when his queen insists she does not desire him.[11] Jorah leads Daenerys's Unsullied in the battle near Yunkai, and later brings her word of their victory. He sends men to hunt Mero, who has escaped captivity.[11]\n\nJorah follows Daenerys to Meereen, unhappy with the large number of freed slaves that follow Daenerys, calling them \"mouths with feet\". He does not believe they have to fight the \"hero of Meereen\", and calls the victory \"hollow\". He advises Daenerys to leave Meereen be, as they see no way to enter the city or starve the city out, and march for Pentos instead. He admits that in that scenario, Daenerys will be unable to feed the freed slaves who have decided to follow her, and Daenerys refuses to let that happen.[24]\n\nWhen Arstan Whitebeard saves Daenerys from Mero, Daenerys angrily accuses Jorah of not informing her of Mero's escape. Upon learning that Arstan, an old man with a wooden staff, managed to kill Mero, Jorah becomes suspicious once again. Arstan reveals he is actually Ser Barristan Selmy, formerly Lord Commander of the Kingsguard for Robert I Baratheon, and he tells Daenerys that someone has been informing on her since the day she married Drogo. Jorah admits that he had spied on her and Viserys, but had stopped when he fell in love with her. Angrily, Daenerys sends them with Belwas and twenty men into the sewers of Meereen to take the city for her.[24] Jorah kills a great pale lizard during the mission.[33]\n\nAlthough Daenerys half hopes that Jorah and Arstan will die, they are successful in freeing Meereen's slaves, granting her victory in the siege of Meereen. The thought of Jorah makes Daenerys feel angry, agitated, and sick, but she summons him and Arstan nonetheless. Although shamed, Jorah refuses to beg for forgiveness and instead insists Daenerys forgive him on account of his loyal service and love to her. Although Daenerys had planned to forgive him, she finds herself unable to, realizing it had been Jorah who had informed King Robert of her pregnancy. Instead, she banishes Jorah from Meereen, swearing to kill him if she ever sees him again.[33]\n\nWhen he lies dying during the mutiny at Craster's Keep, Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, asks Samwell Tarly to tell his son that his dying wish is for Jorah to take the black.[34]\n\nRecalling the prophecies of the Undying Ones, Daenerys Targaryen, Queen of Meereen, thinks of Jorah as one of her three betrayers.[35]\n\nAt a brothel in Selhorys, Jorah hires a silver-haired whore. He recognizes Tyrion Lannister when the dwarf comes down the stairs of the brothel cartwheeling, and takes him prisoner, planning to deliver him to Daenerys.[9]\n\nJorah travels with his captive on horseback to Volantis, where they overhear the red priest Benerro preach that Daenerys will come and free them. Jorah sells his horse and saddle, and buys manacles for his captive, to make him seem like a slave. He rents a room in the Merchant's House, where he chains Tyrion to the wall. Although Jorah had not given Tyrion his name, the dwarf figures it out for himself, and reveals Varys had sent him on his journey from Pentos. Jorah, admitting he accepted gold from Varys once, insists his loyalties lie elsewhere now. Jorah takes Tyrion with him when he visits the widow of the waterfront in search for a passage to Meereen, but the widow declares she does not trust Jorah, and tells him to go elsewhere. When he is about to leave, Tyrion is attacked by Penny, a female dwarf who blames him for the death of her brother, Oppo. Jorah intervenes, disarming Penny, but this earns him more scorn from the widow, as knights are supposed to defend the weak. However, Penny's attack changes the widow's mind on giving aid. She tells Tyrion to be on the Selaesori Qhoran when it sets sail for Qarth. While Tyrion respectfully expresses gratitude, Jorah expresses doubt, but the widow insists Benerro has foreseen that the ship will never reach its intended destination.[12]\n\nJorah and Tyrion share a small cabin on the Selaesori Qhoran. Because Tyrion insists they cannot leave Penny in Volantis, they bring her with them on the ship. However, Jorah makes it clear to Tyrion that Penny is Tyrion's responsibility. During the first storm, a drunken Jorah ends up in a pool of his own vomit.[17] After the ship is stranded due to a lack of wind for twelve days, Jorah warns Tyrion to tell Penny to keep the door of her cabin locked, as he suspects that some crew members might soon attempt to steal her pig to eat. Jorah mocks Tyrion for mock jousting with Penny for entertainment, but grows angry when Tyrion guesses that Jorah was sent away by Daenerys. Jorah punches Tyrion and tells him to find another place to sleep.\n\nThe ship encounters another, fiercer storm, during which several crew members are lost or mortally wounded. Jorah claims to Tyrion that he slept through it, which Tyrion doubts. Following the storm, they are stranded once more for nineteen days, until a distant ship appears which Jorah identifies as a slaver.[5] Jorah kills three slavers with his sword, but is eventually overwhelmed.[36] He is chained to an oar, beaten, whipped, starved, and branded with a demon's mask on his right cheek to mark him as a dangerous and disobedient slave.[36][37] Jorah remains defiant of his captors until he learns of Daenerys's marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq, then all the fight goes out of him.[36]\n\nThe slaver takes the captives taken on the Selaesori Qhoran to the slave market the Yunkai'i have created during the second siege of Meereen. Jorah is placed on the auction block after Tyrion and Penny have been sold to Yezzan zo Qaggaz. Not knowing why, Tyrion lies and convinces his overseer, Nurse, that Jorah is part of their act, playing the bear who attacks Penny, \"the maiden fair\", while Tyrion is the knight who saves her. Jorah is bought by Yezzan as well,[36] but he does not adapt well in Yezzan's ownership either.[27] He is sullen and uncooperative in the mummery acts with Tyrion and Penny, and mostly ignores any commands given by Nurse or replies with curses. As a result, Jorah is confined in a cage and frequently beaten.[27]\n\nWhen Yezzan is stricken with the pale mare, Jorah, Tyrion, and Penny are send to fetch water for their master. However, Tyrion leads them into the camp of the Second Sons to Ben Plumm, the company's captain. As Jorah's face has become unrecognizable, Plumm and his serjeants recognize him by his voice.[27] Although they are surprised that Jorah has returned to Meereen despite his exile,[27] they allow him to sign a contract with the company, removing his chains.[37]\n\nHaving fled from Daznak's Pit atop Drogon,[38] a hallucinating Daenerys has a vision of Jorah while in the Dothraki sea. The shadow Jorah reminds her she is the blood of the dragon.[39]\n\nJorah and Tyrion agree that the Second Sons need to go over to Meereen's side, before Daenerys Targaryen returns to the city. When Ben Plumm summons his captains, Jorah is called to his tent as well. A Yunkish messenger, sent by Morghaz zo Zherzyn, commands the Second Sons to attack Daenerys's Unsullied, but Ser Barristan Selmy leads an attack from the city against the Yunkai'i. When the messenger recognizes Tyrion and demands him to be handed over for punishment, Jorah kills him.[40]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nJorah is a burly[9] middle-aged man,[10] swarthy[11] and with coarse black hair covering his chest, arms, and back.[2][9][12] He is bearded[13] and balding,[4] but still strong and fit.[10] The knight has heavy black brows[14] over his dark,[2][15] deepset eyes.[14] Taller than Daenerys Targaryen,[16] Jorah is shorter but more muscular than Ser Barristan Selmy.[15] He is also shorter and slimmer than Moqorro.[17] Daenerys considers the brawny knight[11] not particularly handsome.[1]\n\nJorah wears wool and leather, with his dark green tunic displaying the standing black bear of House Mormont.[10] For the heat of Essos, he also owns horsehair leggings,[2] loose trousers of mottled sandsilk,[4] and open-toed riding sandals that lace up to his knee.[4] The knight has vests in the Dothraki style, including painted[2] and bleached white vests.[4]\n\nJorah armors himself in mail and leather[4] as well as gauntlets, greaves, and a flat-topped greathelm of dark grey steel.[3] His jerkin has iron studs.[15] The knight wields a longsword[3] and a dagger,[4] and he hangs his scabbard from a a twisted horsehair belt.[4] Jorah is respected by the Dothraki for his swordsmanship.[18] Despite being a northman, the Dothraki of Drogo's khalasar refer to him as \"Jorah the Andal\".[2]\n\nJorah is a brave warrior[19] and a fierce protector.[4] He can be jealous[20] and possessive,[11] however, and he is often distrustful of others.[14] Jorah hates Lord Eddard Stark,[21] and Eddard considers the exile to be dishonorable[22] and a traitor.[23]\n\n\n## History\n\n\n\n## Youth\n\n\nJorah was married at a young age to a girl from House Glover as desired by his father Jeor Mormont, Lord of Bear Island. While they were married for ten years, Jorah's wife was unable to carry a child to term. She eventually died following her third miscarriage.[19] Presumably prior to Robert's Rebellion,[N 1] Jeor gave up the lordship of House Mormont by joining the Night's Watch, which made Jorah the Lord of Bear Island in his own right.[19]\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, Jorah fought on the side of the rebels. He was present during the Battle of the Trident in 283 AC[24] and saw the aftermath of the Sack of King's Landing.[20]\n\n\n## Greyjoy's Rebellion\n\n\nAfter the death of his first wife, Jorah received multiple marriage offers from other houses. Before he made his decision, however, Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, rose in rebellion in 289 AC.[19] Jorah showed courage during Greyjoy's Rebellion, being one of the first men through the breach during the siege of Pyke. He received a knighthood from King Robert I Baratheon in recognition of his bravery.[7][19] According to Magister Illyrio Mopatis, Jorah was anointed by the High Septon when he became a knight,[10] though it is unknown which religion Jorah follows, nor whether the High Septon was present at Pyke.\n\n\n## Marriage to Lynesse\n\n\nDuring a tourney at Lannisport to celebrate the victory over the Greyjoy rebels, Jorah met Lynesse Hightower, who was half his age and became smitten with her beauty. He asked for her favor to wear during the tournament, for which she gave her permission. Jorah unexpectedly defeated all challengers. He faced Ser Jaime Lannister last, and after they broke nine lances to no result, King Robert I Baratheon granted Jorah the victory. Jorah named Lynesse his queen of love and beauty, and asked Lynesse's father, Lord Leyton Hightower, for her hand in marriage that same night. Surprisingly, Leyton agreed. Jorah and Lynesse were married at Lannisport, after which they returned to Bear Island.[19]\n\nThe marriage did not remain happy for long. Having spent her life as part of wealthy House Hightower in Oldtown, Lynesse was unprepared for life on harsh and isolated Bear Island and quickly grew miserable. Jorah attempted to reproduce the lifestyle to which his wife was accustomed but only succeeded in driving himself into financial ruin,[19] by lavishing her with expensive gifts, hiring a cook from Oldtown, and a harper from Lannisport. Having built a fine ship, Jorah attended festivals with his wife in those two cities as well, and he borrowed from moneylenders while in Braavos. Jorah participated in various tourneys, but he never duplicated his success at Lannisport.[19]\n\n\n## Exile\n\n\nDesperate to pay off his debts, Jorah took part in one of the Seven Kingdoms' oldest taboos, slavery.

However, when the Warden of the North arrived on Bear Island to execute him in 293 AC, Jorah had already fled with Lynesse.[22][19] To his credit, Jorah left behind Longclaw, the ancestral Valyrian steel sword of the Mormonts.[25] Jorah's aunt, Lady Maege Mormont, sent the blade to Jeor at Castle Black.[26]\n\nRather than join his father in taking the black, Jorah took Lynesse with him into exile. While Jorah wanted to go to Braavos, Lynesse wanted a warmer home,[12] so they fled to Lys instead, where Jorah sold his ship.

When Jorah returned to Lys, Tregar informed him that he would be enslaved for his debts, unless he gave up Lynesse and left Lys.[19]\n\nHeartbroken, Jorah went to Volantis, where he spent the better part of a year.[12] He remained near the Free Cities[19] travelling as far east as Vaes Dothrak,[13] and, having spent time with the Dothraki, eventually came to speak their language and learn their customs,[13][18] and became known as \"Jorah the Andal\".[2] He has not traveled to the red waste, however.[19] Jorah became familiar with Ben Plumm and the Second Sons.[27] At some point Jorah also became a spy for Lord Varys, King Robert I Baratheon's master of whisperers on the small council.[22]\n\n\n## Recent Events\n\n\n\n## A Game of Thrones\n\n\nJorah is present at the feast held in Drogo's manse in Pentos, where Princess Daenerys Targaryen is presented to the Dothraki khal.[10] Jorah enters the service of the Beggar King, Viserys Targaryen, and he becomes a constant companion to the two Targaryens. During the wedding of Daenerys to Drogo, Jorah gifts her a small stack of old histories and songs of the Seven Kingdoms written in the Common Tongue.[13] When the khalasar leaves Pentos the next day, both he and Viserys accompany them.[1] Despite having sworn his sword to Viserys, Jorah's regard for Viserys is low. During the khalasar's march to Vaes Dothrak, he displays more loyalty towards Daenerys.[1]\n\nJorah is secretly in the employment of Varys, the master of whisperers for King Robert I Baratheon. Hoping to earn a royal pardon and return to Westeros from his exile, Jorah reports on the Targaryens' movements to King's Landing. He is quick to inform Robert about Daenerys's marriage to Drogo.[22] When Daenerys becomes pregnant, Jorah informs Varys as well, resulting in Robert's decision to have Daenerys, her child, and Viserys assassinated.[23]\n\nJorah counsels Daenerys on the Dothraki way of thinking and living.[21] At Vaes Dothrak, he threatens Viserys when the latter attempts to steal dragon eggs, Magister Illyrio Mopatis's gifts to Daenerys. Jorah is given a place of respect at the feast after Daenerys eats the stallion heart. Jorah is unable to calm Viserys when the would-be king enters the hall drunk, and the knight watches as Drogo has Viserys killed with molten gold.[18]\n\nJorah accompanies Daenerys and her escort to the western market, where he insists on visiting a caravan captain alone. Illyrio has sent a letter warning that King Robert has promised a lordship to whomever slays Viserys, Daenerys, or her child. Jorah returns to Daenerys's side just in time to confront a merchant about attempting to sell her poisoned wine.[2] For his role in saving Daenerys and her unborn son, Drogo allows Jorah to choose any horse from his herds, with the exception of his own stallion, and Daenerys's silver. After Jorah warns Drogo that there will be more attempts, Drogo declares he will invade the Seven Kingdoms.[2]\n\nJorah remains with the khalasar as they travel south towards Lhazar. He participates in battle when Drogo falls upon the khalasar of Khal Ogo, who had just sacked a town of the Lhazareen. Daenerys orders Jorah to stop Drogo's men from raping the Lhazareen women, and although Jorah admires Daenerys’s intent, he tries to explain that she cannot save all the women.[3]\n\nDrogo is wounded in the battle, and although Mirri Maz Duur has seen to his wound, the khal ignores the maegi's instructions, and his wound begins to fester.[3][4] When Drogo falls off his horse, Jorah urges Daenerys to flee to Asshai before Drogo dies, as her child will otherwise be killed and she will be forced to join the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dothrak.[4] Daenerys has Mirri perform blood magic on Drogo, which causes chaos in the khalasar. Jorah duels Qotho when Drogo's bloodrider wishes to stop the ritual. Although Qotho's arakh cuts off half Jorah's ear and wounds his hip, the knight is able to kill his opponent. When Daenerys goes into labor and the midwives refuse to come, Jorah takes her into the tent, unaware that Mirri has forbidden anyone from entering.[4]\n\nDaenerys's child, Rhaego, is a stillborn monstrosity. When Daenerys wakes up from her fevered sleep, a weakened Jorah is unable to tell her the truth about the child, so Mirri tells her. Daenerys and Jorah believe that by carrying her into the tent during the ritual, Jorah inadvertently caused her son's death. Jorah escorts Daenerys to Drogo, revealing that his khalasar is gone and Drogo is now catatonic.[28] Daenerys euthanizes her husband.[28]\n\nPreparations are made for Drogo's funeral pyre, but Jorah fears that Daenerys plans to commit suicide by entering the pyre. He begs her to come with him to Yi Ti, Qarth, the Jade Sea, and Asshai. Daenerys promises she does not intend to die with Drogo, and when she later asks the men from her khas and Jorah to swear their service to her, Jorah is the only one to do so. Daenerys promises him a dragon-forged Valyrian steel longsword and names him the first of her Queensguard. Jorah suggests selling the dragon eggs, but Daenerys has them placed upon Drogo's pyre. She has Jorah and Rakharo bind Mirri to the pyre. Jorah shouts at Daenerys when she walks into the burning pyre, which kills Mirri. When the flames have gone and the ground has cooled off the next morning, Daenerys is amidst the ashes, unhurt, with three living dragons. Jorah wordlessly falls to his knees, while the remaining Dothraki swear Daenerys their loyalty.[16]\n\n\n## A Clash of Kings\n\n\nJorah's hip has not yet fully healed. When they arrive at Vaes Tolorro, he finds a peach for Daenerys and counsels her to remain in the city for a while, until her khalasar has recovered its strength. Jorah tells Daenerys about his marriages to a Glover, who died, and Lynesse Hightower, who abandoned him. When Jorah mentions that she resembles Lynesse, Daenerys realizes that Jorah is in love with her.[19] Daenerys tends to Jorah's wound, and it begins to heal.[19]\n\nJorah accompanies the khalasar to Qarth. He is mistrustful of the Qartheen, especially the merchant prince Xaro Xhoan Daxos, the warlock Pyat Pree, and the shadowbinder Quaithe, and he counsels Daenerys to not linger in the city for long. Daenerys sends Jorah to the port of Qarth to learn about tidings from the Seven Kingdoms. He returns with Quhuru Mo, captain of the Cinnamon Wind, who tells them that King Robert I Baratheon is dead, Joffrey I Baratheon has ascended the Iron Throne, and it is rumored that Robert's brothers, Stannis and Renly, are going to claim the Iron Throne. A skeptical Jorah disagrees with Daenerys openly declaring her intent to take the throne herself, as she lacks an army, gold, and ships.[29]\n\nUnlike Xaro, Jorah is intrigued when Daenerys dresses in the Qartheen fashion, baring a breast.[14] Although Jorah warns Daenerys that she will not receive any help from the Pureborn of Qarth, she visits them anyway, taking Rhaegal with her. Jorah remains behind at Xaro's palace to guard the other two dragons, Drogon and Viserion. Upon her return, Jorah guesses that Xaro hopes to obtain a dragon by marrying Daenerys. Advising her to travel further east for safety, but not to Asshai as suggested by Quaithe, Jorah explains that Illyrio Mopatis lacks the power to seat her upon the Iron Throne. He also explains Daenerys must gain the support of some of the high lords of Westeros, but admits he does not know how to accomplish that.[14]\n\nDaenerys sends Jorah to Pyat Pree to arrange a meeting with the Undying Ones.[14] Skeptical of the House of the Undying, Jorah urges Daenerys to take him with her but Pyat insists she enter alone. Jorah warns Daenerys to remember Mirri Maz Duur before she enters, and remains outside of the House of the Undying until Daenerys emerges again. He kneels besides Daenerys while her bloodriders keep the warlock from attacking her.[30]\n\nJorah accompanies Daenerys to the docks of Qarth, seeking a ship to take them from Qarth following the destruction of the House of the Undying. Daenerys discusses her visions from the building and the claims of the Undying Ones. Two men, Strong Belwas and his squire, Arstan Whitebeard, save Daenerys from a Sorrowful Man. They claim to have been sent by Illyrio to bring Daenerys back to Pentos. When Jorah remarks that Arstan is rather old to be a squire, Arstan admits to knowing Jorah, having seen him fight at Pyke and participate in the subsequent tourney at Lannisport. Although Jorah admits Arstan looks familiar, he does not recall having met him.[31]\n\n\n## A Storm of Swords\n\n\nWhile Balerion sails toward Pentos, Jorah reacts with hostility when Arstan provides Daenerys with more accurate information about the dragons once held by House Targaryen and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen's fighting abilities. Jorah is also bothered by Arstan insinuating knowledge of Lynesse Hightower and the tourney at Lannisport.[15]\n\nThat night, Jorah visits Daenerys in her cabin, where he again speaks of his distrust for Arstan, Belwas, and Illyrio Mopatis, claiming that Arstan does not act like a squire. Suggesting that Daenerys go to Pentos with an army, Jorah proposes they sail for Astapor in Slaver's Bay, where Unsullied are trained and sold, telling her the story about the Three Thousand of Qohor. Excited by the idea of acquiring the beginnings of her own army, Daenerys agrees on the approach. However, Jorah kisses her and offers himself in marriage.[15] An uncomfortable Daenerys ensures she is no longer alone with the knight,[20] and she does not dream of him.[20]\n\nWhen she visits the Plaza of Pride to view the Unsullied of Astapor, Daenerys leaves Jorah on Balerion, taking Arstan with her instead. Arstan is against Jorah's plan to have Daenerys buy the eunuch soldiers, and he reminds her that Jorah had been a slaver himself. When she returns to the ship, Jorah informs Daenerys that three slavers inspected her ships' trading goods. When Jorah supports purchasing the Unsullied, an angry Daenerys slaps him. When Daenerys later tells him that she refuses to shed the blood of innocents, Jorah tells her about Aegon's Conquest and the Sack of King's Landing, where many women were raped. He states that the Unsullied do not rape, sack, or plunder. Regardless, Daenerys wishes to lead free men into battle who believe in her cause.[20]\n\nJorah accompanies Daenerys to the Plaza of Pride, where she strikes a deal with the Good Masters. Later, Daenerys confides in Jorah and her bloodriders. The next day, Jorah goes with Daenerys and her people to buy the Unsullied.[32] She frees the eunuchs during the fall of Astapor, asking them to join her by their own choice, and ordering those who do so to chose officers from among themselves. Grey Worm, who is chosen for the highest rank, is trained by Jorah, who finds him promising.[11] Jorah urges Daenerys to abandon the freedmen who have followed her from Astapor, but Daenerys finds herself unable to do so.[11]\n\nAt Yunkai, Jorah states his belief that the army of the Yellow City can easily be defeated by Daenerys's forces. He is present for each of the three meetings with the captains of the free companies and the Wise Masters, and for once agrees with Arstan when the latter argues Mero, the captain of the Second Sons, is not to be trusted. When Daenerys tells her council of her plans, Jorah approves. He later brings Daario Naharis of the Stormcrows, who was caught sneaking into the camp, to Daenerys, and counsels against using the Stormcrows in battle against Yunkai after Daario declares the loyalty of the company. Jorah leaves hurt when his queen insists she does not desire him.[11] Jorah leads Daenerys's Unsullied in the battle near Yunkai, and later brings her word of their victory. He sends men to hunt Mero, who has escaped captivity.[11]\n\nJorah follows Daenerys to Meereen, unhappy with the large number of freed slaves that follow Daenerys, calling them \"mouths with feet\". He does not believe they have to fight the \"hero of Meereen\", and calls the victory \"hollow\". He advises Daenerys to leave Meereen be, as they see no way to enter the city or starve the city out, and march for Pentos instead. He admits that in that scenario, Daenerys will be unable to feed the freed slaves who have decided to follow her, and Daenerys refuses to let that happen.[24]\n\nWhen Arstan Whitebeard saves Daenerys from Mero, Daenerys angrily accuses Jorah of not informing her of Mero's escape. Upon learning that Arstan, an old man with a wooden staff, managed to kill Mero, Jorah becomes suspicious once again. Arstan reveals he is actually Ser Barristan Selmy, formerly Lord Commander of the Kingsguard for Robert I Baratheon, and he tells Daenerys that someone has been informing on her since the day she married Drogo. Jorah admits that he had spied on her and Viserys, but had stopped when he fell in love with her. Angrily, Daenerys sends them with Belwas and twenty men into the sewers of Meereen to take the city for her.[24] Jorah kills a great pale lizard during the mission.[33]\n\nAlthough Daenerys half hopes that Jorah and Arstan will die, they are successful in freeing Meereen's slaves, granting her victory in the siege of Meereen. The thought of Jorah makes Daenerys feel angry, agitated, and sick, but she summons him and Arstan nonetheless. Although shamed, Jorah refuses to beg for forgiveness and instead insists Daenerys forgive him on account of his loyal service and love to her. Although Daenerys had planned to forgive him, she finds herself unable to, realizing it had been Jorah who had informed King Robert of her pregnancy. Instead, she banishes Jorah from Meereen, swearing to kill him if she ever sees him again.[33]\n\nWhen he lies dying during the mutiny at Craster's Keep, Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, asks Samwell Tarly to tell his son that his dying wish is for Jorah to take the black.[34]\n\n\n## A Dance with Dragons\n\n\nRecalling the prophecies of the Undying Ones, Daenerys Targaryen, Queen of Meereen, thinks of Jorah as one of her three betrayers.[35]\n\nAt a brothel in Selhorys, Jorah hires a silver-haired whore. He recognizes Tyrion Lannister when the dwarf comes down the stairs of the brothel cartwheeling, and takes him prisoner, planning to deliver him to Daenerys.[9]\n\nJorah travels with his captive on horseback to Volantis, where they overhear the red priest Benerro preach that Daenerys will come and free them. Jorah sells his horse and saddle, and buys manacles for his captive, to make him seem like a slave. He rents a room in the Merchant's House, where he chains Tyrion to the wall. Although Jorah had not given Tyrion his name, the dwarf figures it out for himself, and reveals Varys had sent him on his journey from Pentos. Jorah, admitting he accepted gold from Varys once, insists his loyalties lie elsewhere now. Jorah takes Tyrion with him when he visits the widow of the waterfront in search for a passage to Meereen, but the widow declares she does not trust Jorah, and tells him to go elsewhere. When he is about to leave, Tyrion is attacked by Penny, a female dwarf who blames him for the death of her brother, Oppo. Jorah intervenes, disarming Penny, but this earns him more scorn from the widow, as knights are supposed to defend the weak. However, Penny's attack changes the widow's mind on giving aid. She tells Tyrion to be on the Selaesori Qhoran when it sets sail for Qarth. While Tyrion respectfully expresses gratitude, Jorah expresses doubt, but the widow insists Benerro has foreseen that the ship will never reach its intended destination.[12]\n\nJorah and Tyrion share a small cabin on the Selaesori Qhoran. Because Tyrion insists they cannot leave Penny in Volantis, they bring her with them on the ship. However, Jorah makes it clear to Tyrion that Penny is Tyrion's responsibility. During the first storm, a drunken Jorah ends up in a pool of his own vomit.[17] After the ship is stranded due to a lack of wind for twelve days, Jorah warns Tyrion to tell Penny to keep the door of her cabin locked, as he suspects that some crew members might soon attempt to steal her pig to eat. Jorah mocks Tyrion for mock jousting with Penny for entertainment, but grows angry when Tyrion guesses that Jorah was sent away by Daenerys. Jorah punches Tyrion and tells him to find another place to sleep.\n\nThe ship encounters another, fiercer storm, during which several crew members are lost or mortally wounded. Jorah claims to Tyrion that he slept through it, which Tyrion doubts. Following the storm, they are stranded once more for nineteen days, until a distant ship appears which Jorah identifies as a slaver.[5] Jorah kills three slavers with his sword, but is eventually overwhelmed.[36] He is chained to an oar, beaten, whipped, starved, and branded with a demon's mask on his right cheek to mark him as a dangerous and disobedient slave.[36][37] Jorah remains defiant of his captors until he learns of Daenerys's marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq, then all the fight goes out of him.[36]\n\nThe slaver takes the captives taken on the Selaesori Qhoran to the slave market the Yunkai'i have created during the second siege of Meereen. Jorah is placed on the auction block after Tyrion and Penny have been sold to Yezzan zo Qaggaz. Not knowing why, Tyrion lies and convinces his overseer, Nurse, that Jorah is part of their act, playing the bear who attacks Penny, \"the maiden fair\", while Tyrion is the knight who saves her. Jorah is bought by Yezzan as well,[36] but he does not adapt well in Yezzan's ownership either.[27] He is sullen and uncooperative in the mummery acts with Tyrion and Penny, and mostly ignores any commands given by Nurse or replies with curses. As a result, Jorah is confined in a cage and frequently beaten.[27]\n\nWhen Yezzan is stricken with the pale mare, Jorah, Tyrion, and Penny are send to fetch water for their master. However, Tyrion leads them into the camp of the Second Sons to Ben Plumm, the company's captain. As Jorah's face has become unrecognizable, Plumm and his serjeants recognize him by his voice.[27] Although they are surprised that Jorah has returned to Meereen despite his exile,[27] they allow him to sign a contract with the company, removing his chains.[37]\n\nHaving fled from Daznak's Pit atop Drogon,[38] a hallucinating Daenerys has a vision of Jorah while in the Dothraki sea. The shadow Jorah reminds her she is the blood of the dragon.[39]\n\n\n## The Winds of Winter\n\n\nJorah and Tyrion agree that the Second Sons need to go over to Meereen's side, before Daenerys Targaryen returns to the city. When Ben Plumm summons his captains, Jorah is called to his tent as well. A Yunkish messenger, sent by Morghaz zo Zherzyn, commands the Second Sons to attack Daenerys's Unsullied, but Ser Barristan Selmy leads an attack from the city against the Yunkai'i. When the messenger recognizes Tyrion and demands him to be handed over for punishment, Jorah kills him.[40]\n\n\n## Quotes by Jorah\n\n\n\n## Quotes about Jorah\n\n\n\n## Family\n",
