  "content": "Aeron Greyjoy is the youngest surviving son of the late Lord Quellon Greyjoy and Lady Sunderly, and is a younger brother of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands. As a result of a near-death experience, Aeron became a priest of the Drowned God, and he is now called the Damphair[3] because of his wet hair. His acolytes are known as the drowned men.[4]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Aeron is portrayed by Michael Feast.\n\nAeron is tall and thin with fierce black eyes and a beak of a nose,[3] but he is shorter than his elder brother Victarion.[5] The sour-faced[6] Aeron never cuts his long black hair[7] and beard, which falls to his waist and has seaweed woven into it.[8]\n\nThe Damphair garbs himself in roughspun wool robes dyed in the green, grey, and blue of the Drowned God.[8] When drowning his acolytes, he wears only a sealskin clout to cover his privates.[8] Aeron carries a waterskin filled with seawater, which he uses to bless those who desire it.[3]\n\nAeron was once an amiable man, fond of songs, ale, and women.[3] At the age of sixteen he sang, danced, japed, played the pipes, juggled, and rode horses.[8] Aeron's transformation has made him devoutly devoted to the god in his watery halls, however. He is now a dour, humorless man who views every breath as a gift that is wasted if it is not used to extol the virtues of following the Drowned God's path.[9]\n\nAeron considers himself a prophet[8] who can hear the Drowned God.[7] He attributes discord in the Iron Islands to the hated Storm God.[7] Aeron sometimes swallows salt water to strength his faith.[7][10]\n\nAeron was born the youngest son from Lord Quellon Greyjoy's second of three marriages. At six-and-ten he called himself a man, but in truth he had been a ribald drunk, who would sing, dance, play pipes, juggle and ride horses. He drank much, and claimed no man could piss longer or farther than him. He once wagered his ship against a flock of goats that he could douse a hearth-fire by urinating on it, and subsequently outraged his brother, Lord Balon, by naming the ship Golden Storm.[8]\n\nDuring Greyjoy's Rebellion, Aeron joined his brothers Victarion and Euron in raiding the coasts. Aeron nearly drowned when Golden Storm was sunk by the war galley Fury during the sea battle off Fair Isle, when the ironborn fleet was caught in a trap set by the master of ships, Lord Stannis Baratheon.  Aeron was initially believed to be lost at sea, but he washed ashore and was discovered by local fishermen, who led him to Lannisport in chains. Aeron spent the rest of the rebellion as a prisoner of the Lannisters, but he was later returned to the Iron Islands. Aeron  held pissing contests with \"lions, boars, and chickens\" while in captivity.[8]\n\nAn unknown amount of time after Greyjoy's Rebellion, Aeron went down in a storm, but washed up ashore, safely and unharmed. Due to his near-death experience, he underwent a spiritual reawakening, and dedicated himself as a priest of the Drowned God and prophet.[3] He became hard, humorless, and ascetic, living as a hermit on the beach, spreading the word of their god, and becoming known primarily by his new name, Damphair. The acolytes serving under Aeron, called drowned men, do his bidding without question, and the Damphair is greatly respected by the ironborn in general.[8] He has never failed to resuscitate any of his followers with the kiss of life.[8]\n\nAeron fears his brother, Euron, for reasons that are not made clear. He has recurring memories and nightmares of a door with screeching hinges, which he associates with Euron.[5]\n\nAeron is still afflicted with guilt over the death of another brother, Urrigon, who died from the infection of a wound that occurred while he and Aeron performed a finger dance, a traditional axe-juggling game among the ironborn.[8]\n\nIn the early phases of the War of the Five Kings, Robb Stark, King in the North, sends his friend, Theon Greyjoy, back to the Iron Islands to negotiate an alliance with Theon's father, Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands. Aeron Damphair, Balon's brother, is sent to bring Theon from Lordsport to Pyke. Since Theon has been living for years with the Starks of Winterfell, who worship the old gods, Aeron blesses Theon with seawater.[3]\n\nBalon declines Robb's alliance offer, however, and Aeron attends Balon's war council regarding an offensive against the north.[11] Aeron and Dagmer accompany Theon during the harrying of the Stony Shore,[6] and the Damphair blesses Theon's new longship, Sea Bitch.[11]\n\nThe ironmen take Benfred Tallhart prisoner when they ambush his Wild Hares. When Benfred refuses to answer questions Aeron and Theon put to him, Aeron commands that the prisoner be sacrificed to the Drowned God. Theon decides to attack Torrhen's Square and Winterfell with the crew of Sea Bitch and Dagmer's Foamdrinker, granting the six remaining ships to Aeron for future raiding.[6]\n\nAfter finishing the reaving, Aeron returns to his normal duties as a priest of the Drowned God in the Iron Islands. Within the Sea Tower of Pyke, Aeron informs Balon of the defeat of his last son, Theon, at Winterfell. Aeron opposes Balon's intention to be succeeded by his daughter, Asha.[8]\n\nWhile reviving Emmond with the kiss of life on the shores of Great Wyk, Aeron learns from the Sparr and Gormond Goodbrother that Balon, his oldest brother, has fallen to his death from Pyke. At Hammerhorn he is told by Maester Murenmure that another older brother, the despised Euron, has claimed the Seastone Chair.[8] After preaching at villages and holdfasts on Great Wyk, Aeron rests in a driftwood shelter made by his drowned men at Pebbleton and rejects their call for him to claim the Seastone Chair. Fearing that Euron Crow's Eye will be the ruin of the ironmen, Aeron blesses Lord Meldred Merlyn and calls for a kingsmoot on Old Wyk to choose Balon's replacement.[8]\n\nThe ironborn captains answer Aeron's summons, and most of the Iron Fleet returns from the Fever River. On the shores of Nagga's Cradle, Aeron blesses and prays with his preferred candidate, his third brother, Victarion, whom he knows will continue Balon's traditional ways.[5] While the captains feast and drink, Aeron consumes only fish and water, and he departs when Euron's ridicules his piety.[5] The Damphair begins the kingsmoot's proceedings and listens to the claims of Lord Gylbert Farwynd, Erik Ironmaker, Lord Dunstan Drumm, Victarion, and Asha. He is shocked when the captains, impressed with  Euron's dragonhorn and bold claims, instead choose the Crow's Eye as Balon's successor.[7]\n\nAeron asks Victarion to aid him in opposing Euron, but the obedient Victarion submits to the new king. The Damphair announces plans to try to rouse the smallfolk of the Iron Islands against the \"godless\" Euron, and he disappears from Old Wyk the next day.[12] Euron and Victarion lead the ironborn in attacking the Reach.[12]\n\nAeron's niece, Asha Greyjoy, tells Tristifer Botley that no one has seen the Damphair since the kingsmoot, but his drowned men claim that he is hiding on Great Wyk and will soon come forth to call down the wrath of the Drowned God on Euron Crow's Eye and his minions. Erik Ironmaker, now Lord Steward of the Iron Islands, searches for Aeron by hunting down his drowned men. Tris suspects that Euron slit the Damphair's throat, however.[13]\n\nAeron is revealed to have been captured after the kingsmoot by Euron's mutes and chained up in the hold of the Silence. Euron forces him to drink shade of the evening and Aeron has numerous nightmarish visions. Aeron remembers how Euron used to sexually abuse him and another brother, Urri, when they were children. On Oakenshield Aeron encounters Falia Flowers. When she feeds him during his imprisonment, Falia believes Euron will make her his salt wife and her sons will come before Euron's other baseborn children. Aeron warns her to flee but she refuses.[14]\n\nAeron is later taken to a captured island castle located near the Arbor, presumably the Isle of Pigs. Several of Euron's lieutenants feast as a dozen bodies of the castle's former occupants hang from the rafters. All take turns mocking Aeron before taking him back to the Silence, where Euron commands that his brother to be  tied to the prow of the ship as Euron sails to meet the Redwyne fleet. A pregnant and naked Falia is tied next to him, her tongue cut out.[14]\n\nThis page uses content from the English Wikipedia. The original content was at House Greyjoy.
