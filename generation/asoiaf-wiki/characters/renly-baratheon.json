  "content": "Renly Baratheon is the Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. The younger brother of King Robert I and Lord Stannis, Renly serves as master of laws on Robert's small council.[3]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Renly is portrayed by Gethin Anthony.[4]\n\nRenly is described as a powerful man[5] who is lean and lithe.[6] He has a handsome, clean-shaven face.[5] Renly greatly resembles a young King Robert I Baratheon,[7] being near as tall as his eldest brother had been.[8] Like Robert, Renly has an easy smile.[7][8] He is taller and broader in the chest than Ser Loras Tyrell.[9]\n\nRenly's thick[10] hair is described as black as jet[5] and coal.[8][6] His fine and straight[8] hair currently falls to his shoulders,[5] although Renly has sometimes kept it short or tied it behind his head with a golden ribbon.[6] He always keeps his hair clean and combed.[6]\n\nRenly has been described as having laughing green eyes that match his armor,[5] as well as deep blue eyes[6] that resemble Robert's eyes.[8][11] According to a semi-canon source, George R. R. Martin reconciled the difference by suggesting Renly has blue-green eyes that change color depending on what he wears.[12]\n\nRenly is a charismatic man, winning friends easily, but he also strikes some people as frivolous.[8] Renly enjoys tourneys and hunting, but is not driven by the passion for food, drink, or wenching as King Robert came to be. Renly is quite popular with smallfolk due to his good looks, friendly ways, and charisma.[13] According to Maester Cressen, Renly is a bold man who acts from impulse.[14] Queen Cersei Lannister dislikes her brother-in-law because of his mockery.[15] Martin has said that Renly is \"a carefree and careless soul\".[16]\n\nRenly wears expensive attire, usually combining the Baratheon sigil with the colors of House Tyrell,[8] such as a dark green velvet doublet embroidered with golden stags. He drapes a cloth-of-gold half cape over the doublet with an emerald brooch.[17] Renly has a suit of enameled green armor with a helm adorned with a pair of golden antlers,[8] which was made by Tobho Mott.[7] He wields longsword and dagger.[18]\n\nUnbeknownst to the realm at large, and despite the many women who are attracted to him, Renly is homosexual.[2][19][20][21] According to his lover, Loras, Renly disdains book learning, believing that books should only be read by maesters. Despite this, he owns books with \"drawings that would turn a septon blind\", implying some kind of pornography.[22]\n\nRenly was born in 277 AC[1] at Storm's End,[2] the youngest of the three sons of Lord Steffon Baratheon and Lady Cassana Estermont.[3][23] Less than a year later, King Aerys II Targaryen sent his cousin Steffon to Volantis to find a bride of Valyrian blood for Prince Rhaegar.[24] Steffon was unable to do so, although he and Cassana did send a message to Storm's End saying that they had found a very talented fool. On their return journey from the Free Cities in 278 AC, Steffon and Cassana's ship, the Windproud, was caught in a severe storm and sank in Shipbreaker Bay, with no survivors except the fool, Patchface.[14]\n\nRenly grew up at Storm's End. Young Renly loved bright colors and fabrics. He loved games as well, and would run laughing through the halls of Storm's End, pretending to be a dragon or a wizard or the rain god.[14] He was still a young boy at the time of his eldest brother Robert's rebellion against King Aerys in 282–283 AC. Renly and his older brother Stannis spent the war under siege in Storm's End. Renly was witness to the desperation of the starving garrison, while Lord Mace Tyrell and his bannermen feasted within sight of the walls.[14][18][2]\n\nIn 285 AC or 286 AC, King Robert I Baratheon granted his brother Stannis the lordship of Dragonstone, traditionally the holding of the king's heir,[25] and granted his youngest brother Renly the seat of Storm's End and named him Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. This upset Stannis, who felt that since he was the elder of Robert's younger brothers, Storm's End was his by right.[14]\n\nWhen Renly turned sixteen in 293 AC, he made a lord's progress across the stormlands to mark his coming of age. During this progress, he visited the isle of Tarth, where Renly courteously danced with Brienne of Tarth, and she fell in love with him.[26] Renly also visited Sunspear once; Princess Arianne Martell recalls that she had tried her best to seduce him, but remembers that Renly had seemed more bemused than inflamed by her attempts.[27]\n\nDuring his time as Lord of Storm's End, Renly took Loras Tyrell as his squire.[15] Eventually, Renly and Loras became lovers. Although it is not widely known, various others at court are aware of their forbidden relationship.[19][2]\n\nRenly was eventually named to the small council, where he occupies the position of master of laws.[3] While he is at court, his castellan at Storm's End is Ser Cortnay Penrose, who also has been given the charge of raising King Robert's bastard son, Edric Storm.[28] Brella runs Renly's household in King's Landing for him.[29] Renly has thirty men in his personal guard at the capital.[30]\n\nWhile King Robert I Baratheon's procession is returning from Winterfell, Renly meets up with them, accompanied by Ser Barristan Selmy, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and the King's Justice, Ser Ilyn Payne. He does not identify himself to Sansa Stark, but she recognizes him by his antlered helmet and his youth.[5] Renly is deeply amused by Prince Joffrey Baratheon's accusations against Arya Stark's direwolf Nymeria at Darry, and when he laughs at the thought of Joffrey being disarmed and beaten by a girl smaller and younger than him, Robert orders him to leave the room.[31]\n\nRenly performs well in the Hand's tourney, but loses to the Hound, Sandor Clegane. When Renly is unhorsed, one of the golden tines of his antlered helm breaks off, and he graciously offers it to the victor. However, Sandor tosses the bit of gold into the crowd, who begin to fight for it, until Renly walks out among them to restore the peace.[13]\n\nRenly shows Lord Eddard Stark a painted portrait of Margaery Tyrell, and asks if she looks like Lyanna Stark, King Robert's late betrothed. Eddard is puzzled by this, stating the girl looks nothing like his sister Lyanna. He wonders if Renly is imitating Robert's behavior in falling in love with a girl he believes looks like Lyanna.[7] Robert even tells Eddard that Renly has told him about Ser Loras Tyrell's lovely sister.[28] In actuality, Renly and Loras want Robert to put aside Cersei and take Margaery as his new queen.[32]\n\nWhen the small council learns that Daenerys Targaryen is pregnant, Renly advises Robert to have the exiled girl assassinated.[33] Renly joins Robert when the king goes hunting in the kingswood for a white hart.[34] While Robert lies dying after being gored by a boar, Renly approaches Eddard and suggests they seize control of the royal children before Queen Cersei Lannister can strike.[30] Eddard refuses the offer, however, and Renly flees King's Landing along with Loras.[35]\n\nAfter Robert's death, Renly is among the nobles ordered to swear fealty to King Joffrey I, Renly's nephew.[36] Rumors spread that Eddard had murdered Robert and that Renly then avenged his brother, or that Renly had killed Robert in a drunken quarrel.[37]\n\nRenly manages to win the support of powerful House Tyrell and many of their bannermen through marriage to Loras's sister Margaery. Renly is crowned Lord of the Seven Kingdoms at Highgarden.[38][39]\n\nRenly's crown of soft gold depicts a ring of roses. On its front is a stag's head made of dark green jade, with golden eyes and antlers.[8]\n\nThrough his charisma with and ties to House Tyrell and familiarity with his stormlands bannermen, Renly's claim to the Iron Throne is backed by the largest army in the War of the Five Kings, despite his elder brother Stannis having the better claim. Renly takes to wearing the stag of Baratheon but in the colors of House Tyrell.[8] Lord Mace Tyrell, the father of Margaery Tyrell, serves as Renly's Hand of the King.[40] Because the Kingsguard is already serving Joffrey, Renly creates his own Kingsguard, naming them the Rainbow Guard in honor of the Seven.[19] Renly appoints his lover, Ser Loras Tyrell, as their Lord Commander.[14]\n\nRobb Stark, the young King in the North, sends his mother Catelyn to Bitterbridge to negotiate an alliance with Renly against Lord Tywin Lannister, who is fortified at Harrenhal.[41] Renly has been spending a great deal of time moving through the Reach, gaining support and men at castles such as Horn Hill, while waiting for the right moment to strike.[42] He blocks the supply of food from the roseroad to King's Landing, causing the capital to suffer starvation.[8][43] He hosts tourneys for his men, including a great melee at Bitterbridge, which Catelyn arrives in time to see. Brienne of Tarth, who is infatuated with Renly, wins the melee, and asks to join the Rainbow Guard as her prize, to be close to him.[8]\n\nIn Catelyn's meeting with Renly, he states that if Robb does him homage, he might allow Robb to keep his title, but he refuses to allow the north to secede from the Seven Kingdoms. Renly shows Catelyn his great army, which he feels justifies his claim to the throne, and tells her that once Robb allies with him against the Lannisters, the war is good as done. Renly's plan goes awry, however, when Stannis unexpectedly besieges Storm's End, forcing Renly to respond.[8]\n\nCatelyn convinces the brothers to parley outside Storm's End, but Renly makes light of the situation, refusing to back down from his claim and advising his older brother to give up and eat a peach. Renly also denies Catelyn leave to return to Riverrun, so she may witness the fate of \"rebels\".[42] However, while preparing for battle with Stannis's forces the next dawn, Renly is slain by an animated shadow conjured by his brother's sorceress adviser, Melisandre. Catelyn and Brienne, who were alone with Renly during the assassination, flee back to Riverrun.[18]\n\nAfter learning of Renly's death, an enraged Loras slays three of the king's guards, including Ser Emmon Cuy and Ser Robar Royce of the Rainbow Guard.[44] Stannis is troubled by terrible nightmares.[45] Rumors spread that Renly was killed by a knight of his Rainbow Guard, Stannis, Brienne, Catelyn, or a spurned lover.[44] Most of Renly's lords join Stannis's host,[44] although prominent nobles like Loras, Arwyn Oakheart, Mathis Rowan, and Randyll Tarly refuse and instead return to Bitterbridge.[46] Ser Cortnay Penrose, the castellan of Storm's End, disbelieves that Renly has died, but his body goes missing before it can be presented as proof.[44] Cortnay refuses to surrender Storm's End and his charge, Edric Storm, but the castellan is also assassinated by a shadow.[45][45]\n\nDuring the Battle of the Blackwater, Renly's famous green armor is seen leading the van for Lords Mace Tyrell and Tywin Lannister. \"Renly\" kills Ser Guyard Morrigen and a dozen other knights,[47] causing many of the men in Stannis's host who had once been Renly's to again change sides.[48] Maester Ballabar reports to Tyrion Lannister that smallfolk are claiming that Renly's ghost saved King's Landing.[49]\n\nTyrion asks Bronn about the rumors of Renly's ghost. Bronn says that he saw nothing but the battle being routed, but there are hundreds of men in King's Landing who will claim they saw Renly's ghost killing one man or another.[50] Captain Khorane Sathmantes tells Davos Seaworth of the end of the battle, saying that King Renly's shade was reportedly seen slaying men while leading the van. Allegedly his armor had a ghostly glow from wildfire, and his antlered helm was covered in golden flames.[51]\n\nSer Loras Tyrell, now a member of King Joffrey I Baratheon's Kingsguard, escorts Sansa Stark to a supper with Renly's widow, Margaery, who has been betrothed to Joffrey. Sansa unknowningly offends Loras when she tells him it must have been terrible for Margaery when Renly was killed. Sansa expresses her condolences to Margaery directly, but Margaery's grandmother, Lady Olenna Tyrell, is dismissive of Renly's campaign, and also dismissive of her son Lord Mace Tyrell for allying with him.[50]\n\nTyrion Lannister asks Ser Loras why he joined the Kingsguard at such a young age, giving up hope of a family and children and love. Loras replies \"When the sun has set, no candle can replace it,\"' implying that his great love has ended and he has no wish for another lesser one.[52]\n\nFollowing King Joffrey's wedding to Margaery, Hamish the Harper performs \"Lord Renly's Ride\" during the wedding feast. Hamish sings of Renly's ghost repenting from his attempt to usurp his nephew, returning to this world to defend the realm from Stannis and then returning to Highgarden to see his true love's face one last time, which brings tears to Margaery's eyes.[53]\n\nWhen Ser Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth arrive in King's Landing, they are confronted by Ser Loras Tyrell, who still believes Brienne guilty of Renly's regicide. Jaime defends Brienne from the accusation, in his position the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard ordering Loras to sheathe his sword. However, he has Brienne put in custody for her own protection.[54] Jaime later meets with Loras, and asks about \"Renly's ghost\", wanting to know who actually wore Renly's armor at the Blackwater, and Loras reluctantly reveals that it was his brother, Ser Garlan Tyrell, who fit the armor better than Loras did. He tells Jaime that the masquerade was done per the suggestion of Petyr Baelish, who said the appearance of Renly's ghost, returned for vengeance, would frighten Stannis's men. Loras then tells Jaime that he buried Renly in a place they knew from when he was a squire at Storm's End, a place that no one else could ever find and disturb his remains. Jaime repeats his defense of Brienne, and advises Loras to speak with her and hear her account of the assassination, to be assured that Brienne had not done it and that it was indeed a shadow that killed Renly. Loras recalls that Renly had believed Brienne to be ridiculous but utterly loyal and willing to die for him; he realizes that if she is innocent, then he had killed Robar Royce and Emmon Cuy for nothing.[9]\n\nBrienne continues to face accusations that she killed Renly, from the hedge knights Ser Illifer and Ser Creighton Longbough, and swears by the Seven that she did not harm him.[26] Later, while bathing, Brienne remembers how Jaime Lannister had looked while joining her in the baths at Harrenhal, and tries to recall Renly's face instead.[55] She has another nightmare of Renly's death, but after the shadow cuts him, she sees that the man in the armor is actually Jaime.[55]\n\nAt Maidenpool, Brienne encounters Ser Hyle Hunt and Lord Randyll Tarly, and tells them both that she did not slay Renly. Ser Hyle assures her that since the Reach lords are allied with the Lannisters now, no one cares. Lord Randyll believes Brienne's defense, but judges her for failing Renly and for playing at knighthood.[56]\n\nTaena of Myr tells Queen Regent Cersei Lannister that she was in attendance at Highgarden for Renly's wedding to Margaery Tyrell and the bedding afterwards, and she questions Margaery's claim that the marriage was never consummated.[57]\n\nKing Tommen I Baratheon names Lord Renly, one of Cersei's dromonds, after his late uncle.[57]\n\nWhen Brienne encounters Gendry at the inn at the crossroads, she initially mistakes him for Renly. She soon realizes that while Gendry has Renly's coloring, his build is more like Robert Baratheon, and suspects that he is one of Robert's bastards.[6] In the Vale, Sansa Stark also recognizes that Robert's bastard Mya Stone has the same thick black hair as Robert and Renly.[10]\n\nAfter being attacked by Biter and falling into a fever, Brienne has nightmares of being surrounded by dead men, including Renly, blood streaming from his throat.[58]\n\nAlthough it is never explicitly stated, there are a number of oblique references that imply those who are close to him are aware of Renly's sexual orientation and, more, that he and Ser Loras Tyrell are involved.\n\nCatelyn Stark notices that Renly pays much more attention to Loras than his new bride, Loras's sister Margaery.[8]\n\nWhen Stannis Baratheon and Renly are trading barbs in anticipation of battle at Storm's End, Stannis calls Renly's wedding to Margaery a \"mummer's farce\". In response to Renly's comment, \"You'll be pleased to know she came to me a maid,\" Stannis replies, \"In your bed she's like to die that way.\"[42]\n\nWhile making battle plans outside Storm's End, Renly gives Loras command of the vanguard, passing over several others clamoring for the honor, and calls Loras \"the greatest knight\". After dismissing the others from his tent Renly tells Loras to stay behind and help him \"pray\".[42] Loras later recalls the moment and pauses noticeably while telling Ser Jaime Lannister that he and Renly prayed together.[9]\n\nOberyn Martell calls Loras \"Renly's little rose\" while in conversation with Tyrion Lannister.[59]\n\nTo run his household, Tyrion hires a woman, Brella, because she was adept at being \"blind, deaf, and mute\" while running Renly's household in King's Landing.[29]\n\nWhen Jaime stops Loras from confronting Brienne Tarth, he threatens Loras, \"Now sheathe your bloody sword, or I'll take it from you and shove it up some place even Renly never found.\"[54]\n\nWhile contemplating Margaery's maidenhood, Queen Cersei Lannister reflects on Margaery's marriage to Renly: \"A man may prefer the taste of hippocras, yet if you set a tankard of ale before him, he will quaff it quick enough;\"[60] the implication being that although Renly prefers the company of men, he may nonetheless have bedded Margaery because she was available.\n\nIn an early draft of A Game of Thrones, Renly was Lord of Dragonstone and \"Warden of the Narrow Sea,\" while Stannis was Lord of Storm's End.[65]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nRenly is described as a powerful man[5] who is lean and lithe.[6] He has a handsome, clean-shaven face.[5] Renly greatly resembles a young King Robert I Baratheon,[7] being near as tall as his eldest brother had been.[8] Like Robert, Renly has an easy smile.[7][8] He is taller and broader in the chest than Ser Loras Tyrell.[9]\n\nRenly's thick[10] hair is described as black as jet[5] and coal.[8][6] His fine and straight[8] hair currently falls to his shoulders,[5] although Renly has sometimes kept it short or tied it behind his head with a golden ribbon.[6] He always keeps his hair clean and combed.[6]\n\nRenly has been described as having laughing green eyes that match his armor,[5] as well as deep blue eyes[6] that resemble Robert's eyes.[8][11] According to a semi-canon source, George R.

Loras replies \"When the sun has set, no candle can replace it,\"' implying that his great love has ended and he has no wish for another lesser one.[52]\n\nFollowing King Joffrey's wedding to Margaery, Hamish the Harper performs \"Lord Renly's Ride\" during the wedding feast. Hamish sings of Renly's ghost repenting from his attempt to usurp his nephew, returning to this world to defend the realm from Stannis and then returning to Highgarden to see his true love's face one last time, which brings tears to Margaery's eyes.[53]\n\nWhen Ser Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth arrive in King's Landing, they are confronted by Ser Loras Tyrell, who still believes Brienne guilty of Renly's regicide. Jaime defends Brienne from the accusation, in his position the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard ordering Loras to sheathe his sword. However, he has Brienne put in custody for her own protection.[54] Jaime later meets with Loras, and asks about \"Renly's ghost\", wanting to know who actually wore Renly's armor at the Blackwater, and Loras reluctantly reveals that it was his brother, Ser Garlan Tyrell, who fit the armor better than Loras did. He tells Jaime that the masquerade was done per the suggestion of Petyr Baelish, who said the appearance of Renly's ghost, returned for vengeance, would frighten Stannis's men. Loras then tells Jaime that he buried Renly in a place they knew from when he was a squire at Storm's End, a place that no one else could ever find and disturb his remains. Jaime repeats his defense of Brienne, and advises Loras to speak with her and hear her account of the assassination, to be assured that Brienne had not done it and that it was indeed a shadow that killed Renly. Loras recalls that Renly had believed Brienne to be ridiculous but utterly loyal and willing to die for him; he realizes that if she is innocent, then he had killed Robar Royce and Emmon Cuy for nothing.[9]\n\n\n## A Feast for Crows\n\n\nBrienne continues to face accusations that she killed Renly, from the hedge knights Ser Illifer and Ser Creighton Longbough, and swears by the Seven that she did not harm him.[26] Later, while bathing, Brienne remembers how Jaime Lannister had looked while joining her in the baths at Harrenhal, and tries to recall Renly's face instead.[55] She has another nightmare of Renly's death, but after the shadow cuts him, she sees that the man in the armor is actually Jaime.[55]\n\nAt Maidenpool, Brienne encounters Ser Hyle Hunt and Lord Randyll Tarly, and tells them both that she did not slay Renly. Ser Hyle assures her that since the Reach lords are allied with the Lannisters now, no one cares. Lord Randyll believes Brienne's defense, but judges her for failing Renly and for playing at knighthood.[56]\n\nTaena of Myr tells Queen Regent Cersei Lannister that she was in attendance at Highgarden for Renly's wedding to Margaery Tyrell and the bedding afterwards, and she questions Margaery's claim that the marriage was never consummated.[57]\n\nKing Tommen I Baratheon names Lord Renly, one of Cersei's dromonds, after his late uncle.[57]\n\nWhen Brienne encounters Gendry at the inn at the crossroads, she initially mistakes him for Renly. She soon realizes that while Gendry has Renly's coloring, his build is more like Robert Baratheon, and suspects that he is one of Robert's bastards.[6] In the Vale, Sansa Stark also recognizes that Robert's bastard Mya Stone has the same thick black hair as Robert and Renly.[10]\n\nAfter being attacked by Biter and falling into a fever, Brienne has nightmares of being surrounded by dead men, including Renly, blood streaming from his throat.[58]\n\n\n## Sexuality\n\n\nAlthough it is never explicitly stated, there are a number of oblique references that imply those who are close to him are aware of Renly's sexual orientation and, more, that he and Ser Loras Tyrell are involved.\n\nCatelyn Stark notices that Renly pays much more attention to Loras than his new bride, Loras's sister Margaery.[8]\n\nWhen Stannis Baratheon and Renly are trading barbs in anticipation of battle at Storm's End, Stannis calls Renly's wedding to Margaery a \"mummer's farce\". In response to Renly's comment, \"You'll be pleased to know she came to me a maid,\" Stannis replies, \"In your bed she's like to die that way.\"[42]\n\nWhile making battle plans outside Storm's End, Renly gives Loras command of the vanguard, passing over several others clamoring for the honor, and calls Loras \"the greatest knight\". After dismissing the others from his tent Renly tells Loras to stay behind and help him \"pray\".[42] Loras later recalls the moment and pauses noticeably while telling Ser Jaime Lannister that he and Renly prayed together.[9]\n\nOberyn Martell calls Loras \"Renly's little rose\" while in conversation with Tyrion Lannister.[59]\n\nTo run his household, Tyrion hires a woman, Brella, because she was adept at being \"blind, deaf, and mute\" while running Renly's household in King's Landing.[29]\n\nWhen Jaime stops Loras from confronting Brienne Tarth, he threatens Loras, \"Now sheathe your bloody sword, or I'll take it from you and shove it up some place even Renly never found.\"[54]\n\nWhile contemplating Margaery's maidenhood, Queen Cersei Lannister reflects on Margaery's marriage to Renly: \"A man may prefer the taste of hippocras, yet if you set a tankard of ale before him, he will quaff it quick enough;\"[60] the implication being that although Renly prefers the company of men, he may nonetheless have bedded Margaery because she was available.\n\n\n## Quotes by Renly\n\n\n\n## Quotes about Renly\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n\n\n## Behind the scenes\n\n\nIn an early draft of A Game of Thrones, Renly was Lord of Dragonstone and \"Warden of the Narrow Sea,\" while Stannis was Lord of Storm's End.[65]",
