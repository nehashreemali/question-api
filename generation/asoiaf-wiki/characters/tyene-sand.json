  "content": "Tyene Sand is the bastard daughter of Prince Oberyn Martell and an unnamed septa. She is one of the infamous Sand Snakes.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Tyene is portrayed by Rosabell Laurenti Sellers.\n\nTyene is fair, with golden hair and deep blue eyes.[3] Dimples bloom in her cheeks, and she has a gentle, sweet voice.[3][4] According to a semi-canon source, Tyenne has a widow's peak like her sisters,[2] and they all have the viper eyes of their father, Oberyn Martell.[3]\n\nPrincess Arianne Martell is especially close with Tyene, considering her cousin to be the sister she never had.[5][6] Tyene is also close with her sisters Obara and Nymeria.[6]\n\nDespite her innocent and pious persona, Tyene is regarded as treacherous. Her soft pale hands are as deadly as Obara's callused ones.[4] She shares her father Oberyn's knowledge of poisons, her chosen weapon.[3] Tyene disapproves of the cautious nature of her uncle, Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne.[3][4]\n\nTyene owns a clinging gown of pale blue samite with sleeves of Myrish lace,[3] as well as a modest cream and green gown with long lace sleeves.[4] Tyene is envious of Princess Myrcella Baratheon's curls.[3]\n\nWhen Tyene was in the cradle her mother, a septa, read to her from The Seven-Pointed Star.[4]\n\nTyene spent her youth at the Water Gardens with her cousin, Princess Arianne Martell, as well as with Sylva Santagar, Andrey Dalt, and Garin. Tyene and Arianne grew as close as sisters, learning to read, ride, and dance together. They have shared meals, jewelry, beds, and onetime a flagon of wine stolen by Arianne. The two would have lost their virginity together to Andrey as well, but he was premature in Tyene's hands during the encounter.[6]\n\nArianne once crossed the Mander with three of the Sand Snakes to visit Tyene's mother.[7] Tyene and Arianne once fled Sunspear to try to marry Arianne to Willas Tyrell at Highgarden, but they were caught by Tyene's father, Oberyn Martell, at Vaith.[6] Oberyn also once brought Tyene with Arianne and Sarella Sand to Shandystone, where he showed Tyene how to milk vipers for their venom.[7]\n\nDoran Martell, Prince of Dorne, kept a marriage pact hidden from Arianne because he feared his daughter would not have kept it a secret from Tyene, who would then have informed her sisters, Obara and Nymeria Sand.[6]\n\nTyene waits for Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, in the throne room of Sunspear to demand vengeance for her father, Oberyn Martell, who was slain by Ser Gregor Clegane in King's Landing. She works on an embroidery of a smiling Oberyn armored in red atop a sand steed.[3]\n\nNymeria Sand wants Tyene to aid her in assassinating Lord Tywin Lannister, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, Ser Jaime Lannister, and King Tommen I Baratheon. Tyene instead wants to crown Tommen's older sister, Princess Myrcella Baratheon, as queen, offering to arrange the wedding between Mycella and Doran's youngest son, Prince Trystane Martell. If the Lannisters and Tyrells invade Dorne in response to Myrcella's crowning, they would then be slain in the Dornish mountains and sands. After Doran states that he will think about her proposal, Tyene asks for his blessing. Since Doran laid his hand on Tyene's head before she departed, Maester Caleotte searches for scratches and puncture marks, demonstrating a fear of her knowledge of poisons.[3]\n\nDoran has his captain, Areo Hotah, detain Tyene and her sisters in the Spear Tower as a gesture of good will towards Tommen's court, with Areo tasked with securing Tyene, Nymeria and Obara before their younger siblings.[3]\n\nPrincess Arianne Martell is also retained the Spear Tower after her own plot to crown Myrcella is foiled by Areo.[6]\n\nDoran has Arianne, Obara, Nymeria, and Tyene released from their cells in the Spear Tower. All are present when Ser Balon Swann presents the Mountain's skull to the Prince of Dorne. Tyene is pleased to learn that Ser Gregor Clegane had died screaming for days from poison. When Ricasso raises a toast to King Tommen during the feast, Tyene declines with a murmur.[4]\n\nAfter the feast, Arianne and her elder cousins meet with Doran in his solar. Ellaria Sand, Oberyn's paramour and the mother of his youngest daughters, disapproves of the vengeful plans of Obara, Nym, and Tyene. After Ellaria departs, Doran has the sisters swear their allegiance so he can confide in them his plans. Doran tasks Nymeria with returning Myrcella to King's Landing and joining the small council. Tyene is to accompany her sister to the capital and, disguised as a septa, gain the confidence of the High Sparrow at the Great Sept of Baelor.[4]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nTyene is fair, with golden hair and deep blue eyes.[3] Dimples bloom in her cheeks, and she has a gentle, sweet voice.[3][4] According to a semi-canon source, Tyenne has a widow's peak like her sisters,[2] and they all have the viper eyes of their father, Oberyn Martell.[3]\n\nPrincess Arianne Martell is especially close with Tyene, considering her cousin to be the sister she never had.[5][6] Tyene is also close with her sisters Obara and Nymeria.[6]\n\nDespite her innocent and pious persona, Tyene is regarded as treacherous.
