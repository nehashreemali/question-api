  "content": "Arthur Dayne, also known by his title as the Sword of the Morning, was a famed and legendary knight from House Dayne and a member of Aerys II Targaryen's Kingsguard. Many considered him to have been the most chivalrous warrior of the Seven Kingdoms.[3]\n\nArthur was Prince Rhaegar Targaryen's closest friend.[4] He was the brother of Lady Ashara Dayne and Lady Allyria Dayne. His nephew, the son of Arthur's unknown older brother, is Lord Edric Dayne.[5]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Arthur is portrayed by Luke Roberts.\n\nAccording to Catelyn Stark, Arthur was the deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys II Targaryen's Kingsguard.[6] Jaime Lannister, who idolized Arthur,[7] recalls that Arthur was stronger than he.[8] Jon Connington considers Arthur to have been an efficient commander.[9]\n\nAccording to George R. R. Martin, Ser Barristan Selmy and Arthur were evenly matched with regular swords. However, if Arthur wielded Dawn he would beat Barristan.[10]\n\nArthur wielded the greatsword called Dawn as part of his office as Sword of the Morning, carrying it slung across his back.[11] To defeat the Kingswood Brotherhood, he gained the trust of the smallfolk of the kingswood by paying for what he and his forces took and taking their grievances before King Aerys II Targaryen. In the end Arthur slew the Smiling Knight in single combat and ended the threat of the outlaws. Following that victory, he knighted Jaime Lannister, who would later become a sworn brother of the Kingsguard.[12]\n\nArthur was the champion in the tournament in honor of Viserys's birth in 276 AC, defeating Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.[3] In another tourney, Arthur broke twelve lances against Rhaegar, losing to the prince.[13][N 1] At the tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC, he was defeated by Rhaegar once again.[15]\n\nAccording to a semi-canon source,[16] Arthur, along with his other sworn brother Ser Oswell Whent, aided Rhaegar in the kidnapping of Lyanna Stark near Harrenhal as the year of the false spring was ending.[17] Robert's Rebellion began shortly after.\n\nAfter the end of the rebellion, Arthur, Oswell, and Ser Gerold Hightower were found by Lord Eddard Stark at the tower of joy. Arthur died there, fighting Eddard and his companions, but the exact circumstances of his death are unclear.[11] The recorded history describes Arthur as being killed by Lord Eddard in single combat, however.[18] Bran Stark recalls his father, Eddard, describing Arthur as the finest knight he ever saw and elaborating further that Arthur would have killed him if not for Howland Reed.[19] Stones from the tower were used to build his cairn upon a nearby ridge.[11]\n\nArthur is remembered as not only a skilled fighter but a valiant and true knight.[7][4][19] After Arthur's death, Eddard rode to Starfall, the seat of House Dayne, to return the sword Dawn to Arthur's sister, Lady Ashara Dayne,[6] as a sign of respect.[18]\n\nLord Eddard Stark has a fever dream of Arthur, Ser Oswell Whent, and Ser Gerold Hightower at the tower of joy.[11]\n\nResting on a weirwood stump, Ser Jaime Lannister dreams of he and Brienne of Tarth being visited by the shades of Arthur, Oswell, Gerold, Ser Jon Darry, Prince Lewyn Martell, and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen in the depths of Casterly Rock.[20]\n\nArthur Dayne may have been inspired by King Arthur, the legendary wielder of the magical sword Excalibur. Martin is a keen reader of the Matter of Britain.[22]\n\nBefore writing The Hedge Knight for the Legends anthology, George R. R. Martin considered writing a novella about Arthur Dayne.[23]\n\nThis page uses content from the English Wikipedia. The original content was at Minor houses in A Song of Ice and Fire.
