  "content": "The High Sparrow, so named by the fool Moon Boy after his election to High Septon, is a leading member of the sparrows, a radical and populist sect of the Faith of the Seven. The septon's real name is unknown.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, the High Sparrow is portrayed by Jonathan Pryce.[2]\n\nThe High Sparrow has a lean, sharp face that is heavily lined.[3][4][5] He is a small man,[3] being several inches shorter than Queen Cersei Lannister.[4] Scrawny[5] and thin as a broom handle,[4] he can look half-starved.[5] He ties his thin hair in a knot behind his head,[3][4] and he keeps his grizzled grey and brown beard short and closely trimmed.[3][4] His deep-set eyes are mud-brown[4] and can look suspicious and hard.[5] His bare feet are hard and horny, thick with callus,[3][4] and he has thin hands.[5]\n\nThe man wears a threadbare septon's robe and crystal on a thong about his neck.[3] After becoming High Septon, he does not wear the rich robes or elaborate crowns of crystal and spun gold of his predecessors. Instead, he wears a simple undyed wool tunic that goes to his ankles.[4][5]\n\nThe High Sparrow is devout to the Faith and has an iron will.[4] He believes that women are wantons at heart, with widows being wicked,[5] and he believes that treason is punishable by death.[6] He scourges himself to bring him closer to god.[6]\n\nThe High Sparrow claims to have been a traveling septon, tending to half a hundred villages that were too small to have their own septs and septon. He walked a route between each village, where he performed the traditional duties of a septon, such as naming newborn children, absolving sins, and performing marriages. However, the villages and their people were destroyed during the War of the Five Kings.[4]\n\nOn the Rosby road, Brienne of Tarth spots a group of so-called sparrows who are bringing to King's Landing a wagon filled with the bones of holy men. Their leader, a small, thin septon, urges Brienne's traveling companions, Ser Creighton Longbough and Ser Illifer the Penniless, to join the sparrows on their journey. Though the hedge knights' refusal angers the sparrows, their leader calms his followers and tells them to let the knights pass in peace. Brienne asks the septon if he has seen her lost sister, and though he has not, he asks the Maiden to watch over Brienne and her sister.[3]\n\nAfter the High Septon apparently dies in his sleep, the Most Devout begin the selection process to determine which one of them will become his successor.[7] Numerous sparrows, who have camped in the plaza of the Great Sept of Baelor with the bones of their martyrs, forcibly take over the selection process. Septon Luceon is nine votes from elevation when sparrows burst through the doors of the Great Sept with axes in hand and their thin leader on their shoulders. In fear, the Most Devout name him the new High Septon. The master of whisperers, Qyburn, relates to Cersei all that had occurred.[4]\n\nThe new High Septon begins his term by selling all of the golden crowns of the Faith, including his own gold and crystal crown, as well as their rings, and their robes of cloth-of-gold and cloth-of-silver. The money earned from this is used to buy food for the sparrows and the poor. He clads himself in a humble wool robe, and the Most Devout are forced to follow suit. He has the fat Septon Torbert of the Most Devout confined to a penitent's cell and fed only bread and water, as he feels it is sinful for a man to be so plump when so many people are starving.[4] The High Septon takes as his sanctum a small seven-sided audience chamber below the Great Sept.[6][5]\n\nThe new High Septon refuses to come to the Red Keep to bless young King Tommen I Baratheon, so his mother, Queen Cersei, comes to the Great Sept. She arrives to discover that armed sparrows, including knights, are guarding the doors of the building and will not allow the armed Kingsguard to enter. When Cersei enters, alone, she is appalled to find the new High Septon and the Most Devout on their knees, scrubbing the floors. Cersei is also displeased to learn what had become of the crystal crown that her father, Lord Tywin Lannister, had given the previous High Septon. When Cersei asks why the sparrows have befouled the Great Sept with their encampment, he responds it was first befouled when Lord Eddard Stark was beheaded on its steps.[4]\n\nThe High Septon tells Cersei he is still praying for guidance from the Seven to decide if King Tommen is the rightful king, as the Iron Throne has not protected the men and women of the Faith as King Jaehaerys the Conciliator once promised. Cersei, though angered, concedes to his concerns that the holy brothers and sisters need protection from rape and murder, and he agrees to have Tommen strike down King Maegor's laws that prohibited holy men from bearing arms. Cersei promises to restore the Faith Militant, for which the High Septon will acknowledge Tommen as king and forgive the near one million dragons the crown owed to the Faith.[4]\n\nThe army of sparrows become Poor Fellows, and soon over a hundred knights join the Warrior's Sons. The new High Septon becomes commonly known as the \"High Sparrow\" per a jape by the court fool, Moon Boy.[1] Lancel Lannister, grieving for the previous High Septon and regretful of his past actions - namely, his role in the death of King Robert Baratheon,[8] as well as becoming Cersei's lover -[9] renounces his lordship of Darry and travels to King's Landing to swear his sword to the new High Septon and join the Warrior's Sons.[10][1]\n\nCersei plots against Tommen's wife, Queen Margaery Tyrell, and sends her sworn shield, Ser Osney Kettleblack, to the High Sparrow to falsely confess to bedding Margaery and two of her cousins, Megga and Elinor Tyrell.[11] When Margaery and her cousins attend the Great Sept on Maiden's Day, they are arrested by the Faith, emboldened by its new power. However, the High Sparrow is suspicious of Osney's confession, as he had never heard a confession from a man so pleased to be guilty, and he has Osney scourged. Under torture, Osney confesses the actual truth: that Cersei had him lie, that she was the queen he had bedded, and that he killed the previous High Septon under her orders. After Cersei visits Margaery's cell at the Great Sept, she meets with the High Septon in his sanctum. The High Septon shows her Osney in chains and has Cersei imprisoned when she tries to flee, planning to have a sacred court of seven godsworn judges both queens.[6]\n\nDoran Martell, Prince of Dorne, tasks Tyene Sand with accompany her sister Nymeria to King's Landing and befriending the High Sparrow.[12]\n\nSince the evidence against Margaery and her cousins is quite weak, the High Septon releases them into the custody of Lord Randyll Tarly. The High Septon requires Randyll to swear a holy oath to return them for trial.[5]\n\nThe High Septon disapproves of King Stannis Baratheon, believing that Stannis has turned from the truth of the Seven to worship a red demon, and that his false faith has no place in the Seven Kingdoms.[5]\n\nLancel is one of the accusers against his cousin, Cersei. After days of solitary confinement, Cersei tells her guardian septas that she wishes to confess, and she is brought before the High Sparrow. To try and gain access to visitors, Cersei confesses that after the death of her husband, King Robert I Baratheon, she had sexual relations with Lancel and all three Kettleblacks (although she is lying about having slept with Osney's brothers, Osmund and Osfryd). She knows such admissions would not earn her an execution, but denies the sins that would result in a death sentence. Cersei denies having ordered Osney to kill the previous High Septon, denies any involvement in Robert's death, and denies having incestuous relations with her brother, Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard. The High Septon agrees to allow her one visitor a day.[5]\n\nSer Kevan Lannister, the Lord Regent, informs his niece that he has spoken with the High Sparrow, who has agreed to free Cersei on the condition that she perform a public walk of atonement through King's Landing. Cersei reluctantly agrees, and she walks naked from the Great Sept to the Red Keep.[5][13]\n\nCersei and Margaery are still to be put on trial for the accusations they deny to be true and that the accusers have not recanted. Cersei chooses trial by combat, with Ser Robert Strong as her champion. Margaery chooses trial by the Faith.[14] While Cersei waits for her trial date, Kevan places her under house arrest in the Red Keep. Cersei is attended by a septa and three novices selected by the High Septon, rather than her usual ladies-in-waiting. The High Septon insists that no girl spend more than seven days with Cersei, lest she be corrupted.[14]\n\nKevan, Randyll, and Mace Tyrell, the new Hand of the King, are frustrated by having to give in to the demands of the \"High Sparrow\". However, with so many rebellious subjects in the Seven Kingdoms, they dare not be seen to go against the Faith, lest it drive the pious into the arms of another claimant to the Iron Throne.[14]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nThe High Sparrow has a lean, sharp face that is heavily lined.[3][4][5] He is a small man,[3] being several inches shorter than Queen Cersei Lannister.[4] Scrawny[5] and thin as a broom handle,[4] he can look half-starved.[5] He ties his thin hair in a knot behind his head,[3][4] and he keeps his grizzled grey and brown beard short and closely trimmed.[3][4] His deep-set eyes are mud-brown[4] and can look suspicious and hard.[5] His bare feet are hard and horny, thick with callus,[3][4] and he has thin hands.[5]\n\nThe man wears a threadbare septon's robe and crystal on a thong about his neck.[3] After becoming High Septon, he does not wear the rich robes or elaborate crowns of crystal and spun gold of his predecessors.
