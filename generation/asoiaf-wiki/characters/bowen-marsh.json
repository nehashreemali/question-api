  "content": "Bowen Marsh, also known as the Old Pomegranate, is the Lord Steward of the Night's Watch.[3]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Bowen is portrayed by Michael Condron.\n\nBowen is round and red as a pomegranate,[3] with plump hands,[5] round cheeks,[6] and a red face.[5][1] The Lord Steward has a mind for counts and measures.[7] He wears a bearskin[7] and carries a dagger.[8]\n\nAs Lord Commander Jeor Mormont is known as the \"Old Bear\", Edd Tollett refers to Bowen as the \"Old Pomegranate\".[9] Although he is a northman, Bowen appears to follow the Faith of the Seven.[10] Jeor does not feel that Bowen would make a suitable replacement as Lord Commander.[3]\n\nBowen is one of the guests at the dinner organized by Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, on the eve of Tyrion Lannister's departure.[3]\n\nThe Lord Steward accompanies Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly, who have been assigned as stewards, when they pronounce their vows in the weirwood circle found beyond the Wall in the haunted forest.[5]\n\nBowen is assigned as castellan of Castle Black by Lord Commander Mormont while the great ranging takes place. He sends letters to King's Landing, requesting assistance for the Night's Watch.[11]\n\nAfter Jeor Mormont's death at Craster's Keep, Bowen temporarily takes command of the Night's Watch until the election of a new Lord Commander. Mance Rayder, King-Beyond-the-Wall, sends groups of wildlings to attack along the Wall, feints to distract the Watch. When Bowen obliges by leading a force west to deal with the wildlings, he appoints the ancient Ser Wynton Stout to command Castle Black in his absence.[2]\n\nThe Lord Steward chases wildlings to the Shadow Tower and into the Gorge. He defeats the Weeper in a fight at the Bridge of Skulls, but the Night's Watch suffers heavy losses.[12] Bowen suffers a head wound[13] and is treated by Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower.[12]\n\nBowen and the survivors from the Bridge of Skulls are brought back to Castle Black by Ser Denys Mallister. While riding east, they meet and join with Sam Tarly and Gilly.[13]\n\nBowen is a candidate in the election of a new Lord Commander. The Lord Steward withdraws his name by the third day as his vote totals dwindle, however, and he instead begins supporting Janos Slynt,[13] who is favored by Lord Tywin Lannister, Hand of the King.[14] The castellan objects to King Stannis Baratheon's desire to take castles along the Wall and land in the Gift from the Watch, and he is wary of Stannis's and Melisandre's intention for nightfires to be lit at each castle.[14] Bowen attempts to sway his sworn brothers and Stannis of Janos's worth,[14] but Jon Snow is eventually chosen instead.[15]\n\nBowen has lost weight and part of an ear after his battle at the Bridge of Skulls,[17] occasionally rubbing at his scar,[8] and he has become more cautious.[18] Bowen is at first helpful to Jon, but he becomes increasingly angry with his decisions. These include appointing a baseborn lad, Satin, as the Lord Commander's new steward,[6] appointing the wildling Leathers as the new master-at-arms at Castle Black,[6] and allowing wildlings to join the Watch and diminish the food supply.[17][7] Bowen is shocked when Jon executes Janos for disobedience.[10]\n\nSupported by most stewards and builders of the Watch,[19] Bowen suggests sealing the gate through the Wall at Castle Black, but his advice is rejected by Jon.[17] He tries to discourage the Lord Commander from leading some recruits to recite their vows in the haunted forest, suggesting Castle Black's sept instead.[20] Bowen refuses to attend the wedding of Alys Karstark and Sigorn.[21]\n\nJon tasks Bowen with collecting tolls from wildlings passing through the Wall and sending the riches to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.[7][22]\n\nThe final straw for Bowen is when Jon reads aloud a letter sent by Ramsay Bolton and states his intention to march on House Bolton at Winterfell, threatening the neutrality of the Night's Watch. A crying Bowen and fellow conspirators stab Jon several times in the mutiny at Castle Black.[8]\n\nBowen's name is once misspelled as \"Bower\" in A Dance with Dragons.[6]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nBowen is round and red as a pomegranate,[3] with plump hands,[5] round cheeks,[6] and a red face.[5][1] The Lord Steward has a mind for counts and measures.[7] He wears a bearskin[7] and carries a dagger.[8]\n\nAs Lord Commander Jeor Mormont is known as the \"Old Bear\", Edd Tollett refers to Bowen as the \"Old Pomegranate\".[9] Although he is a northman, Bowen appears to follow the Faith of the Seven.[10] Jeor does not feel that Bowen would make a suitable replacement as Lord Commander.[3]\n\n\n## Recent Events\n\n\n\n## A Game of Thrones\n\n\nBowen is one of the guests at the dinner organized by Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, on the eve of Tyrion Lannister's departure.[3]\n\nThe Lord Steward accompanies Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly, who have been assigned as stewards, when they pronounce their vows in the weirwood circle found beyond the Wall in the haunted forest.[5]\n\n\n## A Storm of Swords\n\n\nBowen is assigned as castellan of Castle Black by Lord Commander Mormont while the great ranging takes place.
