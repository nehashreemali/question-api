  "content": "Jojen Reed is a member of House Reed. He is Lord Howland Reed's only son and Meera Reed's younger brother. Jojen has greensight, the power of prophetic green dreams.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Jojen is portrayed by Thomas Brodie-Sangster.\n\nJojen is short and slim, with unusually deep green eyes. He wears green-colored clothing, even his boots.[6] The boy speaks softly and slowly.[1]\n\nJojen is barely an adolescent when he arrives at Winterfell, but his gravity and mature personality make him seem older.[2] He knows a number of arcane things that he gleans from his dreams, claiming to know the day of his death.[1]\n\nIn his childhood, Jojen nearly died of greywater fever. While he was near death, he was visited in a dream by a three-eyed crow. Jojen has since had the gift of greensight, causing him to experience prophetic dreams known as green dreams. One such dream involved a winged wolf bound with stone chains, which the three-eyed crow was trying to free. When Jojen told his father, Howland Reed, about the dream, Lord Howland sent him and his sister Meera to Winterfell.[1]\n\nEven though he experiences green dreams, Jojen is not a greenseer, since he lacks the abilities of a warg and cannot commune with weirwood trees.[2]\n\nIn the middle of the harvest feast at Winterfell, Jojen and his sister Meera arrive. They pledge House Reed's support to Winterfell and the new King in the North, Robb Stark, renewing their vows after Lord Eddard Stark's death. The siblings recite their oath to Robb's younger brother, Bran Stark. Jojen asks about the Direwolves, wanting to see them, and is told they are in the godswood of Winterfell. That night, Bran dreams of the Reeds meeting Summer and Shaggydog, the direwolves of Bran and his brother Rickon. Jojen is not afraid of the direwolves, telling Meera that it is not the day he dies, and attempts to pet Summer.[6]\n\nAfter the feast, the other lords and knights depart within a few days, but the Reeds stay at Winterfell and become Bran's constant companions. Because of his solemnity, Old Nan nicknames Jojen \"little grandfather\". Some weeks after the feast, Meera and Jojen visit the godswood with Bran and play with Summer. Meera reveals to Bran that Jojen has the greensight, and that they were sent to Winterfell by their father, Howland Reed. Jojen explains he has dreamed of a winged wolf and a three-eyed crow who lives beyond the Wall. He interrogates Bran about his own dreams, angering him, and Summer growls at Jojen. Though Bran tries to call him off, Summer begins to aggressively stalk Jojen, and is soon joined by Shaggydog. Jojen remains calm, again telling Bran and Meera that it is not the day he dies, but follows Meera's command to climb the weirwood to escape the direwolves.[1]\n\nThough Jojen's abilities are discounted by Maester Luwin, Meera tells Bran of one of Jojen’s green dreams:\n\nLater, Bran learns from Luwin of Robb Stark's victory over Ser Stafford Lannister in the Battle of Oxcross, and the death of Ser Stevron Frey. While Bran is happy for the victory, he knows that only Lord Tywin Lannister matters. In contrast, neither \"Big\" Walder or \"Little\" Walder seem bothered by their uncle Stevron's death. Because they are more concerned about the Frey line of succession than Stevron's death, the maester tells them that they should be ashamed. Bran realizes that the situation is the same as Jojen's green dream, proving its truth, and asks him for the dream he had about a bad thing coming to Winterfell.[3]\n\nBran, confused and dismayed, responds that the sea is far away and Winterfell has high walls, but Jojen insists the sea will flow over the walls. Bran tells Jojen about his own dreams of the three-eyed crow and his dreams of falling. Jojen tells him he is a warg, and that he is powerful but will not fly unless he opens his third eye. Jojen also warns Bran not to tell anyone because people will fear him. Bran tries to warn others about Jojen's dream, but mostly the dream of the sea is dismissed.[3]\n\nSer Rodrik Cassel returns with a prisoner who was involved in the forced marriage and then murder of Lady Donella Hornwood. Jojen reveals he has seen the bodies of Bran and Rickon at the feet of the man they call Reek and he is skinning off their faces with a knife. Meera states that she could kill Reek, but Jojen tells her she would not succeed.[3]\n\nDuring the capture of Winterfell by Theon Greyjoy, Meera and Jojen are herded from their room by Stygg.[7] Alebelly,[7] Septon Chayle,[8] and Mikken[7] are slain by the ironborn, as Jojen had foreseen in his green dream.\n\nThe Stark and Reed children, along with Osha and Hodor, disappear from Winterfell in the night. Theon leads a search party into the wolfswood, but they are unable to find the escapees.[8] Theon and \"Reek\" murder a pair of miller's sons and present their flayed bodies as Bran and Rickon to the people of Winterfell.[8][9]\n\nUnbeknownst to the ironborn, Bran and his companions have been hiding in the crypts of Winterfell.[10] When they eventually reemerge, they find that Winterfell has been burned, signs of fighting, and numerous corpses. In the godswood, the dying Luwin advises Osha to split up the Stark children to make them harder to find. Osha decides to take Rickon with her south, and Jojen says that he and Meera will take Bran. After they separate, Meera, Hodor, and Bran travel north upon Jojen's recommendation.[10]\n\nWhen Bran wakes from a wolf dream while in the ruins of Tumbledown Tower, Jojen warns Bran against spending too much time as the wolf Summer. While Bran would like to stay, Meera and Jojen remind him it is dangerous for them to travel in the north, and that Bran will not learn about his gifts while remaining at the tower. After considering seeking refuge with House Stark's bannermen, Bran tells the Reeds he wants to fly, and to take him to the three-eyed crow.[2]\n\nAs they move north, Jojen insists that they keep away from roads because roads have travelers that will spread tales about a giant, a crippled boy and a a wolf. When the weather turns bad in the northern mountains, Summer finds them a cave, where they find a Liddle who shares his food and warns the kingsroad has become dangerous. When the Liddle states things were different when there was a Stark in Winterfell, Jojen tells him that he dreamed the wolves will return. In the morning the man is gone, but he leaves some food for them.[11]\n\nThe travelers arrive at a village in disrepair in the New Gift: the most substantial building, the inn, only has a few walls still standing. They take refuge from a storm in Queenscrown, the holdfast in the middle of the lake, but they detect men in the village, one of whom turns out to be Jon Snow traveling with wildlings. Bran possesses Summer and attacks the wildlings going after Jon. Summer kills three of them, but takes an arrow to the shoulder. The group waits until the next day to leave after the wildlings are gone.[12][13]\n\nThe companions arrive at the Nightfort, the castle in Jojen's green dream. The surefooted Meera climbs to the top of the Wall to get a look at the other side, while the boys search the abandoned buildings, but they cannot figure out how to get across the Wall. They decide to sleep that night in the kitchen, as it would provide some warmth and protection. As they go to sleep, Jojen states that maybe he will have a green dream to show him the way. In the middle of the night, they hear the sound of footsteps and heavy breathing coming up from a well in the kitchens, and Meera traps what emerges in her net and sticks it with her frog spear. Once they have more light, they see she has captured Samwell Tarly, a man of the Night's Watch, and Gilly and her baby also exit the secret stairs in the well. Sam explains his group was aided by Coldhands, a pale man with cold black hands who was dressed in the black of the Night's Watch, who has been sent to find Bran. Sam tells them that they came through the Black Gate, a passage as old as the Wall. Sam will have to take them down through the well to the gate, because only a man sworn to the Night's Watch can open the gate. Jojen, Meera, Hodor, and Bran go down the well's stairway and through the Black Gate.[14]\n\nJojen, Meera, Bran, Hodor, and Coldhands travel beyond the Wall in search of the three-eyed crow, riding Coldhand's great elk. The journey is difficult for all the children, as they struggle to find food and deal with the cold. Jojen especially becomes listless and demoralized. They take shelter in an abandoned wildling village while Coldhands deals with a threat. The group discusses the nature of Coldhands, deciding that he is not alive. Meera protects her weakened brother Jojen from the cold, though he tells Meera it is not the day he dies.[15]\n\nWhen his great elk collapses along their journey, Coldhands whispers a blessing in an unknown language and slits the animal's throat; he and Meera butcher the carcass for food. They reach the cave of the three-eyed crow, and Meera helps Jojen climp up the hill, half-carrying, half-dragging him. When the group is ambushed by wights near the entrance, Coldhands fights them off while Meera jabs at them with her spear to keep them away. Bran takes control of Hodor and attacks the wights, and Meera defends the giant man when a wight claws at him. Leaf, one of the children of the forest, fends off the wights, allowing Hodor to carry Jojen and Meera to rescue Bran's crippled body. Inside the cave, the group meet the remaining children and the three-eyed crow.[16]\n\nThough they find safety in the cave, staying there for months while Bran learns about being a greenseer from the three-eyed crow, Jojen falls into a resigned depression. He wanders through the caverns alone, and often climbs up to the cave's mouth to stare out at the forest for hours, shivering. Meera tells Bran that Jojen wants to go home to Greywater Watch. She says that Jojen isn't willing to try and fight his fate, stating that the green dreams do not lie. Meera says she had hoped finding the three-eyed crow would do something, but now she wonders why they even came. After Bran is fed the weirwood paste and communes with Winterfell's heart tree for the first time, Hodor returns him to their sleeping chamber in the cave, but neither Meera nor Jojen are there.[17]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nJojen is short and slim, with unusually deep green eyes.
