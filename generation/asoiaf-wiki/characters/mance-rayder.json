  "content": "Mance Rayder was once a man of the Night's Watch before breaking his vows and abandoning his post. He has since become extremely influential among the free folk, and is called the \"King-Beyond-the-Wall\".\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Mance is portrayed by Ciarán Hinds.\n\nMance is a slender man and of middling height,[2] but broader in the chest and shoulders and taller than Rattleshirt.[3] His long brown hair has gone mostly to gray,[4][5] and laughter lines appear at the corners of his mouth.[1] Mance has a sharp face with shrewd brown eyes.[4]\n\nMance has a fondness for music, especially wildling songs.[6] Some consider his voice passable and his playing fair.[7] He also has a passion for free folk women.[6]\n\nMance wears wool and leather,[4] over which he drapes a slashed cloak of black wool and red silk from Asshai. He armors himself with black ringmail and shaggy fur breeches. Mance's helm is bronze and iron and has raven wings at each temple.[8][9] Although recognized as King-Beyond-the-Wall, he does not wear a crown[4] or carry a scepter.[8] Mance's great tent is made from the white pelts of snow bears and is topped with the antlers of a giant elk.[4][9]\n\nAccording to Selyse Florent, Mance's parents were a common woman of the free folk and a man of the Night's Watch.[10] After a group of raiders were put to the sword when Mance was a child, he was taken by the Night's Watch and raised as one of them.[6] According to a semi-canon source, his last name of \"Rayder\" comes from this origin.[11]\n\nA ranger of the Shadow Tower, Mance often sang of Bael the Bard after returning from rangings beyond the Wall.[6] Some time between 286 AC and 288 AC,[12] Lord Commander Qorgyle traveled to Winterfell to meet with Lord Eddard Stark, with Mance among the black brothers escorting him. In Winterfell, he encountered the young Robb Stark and Jon Snow playing a prank, and promised not to tell.[4]\n\nYears later,[12] Mance was attacked by a shadowcat while ranging, and was healed by a wildling woman, a wisewoman's daughter. While he recuperated, she mended his torn cloak with swatches of red silk. Upon returning to the Wall, Ser Denys Mallister required Mance to replace his mended cloak with one of uniform black. This infringement of freedom caused Mance to abandon the Shadow Tower[6] and live with the free folk in the way he wished.[4]\n\nMance spent years gaining gathering various tribes into one host, seeking support from clan mothers and magnars. He made peace between  Harma Dogshead and the Lord of Bones, the Hornfoots and the Nightrunners, and the men of the Frozen Shore and the ice-river clans.[8] Opposed by five other would-be Kings-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance gained the support of Tormund of Ruddy Hall and Styr of Thenn and slew the three rivals who refused to submit.[9]\n\nMance is familiar with hiding places east of Long Lake from his secret expeditions into the north.[1]\n\nHearing of King Robert I Baratheon's planned visit to Winterfell to see Lord Eddard Stark via sources in the Night's Watch, Mance, inspired by the legend of Bael the Bard, decided to partake in the event. He scales the Wall near Long Barrow, purchases a horse south of the New Gift, and journeys to Winterfell.[4]\n\nUsing his lute to disguise himself as a musician, Mance joins Robert's retinue as it nears Winterfell. Mance sits with freeriders at the back of the Great Hall during the feast in honor of King Robert's visit to Winterfell. Mance's presence is unbeknownst to both Eddard, who does not remember Mance from his previous visit with Lord Commander Qorgyle, and Benjen Stark, who had never met Mance despite being in the Watch for a few years.[4]\n\nMance meets Dalla upon his return to the lands beyond the Wall.[4]\n\nOsha suggests capturing Bran Stark in the wolfswood and delivering him as a hostage to Mance, but Osha is instead captured by House Stark.[13]\n\nA captured wildling tells Qhorin Halfhand that Mance is gathering wildlings to a secret stronghold.[14]\n\nFollowing the rumors about Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, and the wildlings deserting their villages, the Night's Watch assembles in force in a great ranging beyond the Wall.[15] Craster informs Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, that Mance is gathering wildlings in the Frostfangs. Jeor fears that Mance intends to strike south against the Seven Kingdoms.[16]\n\nMance sends Alfyn Crowkiller to scout along the Wall, but he is slain by Qhorin's men.[17]\n\nMance has his followers dig in graves along the Milkwater[18] in search of the legendary Horn of Winter, said to be capable of toppling the Wall, but the horn is not found.[19]\n\nWhen Jon Snow meets with Mance in the Frostfangs under pretext of joining his campaign, the bard sings \"The Dornishman's Wife\". Jon mistakes the more distinctive Tormund and Styr as Mance.[4] Mance sends Styr to climb the Wall and attack Castle Black from the south.[20] He sends Jon with Styr's group,[8] but Jon escapes at Queenscrown and manages to warn the black brothers about the upcoming attack.[21]\n\nAfter Styr's attack fails,[22] Mance attacks the Wall with his main force. Despite his better numbers, the Night's Watch under command of Jon Snow are successful in keeping Mance's forces at bay.[23][24] Aware of the low numbers of the Night's Watch, Mance eventually sends a request for a parley to Castle Black, requesting an envoy is sent to him. Ser Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt send Jon, secretly tasking with assassinating the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Displaying a huge horn in his tent, Mance threatens to use the Horn of Winter if he is not allowed to pass through the gate. However, Mance reveals that the free folk, including his own people, have been hunted by the Others and their wights, and are unable to stop them. His true aim therefore is not to destroy the Wall, but to use it as a shield against the Others.[9]\n\nDuring the parley, rangers from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the southern force of Stannis Baratheon unexpectedly arrive. Although Mance personally leads a wedge of mounted free folk against them, the disorganized wildling army breaks once Mance's horse goes down.[9] Mance's wife, Dalla, goes into labor during the battle[9] and dies giving birth to their son.[25]\n\nMance himself is captured by Stannis and held captive at Castle Black, where his wounds are treated by Maester Aemon.[26] Stannis Baratheon speaks with him, but feels he has no other choice but to sacrifice Mance to R'hllor[25] once he is strong enough.[26] At Castle Black, Mance's son is given over to Val, Dalla's sister, while the girl Gilly serves as his wet nurse.[26] Val requests to be allowed to see Mance and let him hold his son once.[26] Jon Snow presents the request to Stannis Baratheon, but is denied.[25]\n\nFearing that Stannis Baratheon will allow his red priestess, Melisandre, to sacrifice Mance's son in the belief that Mance's title of \"King-Beyond-the-Wall\" could be construed as his child having royal blood, Jon Snow, the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, sends Gilly away from Castle Black and forces her to leave her own son behind and secretly take Mance's son instead.[27][28] Gilly later suggests the name Aemon Steelsong for Mance's son.[29]\n\nMors Umber agrees to support Stannis if he is given Mance's skull to use as a drinking cup, since Mors's only daughter was carried away by wildlings.[30]\n\nMance is supposedly burned alive by Stannis with surrendered free folk, members of the Night's Watch, king's men, and queen's men there to bear witness. Jon Snow orders him killed by archers of the Watch during the burning to give him a quick death.[31] In actuality the man killed is Rattleshirt, who is glamoured by Melisandre's magic to appear like Mance. Meanwhile, the actual Mance is glamoured by a ruby worn at his wrist to appear as Rattleshirt. Sparring with \"Rattleshirt\" in the yard of Castle Black, Jon is shocked by the man's speed and skill, not knowing he is actually Mance.[3]\n\nWord reaches the Wall that Arya Stark is to wed Ramsay Bolton at Barrowton, and Melisandre has a vision of a girl in grey on a dying horse.[3] Melisandre offers to send \"Rattleshirt\" to retrieve Arya, but Jon refuses, not trusting the Lord of Bones. Melisandre reveals Mance's disguise to make Jon reconsider the offer. Jon holds Mance's son so Mance would do everything in his power to rescue Jon's sister for the sake of his son. However, Mance does not know that Mance's son was switched with Gilly's son.[1] Lord Roose Bolton, the new Warden of the North, later decides to move his son's wedding to Winterfell.[32]\n\nNo longer appearing as Rattleshirt, the brown-bearded[5] Mance takes six spearwives with him to find Arya:[33] Rowan, Holly, Squirrel, Willow Witch-eye, Frenya, and Myrtle. He arrives at Winterfell as a bard under the assumed name Abel,[7] an anagram for \"Bael\", and claims the women are camp followers and relatives to him.[34] Mance performs throughout the wedding and subsequent feasts at Winterfell.[7][34][35] His songs include \"Two Hearts That Beat as One\",[7] \"Fair Maids of Summer\"[7], \"The Dornishman's Wife\",[34] \"Iron Lances\",[35] \"The Winter Maid\",[35] \"The Queen Took Off Her Sandal, the King Took Off His Crown\",[35] \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\",[35] \"The Maids That Bloom in Spring\",[35] and an unnamed sad song.[5]\n\nWith Winterfell snowbound from a blizzard, Mance's spearwives kill several northern men. Suspicion is cast on Theon Greyjoy at first, then Manderly knights, causing tension in the castle between Boltons, other northern houses, and Freys.[35][5] They also receive the help of a reluctant and fearful Theon to help them free \"Arya\", though he knows she is really Jeyne Poole. Tensions explode in the castle when Little Walder Frey is murdered, though the spearwives claim it was not their doing. Theon assists Mance's spearwives in rescuing Jeyne, but when Jeyne gives their position away by screaming, Theon and Jeyne are forced to jump from Winterfell's battlements to the snow below.[5]\n\nIt is reported in a letter to Jon purportedly from Ramsay Bolton that Mance has been captured. Ramsay claims Mance has been thrown in a cage which is exposed to the elements and that the six spearwives that came with him have been killed and skinned. Mance is allegedly being forced to use their sewn-together skins in the cage, as it is his only source of warmth.[10]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nMance is a slender man and of middling height,[2] but broader in the chest and shoulders and taller than Rattleshirt.[3] His long brown hair has gone mostly to gray,[4][5] and laughter lines appear at the corners of his mouth.[1] Mance has a sharp face with shrewd brown eyes.[4]\n\nMance has a fondness for music, especially wildling songs.[6] Some consider his voice passable and his playing fair.[7] He also has a passion for free folk women.[6]\n\nMance wears wool and leather,[4] over which he drapes a slashed cloak of black wool and red silk from Asshai.
