  "content": "Areo Hotah is the captain of the household guard at Sunspear for the Prince of Dorne, Doran Martell. He is originally from the Free City of Norvos, where he was trained by the bearded priests.[2]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Areo is portrayed by DeObia Oparei.[3]\n\nAreo is broad-shouldered with white hair which was once dark,[2] and he has a seamed and scarred face.[4] Areo speaks the Common Tongue with a gruff, deep voice and thick Norvoshi accent.[2][4] The captain is loyal, obedient, and confident in his martial abilities,[2][4] and he has a bellowing voice when commanding his guardsmen.[5] Areo usually stations himself to the left of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, and he carries the prince gently when needed.[2]\n\nIn Norvos, Areo wore a heavy horsehair cape, a studded leather tunic, and an iron halfhelm with a crest of sharpened spikes. When he arrived in Dorne, he quickly realized he had to change his clothing to acclimatize to the Dornish sun. Nowadays, he wears a shirt of copper scales with a billowing cloak of dun-and-yellow sandsilk to keep the sun off the copper. The sun beating down on the metal of his Norvoshi halfhelm caused him headaches, so he wrapped it in orange silk.[2] Areo's longaxe has a shaft of mountain ash six feet long and is kept in a sling across his back,[2] and he considers it his ash-and-iron wife.[6]\n\nAreo is an old friend and protector of Doran's daughter and heir, Princess Arianne Martell.[4]\n\nAreo was born in Norvos[7] as the youngest of six children, with two brothers and three sisters, and he was sold to the bearded priests at a young age. When he was sixteen years old, Areo completed his training. He was wedded to his axe and branded on his chest to signify the event.[2]\n\nAreo became a guardsman to the family of Lady Mellario, and was present the day she first met her future husband, Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne.[7][4] He escorted Mellario when she traveled with Doran to Dorne, having learned Westerosi speech. Upon arrival in Dorne, Areo found it a strange place; the Dornish women were lewd, Dornish wine was sour, and Dornish food was full of queer hot spices. He also thought the Dornish sun was hotter than the pale, wan sun of Norvos.[6] Areo entered the service of House Martell, and Mellario married Doran.[2]\n\nAreo watched all of Doran and Mellario's children grow up, and developed a father-like love for Princess Arianne Martell, whom he refers to as \"little princess.\"[2][6] Despite this affection, however, he is utterly loyal to Prince Doran.[2][5] Areo eventually became the captain of Prince Doran's guard, and remained in Dorne to serve the Martell's even after Mellario returned to Norvos. Even after all his years in Dorne, Areo still reminds himself of the vows he took when he was sixteen, \"Serve. Obey. Protect.\"[2]\n\nWhen Doran Martell moved from Sunspear to the Water Gardens due to his deteriorating health, Areo accompanied him. On occasion, Areo is sent to Sunspear by Doran.[2]\n\nAreo is a sellsword serving as captain of guards for Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne.[8]\n\nAreo is at the Water Gardens with Doran. Following the death of Doran's younger brother, Prince Oberyn Martell, Areo accompanies Doran when the latter returns to Sunspear. He is ordered by Doran to arrest Oberyn's bastard daughters, the Sand Snakes.[2]\n\nAreo is sent by Doran to put an end to Arianne Martell's plot to steal Princess Myrcella Baratheon away with the intention of crowning her Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. During the confrontation at the Greenblood, Ser Arys Oakheart of the Kingsguard, Myrcella's sworn shield, charges Areo and his guards. After Arys's horse is brought down by crossbowmen, Areo chops off the knight's right arm at the shoulder and beheads him with his longaxe.[5] Areo orders his men to pursue Ser Gerold Dayne, who has wounded Myrcella. Darkstar escapes, however, which angers Areo.[4]\n\nAreo escorts Arianne back to Sunspear to await an audience with Doran.[4] After she has spent several weeks in confinement in Spear Tower, it is Areo who retrieves Arianne and brings her to her father.[4]\n\nAreo is present at the feast at Sunspear in which Ser Balon Swann of the Kingsguard presents Prince Doran Martell with the skull of Ser Gregor Clegane. Areo notes that Balon looks to be a more formidable warrior than Ser Arys had been, and wonders if it will come to a fight between them as well.[6]\n\nAreo is present when Prince Doran discusses his plans in a private solar with Arianne Martell and Obara, Nymeria and Tyene Sand. They decide to tell Balon that Arys was killed by Darkstar.[6]\n\nAreo joins Obara and Balon on their mission to hunt and kill the rogue knight Darkstar.[6][9]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nAreo is broad-shouldered with white hair which was once dark,[2] and he has a seamed and scarred face.[4] Areo speaks the Common Tongue with a gruff, deep voice and thick Norvoshi accent.[2][4] The captain is loyal, obedient, and confident in his martial abilities,[2][4] and he has a bellowing voice when commanding his guardsmen.[5] Areo usually stations himself to the left of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, and he carries the prince gently when needed.[2]\n\nIn Norvos, Areo wore a heavy horsehair cape, a studded leather tunic, and an iron halfhelm with a crest of sharpened spikes.
