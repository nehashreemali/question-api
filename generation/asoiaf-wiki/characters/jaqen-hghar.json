  "content": "Jaqen H'ghar is a sellsword from Lorath.[4] He is taken as a criminal from the black cells by Yoren to join the Night's Watch.[1]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Jaqen is portrayed mainly by Tom Wlaschiha,[5] and a variety of additional actors when he is wearing different faces, including Patrick O'Kane,[6] Cedric Henderson,[7] and Faye Marsay.[8]\n\nJaqen is a slender, handsome young man with fine features.[1][9] He has shiny long, straight hair streaming down across his shoulders, colored white on one side and red on the other.[9] Though he speaks the Common Tongue, he does so in the traditional manner of the Lorathi, avoiding direct pronouns, referring to himself only as \"a man\" or \"this man\" rather than \"I\" or \"me\", and to others avoiding \"you\" and instead using descriptions like \"a boy\" or \"this girl\".[1][10]\n\nJaqen's prisoner's garb is ragged and filthy.[9] He possesses a thin knife and a cloak, and he is a skilled swordsman.[11]\n\nJaqen is polite,[1][12] calm and casual,[4] and always smiles.[1] Serving girls admire him.[9] His friendly voice[1] can resemble silk and steel.[11] Arya Stark thinks that the intimidating Rorge might be scared of Jaqen.[4]\n\nJaqen claims he was once of the Free City of Lorath,[1][13] and that his sire is long dead.[11]\n\nAt the Red Keep in King's Landing, Yoren pleads for volunteers to join the Night's Watch. No knights accept the wandering crow's offer, however, so Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King, gives Yoren his pick of the king's dungeons.[14] Jaqen is one of the three common men Yoren takes from the black cells,[15] the others being Rorge and Biter.[1]\n\nWhen Yoren's party departs King's Landing for the Wall, he keeps Rorge, Biter, and Jaqen fettered in a cage in a wagon. Despite the situation, Jaqen is polite to Arya Stark, who is disguised as a boy named \"Arry\".[1]\n\nJaqen remains caged with Biter and Rorge when the group of recruits decides to spend the night in the holdfast of a deserted town on the southern shore of the Gods Eye. The town is burned down that night by men under the command of Ser Amory Lorch. As the cage is threatened by the fire, Jaqen shouts for Arya's help, claiming he can fight. Before Arya flees into a tunnel, she throws an axe to Rorge, who uses it to chop through the wagon, allowing the three prisoners to escape the fire.[16][17]\n\nRorge, Biter, and Jaqen join Ser Amory's raiding party, and Arya, now disguised as the servant girl \"Weasel\", observes their arrival at Harrenhal, feeling betrayed. However, that night Jaqen interrupts Arya's sleep, and explains that he knew she is actually a girl. Jaqen insists that because Arya had helped him, Rorge, and Biter escape death by burning at the Gods Eye, he now owes her three deaths to repay those she stole from the \"Red God\". Jaqen asks for her to give him three names.[9][18]\n\nAfter Arya overhears Chiswyck tell the story of Ser Gregor Clegane and the Mountain's men raping Layna, a brewer's daughter, she gives Chiswyck's name to Jaqen. Three days later, Arya learns that Chiswyck has broken his neck after falling from a wallwalk; some claim that the soldier was killed by the ghost of Harren the Black.[9]\n\nLater on, Weese, the understeward of the Wailing Tower, slaps and berates \"Weasel\". Arya finds Jaqen relaxing in Harrenhal's bathhouse, and whispers Weese's name to the Lorathi. The next day, Arya regrets her choice while watching the powerful Lord Tywin Lannister depart Harrenhal with his army. Arya rushes to find Jaqen in an attempt to change her second name, but she discovers that Weese's throat has already been torn out by his own spotted dog. Amabel attributes Weese's death to Harren's ghost.[4]\n\nVargo Hoat and the Brave Companions bring to Harrenhal captured northmen and rivermen led by Robett Glover and Ser Aenys Frey. Jaqen finds Arya in the godswood of Harrenhal and asks her for the third name, claiming he will kill anyone in the world that she names, even his own father if he were still alive, even King Joffrey I Baratheon. After Jaqen refuses to aid Arya in freeing the captives, she shocks him by whispering \"Jaqen H'ghar\" in his ear. Arya promises to unsay his name only if he helps her, so Jaqen sends the girl to the kitchens to have hot broth prepared. Rorge and Biter then help Jaqen and Arya bring four kettles to the dungeon beneath the Widow's Tower. Eight of Amory's guardsmen prepare to eat the broth, but the sellswords throw the scalding broth in their faces and begin killing them. One guard draws his sword, but Jaqen duels him with his own sword and stabs the man in the heart. When Robett Glover asks if the three men are Brave Companions, Rorge replies affirmatively.[11]\n\nRorge and Biter go off to help the freed northmen and Brave Companions with the fall of Harrenhal, but Jaqen remains by Arya's side. She takes back his name and asks if she still has a third death to request, but Jaqen reminds her of the various men he has already helped kill on her behalf. Jaqen informs her it is time for him to \"die\", passing his hand down his face and changing his appearance. Jaqen's cheeks become fuller, his eyes are closer together, his nose is now hooked, and a scar appears on his right cheek. Jaqen's long red and white hair is changed into a cap of tight black curls. He also now has a shiny golden tooth. When Arya requests that he teach her how to do that, the man who was once Jaqen, now speaking with typical Westeros pronoun usage, tells her that she must come with him across the narrow sea. When she says she cannot go, he gives Arya a small iron coin, claiming it has great value. He says that should she ever wish to find him again, she should give the coin to any man from Braavos, and tell him \"valar morghulis\". When Arya asks him once more to stay, he tells her Jaqen is dead, and he has promises to keep. He then departs Harrenhal during the fighting, and Vargo's Brave Companions turn the castle over to Lord Roose Bolton.[11]\n\nAlthough Jaqen did not explain the meaning of valar morghulis, Arya begins to use the words with her prayer listing the people she hates and wants dead.[11][19] Arya sometimes regrets not leaving with Jaqen. As she examines the worn iron coin he gave her, which has foreign writing on one side and a man whose face has rubbed off on the other, Arya becomes so angry at the lies Jaqen told her that she throws the coin away, but an hour later she decides to find it again and keep it. When Arya escapes Harrenhal, she distracts a Bolton guard with the iron coin and then slits his throat; she whispers \"valar morghulis\" as he dies.[19]\n\nArya continues to use the words valar morghulis to end her nightly prayer.[20][21][22][23] When Arya is captured by the brotherhood without banners and meets Harwin, a former household guard of Winterfell, she tells him much of her adventures since she escaped King's Landing, but does not tell him about how Jaqen and how he killed for her.[21] She feels strong remembering how Jaqen made her the ghost in Harrenhal, but is unhappy recalling how he and so many others have left her.[22]\n\nSeeking passage from Westeros, Arya shows the iron coin to Ternesio Terys, the captain of the Braavosi ship Titan's Daughter. At the captain's confusion, she recalls that Jaqen had also given her words to say. When Arya says, \"Valar morghulis\", Ternesio replies, \"Valar dohaeris\", and agrees to transport her from Saltpans to Braavos.[24]\n\nWhen Arya arrives at the House of Black and White in Braavos, she offers the iron coin to a kindly man, who says he does not know Jaqen's name.[13] Arya is allowed to serve at the temple, but the kindly man continues to not recognize Jaqen's name. The kindly man eventually tells her about the origins of the Faceless Men, and she learns that they do not use names.[25]\n\nA man claiming to be an alchemist, whose appearance matches the appearance of Jaqen's new face, approaches Pate, a novice of the Citadel, in Oldtown. He promises Pate a gold dragon in exchange for Archmaester Walgrave's key. They make the exchange, but Pate dies after biting the coin.[26] When Samwell Tarly later arrives at the Citadel, he is welcomed by a novice who introduces himself as Pate.[27]\n\nAt the House of Black and White, plague face explains to Arya that in order for her to truly become a servant of the Many-Faced God, she must be willing to surrender all of her identity, including her name and face. When the kindly man uses the Faceless Men's magic to give her the face of an ugly, broken girl, Arya passes her hand down her face as she had seen Jaqen do to change his, but nothing apparently happens.[28]\n\nJaqen's ability to change his appearance at will and his possession of the iron coin of the House of Black and White imply an association with the Faceless Men of Braavos.[2] It has been theorized that Jaqen is the \"man without a face\" that the ghost of High Heart prophesied killing Balon Greyjoy.[29] It has also been theorized that Jaqen, in the appearance of the alchemist, killed the novice Pate, and is now impersonating him at the Citadel. While real Pate hated to be associated with the character of the popular tales,[26] the impersonator mentions being the namesake of the character after meeting Samwell Tarly.[27]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nJaqen is a slender, handsome young man with fine features.[1][9] He has shiny long, straight hair streaming down across his shoulders, colored white on one side and red on the other.[9] Though he speaks the Common Tongue, he does so in the traditional manner of the Lorathi, avoiding direct pronouns, referring to himself only as \"a man\" or \"this man\" rather than \"I\" or \"me\", and to others avoiding \"you\" and instead using descriptions like \"a boy\" or \"this girl\".[1][10]\n\nJaqen's prisoner's garb is ragged and filthy.[9] He possesses a thin knife and a cloak, and he is a skilled swordsman.[11]\n\nJaqen is polite,[1][12] calm and casual,[4] and always smiles.[1] Serving girls admire him.[9] His friendly voice[1] can resemble silk and steel.[11] Arya Stark thinks that the intimidating Rorge might be scared of Jaqen.[4]\n\n\n## History\n\n\nJaqen claims he was once of the Free City of Lorath,[1][13] and that his sire is long dead.[11]\n\n\n## Recent Events\n\n\n\n## A Game of Thrones\n\n\nAt the Red Keep in King's Landing, Yoren pleads for volunteers to join the Night's Watch.
