  "content": "Obara Sand is the bastard daughter of Oberyn Martell and an Oldtown whore. She is the eldest of the infamous Sand Snakes.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Obara is portrayed by Keisha Castle-Hughes.\n\nObara is a big-boned woman near to thirty, long-legged, with close-set eyes and with the same rat-brown hair of her mother[3] which she sometimes ties in a knot.[4] She strides quickly and angrily.[3][4] Obara has callused hands and can have a mannish look.[4]\n\nA prickly, hot-tempered woman,[5] Obara is given to martial pursuits as she considers herself a warrior. She wears a mottled sandsilk cloak of dun and gold over brown riding leathers and wields a spear, a whip, and a round shield of steel and copper.[3] Instead of a gown, fierce Obara prefers men's breeches, a calf-length linen tunic, and a belt of copper suns.[4]\n\nObara is a confident rider who uses spurs, often to the point where the animal is bloody, and she always rides stallions.[3] Obara is also fond of wine.[5]\n\nObara was born to a prostitute in Oldtown. When Prince Oberyn Martell came to claim her, her mother did not want to let her go and insisted that Obara's father was one of the other men she had been with. Oberyn tossed his spear at Obara's feet and slapped her mother in the face. Then he told the girl to choose, pointing to the spear and her mother's tears. Obara chose the former, and her mother drank herself to death within a year.[3]\n\nObara spent part of her youth at the Water Gardens.[3]\n\nObara meets Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, at the Water Gardens, demanding vengeance for her father, Oberyn Martell, who was slain by Ser Gregor Clegane in King's Landing. Obara wants to slay Gregor's liege, Lord Tywin Lannister, and burn Oldtown. Doran says he will think about it. After more visits by her half-sisters, Doran orders the arrest of all the Sand Snakes.[3] The elder sisters are detained in the Spear Tower in Sunspear.[4]\n\nObara and her sisters are released from the Spear Tower and are present at the feast when Ser Balon Swann presents the Mountain's skull to Doran. She places Gregor's skull on top of a marble column because Maester Caleotte cannot reach it.[4] When a toast is raised by Ricasso to King Tommen I Baratheon, Obara allows her wine cup to be filled before upending it onto the floor and leaving.[4]\n\nWhen discussing Gregor's death with her sisters, Areo Hotah, Arianne Martell, Ellaria Sand, and Prince Doran, Obara vouches for war against House Lannister, causing Ellaria alarm.[4] Doran has Obara lead Balon to High Hermitage so he can hunt and kill Ser Gerold Dayne for his attack on Princess Myrcella.[4]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nObara is a big-boned woman near to thirty, long-legged, with close-set eyes and with the same rat-brown hair of her mother[3] which she sometimes ties in a knot.[4] She strides quickly and angrily.[3][4] Obara has callused hands and can have a mannish look.[4]\n\nA prickly, hot-tempered woman,[5] Obara is given to martial pursuits as she considers herself a warrior.
