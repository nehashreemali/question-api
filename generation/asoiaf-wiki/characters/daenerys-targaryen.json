  "content": "Daenerys Targaryen, also known as Daenerys Stormborn,[5] is one of the last confirmed members of House Targaryen, along with her older brother Viserys, who refers to her as Dany.[5][17] She is the youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Queen Rhaella. She is one of the major POV characters in A Song of Ice and Fire.\n\nIn the television adaptations Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, Daenerys is portrayed respectively by Emilia Clarke and Imogen Ruby Little.[18] She was previously played by Tamzin Merchant in the rejected pilot episode of Game of Thrones.\n\nA young woman in her early teens, Daenerys has the classical Valyrian look; She has violet eyes,[5] pale skin,[17] and long, pale silver-gold hair.[5][1][19] Daenerys is slender of frame,[5] with small breasts.[5][1][20] She is said to resemble Queen Naerys Targaryen, though Daenerys is taller and stronger.[21] Daenerys has been described as fair,[19][14][22] and beautiful.[23][13][24]\n\nBeside the Common Tongue, Daenerys speaks the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities with a Tyroshi accent,[25] and High Valyrian.[9] She quickly learns the Dothraki language,[6] and the Ghiscari tongue.[3][26]\n\nDaenerys grew up terrified of and abused by her brother Viserys,[10] and was regarded as fearful and furtive by Magister Illyrio Mopatis.[27] She grows more confident in A Song of Ice and Fire, however, and her followers generally regard her with great respect and love, and Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy have compared her to her deceased brother, Prince Rhaegar,[6][8][11] who had been valiant, honorable, and noble, and is still fondly remembered in the Seven Kingdoms.[9]\n\nAs she was raised in exile, never staying long at one place, Daenerys has never truly known a place to call home. Though she describes the fragrance of the Western Market at Vaes Dothrak as smelling \"of home\", they in fact remind her of her days spent in several of the Free Cities as a small child.[25] Among the Dothraki, she feels safe, loved and hopeful for the first time.[28] The house with the red door in Braavos, where she lived until she was about five years old, has come to symbolize her lost childhood,[5][25] and she frequently wishes to return there.[29][3][30][31] Though she has never seen Westeros and cannot remember Dragonstone, she believes that the Iron Throne is her by rights, as Viserys's heir, and that ruling the Seven Kingdoms is her duty. Daenerys abhors slavery[32] and is willing to put the needs of her people before her own desires.[26]\n\nDaenerys loves the sea, as it makes her feel free, as well as the sailors and their songs and stories.[23] She also loves to read children's stories and songs from the Seven Kingdoms about tall and handsome heroes.[29] She enjoys heat, preferring her baths scalding hot.[5][33]\n\nDescending from dragonlords, Daenerys dreams of dragons.[1][34] Though Daenerys is familiar with the Faith of the Seven,[29][31] and believes in the existence of gods, she does not appear to follow a particular faith.[29][31][7]\n\nDaenerys sometimes dresses in Dothraki garb; a painted vest and riding leathers, while going about barefoot,[34] with her hair oiled[34][33] and her skin sun-browned.[33] Her other Dothraki attire includes silk or horsehair pants, woven grass sandals, a medallion belt, and her painted vest.[20][23][10] She often wears silver bells in her braided hair per Dothraki custom, one for each of her victories.[20][9][11][35] Daenerys also owns a Qartheen gown which leaves one breast bare,[36] several Ghiscari tokars,[3][37] and a musty-smelling hrakkar cloak.[38]\n\nDaenerys is the youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Queen Rhaella. Daenerys was conceived during the last month of Robert's Rebellion, the war which ended House Targaryen's reign over the Seven Kingdoms. Shortly thereafter, her mother was sent with the young prince Viserys to the family ancestral seat of Dragonstone to escape the rebel army which was marching towards King's Landing. Daenerys was born nine months after their flight, while a great storm raged above Dragonstone, sinking what remained of the Targaryen fleet; for this reason she is known as \"Daenerys Stormborn\". Her mother died in labor,[5] but not before naming her.[39]\n\nThe war had been lost shortly after Rhaella had fled the city, after which Robert I Baratheon had claimed the Iron Throne. With Aerys, his eldest son Rhaegar, and Rhaegar's young children Rhaenys and Aegon dead, Daenerys and her older brother Viserys were the only known living Targaryen heirs. As Viserys had been crowned king on Dragonstone by their mother before her death,[40] Daenerys received the title \"Princess of Dragonstone\" as Viserys's heir.[5]\n\nRobert's brother, Stannis, built a new royal fleet in preparation for an assault on Dragonstone. With the Targaryen fleet destroyed by the storm during which Daenerys had been born, the garrison at Dragonstone were prepared to sell the Targaryen children to Robert. However, before they could act on this plan, Ser Willem Darry and several other loyal retainers took the children from the nursery and smuggled them into exile, sailing to the Braavosian coast.[5]\n\nViserys and Daenerys lived in Braavos in a house with a red door, where Daenerys had her own room, and a lemon tree underneath her window. Willem was old and sickly, but Daenerys remembers that he always treated her kindly.[5] When Daenerys was five years old, Willem fell sick and slowly wasted away.[41] After his death, the servants he had hired stole all they could. The young Targaryens were put out of the house a while after. As they were forced out, Daenerys wept.[5]\n\nViserys and Daenerys left Braavos, and wandered the Free Cities for years. They visited nearly all the Free Cities, including Myr, Tyrosh, Qohor, Volantis, and Lys,[5] and returned to Braavos at least once.[23] While at first they were welcomed by magisters and archons and merchant princes, with time their interests in the last Targaryens decreased. Daenerys and Viserys had to sell their last few treasures, and eventually their mother's crown.[5] Selling their mother's crown took the last of Viserys's joy, leaving only rage.[42] Daenerys remembers how Viserys once feasted the Golden Company, hoping they would take up his cause, but to no avail.[19] Considering himself to be the rightful ruler, Viserys grew bitter and obsessed with the birthright he had been denied. Daenerys was a frequent target for his frustrations. He had never forgiven her for their mother's death in childbirth, and frequently warned her not to \"wake the dragon\" by angering him.[5] Once, when Daenerys and Viserys were on their way to Braavos by ship, Daenerys expressed to her brother how fine it would be to be a sailor. Angry, Viserys twisted her hair until she cried.[23] Because Viserys often told her that their line must be \"kept pure\", Daenerys grew up believing that she would marry him once she came of age.[5]\n\nThough Viserys's growing bitterness made their relationship more troubled, Daenerys also has fond memories of her brother from times when he had not yet been so angry. He let her crawl into bed with him and told her stories about the Seven Kingdoms, about their family[23] and their history,[5][30] their dragons,[34] and Robert's Rebellion.[5][28] Almost everything Daenerys knows about Westeros she learned from Viserys, making her feel as if she knew what it was like without ever having been there. Viserys is intent on reclaiming their father's throne, and he promised Daenerys a thousand times that he will take her back to Westeros,[25] and that their lives will be much better once he has.[23] Viserys also told her about siege towers[35] and the Faith of the Seven.[29]\n\nIn 297 AC, Viserys and Daenerys were taken in by Illyrio Mopatis, a magister of the Free City of Pentos, who offered his help in reclaiming the Iron Throne for Viserys. They have lived with Illyrio for almost half a year.[5]\n\nIllyrio Mopatis, a magister of Pentos, arranges a marriage between Daenerys and Drogo, a powerful khal of the Dothraki, in return for the promise of an army which her brother, the would-be Viserys III Targaryen, can use to claim the Iron Throne. Though Daenerys does not want the marriage, Viserys is insistent.[5]\n\nDaenerys and Drogo are wed outside of the walls of Pentos. Daenerys receives multiple bride gifts, including three petrified dragon eggs from Illyrio, three handmaidens (Irri, Jhiqui, and Doreah) from her brother, and a magnificent silver mare from Drogo. She is frightened by the seemingly barbaric Dothraki culture and has absolutely no way of communicating with Drogo, as they do not speak each other's languages. After the wedding ceremony is over, Drogo leads Daenerys away from the khalasar to consummate their marriage. Daenerys is terrified, but Drogo proves to be surprisingly tender and considerate. He lets Daenerys know that he understands one word in the Common Tongue (\"no\"), and touches her gently and gradually. Only after she gives him her consent do they have sex.[1]\n\nThe day after the wedding, Drogo's khalasar leaves Pentos. The khal assigns four young men—Aggo, Jhogo, Quaro, and Rakharo—to protect Daenerys as her khas. Although she is also accompanied by both Viserys and Ser Jorah Mormont, an exiled knight who has sworn his sword to Viserys, Daenerys feels lonely. Her entire body hurts from spending her days on horseback and her nights with Drogo.[34]\n\nOn the night that Daenerys decides she cannot go on anymore, she dreams about a black dragon. The flames of the beast cleanse her and make her feel strong and new and fierce. From that night onwards, life among the Dothraki begins to come more easily to Daenerys. She begins to enjoy her surroundings, and grows more confident. She also dares for the first time ever to fight back against Viserys when he attacks her in a rage. Daenerys shoves him away, realizing that Viserys is a pitiful thing and would make a terrible king. When she discusses this with Jorah, Daenerys is shocked to learn how poorly the knight thinks of Viserys. When Drogo arrives in her tent that night to take his pleasure, Daenerys leads him outside, as the Dothraki believe that everything of importance happens must be done beneath the bare sky. Daenerys initiates sex with Drogo, and her new-found confidence and strength mark the beginning of a loving relationship between them.[34]\n\nThe khalasar travels toward Vaes Dothrak, passing through Ghoyan Drohe, Norvos, Qohor, Vaes Khadokh, and southern Sarnor.[43] On the far end of the Dothraki sea, on her fourteenth nameday, Daenerys reveals that she is pregnant.[34] The khalasar arrives at Vaes Dothrak, and Jorah informs Daenerys about the chances the Dothraki would have against Westerosi armies. That evening, Daenerys and Viserys argue. When he grabs her, she hits him with a belt and orders him to leave.[33]\n\nIn Westeros, King Robert I Baratheon has learned of Daenerys's marriage to Drogo from Jorah Mormont, who is in the employment of Lord Varys, Robert's master of whisperers. Though Robert's new Hand of the King, Lord Eddard Stark, protests against the notion of killing Daenerys, calling her an innocent child, Robert nonetheless fears that Daenerys will soon start breeding more \"dragonspawn\", and that Viserys will cross the narrow sea with a horde of Dothraki. Eddard convinces him that the Dothraki are not likely to cross, and that they can easily defeat them if they do.[44] The matter is laid to rest, but is brought up again when a report from Jorah arrives in King's Landing, informing the small council that Daenerys is pregnant. Robert wants Viserys, Daenerys, and her child killed, and while Eddard and Ser Barristan Selmy protest, the rest of the council agrees with Robert. In the end, it is decided that Varys will quietly let it become known that whoever kills Daenerys, her child, and Viserys will be given a lordship.[45]\n\nAt Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys is presented to the dosh khaleen, and she takes part in a ceremony for her unborn child in which she eats a raw stallion heart. The dosh khaleen predict that Daenerys will have a son, who will be \"the stallion who mounts the world\", a long-prophesied leader destined to unite the Dothraki into a single khalasar and conquer the world. Daenerys chooses the name Rhaego for her son, after her eldest brother, Rhaegar. Daenerys and Drogo have sex after she bathes in the Womb of the World.[17]\n\nAt the feast after the ceremony, Jorah tells Daenerys he prevented Viserys from stealing and selling her dragon eggs. A drunk Viserys arrives late at the feast. Having grown increasingly impatient for Drogo to give him his army and his crown, Viserys arrives carrying a blade, which is forbidden in Vaes Dothrak. He threatens both Daenerys and her unborn child. Daenerys translates for Drogo, who tells Viserys that he will give him his crown. While his bloodriders take hold of Viserys, Drogo melts the golden medallions from his belt, and he pours the molten gold over Viserys's head, giving him his golden crown. Daenerys calmly watches as Viserys pleads with her, and he dies screaming.[17]\n\nNow the last remaining member of House Targaryen, Daenerys believes her family's throne should be conquered for her unborn son and attempts to persuade Drogo to invade the Seven Kingdoms. However, Drogo has no interest in doing so, until Daenerys is rescued by Jorah Mormont from drinking poisoned Arbor red offered by a wineseller at the Western Market of Vaes Dothrak. They learn that King Robert I Baratheon has promised a lordship and lands to whoever kills Viserys, Daenerys, and her child. Furious, Drogo vows to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for his son. When they depart Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys has the would-be assassin forced to run after her silver mare until he collapses and dies.[25]\n\nDrogo leads his khalasar south, planning to take captives to sell at the cities of Slaver's Bay in exchange for ships. They encounters a Lhazareen town, which is under attack by the khalasar of Khal Ogo. They battle, and Drogo is victorious. Though most of Ogo's riders have fled, Jorah estimates that there are ten thousand captives. Daenerys is disgusted and disturbed by the sight of the Dothraki raping women, and she eventually orders every rape she sees stopped, claiming the women as her own slaves to protect them. Though this angers Drogo's riders, Daenerys refuses to give them back. Drogo is pleased by Daenerys's boldness, and he allows her to keep her slaves.[6]\n\nDrogo is injured, but the healers are occupied elsewhere. When Daenerys insists that Drogo's cuts are seen to immediately, a Lhazareen godswife, Mirri Maz Duur, offers her service. Drogo's bloodriders call the woman a maegi, but Drogo agrees to accompany Mirri inside the temple, supported by Daenerys, where Mirri tends to his wounds. Afterwards, Daenerys asks Mirri to be her midwife when she goes into labor.[6] Mirri's poultice itches and burns Drogo, and he eventually tears it off, replacing it with a mud plaster.[28]\n\nDrogo's wound festers, and he grows weaker and weaker until he falls from his horse. Daenerys realizes the danger in this, as a khal who cannot ride cannot rule, according to the Dothraki. Daenerys orders Drogo's bloodriders to make camp, and to pretend the command came from Drogo. She also orders Mirri Maz Duur to be brought to her. Though Qotho protests every order she gives, he leaves to fetch Mirri. Daenerys has Drogo brought into his tent, and she learns that rumors of Drogo's fall are spreading through the camp when Jorah arrives. Daenerys begs Jorah to help Drogo. When they are alone, Jorah removes the mud plaster from Drogo's wound, concluding that Drogo is \"as good as dead\". He urges her to flee, as a power struggle among the kos will follow Drogo's death, and the victor is likely to kill Rhaego, while Daenerys will be forced to join the dosh khaleen. Daenerys refuses to leave Drogo. She protects Mirri from Qotho and Haggo, and she sends Jorah to go fetch his armor, in case of trouble.[28]\n\nDaenerys asks Mirri to heal Drogo using blood magic. The maegi warns that some claim death would be cleaner, and that \"only death may pay for life\", though Mirri reassures Daenerys that her life is not the payment. As part of the ritual, Drogo is placed in a bath, and his stallion is slain so its blood can mix with the water in the tub. Daenerys is told to prevent anyone from entering the tent during the ritual. As Mirri sings her spells, battle erupts between Drogo's bloodriders and Daenerys's khas, with Qotho killing Quaro and then being slain by Jorah. Rhaego begins to kick wildly inside Daenerys, and she goes into labor as men are dying around her. The birthing women refuse to attend Daenerys, and when someone suggests Mirri, Jorah lifts Daenerys up in his arms and carries her into the tent. Daenerys is too weak to protest.[28]\n\nDaenerys wakes days later, after several fever dreams, with one of her dragon eggs in her arms, as she had requested during one of her short waking moments. Rhaego was stillborn and malformed, Daenerys learns, and had been dead for months according to Mirri, even though Daenerys had felt him strong and alive shortly before her labor had begun. Mirri reveals that Rhaego's death was the true price of the blood magic. Drogo's khalasar is gone, split into two new khalasars belonging to Khal Pono and Khal Jhaqo. Although Drogo still lives, he is in a catatonic state. Daenerys demands to know when Drogo will be as before, and Mirri replies \"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before\". She reveals that it had been wrong of Drogo's khalasar to burn her temple, and that Rhaego's death means that the stallion who mounts the world is now unable to burn cities or trample nations into dust.[7]\n\nDaenerys orders Mirri arrested. She attempts to get a response from Drogo by pleasuring him and speaking to him, but realizes that he is truly gone. Daenerys euthanizes the khal,[7] and she has the remaining Dothraki build him a funeral pyre. Daenerys declares herself to be a queen, and she states the remaining people are her khalasar now. She frees the slaves, names Jorah as a knight of her Queensguard, and names Jhogo, Rakharo, and Aggo, the three surviving men from her khas, as her kos, ignoring their refusal to be bloodrider to a woman. Daenerys places her three dragon eggs onto Drogo's funeral pyre, beside his body. She also has Mirri bound to the pyre, claiming \"only death can pay for life\". Drogo's pyre is lit when the first star, a fiery red comet, is seen in the sky. Once the entire pyre is afire, Daenerys walks into the flames.[46]\n\nThe next morning, when the flames have gone out and the ground has cooled down, Daenerys's new khalasar finds her amidst the ashes, naked but unharmed, holding three newly-hatched dragons, the first living dragons since 153 AC. They all kneel and swear their oaths to Daenerys, more loyal to her than they had ever been to Drogo.[46]\n\nDaenerys names the three dragons Viserion (after her brother Viserys), Rhaegal (after her brother Rhaegar), and Drogon (after her husband Drogo). Although the Dothraki are convinced the red comet is an ill omen, Daenerys believes that it a herald of her coming, which points in the direction in which she must travel. However, she is aware of the fact that the comet's direction was the only direction in which they could have gone; to the north are too many khalasars, to the south the Lhazareen, and to the east Pono's khalasar, all hostile to them. She leads her people east, through the red waste.[38]\n\nThey eventually arrive in an abandoned city, which Daenerys dubs Vaes Tolorro. While her khalasar recovers from the terrible journey through the desert, Daenerys sends out her bloodriders to scout in every direction. Aggo and Rakharo return without hopeful news, and Daenerys begins to fortify Vaes Tolorro, in case of enemies. After a long time, Jhogo returns accompanied by three citizens from the city Qarth: the merchant Xaro Xhoan Daxos, the warlock Pyat Pree, and the shadow-binder Quaithe of Asshai.[38] They escort Daenerys and her khalasar to Qarth, where Xaro invites them to stay in his palace. Daenerys learns of the death of King Robert I Baratheon and the unrest in the Seven Kingdoms.[8]\n\nDaenerys visits the Pureborn of Qarth, hoping to convince them to help her in her conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, but they refuse her. On her way back to Xaro's palace, Daenerys sees Quaithe, who urges Daenerys to travel to Asshai. Xaro proposes marriage to Daenerys, which she finds amusing as Xaro is completely uninterested in the charms of women. Jorah warns her that according to Qartheen marriage customs, Xaro would be within his rights to ask a dragon of Daenerys if they were to wed, and she would not legally be able to deny him. Not knowing where else to turn, Daenerys decides to go to the warlocks.[36]\n\nDaenerys goes to the House of the Undying, where Pyat Pree gives her shade-of-the-evening, and she enters the building with only Drogon by her side. Inside, Daenerys sees several strange visions. When she reaches the hall of the Undying, they tell her that she will light three fires (one for life, one for death, and one to love), ride three mounts (one to bed, one to dread, and one to love), and face three betrayals (one for blood, one for gold, and one for love). More visions follow as the Undying attack her. Drogon sets the Undying Ones on fire, allowing Daenerys to flee the burning building. Outside, Daenerys is attacked by Pyat, but Jhogo, Rakharo, and Drogon save her.[2]\n\nThe destruction of the House of the Undying turns the Qartheen against her. Xaro warns Daenerys that Pyat Pree is gathering warlocks against her, and after she refuses to marry him once more, he suggests that she should leave Qarth. Xaro offers to give her ships in exchange for a dragon, and when Daenerys refuses, insists she leaves his palace. Daenerys visits the port of Qarth to seek passage on a ship for herself, her khalasar and her dragons, but is frequently refused. Jorah warns her that they are being followed by two strangers. When a Sorrowful Man gives her a box containing a manticore with the purpose of killing her, one of the strangers knocks the manticore aside before it can sting her. The two strangers, Belwas and Arstan Whitebeard, inform Daenerys they had been sent to Qarth by Magister Illyrio with three ships to escort Daenerys and her party back to Pentos. Daenerys renames the ships Vhagar, Meraxes and Balerion, after the dragons of Aegon I Targaryen and his sister-wives, Rhaenys and Visenya, and sets sail for Pentos.[20]\n\nWord of a three-headed dragon having hatched in Qarth reaches King's Landing and is reported to the small council by Lord Varys.[47]\n\nOn their way to Pentos, Ser Jorah Mormont convinces Daenerys to change course to Astapor, one of the slaver cities of Slaver's Bay. Mistrustful of Illyrio's motives, Jorah believes it wise to purchase Unsullied before traveling to Illyrio, so Daenerys has an army loyal to her. He kisses her and professes his love for her, telling her that he could be one of the three heads of the dragon, as her husband.[23] Lonely since Drogo's death, Daenerys one night takes her maid Irri as a lover.[9]\n\nIn Astapor, Daenerys visits the Plaza of Pride, where Kraznys mo Nakloz informs her about the capabilities of the Unsullied. As Daenerys pretends she cannot understand High Valyrian, Kraznys's scribe Missandei translates his rude remarks into respectful statements. Though Arstan Whitebeard counsels against using slaves,[9] Daenerys informs the Good Masters that she wishes to purchase all eight thousand six hundred Unsullied, as well as the five thousand boys still in training, in exchange for all her goods, ships, and Drogon. The slavers agree, and give her Missandei as a gift. On their way back to the ship, Daenerys frees Missandei and gives her the option to leave her service, revealing her ability to understand and speak High Valyrian. Missandei decides to stay with Daenerys. That night, Daenerys is visited by Quaithe again, who urges her once more to go to Asshai.[10]\n\nThe next day, Daenerys goes to purchase her Unsullied. After assuming command of the soldiers, Daenerys betrays the Good Masters, ordering Drogon to attack the slavers and her Unsullied to conquer the city.[10] Daenerys frees all slaves, and leaves a council to rule the city.[48] She frees her Unsullied as well, and most decide to serve her as free men.[citation needed]\n\nWith her new army, Daenerys marches to Yunkai. Aware of Astapor's fate, Yunkai hires two sellsword companies, the Stormcrows and the Second Sons, to strengthen their own slave army of four thousand. Daenerys meets with Grazdan mo Eraz, an envoy from Yunkai, as well as with the captains from the sellsword companies. Though two of the captains of the Stormcrows, Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor the Bald, are quick to refuse Daenerys, the third, Daario Naharis, is more polite. Mero, the captain of the Second Sons, behaves rudely in Daenerys's presence. She offers to pay more than Yunkai, and gifts him with enough wine for him and his sellswords when he promises to consider her offer. Grazdan, the last to arrive, offers Daenerys gold, but she refuses and informs him that Yunkai has three days to free their slaves. If they do not, she will sack the city.[11]\n\nOnce the envoy from Yunkai has left, Daenerys reveals that she plans to attack the city that same night, while the Stormcrows are still arguing over her offer, the Second Sons are drunk on the wine she gave them, and the Yunkai'i believe they still have two more days. Shortly before the attack begins, Daario Naharis walks into the Targaryen camp. He presents Daenerys with the heads of Prendahl and Sallor, his fellow captains, and pledges the Stormcrows to her service. While her army attacks Yunkai, Daenerys remains in the camp, and discusses her late brother Rhaegar with Arstan. Daenerys's forces are victorious in the battle near Yunkai. Though Mero escapes, thousand others are taken captive, and Daenerys agrees that any slave or sellsword who swears loyalty to her are to be spared. Daenerys marches the last few leagues to Yunkai. The city gates open on the morning of the third day, and the slaves from Yunkai emerge, hailing her as Mhysa, meaning \"Mother\" in Ghiscari.[11]\n\nDaenerys marches further north, to Meereen. In preparation for her arrival, the Meereenese retreat behind the walls of their city after stripping their lands clean. In addition, the Great Masters nail a hundred and sixty-three slave children onto the mileposts placed on the coast road between Yunkai and Meereen. Daenerys encamps her host, now more than eighty thousand strong (though fewer than a quarter are warriors), outside of the walls of Meereen. Strong Belwas fights against Oznak zo Pahl, the \"hero of Meereen\", and easily slays him. Brown Ben Plumm, the new commander of the Second Sons, suggests entering the city through the sewers, but Daenerys does not consider it a promising idea.[35]\n\nWhen Daenerys takes Missandei and Arstan into the camp of her freedmen, she is attacked by Mero, who had been hidden among her freedmen while awaiting an opportunity to kill her. Arstan saves her life, killing Mero in the process. However, Jorah questions Arstan's ability, causing the aged squire to reveal he is Ser Barristan Selmy, formerly of the Kingsguard. Barristan further reveals that Jorah has served the Iron Throne as a spy, giving them information about Viserys and Daenerys ever since her wedding to Drogo. Daenerys is furious and feels betrayed by both of them.[35]\n\nDaenerys sends Barristan and Jorah into the sewers of Meereen as part of her plan to take the city, half hoping that they will die in their attempt. During the siege of Meereen, her army attacks the gates of the city from the outside and her archers fire arrows at the city's defenders. Meanwhile, Belwas, the knights Barristan and Jorah, and nineteen others enter the city through the sewers to free the slaves, who then revolt against the Great Masters.[29]\n\nWith Meereen taken, Daenerys has one hundred and sixty-three of the Great Masters nailed on posts on the plaza in front of the Great Pyramid to avenge the slain children. Though she is able to pardon Barristan, she finds herself unable to do the same for Jorah. Instead, she exiles him, and warns Jorah that he will be killed if he returns to the city.[29]\n\nDaenerys learns that the council she had previously installed in Astapor to rule the city has been killed and replaced by Cleon, a former butcher who has declared himself king and enslaved the former nobility. In addition, Yunkai is gathering new levies and sending out envoys to form alliances against Daenerys. The queen decides that she cannot leave Meereen to suffer the same violent fate as Astapor, and she informs her captains that she will stay in Meereen to learn how to rule one city before attempting the same for the Seven Kingdoms.[29]\n\nNews of Daenerys's dragons and her campaign continues to reach Westeros. Several acolytes of the Citadel discuss the stories they have heard, including sailors speaking of dragons in Asshai, Qarth, and Meereen, dragons among the Dothraki, and dragons freeing slaves. Though all the tales differ in details, all speak of dragons and a beautiful young queen. Alleras points out that, though Viserys Targaryen is dead, Daenerys is still alive. Leo Tyrell informs the acolytes that Daenerys has, in fact, hatched herself three dragons.[49]\n\nIn Dorne, Arianne Martell recalls having heard stories about dragons in Qarth and a slave revolt in Astapor.[50] Arianne is taken into captivity after failing to crown Myrcella Baratheon. Arianne's father, Prince Doran Martell, informs her that her brother Quentyn has gone on a perilous voyage to bring back their heart's desire, \"fire and blood\".[51]\n\nIn King's Landing, Aurane Waters reports to Queen Regent Cersei Lannister during a small council meeting that sailors speak of dragons in the east,[52] and Qyburn later reports that the slave revolt in Astapor has spread to Meereen, stating that \"sailors off a dozen ships\" speak of dragons.[53]\n\nAt the kingsmoot on Old Wyk, Euron Greyjoy reveals to the ironborn that there are three dragons in the world.[54] After the taking of the Shields, King Euron tasks his younger brother Victarion with sailing the Iron Fleet to Slaver's Bay and bringing back Daenerys so Euron can wed her. Victarion agrees, although he plans to marry Daenerys himself.[55]\n\nIn Braavos, a drunken Dareon repeats tales of dragons to Maester Aemon and Samwell Tarly. Aemon becomes increasingly interested in the stories, but he is too ill to venture outside and learn about them firsthand. He requests that Samwell brings him someone who has seen the dragons. Samwell encounters Xhondo Dhoru, who had seen Daenerys and her dragons in Qarth.[56] Upon hearing Xhondo's stories, Aemon becomes convinced that Daenerys is the princess that was promised, as proven by the dragons. He insists that Samwell informs the archmaesters at the Citadel should be informed about Daenerys and the dangers at the Wall, calling Daenerys \"our last hope\", and believing that a maester should be send to Daenerys to give her counsel.{m Aemon dies on the voyage to Oldtown.[12] Upon his arrival at the Citadel, Samwell encounters Alleras, who listens to his stories and brings him to Archmaester Marwyn at the Ravenry. Marwyn decides to travel to Slaver's Bay himself to give Daenerys his aid.[57]\n\nRumors of Daenerys's striking beauty have spread far and wide,[13] and she is said to have silver-gold hair and amethyst eyes.[24] The head of a man, executed for spying on behalf of Daenerys and fermenting rebellion, is displayed on the Long Bridge of Volantis.[58]\n\nDaenerys rules Meereen as its queen, but she faces multiple enemies. A resistance group of Ghiscari noblemen from Meereen, the Sons of the Harpy, engage in a shadow war against Daenerys, slaying freedmen, Unsullied, and shavepates during the night.[3] Daenerys orders the creation of a city watch, made up from the Meereenese themselves,[30] the Brazen Beasts,[19] and sets a reward for the Sons of the Harpy at one thousand honors.[3] To fund the Brazen Beasts, Daenerys imposes a blood tax on the noble families of Meereen, and demands two hostages from each family in an attempt to stop the killings.[30] The Sons of the Harpy, in turn, offer wealth and glory and a hundred slave girls to whoever slays Daenerys, while promising death to anyone, and their families, who serve Daenerys.[19] The murders continue, but Daenerys finds herself unable to harm any of her hostages.[32] Daenerys further has three fighting companies formed comprised from her freedmen: the Mother's Men, the Free Brothers, and the Stalwart Shields.[3][30]\n\nDaenerys also faces the dislike from the nobility of the city, as numerous crimes had been committed during the sack, and the nobility especially have suffered losses of property and wealth. However, there are also those who support Daenerys. These men have shaven their heads, abandoning the traditional hair styles of the Ghiscari culture. These men, known as shavepates, are led by Skahaz mo Kandaq, who serves Daenerys as a counselor.[3]\n\nDrogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal have been growing wilder and often hunt sheep in the lands surrounding the city. Daenerys pays shepherds for the loss of their animals. However, one day at court, one man lingers after Daenerys has granted compensation to be given for the loss of twenty-three animals. After all petitioners have departed, he presents her with the burned bones of his daughter, Hazzea, saying it had been \"the winged shadow\".[3] Shocked by Hazzea's death, Daenerys orders her dragons captured. Viserion and Rhaegal are locked in a pit underneath the Great Pyramid where Daenerys resides, but Drogon escapes and flies off towards the Dothraki sea.[30]\n\nQuaithe uses magic to visit Daenerys one night, when Daenerys is alone. She informs her that the glass candles are burning, and warns Daenerys about the dangers that are coming. \"Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.\" After telling Daenerys to remember who she is, Quaithe disappears.[30]\n\nDaenerys hosts Xaro Xhoan Daxos, who offers her thirteen ships on the condition that she departs for Westeros immediately. She considers his offer, but realizes that all of her freedmen who stay behind in Meereen will either be enslaved once more or die. Unable to take all of them to Westeros with only thirteen ships, Daenerys refuses Xaro's offer, and Xaro leaves Meereen, declaring war.[19]\n\nThe Wise Masters of Yunkai resumed slavery after Daenerys left for Meereen, and by now have raised a new army of slave levies and sellswords,[3] who are joined by iron legions from New Ghis.[19] King Cleon of Astapor prepares to march into battle, while his envoy, Lord Ghael, requests an alliance between Astapor and Meereen from Daenerys. She refuses him on multiple occasions.[3][19] Cleon is defeated in battle at the Horns of Hazzat,[19] and later killed by his own men.[32] After a short siege, the Astapori make one last stand, and are defeated,[15] and the Yunkai'i begin their march against Daenerys.[citation needed]\n\nGalazza Galare, the Green Grace, counsels Daenerys that she should take a Meereenese noble as her husband, and proposes Hizdahr zo Loraq. Daenerys and Hizdahr come to an agreement; If he can stop the murders by the Sons of the Harpy for ninety days, they will wed. Barristan objects to the marriage, but Daenerys informs him that ninety days is a long period, and Hizdahr could still fail. However, she admits that, should Hizdahr succeed, she will wed him as she promised, for her people.[32] Before leaving, Barristan informs Daenerys that Daario Naharis has returned to the city. Having been attracted to Daario since he swore his fealty to her,[35] Daenerys insists on seeing him immediately. Daario brings her good news: negotiations with the Lhazareen have been successful, and the Lhazareen have agreed to trade with Meereen. While Daario and his Stormcrows face the Long Lances, a sellsword company hired by Yunkai, in the Khyzai Pass, but Daario boasts that twelve of them defected to his side, while only nine of his own had died. Daenerys tells Daario about the troubles within and outside of the city, and that Galazza had suggested a marriage to Hizdahr to create a peace. When Daario suggests that Daenerys should agree to a marriage only as a pretense to gather all the Great Masters and kill them, Daenerys angrily sends him and his Stormcrows away from the city once more, back to the Khyzai Pass.[32]\n\nThe exiled Lord Jon Connington, now calling himself \"Griff\", recalls secret plans with the previous captain-general of the Golden Company, Ser Myles Toyne. They plotted with Illyrio to eventually have \"Young Griff\", whom they claim is Prince Aegon Targaryen, marry his aunt Daenerys and claim the Iron Throne.[59] Frustrated by Illyrio's constantly changing plans when they learn that the unaware Daenerys has stayed in Meereen, the sellswords support Aegon in an invasion of Westeros without Daenerys's involvement.[59][60]\n\nShips from Qarth, Tolos, and New Ghis, and even Meereenese ships which had fled when Daenerys first took the city have blocked the harbor. Without any ships of her own, nor wood to build new ships, Daenerys cannot battle them. Hizdahr has been successful thus far in preventing new murders, causing Skahaz mo Kandaq to suspect him of being the Harpy. Daenerys refuses to allow him to torture Hizdahr. Astapori refugees travel to Meereen. The first Astapori to reach the city is infected with the bloody flux, soon known as \"the pale mare\". More of the surviving Astapori on their way to Meereen have the contagious disease. Daenerys follows the advice of her counselors and does not allow the refugees to enter the city,[61] but instead has them camp outside the walls.[37]\n\nThe Yunkai'i are in contact with Hizdahr zo Loraq, and inform him that they are willing to give Meereen peace, but they require gold from Daenerys, as well as an agreement that the Yunkai'i can resume slaving and Astapor will be a slaver city once again, without Daenerys's interference. The agreements are to be sealed by Daenerys's marriage to Hizdahr. Daario returns to Meereen, informing Daenerys that the Second Sons have joined Yunkai, but that some deserters from the Windblown have come over to their side. With four sellsword companies, six Ghiscari legions, Qartheen camelry, and Tolosi slingers on their way to Meereen, Daenerys has no choice but to close her gates. Finally giving in to her desires, Daenerys takes Daario as her lover once they are alone.[37] The day before her wedding to Hizdahr, Daario introduces her to the men who have defected from the Windblown. One of them reveals himself to be Quentyn Martell of Dorne, who brings with him a secret marriage pact signed by his uncle on behalf of Dorne and Ser Willem Darry on behalf of Viserys, promising the hand of Quentyn's sister Arianne to Viserys in marriage, in exchange for Dorne's support. With Viserys dead, Quentyn offers himself in marriage to Daenerys. While Barristan sees the offer as a hopeful option, Daenerys rejects him and marries Hizdahr after ninety days of peace inside the city.[26] When Quentyn informs Daenerys that the other deserters are spies sent by the Tattered Prince, Daenerys has them imprisoned.[citation needed]\n\nHizdahr invites the captains from the Yunkish army into Meereen, to sign the peace treaty and celebrate the opening of the fighting pits. Hostages from Meereen have been sent into the Yunkish camp, to ensure the captains remain unharmed. Daenerys hates everything about the feast. After a confrontation with Ben Plumm, Daenerys orders Barristan Selmy to free Meris and send her back to the Windblown, hoping to convince the Windblown to abandon Yunkai. Daenerys next takes Quentyn to see her dragons, and urges him to return home.[62] The next day, Barristan reports that the Tattered Prince is willing to join Daenerys in return for Pentos, but Daenerys is unwilling to help him take the city. She goes to Daznak's Pit for the pit fighting. Belwas consumes poisoned locusts which Hizdahr had been urging Daenerys to eat, while Daenerys grows disgusted with the day's events. Just as she is about to leave, Belwas falls sick to his knees, and Drogon returns to the city, landing in the pit to feed on the body of the slain Barsena. The crowd panics, and one man attacks Drogon with his spear. Daenerys rushes to Drogon's side, mounts the dragon, and rides on his back as he flies out of the arena.[31]\n\nJorah takes Tyrion Lannister captive in Selhorys and plans to bring him to Daenerys to regain her favor.[14] They end up joining the Second Sons under the command of Ben Plumm.[63] While the sellswords' current contract is to fight Daenerys, Tyrion hopes to win them to her side.[64] Meanwhile, the Iron Fleet nears Slaver's Bay. Having learned from Moqorro that Daenerys has wed again, Victarion has no compunction against making her a widow so he can claim her.[24]\n\nIn Meereen, many fear that Daenerys has died,[65] and chaos returns to the city. Hizdahr attempts to rule as King of Meereen, but is eventually taken into custody by Ser Barristan,[66] who rules in Daenerys's absence as Hand of the Queen.[22] Quentyn is mortally wounded in an attempt to tame Rhaegal and Viserion,[67] and the two dragons escape the Great Pyramid.[66][22]\n\nDaenerys still lives, however. Drogon has flown her to a hill in the Dothraki sea, which she dubs Dragonstone, after the island on which she had been born. She eventually decides to return to Meereen, but is unable to get Drogon to follow her commands, leading to her traveling on foot. She begins to fall ill; Her stomach is cramping, she is retching up green slime, and has diarrhea. She dreams of Viserys, and wakes with her thighs covered in blood. She spots Drogon and calls him to her side, and the dragon obeys. Khal Jhaqo and his khalasar eventually find Daenerys standing next to her dragon.[68]\n\nIn an early draft of A Game of Thrones, Daenerys II, Daenerys does not receive dragon eggs as a wedding gift from Illyrio Mopatis. Instead, she receives \"the finest silks and velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce.\" This is consistent with George R.R. Martin's 1993 outline, which stated that Daenerys would discover a cache of dragon's eggs in the wilderness outside Vaes Dothrak after killing her husband Drogo.[70]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nA young woman in her early teens, Daenerys has the classical Valyrian look; She has violet eyes,[5] pale skin,[17] and long, pale silver-gold hair.[5][1][19] Daenerys is slender of frame,[5] with small breasts.[5][1][20] She is said to resemble Queen Naerys Targaryen, though Daenerys is taller and stronger.[21] Daenerys has been described as fair,[19][14][22] and beautiful.[23][13][24]\n\nBeside the Common Tongue, Daenerys speaks the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities with a Tyroshi accent,[25] and High Valyrian.[9] She quickly learns the Dothraki language,[6] and the Ghiscari tongue.[3][26]\n\nDaenerys grew up terrified of and abused by her brother Viserys,[10] and was regarded as fearful and furtive by Magister Illyrio Mopatis.[27] She grows more confident in A Song of Ice and Fire, however, and her followers generally regard her with great respect and love, and Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy have compared her to her deceased brother, Prince Rhaegar,[6][8][11] who had been valiant, honorable, and noble, and is still fondly remembered in the Seven Kingdoms.[9]\n\nAs she was raised in exile, never staying long at one place, Daenerys has never truly known a place to call home. Though she describes the fragrance of the Western Market at Vaes Dothrak as smelling \"of home\", they in fact remind her of her days spent in several of the Free Cities as a small child.[25] Among the Dothraki, she feels safe, loved and hopeful for the first time.[28] The house with the red door in Braavos, where she lived until she was about five years old, has come to symbolize her lost childhood,[5][25] and she frequently wishes to return there.[29][3][30][31] Though she has never seen Westeros and cannot remember Dragonstone, she believes that the Iron Throne is her by rights, as Viserys's heir, and that ruling the Seven Kingdoms is her duty. Daenerys abhors slavery[32] and is willing to put the needs of her people before her own desires.[26]\n\nDaenerys loves the sea, as it makes her feel free, as well as the sailors and their songs and stories.[23] She also loves to read children's stories and songs from the Seven Kingdoms about tall and handsome heroes.[29] She enjoys heat, preferring her baths scalding hot.[5][33]\n\nDescending from dragonlords, Daenerys dreams of dragons.[1][34] Though Daenerys is familiar with the Faith of the Seven,[29][31] and believes in the existence of gods, she does not appear to follow a particular faith.[29][31][7]\n\nDaenerys sometimes dresses in Dothraki garb; a painted vest and riding leathers, while going about barefoot,[34] with her hair oiled[34][33] and her skin sun-browned.[33] Her other Dothraki attire includes silk or horsehair pants, woven grass sandals, a medallion belt, and her painted vest.[20][23][10] She often wears silver bells in her braided hair per Dothraki custom, one for each of her victories.[20][9][11][35] Daenerys also owns a Qartheen gown which leaves one breast bare,[36] several Ghiscari tokars,[3][37] and a musty-smelling hrakkar cloak.[38]\n\n\n## History\n\n\nDaenerys is the youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Queen Rhaella. Daenerys was conceived during the last month of Robert's Rebellion, the war which ended House Targaryen's reign over the Seven Kingdoms. Shortly thereafter, her mother was sent with the young prince Viserys to the family ancestral seat of Dragonstone to escape the rebel army which was marching towards King's Landing. Daenerys was born nine months after their flight, while a great storm raged above Dragonstone, sinking what remained of the Targaryen fleet; for this reason she is known as \"Daenerys Stormborn\". Her mother died in labor,[5] but not before naming her.[39]\n\nThe war had been lost shortly after Rhaella had fled the city, after which Robert I Baratheon had claimed the Iron Throne. With Aerys, his eldest son Rhaegar, and Rhaegar's young children Rhaenys and Aegon dead, Daenerys and her older brother Viserys were the only known living Targaryen heirs. As Viserys had been crowned king on Dragonstone by their mother before her death,[40] Daenerys received the title \"Princess of Dragonstone\" as Viserys's heir.[5]\n\nRobert's brother, Stannis, built a new royal fleet in preparation for an assault on Dragonstone. With the Targaryen fleet destroyed by the storm during which Daenerys had been born, the garrison at Dragonstone were prepared to sell the Targaryen children to Robert. However, before they could act on this plan, Ser Willem Darry and several other loyal retainers took the children from the nursery and smuggled them into exile, sailing to the Braavosian coast.[5]\n\nViserys and Daenerys lived in Braavos in a house with a red door, where Daenerys had her own room, and a lemon tree underneath her window. Willem was old and sickly, but Daenerys remembers that he always treated her kindly.[5] When Daenerys was five years old, Willem fell sick and slowly wasted away.[41] After his death, the servants he had hired stole all they could. The young Targaryens were put out of the house a while after. As they were forced out, Daenerys wept.[5]\n\nViserys and Daenerys left Braavos, and wandered the Free Cities for years. They visited nearly all the Free Cities, including Myr, Tyrosh, Qohor, Volantis, and Lys,[5] and returned to Braavos at least once.[23] While at first they were welcomed by magisters and archons and merchant princes, with time their interests in the last Targaryens decreased. Daenerys and Viserys had to sell their last few treasures, and eventually their mother's crown.[5] Selling their mother's crown took the last of Viserys's joy, leaving only rage.[42] Daenerys remembers how Viserys once feasted the Golden Company, hoping they would take up his cause, but to no avail.[19] Considering himself to be the rightful ruler, Viserys grew bitter and obsessed with the birthright he had been denied. Daenerys was a frequent target for his frustrations. He had never forgiven her for their mother's death in childbirth, and frequently warned her not to \"wake the dragon\" by angering him.[5] Once, when Daenerys and Viserys were on their way to Braavos by ship, Daenerys expressed to her brother how fine it would be to be a sailor. Angry, Viserys twisted her hair until she cried.[23] Because Viserys often told her that their line must be \"kept pure\", Daenerys grew up believing that she would marry him once she came of age.[5]\n\nThough Viserys's growing bitterness made their relationship more troubled, Daenerys also has fond memories of her brother from times when he had not yet been so angry. He let her crawl into bed with him and told her stories about the Seven Kingdoms, about their family[23] and their history,[5][30] their dragons,[34] and Robert's Rebellion.[5][28] Almost everything Daenerys knows about Westeros she learned from Viserys, making her feel as if she knew what it was like without ever having been there. Viserys is intent on reclaiming their father's throne, and he promised Daenerys a thousand times that he will take her back to Westeros,[25] and that their lives will be much better once he has.[23] Viserys also told her about siege towers[35] and the Faith of the Seven.[29]\n\nIn 297 AC, Viserys and Daenerys were taken in by Illyrio Mopatis, a magister of the Free City of Pentos, who offered his help in reclaiming the Iron Throne for Viserys. They have lived with Illyrio for almost half a year.[5]\n\n\n## Recent Events\n\n\n\n## A Game of Thrones\n\n\nIllyrio Mopatis, a magister of Pentos, arranges a marriage between Daenerys and Drogo, a powerful khal of the Dothraki, in return for the promise of an army which her brother, the would-be Viserys III Targaryen, can use to claim the Iron Throne. Though Daenerys does not want the marriage, Viserys is insistent.[5]\n\nDaenerys and Drogo are wed outside of the walls of Pentos. Daenerys receives multiple bride gifts, including three petrified dragon eggs from Illyrio, three handmaidens (Irri, Jhiqui, and Doreah) from her brother, and a magnificent silver mare from Drogo. She is frightened by the seemingly barbaric Dothraki culture and has absolutely no way of communicating with Drogo, as they do not speak each other's languages. After the wedding ceremony is over, Drogo leads Daenerys away from the khalasar to consummate their marriage. Daenerys is terrified, but Drogo proves to be surprisingly tender and considerate. He lets Daenerys know that he understands one word in the Common Tongue (\"no\"), and touches her gently and gradually. Only after she gives him her consent do they have sex.[1]\n\nThe day after the wedding, Drogo's khalasar leaves Pentos. The khal assigns four young men—Aggo, Jhogo, Quaro, and Rakharo—to protect Daenerys as her khas. Although she is also accompanied by both Viserys and Ser Jorah Mormont, an exiled knight who has sworn his sword to Viserys, Daenerys feels lonely. Her entire body hurts from spending her days on horseback and her nights with Drogo.[34]\n\nOn the night that Daenerys decides she cannot go on anymore, she dreams about a black dragon. The flames of the beast cleanse her and make her feel strong and new and fierce. From that night onwards, life among the Dothraki begins to come more easily to Daenerys. She begins to enjoy her surroundings, and grows more confident. She also dares for the first time ever to fight back against Viserys when he attacks her in a rage. Daenerys shoves him away, realizing that Viserys is a pitiful thing and would make a terrible king. When she discusses this with Jorah, Daenerys is shocked to learn how poorly the knight thinks of Viserys. When Drogo arrives in her tent that night to take his pleasure, Daenerys leads him outside, as the Dothraki believe that everything of importance happens must be done beneath the bare sky. Daenerys initiates sex with Drogo, and her new-found confidence and strength mark the beginning of a loving relationship between them.[34]\n\nThe khalasar travels toward Vaes Dothrak, passing through Ghoyan Drohe, Norvos, Qohor, Vaes Khadokh, and southern Sarnor.[43] On the far end of the Dothraki sea, on her fourteenth nameday, Daenerys reveals that she is pregnant.[34] The khalasar arrives at Vaes Dothrak, and Jorah informs Daenerys about the chances the Dothraki would have against Westerosi armies. That evening, Daenerys and Viserys argue. When he grabs her, she hits him with a belt and orders him to leave.[33]\n\nIn Westeros, King Robert I Baratheon has learned of Daenerys's marriage to Drogo from Jorah Mormont, who is in the employment of Lord Varys, Robert's master of whisperers. Though Robert's new Hand of the King, Lord Eddard Stark, protests against the notion of killing Daenerys, calling her an innocent child, Robert nonetheless fears that Daenerys will soon start breeding more \"dragonspawn\", and that Viserys will cross the narrow sea with a horde of Dothraki. Eddard convinces him that the Dothraki are not likely to cross, and that they can easily defeat them if they do.[44] The matter is laid to rest, but is brought up again when a report from Jorah arrives in King's Landing, informing the small council that Daenerys is pregnant. Robert wants Viserys, Daenerys, and her child killed, and while Eddard and Ser Barristan Selmy protest, the rest of the council agrees with Robert. In the end, it is decided that Varys will quietly let it become known that whoever kills Daenerys, her child, and Viserys will be given a lordship.[45]\n\nAt Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys is presented to the dosh khaleen, and she takes part in a ceremony for her unborn child in which she eats a raw stallion heart. The dosh khaleen predict that Daenerys will have a son, who will be \"the stallion who mounts the world\", a long-prophesied leader destined to unite the Dothraki into a single khalasar and conquer the world. Daenerys chooses the name Rhaego for her son, after her eldest brother, Rhaegar. Daenerys and Drogo have sex after she bathes in the Womb of the World.[17]\n\nAt the feast after the ceremony, Jorah tells Daenerys he prevented Viserys from stealing and selling her dragon eggs. A drunk Viserys arrives late at the feast. Having grown increasingly impatient for Drogo to give him his army and his crown, Viserys arrives carrying a blade, which is forbidden in Vaes Dothrak. He threatens both Daenerys and her unborn child. Daenerys translates for Drogo, who tells Viserys that he will give him his crown. While his bloodriders take hold of Viserys, Drogo melts the golden medallions from his belt, and he pours the molten gold over Viserys's head, giving him his golden crown. Daenerys calmly watches as Viserys pleads with her, and he dies screaming.[17]\n\nNow the last remaining member of House Targaryen, Daenerys believes her family's throne should be conquered for her unborn son and attempts to persuade Drogo to invade the Seven Kingdoms. However, Drogo has no interest in doing so, until Daenerys is rescued by Jorah Mormont from drinking poisoned Arbor red offered by a wineseller at the Western Market of Vaes Dothrak. They learn that King Robert I Baratheon has promised a lordship and lands to whoever kills Viserys, Daenerys, and her child. Furious, Drogo vows to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for his son. When they depart Vaes Dothrak, Daenerys has the would-be assassin forced to run after her silver mare until he collapses and dies.[25]\n\nDrogo leads his khalasar south, planning to take captives to sell at the cities of Slaver's Bay in exchange for ships. They encounters a Lhazareen town, which is under attack by the khalasar of Khal Ogo. They battle, and Drogo is victorious. Though most of Ogo's riders have fled, Jorah estimates that there are ten thousand captives. Daenerys is disgusted and disturbed by the sight of the Dothraki raping women, and she eventually orders every rape she sees stopped, claiming the women as her own slaves to protect them. Though this angers Drogo's riders, Daenerys refuses to give them back. Drogo is pleased by Daenerys's boldness, and he allows her to keep her slaves.[6]\n\nDrogo is injured, but the healers are occupied elsewhere. When Daenerys insists that Drogo's cuts are seen to immediately, a Lhazareen godswife, Mirri Maz Duur, offers her service. Drogo's bloodriders call the woman a maegi, but Drogo agrees to accompany Mirri inside the temple, supported by Daenerys, where Mirri tends to his wounds. Afterwards, Daenerys asks Mirri to be her midwife when she goes into labor.[6] Mirri's poultice itches and burns Drogo, and he eventually tears it off, replacing it with a mud plaster.[28]\n\nDrogo's wound festers, and he grows weaker and weaker until he falls from his horse. Daenerys realizes the danger in this, as a khal who cannot ride cannot rule, according to the Dothraki. Daenerys orders Drogo's bloodriders to make camp, and to pretend the command came from Drogo. She also orders Mirri Maz Duur to be brought to her. Though Qotho protests every order she gives, he leaves to fetch Mirri. Daenerys has Drogo brought into his tent, and she learns that rumors of Drogo's fall are spreading through the camp when Jorah arrives. Daenerys begs Jorah to help Drogo. When they are alone, Jorah removes the mud plaster from Drogo's wound, concluding that Drogo is \"as good as dead\". He urges her to flee, as a power struggle among the kos will follow Drogo's death, and the victor is likely to kill Rhaego, while Daenerys will be forced to join the dosh khaleen. Daenerys refuses to leave Drogo. She protects Mirri from Qotho and Haggo, and she sends Jorah to go fetch his armor, in case of trouble.[28]\n\nDaenerys asks Mirri to heal Drogo using blood magic. The maegi warns that some claim death would be cleaner, and that \"only death may pay for life\", though Mirri reassures Daenerys that her life is not the payment. As part of the ritual, Drogo is placed in a bath, and his stallion is slain so its blood can mix with the water in the tub. Daenerys is told to prevent anyone from entering the tent during the ritual. As Mirri sings her spells, battle erupts between Drogo's bloodriders and Daenerys's khas, with Qotho killing Quaro and then being slain by Jorah. Rhaego begins to kick wildly inside Daenerys, and she goes into labor as men are dying around her. The birthing women refuse to attend Daenerys, and when someone suggests Mirri, Jorah lifts Daenerys up in his arms and carries her into the tent. Daenerys is too weak to protest.[28]\n\nDaenerys wakes days later, after several fever dreams, with one of her dragon eggs in her arms, as she had requested during one of her short waking moments. Rhaego was stillborn and malformed, Daenerys learns, and had been dead for months according to Mirri, even though Daenerys had felt him strong and alive shortly before her labor had begun. Mirri reveals that Rhaego's death was the true price of the blood magic. Drogo's khalasar is gone, split into two new khalasars belonging to Khal Pono and Khal Jhaqo. Although Drogo still lives, he is in a catatonic state. Daenerys demands to know when Drogo will be as before, and Mirri replies \"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before\". She reveals that it had been wrong of Drogo's khalasar to burn her temple, and that Rhaego's death means that the stallion who mounts the world is now unable to burn cities or trample nations into dust.[7]\n\nDaenerys orders Mirri arrested. She attempts to get a response from Drogo by pleasuring him and speaking to him, but realizes that he is truly gone. Daenerys euthanizes the khal,[7] and she has the remaining Dothraki build him a funeral pyre. Daenerys declares herself to be a queen, and she states the remaining people are her khalasar now. She frees the slaves, names Jorah as a knight of her Queensguard, and names Jhogo, Rakharo, and Aggo, the three surviving men from her khas, as her kos, ignoring their refusal to be bloodrider to a woman. Daenerys places her three dragon eggs onto Drogo's funeral pyre, beside his body. She also has Mirri bound to the pyre, claiming \"only death can pay for life\". Drogo's pyre is lit when the first star, a fiery red comet, is seen in the sky. Once the entire pyre is afire, Daenerys walks into the flames.[46]\n\nThe next morning, when the flames have gone out and the ground has cooled down, Daenerys's new khalasar finds her amidst the ashes, naked but unharmed, holding three newly-hatched dragons, the first living dragons since 153 AC. They all kneel and swear their oaths to Daenerys, more loyal to her than they had ever been to Drogo.[46]\n\n\n## A Clash of Kings\n\n\nDaenerys names the three dragons Viserion (after her brother Viserys), Rhaegal (after her brother Rhaegar), and Drogon (after her husband Drogo). Although the Dothraki are convinced the red comet is an ill omen, Daenerys believes that it a herald of her coming, which points in the direction in which she must travel. However, she is aware of the fact that the comet's direction was the only direction in which they could have gone; to the north are too many khalasars, to the south the Lhazareen, and to the east Pono's khalasar, all hostile to them. She leads her people east, through the red waste.[38]\n\nThey eventually arrive in an abandoned city, which Daenerys dubs Vaes Tolorro. While her khalasar recovers from the terrible journey through the desert, Daenerys sends out her bloodriders to scout in every direction. Aggo and Rakharo return without hopeful news, and Daenerys begins to fortify Vaes Tolorro, in case of enemies. After a long time, Jhogo returns accompanied by three citizens from the city Qarth: the merchant Xaro Xhoan Daxos, the warlock Pyat Pree, and the shadow-binder Quaithe of Asshai.[38] They escort Daenerys and her khalasar to Qarth, where Xaro invites them to stay in his palace. Daenerys learns of the death of King Robert I Baratheon and the unrest in the Seven Kingdoms.[8]\n\nDaenerys visits the Pureborn of Qarth, hoping to convince them to help her in her conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, but they refuse her. On her way back to Xaro's palace, Daenerys sees Quaithe, who urges Daenerys to travel to Asshai. Xaro proposes marriage to Daenerys, which she finds amusing as Xaro is completely uninterested in the charms of women. Jorah warns her that according to Qartheen marriage customs, Xaro would be within his rights to ask a dragon of Daenerys if they were to wed, and she would not legally be able to deny him. Not knowing where else to turn, Daenerys decides to go to the warlocks.[36]\n\nDaenerys goes to the House of the Undying, where Pyat Pree gives her shade-of-the-evening, and she enters the building with only Drogon by her side. Inside, Daenerys sees several strange visions. When she reaches the hall of the Undying, they tell her that she will light three fires (one for life, one for death, and one to love), ride three mounts (one to bed, one to dread, and one to love), and face three betrayals (one for blood, one for gold, and one for love). More visions follow as the Undying attack her. Drogon sets the Undying Ones on fire, allowing Daenerys to flee the burning building. Outside, Daenerys is attacked by Pyat, but Jhogo, Rakharo, and Drogon save her.[2]\n\nThe destruction of the House of the Undying turns the Qartheen against her. Xaro warns Daenerys that Pyat Pree is gathering warlocks against her, and after she refuses to marry him once more, he suggests that she should leave Qarth. Xaro offers to give her ships in exchange for a dragon, and when Daenerys refuses, insists she leaves his palace. Daenerys visits the port of Qarth to seek passage on a ship for herself, her khalasar and her dragons, but is frequently refused. Jorah warns her that they are being followed by two strangers. When a Sorrowful Man gives her a box containing a manticore with the purpose of killing her, one of the strangers knocks the manticore aside before it can sting her. The two strangers, Belwas and Arstan Whitebeard, inform Daenerys they had been sent to Qarth by Magister Illyrio with three ships to escort Daenerys and her party back to Pentos. Daenerys renames the ships Vhagar, Meraxes and Balerion, after the dragons of Aegon I Targaryen and his sister-wives, Rhaenys and Visenya, and sets sail for Pentos.[20]\n\n\n## A Storm of Swords\n\n\nWord of a three-headed dragon having hatched in Qarth reaches King's Landing and is reported to the small council by Lord Varys.[47]\n\nOn their way to Pentos, Ser Jorah Mormont convinces Daenerys to change course to Astapor, one of the slaver cities of Slaver's Bay. Mistrustful of Illyrio's motives, Jorah believes it wise to purchase Unsullied before traveling to Illyrio, so Daenerys has an army loyal to her. He kisses her and professes his love for her, telling her that he could be one of the three heads of the dragon, as her husband.[23] Lonely since Drogo's death, Daenerys one night takes her maid Irri as a lover.[9]\n\nIn Astapor, Daenerys visits the Plaza of Pride, where Kraznys mo Nakloz informs her about the capabilities of the Unsullied. As Daenerys pretends she cannot understand High Valyrian, Kraznys's scribe Missandei translates his rude remarks into respectful statements. Though Arstan Whitebeard counsels against using slaves,[9] Daenerys informs the Good Masters that she wishes to purchase all eight thousand six hundred Unsullied, as well as the five thousand boys still in training, in exchange for all her goods, ships, and Drogon. The slavers agree, and give her Missandei as a gift. On their way back to the ship, Daenerys frees Missandei and gives her the option to leave her service, revealing her ability to understand and speak High Valyrian. Missandei decides to stay with Daenerys. That night, Daenerys is visited by Quaithe again, who urges her once more to go to Asshai.[10]\n\nThe next day, Daenerys goes to purchase her Unsullied. After assuming command of the soldiers, Daenerys betrays the Good Masters, ordering Drogon to attack the slavers and her Unsullied to conquer the city.[10] Daenerys frees all slaves, and leaves a council to rule the city.[48] She frees her Unsullied as well, and most decide to serve her as free men.[citation needed]\n\nWith her new army, Daenerys marches to Yunkai. Aware of Astapor's fate, Yunkai hires two sellsword companies, the Stormcrows and the Second Sons, to strengthen their own slave army of four thousand. Daenerys meets with Grazdan mo Eraz, an envoy from Yunkai, as well as with the captains from the sellsword companies. Though two of the captains of the Stormcrows, Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor the Bald, are quick to refuse Daenerys, the third, Daario Naharis, is more polite. Mero, the captain of the Second Sons, behaves rudely in Daenerys's presence. She offers to pay more than Yunkai, and gifts him with enough wine for him and his sellswords when he promises to consider her offer. Grazdan, the last to arrive, offers Daenerys gold, but she refuses and informs him that Yunkai has three days to free their slaves. If they do not, she will sack the city.[11]\n\nOnce the envoy from Yunkai has left, Daenerys reveals that she plans to attack the city that same night, while the Stormcrows are still arguing over her offer, the Second Sons are drunk on the wine she gave them, and the Yunkai'i believe they still have two more days. Shortly before the attack begins, Daario Naharis walks into the Targaryen camp. He presents Daenerys with the heads of Prendahl and Sallor, his fellow captains, and pledges the Stormcrows to her service. While her army attacks Yunkai, Daenerys remains in the camp, and discusses her late brother Rhaegar with Arstan. Daenerys's forces are victorious in the battle near Yunkai. Though Mero escapes, thousand others are taken captive, and Daenerys agrees that any slave or sellsword who swears loyalty to her are to be spared. Daenerys marches the last few leagues to Yunkai. The city gates open on the morning of the third day, and the slaves from Yunkai emerge, hailing her as Mhysa, meaning \"Mother\" in Ghiscari.[11]\n\nDaenerys marches further north, to Meereen. In preparation for her arrival, the Meereenese retreat behind the walls of their city after stripping their lands clean. In addition, the Great Masters nail a hundred and sixty-three slave children onto the mileposts placed on the coast road between Yunkai and Meereen. Daenerys encamps her host, now more than eighty thousand strong (though fewer than a quarter are warriors), outside of the walls of Meereen. Strong Belwas fights against Oznak zo Pahl, the \"hero of Meereen\", and easily slays him. Brown Ben Plumm, the new commander of the Second Sons, suggests entering the city through the sewers, but Daenerys does not consider it a promising idea.[35]\n\nWhen Daenerys takes Missandei and Arstan into the camp of her freedmen, she is attacked by Mero, who had been hidden among her freedmen while awaiting an opportunity to kill her. Arstan saves her life, killing Mero in the process. However, Jorah questions Arstan's ability, causing the aged squire to reveal he is Ser Barristan Selmy, formerly of the Kingsguard. Barristan further reveals that Jorah has served the Iron Throne as a spy, giving them information about Viserys and Daenerys ever since her wedding to Drogo. Daenerys is furious and feels betrayed by both of them.[35]\n\nDaenerys sends Barristan and Jorah into the sewers of Meereen as part of her plan to take the city, half hoping that they will die in their attempt. During the siege of Meereen, her army attacks the gates of the city from the outside and her archers fire arrows at the city's defenders. Meanwhile, Belwas, the knights Barristan and Jorah, and nineteen others enter the city through the sewers to free the slaves, who then revolt against the Great Masters.[29]\n\nWith Meereen taken, Daenerys has one hundred and sixty-three of the Great Masters nailed on posts on the plaza in front of the Great Pyramid to avenge the slain children. Though she is able to pardon Barristan, she finds herself unable to do the same for Jorah. Instead, she exiles him, and warns Jorah that he will be killed if he returns to the city.[29]\n\nDaenerys learns that the council she had previously installed in Astapor to rule the city has been killed and replaced by Cleon, a former butcher who has declared himself king and enslaved the former nobility. In addition, Yunkai is gathering new levies and sending out envoys to form alliances against Daenerys. The queen decides that she cannot leave Meereen to suffer the same violent fate as Astapor, and she informs her captains that she will stay in Meereen to learn how to rule one city before attempting the same for the Seven Kingdoms.[29]\n\n\n## A Feast for Crows\n\n\nNews of Daenerys's dragons and her campaign continues to reach Westeros. Several acolytes of the Citadel discuss the stories they have heard, including sailors speaking of dragons in Asshai, Qarth, and Meereen, dragons among the Dothraki, and dragons freeing slaves. Though all the tales differ in details, all speak of dragons and a beautiful young queen. Alleras points out that, though Viserys Targaryen is dead, Daenerys is still alive. Leo Tyrell informs the acolytes that Daenerys has, in fact, hatched herself three dragons.[49]\n\nIn Dorne, Arianne Martell recalls having heard stories about dragons in Qarth and a slave revolt in Astapor.[50] Arianne is taken into captivity after failing to crown Myrcella Baratheon. Arianne's father, Prince Doran Martell, informs her that her brother Quentyn has gone on a perilous voyage to bring back their heart's desire, \"fire and blood\".[51]\n\nIn King's Landing, Aurane Waters reports to Queen Regent Cersei Lannister during a small council meeting that sailors speak of dragons in the east,[52] and Qyburn later reports that the slave revolt in Astapor has spread to Meereen, stating that \"sailors off a dozen ships\" speak of dragons.[53]\n\nAt the kingsmoot on Old Wyk, Euron Greyjoy reveals to the ironborn that there are three dragons in the world.[54] After the taking of the Shields, King Euron tasks his younger brother Victarion with sailing the Iron Fleet to Slaver's Bay and bringing back Daenerys so Euron can wed her. Victarion agrees, although he plans to marry Daenerys himself.[55]\n\nIn Braavos, a drunken Dareon repeats tales of dragons to Maester Aemon and Samwell Tarly. Aemon becomes increasingly interested in the stories, but he is too ill to venture outside and learn about them firsthand. He requests that Samwell brings him someone who has seen the dragons. Samwell encounters Xhondo Dhoru, who had seen Daenerys and her dragons in Qarth.[56] Upon hearing Xhondo's stories, Aemon becomes convinced that Daenerys is the princess that was promised, as proven by the dragons. He insists that Samwell informs the archmaesters at the Citadel should be informed about Daenerys and the dangers at the Wall, calling Daenerys \"our last hope\", and believing that a maester should be send to Daenerys to give her counsel.{m Aemon dies on the voyage to Oldtown.[12] Upon his arrival at the Citadel, Samwell encounters Alleras, who listens to his stories and brings him to Archmaester Marwyn at the Ravenry. Marwyn decides to travel to Slaver's Bay himself to give Daenerys his aid.[57]\n\n\n## A Dance with Dragons\n\n\nRumors of Daenerys's striking beauty have spread far and wide,[13] and she is said to have silver-gold hair and amethyst eyes.[24] The head of a man, executed for spying on behalf of Daenerys and fermenting rebellion, is displayed on the Long Bridge of Volantis.[58]\n\nDaenerys rules Meereen as its queen, but she faces multiple enemies. A resistance group of Ghiscari noblemen from Meereen, the Sons of the Harpy, engage in a shadow war against Daenerys, slaying freedmen, Unsullied, and shavepates during the night.[3] Daenerys orders the creation of a city watch, made up from the Meereenese themselves,[30] the Brazen Beasts,[19] and sets a reward for the Sons of the Harpy at one thousand honors.[3] To fund the Brazen Beasts, Daenerys imposes a blood tax on the noble families of Meereen, and demands two hostages from each family in an attempt to stop the killings.[30] The Sons of the Harpy, in turn, offer wealth and glory and a hundred slave girls to whoever slays Daenerys, while promising death to anyone, and their families, who serve Daenerys.[19] The murders continue, but Daenerys finds herself unable to harm any of her hostages.[32] Daenerys further has three fighting companies formed comprised from her freedmen: the Mother's Men, the Free Brothers, and the Stalwart Shields.[3][30]\n\nDaenerys also faces the dislike from the nobility of the city, as numerous crimes had been committed during the sack, and the nobility especially have suffered losses of property and wealth. However, there are also those who support Daenerys. These men have shaven their heads, abandoning the traditional hair styles of the Ghiscari culture. These men, known as shavepates, are led by Skahaz mo Kandaq, who serves Daenerys as a counselor.[3]\n\nDrogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal have been growing wilder and often hunt sheep in the lands surrounding the city. Daenerys pays shepherds for the loss of their animals. However, one day at court, one man lingers after Daenerys has granted compensation to be given for the loss of twenty-three animals. After all petitioners have departed, he presents her with the burned bones of his daughter, Hazzea, saying it had been \"the winged shadow\".[3] Shocked by Hazzea's death, Daenerys orders her dragons captured. Viserion and Rhaegal are locked in a pit underneath the Great Pyramid where Daenerys resides, but Drogon escapes and flies off towards the Dothraki sea.[30]\n\nQuaithe uses magic to visit Daenerys one night, when Daenerys is alone. She informs her that the glass candles are burning, and warns Daenerys about the dangers that are coming. \"Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.\" After telling Daenerys to remember who she is, Quaithe disappears.[30]\n\nDaenerys hosts Xaro Xhoan Daxos, who offers her thirteen ships on the condition that she departs for Westeros immediately. She considers his offer, but realizes that all of her freedmen who stay behind in Meereen will either be enslaved once more or die. Unable to take all of them to Westeros with only thirteen ships, Daenerys refuses Xaro's offer, and Xaro leaves Meereen, declaring war.[19]\n\nThe Wise Masters of Yunkai resumed slavery after Daenerys left for Meereen, and by now have raised a new army of slave levies and sellswords,[3] who are joined by iron legions from New Ghis.[19] King Cleon of Astapor prepares to march into battle, while his envoy, Lord Ghael, requests an alliance between Astapor and Meereen from Daenerys. She refuses him on multiple occasions.[3][19] Cleon is defeated in battle at the Horns of Hazzat,[19] and later killed by his own men.[32] After a short siege, the Astapori make one last stand, and are defeated,[15] and the Yunkai'i begin their march against Daenerys.[citation needed]\n\nGalazza Galare, the Green Grace, counsels Daenerys that she should take a Meereenese noble as her husband, and proposes Hizdahr zo Loraq. Daenerys and Hizdahr come to an agreement; If he can stop the murders by the Sons of the Harpy for ninety days, they will wed. Barristan objects to the marriage, but Daenerys informs him that ninety days is a long period, and Hizdahr could still fail. However, she admits that, should Hizdahr succeed, she will wed him as she promised, for her people.[32] Before leaving, Barristan informs Daenerys that Daario Naharis has returned to the city. Having been attracted to Daario since he swore his fealty to her,[35] Daenerys insists on seeing him immediately. Daario brings her good news: negotiations with the Lhazareen have been successful, and the Lhazareen have agreed to trade with Meereen. While Daario and his Stormcrows face the Long Lances, a sellsword company hired by Yunkai, in the Khyzai Pass, but Daario boasts that twelve of them defected to his side, while only nine of his own had died. Daenerys tells Daario about the troubles within and outside of the city, and that Galazza had suggested a marriage to Hizdahr to create a peace. When Daario suggests that Daenerys should agree to a marriage only as a pretense to gather all the Great Masters and kill them, Daenerys angrily sends him and his Stormcrows away from the city once more, back to the Khyzai Pass.[32]\n\nThe exiled Lord Jon Connington, now calling himself \"Griff\", recalls secret plans with the previous captain-general of the Golden Company, Ser Myles Toyne. They plotted with Illyrio to eventually have \"Young Griff\", whom they claim is Prince Aegon Targaryen, marry his aunt Daenerys and claim the Iron Throne.[59] Frustrated by Illyrio's constantly changing plans when they learn that the unaware Daenerys has stayed in Meereen, the sellswords support Aegon in an invasion of Westeros without Daenerys's involvement.[59][60]\n\nShips from Qarth, Tolos, and New Ghis, and even Meereenese ships which had fled when Daenerys first took the city have blocked the harbor. Without any ships of her own, nor wood to build new ships, Daenerys cannot battle them. Hizdahr has been successful thus far in preventing new murders, causing Skahaz mo Kandaq to suspect him of being the Harpy. Daenerys refuses to allow him to torture Hizdahr. Astapori refugees travel to Meereen. The first Astapori to reach the city is infected with the bloody flux, soon known as \"the pale mare\". More of the surviving Astapori on their way to Meereen have the contagious disease. Daenerys follows the advice of her counselors and does not allow the refugees to enter the city,[61] but instead has them camp outside the walls.[37]\n\nThe Yunkai'i are in contact with Hizdahr zo Loraq, and inform him that they are willing to give Meereen peace, but they require gold from Daenerys, as well as an agreement that the Yunkai'i can resume slaving and Astapor will be a slaver city once again, without Daenerys's interference. The agreements are to be sealed by Daenerys's marriage to Hizdahr. Daario returns to Meereen, informing Daenerys that the Second Sons have joined Yunkai, but that some deserters from the Windblown have come over to their side. With four sellsword companies, six Ghiscari legions, Qartheen camelry, and Tolosi slingers on their way to Meereen, Daenerys has no choice but to close her gates. Finally giving in to her desires, Daenerys takes Daario as her lover once they are alone.[37] The day before her wedding to Hizdahr, Daario introduces her to the men who have defected from the Windblown. One of them reveals himself to be Quentyn Martell of Dorne, who brings with him a secret marriage pact signed by his uncle on behalf of Dorne and Ser Willem Darry on behalf of Viserys, promising the hand of Quentyn's sister Arianne to Viserys in marriage, in exchange for Dorne's support. With Viserys dead, Quentyn offers himself in marriage to Daenerys. While Barristan sees the offer as a hopeful option, Daenerys rejects him and marries Hizdahr after ninety days of peace inside the city.[26] When Quentyn informs Daenerys that the other deserters are spies sent by the Tattered Prince, Daenerys has them imprisoned.[citation needed]\n\nHizdahr invites the captains from the Yunkish army into Meereen, to sign the peace treaty and celebrate the opening of the fighting pits. Hostages from Meereen have been sent into the Yunkish camp, to ensure the captains remain unharmed. Daenerys hates everything about the feast. After a confrontation with Ben Plumm, Daenerys orders Barristan Selmy to free Meris and send her back to the Windblown, hoping to convince the Windblown to abandon Yunkai. Daenerys next takes Quentyn to see her dragons, and urges him to return home.[62] The next day, Barristan reports that the Tattered Prince is willing to join Daenerys in return for Pentos, but Daenerys is unwilling to help him take the city. She goes to Daznak's Pit for the pit fighting. Belwas consumes poisoned locusts which Hizdahr had been urging Daenerys to eat, while Daenerys grows disgusted with the day's events. Just as she is about to leave, Belwas falls sick to his knees, and Drogon returns to the city, landing in the pit to feed on the body of the slain Barsena. The crowd panics, and one man attacks Drogon with his spear. Daenerys rushes to Drogon's side, mounts the dragon, and rides on his back as he flies out of the arena.[31]\n\nJorah takes Tyrion Lannister captive in Selhorys and plans to bring him to Daenerys to regain her favor.[14] They end up joining the Second Sons under the command of Ben Plumm.[63] While the sellswords' current contract is to fight Daenerys, Tyrion hopes to win them to her side.[64] Meanwhile, the Iron Fleet nears Slaver's Bay. Having learned from Moqorro that Daenerys has wed again, Victarion has no compunction against making her a widow so he can claim her.[24]\n\nIn Meereen, many fear that Daenerys has died,[65] and chaos returns to the city. Hizdahr attempts to rule as King of Meereen, but is eventually taken into custody by Ser Barristan,[66] who rules in Daenerys's absence as Hand of the Queen.[22] Quentyn is mortally wounded in an attempt to tame Rhaegal and Viserion,[67] and the two dragons escape the Great Pyramid.[66][22]\n\nDaenerys still lives, however. Drogon has flown her to a hill in the Dothraki sea, which she dubs Dragonstone, after the island on which she had been born. She eventually decides to return to Meereen, but is unable to get Drogon to follow her commands, leading to her traveling on foot. She begins to fall ill; Her stomach is cramping, she is retching up green slime, and has diarrhea. She dreams of Viserys, and wakes with her thighs covered in blood. She spots Drogon and calls him to her side, and the dragon obeys. Khal Jhaqo and his khalasar eventually find Daenerys standing next to her dragon.[68]\n\n\n## Quotes by Daenerys\n\n\n\n## Quotes about Daenerys\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n\n\n## Behind the scenes\n\n\nIn an early draft of A Game of Thrones, Daenerys II, Daenerys does not receive dragon eggs as a wedding gift from Illyrio Mopatis. Instead, she receives \"the finest silks and velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce.\" This is consistent with George R.R. Martin's 1993 outline, which stated that Daenerys would discover a cache of dragon's eggs in the wilderness outside Vaes Dothrak after killing her husband Drogo.[70]",
