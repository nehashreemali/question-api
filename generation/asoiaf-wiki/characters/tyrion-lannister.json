  "content": "Tyrion Lannister is a member of House Lannister and is the third and youngest child of Lord Tywin Lannister and the late Lady Joanna Lannister. His older siblings are Cersei Lannister, the queen of King Robert I Baratheon, and Ser Jaime Lannister, a knight of Robert's Kingsguard.\n\nTyrion is a dwarf; because of this he is sometimes called the Imp and the Halfman. He is one of the major POV characters in the books.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Tyrion is portrayed by Peter Dinklage.[19]\n\nTyrion is a dwarf with stunted legs,[20] stubby fingers,[21] and a jutting forehead.[20] He has mismatched eyes of green and black,[20] so rumors spread that he has an \"evil eye\".[7] Tyrion's thin hair is fair and flaxen,[22][23] so blond it can appear white.[20] He has some strands of black hair,[24] however, and if he grows a beard it is yellow, white, and black.[25] Tyrion's unique stare has been said to make people uncomfortable, which he tries to use to his advantage.[7]\n\nTyrion is intelligent, well educated, and a ferocious reader. He is sharp of wit and tongue. Even though he is no warrior, he has been trained at arms[26] and shows great bravery in battle.[27][5][18] Moreover, he knows some tumbling tricks, despite walking with difficulty.[20][10][13] Tyrion has stated that what he lacks in size and strength he makes up for in mental acuity.[28]\n\nTyrion generally receives little respect and is often mocked. His deformity is the cause of many problems and persecution, although mitigated to some extent by his high social standing and his family's wealth and power. He craves for love and respect from his family, but does not have a good relationship with all his family members. His deformity and the fact that his mother Joanna died at his birth are two of the reasons that his father Tywin and sister Cersei despise him.[29][10] Tywin has never forgiven him for Joanna's death.[29] Unbeknownst to Tyrion, Cersei also despises him largely because of a prophecy made to her when she was a young girl. The prophecy claimed that a valonqar (High Valyrian for \"little brother\")[30] would eventually end her life.[12] Cersei has always identified Tyrion as her valonqar and has thus been determined to rid herself of him ever since.[30] Tyrion's older brother Jaime was the only one who ever treated Tyrion with love and affection and for this Tyrion believed he would forgive his brother for anything.[31]\n\nAt a young age, Tyrion married Tysha, a commoner, but eventually Jaime told him the girl was a whore he had paid to take Tyrion's virginity. Tyrion was crushed, and the memory of her has long haunted him.[23] Believing that no girl could ever truly love him for who he was,[32][33][34] he began to seek his pleasure with prostitutes.[35] Tywin felt this brought more shame on their house,[29] further deteriorating their relationship.\n\nTyrion was born in 273 AC as the third-born child to Lord Tywin and Lady Joanna Lannister. Joanna died giving birth to him, and as a result his father blames him for her death.[29] Tales about Tyrion were spread immediately after his birth; At Oldtown, it was said that Tyrion was a monster, with a tail, monstrous huge head, thick black hair, a beard, an evil eye, lion's claws, with teeth so long he was not able to close his mouth, and both male and female genitals.[7] It was said that Tyrion's birth was an omen to famine, plague and war,[7] and the smallfolk named him \"Lord Tywin's Doom\" and \"Lord Tywin's Bane\".[8] King Aerys II Targaryen stated that Tyrion was a punishment for Tywin's arrogance,[8] and the same was said by begging brothers in Oldtown, stating that Tywin had made himself greater than the king, which was only allowed by a god.[7]\n\nShortly after Tyrion's birth, the Princess of Dorne arrived with her consort and two younger children, Elia and Oberyn Martell. Tyrion was kept out of sight during the visit of the Martells, though he could sometimes be heard howling. Cersei and Jaime showed Tyrion to Elia and Oberyn the day before the Martells left, with Cersei claiming the infant would die soon. Lord Tywin, having refused to betroth Princess Elia to his heir Jaime, offered Tyrion as a betrothed to Elia instead, which the Martells took as an insult.[36][7][6]\n\nDuring most of Tyrion's childhood, his father Tywin served as Hand of the King to King Aerys II Targaryen in King's Landing, and as a consequence was absent from home for longer periods of time.[10] As a child, Tyrion was lonely.[37] His brother Jaime left Casterly Rock to serve as a squire at Crakehall in 277 AC,[N 1] while his sister Cersei left for the court of King's Landing in 278 AC.[8] At the age of six or seven, his uncle Gerion taught him tumbling, which he happily did for half a year at Casterly Rock, until Tywin returned from King's Landing and forbade it.[10][13]\n\nAs a child, Tyrion used to dream of owning a dragon.[28] He once even asked his uncles for a dragon as a name day present, \"little, like I am\", whereupon he was informed that the last dragon had died a century before.[37] He used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock, and stared at them for hours, pretending they were dragonflame,[28] while he himself was a lost Targaryen princeling, or a dragonlord from Valyria.[37] Sometimes, he imagined that he saw his father or sister burning in the fires.[37] As he grew older, Tyrion would seldom ever dream of dragons, though he would always remain fascinated by them.[28] When Cersei married King Robert I Baratheon in 284 AC,[N 2] Tyrion came to King's Landing for the wedding, where he sought out the dragon skulls which had decorated the throne room during the Targaryen dynasty, but which had been taken down by Robert.[28]\n\nIn 281 AC, when Tyrion was eight years old, his father Tywin Lannister had been discussing a betrothal between Tyrion's brother Jaime and the youngest daughter of Lord Hoster Tully, Lysa. However, Jaime was named to the Kingsguard, making him unavailable for marriage. Tywin offered Tyrion as a replacement, only to be told by Lord Hoster that his daughter required a \"whole man\".[36] Tywin later tried to offer Tyrion to Lords Yohn Royce and Leyton Hightower, but they took it in a similar fashion as the Princess of Dorne had done years before. Around 286 AC or 287 AC,[N 3] Tywin even offered Tyrion as a husband to Delena Florent, who had been deflowered by King Robert I Baratheon, but Ser Colin Florent preferred to marry his daughter to Ser Hosman Norcross instead.[36]\n\nKnowing he would never be a knight, as a child Tyrion thought he could become the High Septon instead, as the crystal crown added a foot to one's height. As such, he studied the holy books.[37]\n\nAt the age of thirteen, around 286 AC, Tyrion fell in love, and that quickly replaced the thoughts of priesthood. He and his brother Jaime rescued a common girl, Tysha, from some bandits near Casterly Rock. While Jaime went after the bandits, Tyrion took care of Tysha. To his amazement Tysha liked him, and they eventually made love. Tyrion became so enamored by her, that he bribed a drunken septon and married her in secret.[3] They lived in a little cottage by the sunset sea, and spent whole days in bed. They would kiss and make love, and Tysha would sing the Myrish song \"The Seasons of My Love\" for him.[39]\n\nHowever, their marriage lasted only two weeks, until the septon sobered up and confessed to Lord Tywin. When Tyrion's father learned about the wedding, he commanded Jaime to say that Tysha was a prostitute whom Jaime had hired to take Tyrion's virginity. Because the \"whore\" had presumed to marry a Lannister, Tywin had his guards rape Tysha for a silver coin each, and then made Tyrion rape her as well, paying a gold coin, stating that a Lannister was worth more.[3] Afterwards, Tywin had the marriage undone, and the septons said it was as if Tyrion and Tysha had never been wed.[33]\n\nAs a young boy, Tyrion had committed to learn all sixteen of the wonders described by Lomas Longstrider to memory, and occasionally recited them during feasts. For years, he dreamed that one day he could travel the world and see them himself. In 289 AC, when he became a man at sixteen, he wanted to take a tour of the nine Free Cities, as his uncles Gerion and Tygett had done. Tywin forbade him to go, claiming he was irresponsible because of his marriage to Tysha, and instead gave him charge of all the cisterns and drains at Casterly Rock.[9] When Tyrion was eighteen, in 291 AC,[N 4] his uncle Gerion left on a journey for Valyria to recover the ancient Valyrian steel greatsword Brightroar which had once belonged to House Lannister. Lord Tywin forbade Tyrion to go on this journey as well.[9]\n\nFor his twenty-third name day, Tyrion received a mare from his brother Jaime.[27] He keeps a suit of plate armor crafted for his atypical body at Casterly Rock.[5]\n\nTyrion goes north to Winterfell as part of King Robert I Baratheon's royal procession.[1] He speaks with Jon Snow during the welcoming feast,[20] and he visits the castle's Library Tower.[31] After Bran Stark's fall from the First Keep, Tyrion makes Prince Joffrey Baratheon offer his sympathies to Bran's parents, though his nephew only obeys after Tyrion hits him. Suspicious of the accident, Tyrion takes notice of his siblings' reactions to the news that Bran is expected to survive.[31]\n\nWhen the royal family leaves Winterfell, Tyrion rides north to see the Wall before returning south, with Lord Eddard Stark allowing him to borrow a few rare books from the library.[28] Tyrion joins the First Ranger, Benjen Stark, and new recruit Jon Snow for the journey and is accompanied by a guard, Jyck, and a servant, Morrec.[28] Tyrion reads about a book about the history and properties of dragons.[28]\n\nWhile at the Wall, Tyrion sees firsthand the poor state of the Night's Watch;[28][40] it is dwindling in numbers, ranging parties are going missing more often than usual, and wildlings are fleeing south like never before. He is implored by Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, to make King Robert and his father, Lord Tywin Lannister, aware of the Watch's needs.[41]\n\nTyrion befriends and advises Jon Snow during his time at Castle Black. Tyrion sees himself as an outcast on similar ground as the bastard-born Snow and helps Jon cope with his identity and lot in life. Before Tyrion leaves the Wall, Jon asks him to help his brother Bran in the same way that he helped Jon, which Tyrion promises to do.[41]\n\nOn his way back south, Tyrion stops at Winterfell. Despite initially receiving a hostile welcome from Robb Stark and an attack from the Stark direwolves at his arrival, Tyrion gives Maester Luwin plans for a special saddle that will allow Bran to ride a horse despite his disability. Tyrion declines an offer for a room at Winterfell, choosing to stay at an inn in the nearby winter town.[42]\n\nOn his way back to King's Landing Tyrion encounters Catelyn Stark at the inn at the crossroads. Unknown to Tyrion, Catelyn was told by the master of coin, Lord Petyr Baelish, that the Valyrian steel dagger used in Bran's failed assassination attempt belonged to Tyrion. As a result, Catelyn, with the help of some of her father’s bannermen present at the inn, arrests Tyrion and takes him to the Eyrie to be tried.[43][27] On their way, they are attacked by the clansmen of the Vale, and Tyrion finds himself fighting in his first battle.[27] Jyck and Morrec are slain during the journey.[27][44]\n\nOnce they reach the Eyrie, Lysa Arryn accuses Tyrion of killing her husband, Lord Jon Arryn. Tyrion is tried for both Jon's murder and Bran's attempted murder, though he is innocent of both. To break him, Lysa locks him up in the sky cells. Tyrion thinks it possible that his siblings were responsible for the crimes he is accused of, but that Bran's assassination attempt seems too clumsily done to be Jaime's or Cersei's work. Tyrion eventually manages to bribe his gaoler, Mord, into telling Lysa that he is ready to confess. When Lysa summons the complete court of the Vale to hear his confession, he demands a trial by combat.[45] Tyrion's champion, the sellsword Bronn, kills Lysa's champion, Ser Vardis Egen, securing Tyrion's freedom.[46]\n\nTyrion and Bronn leave the Eyrie on the dangerous high road, and along the way they are surrounded by men of the mountain clans, led by Shagga. Tyrion uses his quick wits and words to win over the clansmen by promising them weapons, armor, and glory.[3] More clansmen join Tyrion on his way to the riverlands. The group rides out of the mountains, eventually reaching the Lannister host led by his father, Tywin, who has invaded the riverlands following Tyrion's capture. Tywin hangs Masha Heddle because Tyrion had been captured at her inn.[4]\n\nTywin places Tyrion and his clansmen in the front for the upcoming battle with the Stark forces and Tyrion is given a number of new servants including a new squire, Podrick Payne. That night, he sends Bronn looking for a female companion for him, and Bronn brings back a young camp follower named Shae, whom Tyrion takes an immediate liking to and takes into his service. The next day, he fights in the battle on the Green Fork against Stark forces commanded by Lord Roose Bolton.[5] The battle is won, though afterward the Lannisters learn it was only a diversion. While Tywin had been marching north, Jaime was captured in the Whispering Wood and his host was then defeated at Riverrun in the Battle of the Camps.[47]\n\nAt the crossroads inn, before he moves his host to Harrenhal, Lord Tywin sends Tyrion to King's Landing to act as Hand of the King in his stead. Tywin does not trust the \"jackanapes\" on the small council: Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, and Varys, the master of whisperers. He wants Tyrion to rein in his newly crowned nephew and prevent further mistakes by Joffrey like Lord Eddard Stark's execution and Ser Barristan Selmy's dismissal, but forbids Tyrion from taking Shae to court. Tyrion disobeys his father as much as he dares and brings Shae to King's Landing with him in secret.[47]\n\nTyrion, along with his mountain clansmen, Shae, and Bronn, arrives at King's Landing during the tourney on King Joffrey's name day and presents Tywin's letter which names him Hand in his father's absence, much to Cersei's dismay. She threatens to name it a forgery and throw him in the dungeon, but Tyrion promises to help her get Jaime back and Cersei concedes. She also admits she needs help and agrees to ally herself with Tyrion, though they both have no intention of keeping it. This leads to a power struggle between the two. Tyrion takes up residence in the Tower of the Hand and as his first act of business removes the heads of the executed Stark household from the walls of the Red Keep.[32] He also grows a beard of blonde and black hair.[48]\n\nTyrion forges an alliance with Varys who helps him to replace Lord Janos Slynt with Ser Jacelyn Bywater as Commander of the City Watch and sends Slynt and a few of his cronies to the Wall.[35] Next he concocts a plan to identify Cersei's informants on the small council. He tells Petyr Baelish, Varys, and Pycelle each different plans that he has for Myrcella and Tommen.[49] When Cersei confronts him about the plan that he divulged to Pycelle, Tyrion knows that Pycelle is the informant.[14] Tyrion's true plan is to send Myrcella to Dorne to be betrothed to Prince Trystane Martell. To further garner Dornish support, he offers Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, a seat on the small council and promises to turn over the men that murdered Doran's sister Elia.[49][14] For his part in giving Cersei private information, Pycelle is confined to the black cells beneath the Keep.[2] Tyrion tries to protect Sansa Stark from Joffrey's cruelties.[50]\n\nWith his place at court secure and successfully outsmarting Cersei at every turn, Tyrion begins a series of initiatives to prepare the city for the siege, commanding the construction of fishing boats. He also opens the kingswood for hunting and sends gold cloaks out to forage, but this is still not enough to feed the overcrowded city. He commands the blacksmiths around the city to begin construction on a giant chain which will allow him to close the Blackwater Rush.[51] He also has Hallyne of the Alchemists' Guild synthesize a large quantity of wildfire.[14] Eventually, he sends his clansmen to the kingswood to snuff out outriders and scouts loyal to Stannis Baratheon.[21]\n\nTyrion sets Shae up in a manse near the Iron Gate to keep her existence in King's Landing a secret.[35] Varys, however, knows her location, and helps Tyrion use Chataya's brothel as a front. Once inside the brothel, Tyrion passes through a tunnel that takes him to a location where he can safely travel to Shae's manse without being followed.[51] She is restless there, however, and wishes to see more of court. Following the riot of King's Landing, Tyrion moves Shae to the Red Keep for her safety in the guise of Lollys Stokeworth's maid.[33]\n\nTyrion's cousin, Ser Cleos Frey, brings peace terms from Robb Stark, asking that Sansa and Arya Stark be released (although Arya is not, in fact, held at King's Landing) in exchange for all captives save Jaime, and that Joffrey renounce all claims to the north and riverlands.[52] Tyrion deems the terms unacceptable[14] and sends Cleos back with the counter-offer that he will release Sansa and Arya along with a number of captive Stark bannermen in return for Robb’s fealty and Jaime’s release, setting up an escape plan for Jaime to be orchestrated by men in Cleos's party.[2] Tyrion is also visited by Ser Alliser Thorne of the Night's Watch, who has brought with him the severed hand of a wight from the Wall, but it rots away before he can present it. Alliser is mocked by Tyrion and the court, but is promised his pick of the city's dungeons as recruits.[49][2] Tyrion's plot to free Jaime fails at Riverrun.[53]\n\nWhen Renly Baratheon is murdered at Storm's End, Tyrion seizes the opportunity to bring the Tyrells to the Lannister cause. He sends Petyr Baelish to treat with the Tyrells and offers Joffrey in marriage to Renly's widow, Margaery Tyrell.[54] Tyrion continues to thwart Cersei's plans, including one to send a disguised Tommen to Rosby to remove him from the reach of the mobs and Tyrion.[33] On one occasion Tyrion drugs her so that she will not be able to attend the small council.[49][2] In retaliation Cersei has Alayaya, whom she believes is Tyrion's whore, seized and beaten, offering her freedom in return for custody over Tommen. Tyrion is furious and swears to take from Cersei everything she cares about.[55]\n\nWhen Stannis's forces attack King's Landing in the Battle of the Blackwater, Bronn raises the chain which traps many ships of the rival royal fleets in the Blackwater Rush. The wildfire commissioned from the alchemists is then launched at the ships and they are trapped in the river to burn, unable to reach the safety of Blackwater Bay.[56]\n\nDuring the battle, Tyrion is forced to lead a sortie out past the city walls because Sandor Clegane, terrified of fire, refuses to do so.[18] Tyrion heads his men in a wedge formation dispersing the men assaulting the King's Gate. He then continues with his men to hold the men crossing over a makeshift bridge made of the sinking galleys of Stannis's fleet in the river. During the battle, Ser Mandon Moore of the Kingsguard turns on Tyrion and tries to kill him, slicing off his nose, but Tyrion is saved by his squire, Podrick Payne, before Mandon can kill him.[57] Tywin's father, Lord Tywin, arrives with Lord Mace Tyrell, and Stannis is forced to retreat.[58]\n\nTyrion wakes up in bed sometime after the battle, suffering from serious facial wounds and the loss of most of his nose.[39] The wounds are treated by Maester Ballabar, but Tyrion asks for him to be replaced with Maester Frenken, whom Tyrion is more familiar with.[39][29] Tyrion suspects that Cersei was behind Mandon's assassination attempt.[39]\n\nAfter the Battle of the Blackwater, Tyrion is left with a grisly facial scar.[29] He recovers some time later, only to learn that his father has taken all the glory. Lord Tywin has assumed his role as Hand of the King, greatly diminishing Tyrion's power. He is eventually named master of coin as Lord Petyr Baelish's replacement.[36]\n\nIn an attempt to prevent the Tyrells from marrying Sansa Stark to the heir of Highgarden, Willas Tyrell, Tywin tells Tyrion that he has to marry Sansa, so the Lannisters can claim Winterfell.[36] Tyrion and Sansa marry, though Tyrion refuses to consummate the marriage, saying he will not touch her unless and until she wants him to. His father pushes him to consummate the marriage with Sansa for the good of House Lannister, but Tyrion never does - a decision that earns him scorn and jest in court.[59] Tyrion's marriage brings him no joy, as Sansa is repulsed by him and Shae remains indifferent.[60]\n\nShae desires to attend the feast for King Joffrey I Baratheon's upcoming wedding to Margaery Tyrell, but Tyrion feels it is not safe.[25] Having written a song about Tyrion and his mistress, Symon Silver Tongue blackmails Tyrion by threatening to sing it for Tywin or Queen Cersei.[60] When Symon refuses Tyrion's suggestion to leave the capital for the Free Cities, Tyrion has Bronn murder the singer,[6] who ends up in a bowl of brown.[34]\n\nOn the morning of Joffrey's wedding, Tyrion gives the king a rare book, Lives of Four Kings. Shortly after receiving Tyrion's gift, however, Joffrey carves the book up with his new Valyrian steel sword, Widow's Wail.[61] Tyrion becomes convinced that Joffrey sent the catspaw to assassinate Bran Stark. Tyrion and Sansa attend the royal wedding at the Great Sept of Baelor.[34]\n\nAt Joffrey's wedding feast, the king offends Tyrion by telling him to joust with performing dwarfs. Tyrion insults Joffrey in response, so the king upends his wedding chalice over Tyrion and names his uncle as his new cupbearer. When Joffrey chokes to death while drinking wine from the chalice and eating pigeon pie, Tyrion empties the chalice of the remaining wine. Cersei accuses Tyrion of having poisoned Joffrey and has her brother arrested by the Kingsguard.[34]\n\nSansa vanishes from King's Landing,[62] having been taken to the Vale of Arryn by Petyr Baelish. Littlefinger reveals to the girl that he had plotted Joffrey's death with Olenna Tyrell.[63]\n\nTyrion is imprisoned in a tower cell of the Red Keep, where he prepares his defense for the trial and tries to summon witnesses that could help his case. During the trial, numerous witnesses are presented, and each testimony condemns him further. Cersei brings Ser Osmund Kettleblack to the stand, who lies that Joffrey believed Tyrion meant to murder him; Grand Maester Pycelle claims that Tyrion stole several poisons from him and that the strangler was used on the king; and Shae testifies that Tyrion and Sansa plotted the murder together. After Prince Oberyn Martell visits Tyrion's cell and offers to serve as his champion, Tyrion demands a trial by combat.[64] Oberyn battles against Ser Gregor Clegane and manages to mortally wound him, but Gregor eventually has the upper hand and kills Oberyn.[6]\n\nOberyn's death condemns Tyrion to the black cells and death, but the night before he is to be executed, he is freed from his prison cell by his brother Jaime, with the assistance of Varys, who is to take Tyrion to the Free Cities. Jaime reveals that Tysha had not been a prostitute. She had genuinely loved Tyrion, but Tywin had forced Jaime to lie about it. Furious, Tyrion swears retribution on Jaime, Tywin, and Cersei. He also torments Jaime by telling his brother of Cersei's repeated infidelities, and falsely claims responsibility for Joffrey's death.[65]\n\nWhile following Varys through the tunnels of the Red Keep, Tyrion recognizes a secret tunnel leading to the Tower of the Hand. He asks Varys for directions, and climbs up to Tywin's chambers. There, he finds Shae in Tywin's bed. He strangles her, and then confronts his father about Tysha, whom Tywin remembers as Tyrion's \"first whore\". Tyrion warns him not to call her a whore again and demands to know what happened to her. When Tywin does answers she went \"wherever whores go\", Tyrion slays his father in fury, shooting him with a crossbow.[65]\n\nCersei offers a lordship to anyone who brings her the vanished Tyrion.[66] Her bounty results in the killing of a number of innocent dwarfs and children; Cersei refuses to publicly punish anyone who does so, for fear it will discourage other such bounty hunters and allow Tyrion to escape.[67]\n\nFeeling abandoned by Tyrion, an anguished Podrick Payne, Tyrion's squire, joins Brienne of Tarth in search of Tyrion's wife, Sansa Stark.[68]\n\nTyrion flees across the narrow sea, pondering his options and considering himself a kinslayer. Tyrion arrives drunk and despondent at the manse of Magister Illyrio Mopatis in Pentos.[69] There Illyrio tells Tyrion of Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons.\n\nIllyrio sends Tyrion, along with retainers Griff, Young Griff, Ser Rolly Duckfield, Septa Lemore, and Haldon, called Halfmaester, aboard the ship Shy Maid to Volantis. During the trip, Tyrion assumes the aliases Yollo and Hugor Hill.[37] Griff forces Tyrion into recuperation from his increasingly heavy drinking. The companions plan to meet Daenerys in Volantis to strengthen her cause. En route, Tyrion deduces that Griff is the exiled lord Jon Connington and Young Griff is Prince Aegon Targaryen, saved from the Sack of King's Landing. When the boat is ambushed by stone men in Chroyane, Jon rescues Tyrion from the Rhoyne.[70]\n\nWhile in Selhorys, Tyrion (under Haldon's direction) plays a game of cyvasse with Qavo Nogarys, a customs official, to gain information. Tyrion is then captured in a brothel by Ser Jorah Mormont[71] and brought to Volantis, as Jorah plans to bring Tyrion to Daenerys to regain her favor. Jorah takes him to the widow of the waterfront to try and arrange passage out of Volantis. There Tyrion meets a female dwarf performer named Penny who, upon learning that Tyrion was indirectly responsible for her brother Oppo's death, tries to kill him.[72] Penny joins the pair as they travel to Meereen by sea aboard the Selaesori Qhoran, where the crew take to calling him No-Nose, to reach Daenerys. On the ship Penny eventually befriends Tyrion.[11]\n\nWhile aboard the Selaesori Qhoran, Tyrion makes the acquaintance of Moqorro, who sees visions in flames.[11] Tyrion, Penny, and Jorah are captured by a Yunkai'i slaver and bought by Yezzan zo Qaggaz. They are instructed by his overseer, Nurse, on how to treat their new master.[24] Tyrion and Penny are forced to perform a mock joust in the fighting pits of Meereen, not knowing that they were to be eaten by lions at the end of the show. Daenerys Targaryen, for whom the show was staged, learns of their impending fate and stops the lions from being released.[73]\n\nAfter their new master dies of the bloody flux the trio escapes. Tyrion arranges for the three to join a sellsword company, the Second Sons under the command of Brown Ben Plumm, by promising the company the wealth of Casterly Rock.[74][75] While the Sons' current contract is to fight Daenerys, Tyrion hopes to win them to her side.\n\nWhile in the Second Sons, Tyrion attempts to sway Brown Ben Plumm's mind over a game of cyvasse, in order to rejoin Daenerys. News of the Iron Fleet entering Slaver's Bay reaches the encampment. While the Sons are preparing for the battle that rages around them, a meeting of their officers occurs in which a Yunkish commander demands they fight. After the Yunkishman is killed by Jorah, a white dragon cyvasse piece falls at Tyrion's feet, and it is declared the Second Sons will rejoin Daenerys.[76]\n\nAccording to George R. R. Martin, Tyrion has similarities with Richard III of England.[79]\n\nHis name may be a reference to Tirion, an Elvish town from The Silmarillion by J. R. R. Tolkien, who is a known influence to Martin.[80] It may also be a reference to Tyrian, a character from the 1981 film Dragonslayer, which Martin has cited as one of his favorite fantasy movies.[81]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nTyrion is a dwarf with stunted legs,[20] stubby fingers,[21] and a jutting forehead.[20] He has mismatched eyes of green and black,[20] so rumors spread that he has an \"evil eye\".[7] Tyrion's thin hair is fair and flaxen,[22][23] so blond it can appear white.[20] He has some strands of black hair,[24] however, and if he grows a beard it is yellow, white, and black.[25] Tyrion's unique stare has been said to make people uncomfortable, which he tries to use to his advantage.[7]\n\nTyrion is intelligent, well educated, and a ferocious reader. He is sharp of wit and tongue. Even though he is no warrior, he has been trained at arms[26] and shows great bravery in battle.[27][5][18] Moreover, he knows some tumbling tricks, despite walking with difficulty.[20][10][13] Tyrion has stated that what he lacks in size and strength he makes up for in mental acuity.[28]\n\nTyrion generally receives little respect and is often mocked. His deformity is the cause of many problems and persecution, although mitigated to some extent by his high social standing and his family's wealth and power. He craves for love and respect from his family, but does not have a good relationship with all his family members. His deformity and the fact that his mother Joanna died at his birth are two of the reasons that his father Tywin and sister Cersei despise him.[29][10] Tywin has never forgiven him for Joanna's death.[29] Unbeknownst to Tyrion, Cersei also despises him largely because of a prophecy made to her when she was a young girl. The prophecy claimed that a valonqar (High Valyrian for \"little brother\")[30] would eventually end her life.[12] Cersei has always identified Tyrion as her valonqar and has thus been determined to rid herself of him ever since.[30] Tyrion's older brother Jaime was the only one who ever treated Tyrion with love and affection and for this Tyrion believed he would forgive his brother for anything.[31]\n\nAt a young age, Tyrion married Tysha, a commoner, but eventually Jaime told him the girl was a whore he had paid to take Tyrion's virginity. Tyrion was crushed, and the memory of her has long haunted him.[23] Believing that no girl could ever truly love him for who he was,[32][33][34] he began to seek his pleasure with prostitutes.[35] Tywin felt this brought more shame on their house,[29] further deteriorating their relationship.\n\n\n## History\n\n\n\n## Birth\n\n\nTyrion was born in 273 AC as the third-born child to Lord Tywin and Lady Joanna Lannister. Joanna died giving birth to him, and as a result his father blames him for her death.[29] Tales about Tyrion were spread immediately after his birth; At Oldtown, it was said that Tyrion was a monster, with a tail, monstrous huge head, thick black hair, a beard, an evil eye, lion's claws, with teeth so long he was not able to close his mouth, and both male and female genitals.[7] It was said that Tyrion's birth was an omen to famine, plague and war,[7] and the smallfolk named him \"Lord Tywin's Doom\" and \"Lord Tywin's Bane\".[8] King Aerys II Targaryen stated that Tyrion was a punishment for Tywin's arrogance,[8] and the same was said by begging brothers in Oldtown, stating that Tywin had made himself greater than the king, which was only allowed by a god.[7]\n\nShortly after Tyrion's birth, the Princess of Dorne arrived with her consort and two younger children, Elia and Oberyn Martell. Tyrion was kept out of sight during the visit of the Martells, though he could sometimes be heard howling. Cersei and Jaime showed Tyrion to Elia and Oberyn the day before the Martells left, with Cersei claiming the infant would die soon. Lord Tywin, having refused to betroth Princess Elia to his heir Jaime, offered Tyrion as a betrothed to Elia instead, which the Martells took as an insult.[36][7][6]\n\n\n## Childhood\n\n\nDuring most of Tyrion's childhood, his father Tywin served as Hand of the King to King Aerys II Targaryen in King's Landing, and as a consequence was absent from home for longer periods of time.[10] As a child, Tyrion was lonely.[37] His brother Jaime left Casterly Rock to serve as a squire at Crakehall in 277 AC,[N 1] while his sister Cersei left for the court of King's Landing in 278 AC.[8] At the age of six or seven, his uncle Gerion taught him tumbling, which he happily did for half a year at Casterly Rock, until Tywin returned from King's Landing and forbade it.[10][13]\n\nAs a child, Tyrion used to dream of owning a dragon.[28] He once even asked his uncles for a dragon as a name day present, \"little, like I am\", whereupon he was informed that the last dragon had died a century before.[37] He used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock, and stared at them for hours, pretending they were dragonflame,[28] while he himself was a lost Targaryen princeling, or a dragonlord from Valyria.[37] Sometimes, he imagined that he saw his father or sister burning in the fires.[37] As he grew older, Tyrion would seldom ever dream of dragons, though he would always remain fascinated by them.[28] When Cersei married King Robert I Baratheon in 284 AC,[N 2] Tyrion came to King's Landing for the wedding, where he sought out the dragon skulls which had decorated the throne room during the Targaryen dynasty, but which had been taken down by Robert.[28]\n\nIn 281 AC, when Tyrion was eight years old, his father Tywin Lannister had been discussing a betrothal between Tyrion's brother Jaime and the youngest daughter of Lord Hoster Tully, Lysa. However, Jaime was named to the Kingsguard, making him unavailable for marriage. Tywin offered Tyrion as a replacement, only to be told by Lord Hoster that his daughter required a \"whole man\".[36] Tywin later tried to offer Tyrion to Lords Yohn Royce and Leyton Hightower, but they took it in a similar fashion as the Princess of Dorne had done years before. Around 286 AC or 287 AC,[N 3] Tywin even offered Tyrion as a husband to Delena Florent, who had been deflowered by King Robert I Baratheon, but Ser Colin Florent preferred to marry his daughter to Ser Hosman Norcross instead.[36]\n\nKnowing he would never be a knight, as a child Tyrion thought he could become the High Septon instead, as the crystal crown added a foot to one's height. As such, he studied the holy books.[37]\n\n\n## Tysha\n\n\nAt the age of thirteen, around 286 AC, Tyrion fell in love, and that quickly replaced the thoughts of priesthood. He and his brother Jaime rescued a common girl, Tysha, from some bandits near Casterly Rock. While Jaime went after the bandits, Tyrion took care of Tysha. To his amazement Tysha liked him, and they eventually made love. Tyrion became so enamored by her, that he bribed a drunken septon and married her in secret.[3] They lived in a little cottage by the sunset sea, and spent whole days in bed. They would kiss and make love, and Tysha would sing the Myrish song \"The Seasons of My Love\" for him.[39]\n\nHowever, their marriage lasted only two weeks, until the septon sobered up and confessed to Lord Tywin. When Tyrion's father learned about the wedding, he commanded Jaime to say that Tysha was a prostitute whom Jaime had hired to take Tyrion's virginity. Because the \"whore\" had presumed to marry a Lannister, Tywin had his guards rape Tysha for a silver coin each, and then made Tyrion rape her as well, paying a gold coin, stating that a Lannister was worth more.[3] Afterwards, Tywin had the marriage undone, and the septons said it was as if Tyrion and Tysha had never been wed.[33]\n\n\n## Recent History\n\n\nAs a young boy, Tyrion had committed to learn all sixteen of the wonders described by Lomas Longstrider to memory, and occasionally recited them during feasts. For years, he dreamed that one day he could travel the world and see them himself. In 289 AC, when he became a man at sixteen, he wanted to take a tour of the nine Free Cities, as his uncles Gerion and Tygett had done. Tywin forbade him to go, claiming he was irresponsible because of his marriage to Tysha, and instead gave him charge of all the cisterns and drains at Casterly Rock.[9] When Tyrion was eighteen, in 291 AC,[N 4] his uncle Gerion left on a journey for Valyria to recover the ancient Valyrian steel greatsword Brightroar which had once belonged to House Lannister. Lord Tywin forbade Tyrion to go on this journey as well.[9]\n\nFor his twenty-third name day, Tyrion received a mare from his brother Jaime.[27] He keeps a suit of plate armor crafted for his atypical body at Casterly Rock.[5]\n\n\n## Recent Events\n\n\n\n## A Game of Thrones\n\n\nTyrion goes north to Winterfell as part of King Robert I Baratheon's royal procession.[1] He speaks with Jon Snow during the welcoming feast,[20] and he visits the castle's Library Tower.[31] After Bran Stark's fall from the First Keep, Tyrion makes Prince Joffrey Baratheon offer his sympathies to Bran's parents, though his nephew only obeys after Tyrion hits him. Suspicious of the accident, Tyrion takes notice of his siblings' reactions to the news that Bran is expected to survive.[31]\n\nWhen the royal family leaves Winterfell, Tyrion rides north to see the Wall before returning south, with Lord Eddard Stark allowing him to borrow a few rare books from the library.[28] Tyrion joins the First Ranger, Benjen Stark, and new recruit Jon Snow for the journey and is accompanied by a guard, Jyck, and a servant, Morrec.[28] Tyrion reads about a book about the history and properties of dragons.[28]\n\nWhile at the Wall, Tyrion sees firsthand the poor state of the Night's Watch;[28][40] it is dwindling in numbers, ranging parties are going missing more often than usual, and wildlings are fleeing south like never before. He is implored by Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, to make King Robert and his father, Lord Tywin Lannister, aware of the Watch's needs.[41]\n\nTyrion befriends and advises Jon Snow during his time at Castle Black. Tyrion sees himself as an outcast on similar ground as the bastard-born Snow and helps Jon cope with his identity and lot in life. Before Tyrion leaves the Wall, Jon asks him to help his brother Bran in the same way that he helped Jon, which Tyrion promises to do.[41]\n\nOn his way back south, Tyrion stops at Winterfell. Despite initially receiving a hostile welcome from Robb Stark and an attack from the Stark direwolves at his arrival, Tyrion gives Maester Luwin plans for a special saddle that will allow Bran to ride a horse despite his disability. Tyrion declines an offer for a room at Winterfell, choosing to stay at an inn in the nearby winter town.[42]\n\nOn his way back to King's Landing Tyrion encounters Catelyn Stark at the inn at the crossroads. Unknown to Tyrion, Catelyn was told by the master of coin, Lord Petyr Baelish, that the Valyrian steel dagger used in Bran's failed assassination attempt belonged to Tyrion. As a result, Catelyn, with the help of some of her father’s bannermen present at the inn, arrests Tyrion and takes him to the Eyrie to be tried.[43][27] On their way, they are attacked by the clansmen of the Vale, and Tyrion finds himself fighting in his first battle.[27] Jyck and Morrec are slain during the journey.[27][44]\n\nOnce they reach the Eyrie, Lysa Arryn accuses Tyrion of killing her husband, Lord Jon Arryn. Tyrion is tried for both Jon's murder and Bran's attempted murder, though he is innocent of both. To break him, Lysa locks him up in the sky cells. Tyrion thinks it possible that his siblings were responsible for the crimes he is accused of, but that Bran's assassination attempt seems too clumsily done to be Jaime's or Cersei's work. Tyrion eventually manages to bribe his gaoler, Mord, into telling Lysa that he is ready to confess. When Lysa summons the complete court of the Vale to hear his confession, he demands a trial by combat.[45] Tyrion's champion, the sellsword Bronn, kills Lysa's champion, Ser Vardis Egen, securing Tyrion's freedom.[46]\n\nTyrion and Bronn leave the Eyrie on the dangerous high road, and along the way they are surrounded by men of the mountain clans, led by Shagga. Tyrion uses his quick wits and words to win over the clansmen by promising them weapons, armor, and glory.[3] More clansmen join Tyrion on his way to the riverlands. The group rides out of the mountains, eventually reaching the Lannister host led by his father, Tywin, who has invaded the riverlands following Tyrion's capture. Tywin hangs Masha Heddle because Tyrion had been captured at her inn.[4]\n\nTywin places Tyrion and his clansmen in the front for the upcoming battle with the Stark forces and Tyrion is given a number of new servants including a new squire, Podrick Payne. That night, he sends Bronn looking for a female companion for him, and Bronn brings back a young camp follower named Shae, whom Tyrion takes an immediate liking to and takes into his service. The next day, he fights in the battle on the Green Fork against Stark forces commanded by Lord Roose Bolton.[5] The battle is won, though afterward the Lannisters learn it was only a diversion. While Tywin had been marching north, Jaime was captured in the Whispering Wood and his host was then defeated at Riverrun in the Battle of the Camps.[47]\n\nAt the crossroads inn, before he moves his host to Harrenhal, Lord Tywin sends Tyrion to King's Landing to act as Hand of the King in his stead. Tywin does not trust the \"jackanapes\" on the small council: Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, and Varys, the master of whisperers. He wants Tyrion to rein in his newly crowned nephew and prevent further mistakes by Joffrey like Lord Eddard Stark's execution and Ser Barristan Selmy's dismissal, but forbids Tyrion from taking Shae to court. Tyrion disobeys his father as much as he dares and brings Shae to King's Landing with him in secret.[47]\n\n\n## A Clash of Kings\n\n\nTyrion, along with his mountain clansmen, Shae, and Bronn, arrives at King's Landing during the tourney on King Joffrey's name day and presents Tywin's letter which names him Hand in his father's absence, much to Cersei's dismay. She threatens to name it a forgery and throw him in the dungeon, but Tyrion promises to help her get Jaime back and Cersei concedes. She also admits she needs help and agrees to ally herself with Tyrion, though they both have no intention of keeping it. This leads to a power struggle between the two. Tyrion takes up residence in the Tower of the Hand and as his first act of business removes the heads of the executed Stark household from the walls of the Red Keep.[32] He also grows a beard of blonde and black hair.[48]\n\nTyrion forges an alliance with Varys who helps him to replace Lord Janos Slynt with Ser Jacelyn Bywater as Commander of the City Watch and sends Slynt and a few of his cronies to the Wall.[35] Next he concocts a plan to identify Cersei's informants on the small council. He tells Petyr Baelish, Varys, and Pycelle each different plans that he has for Myrcella and Tommen.[49] When Cersei confronts him about the plan that he divulged to Pycelle, Tyrion knows that Pycelle is the informant.[14] Tyrion's true plan is to send Myrcella to Dorne to be betrothed to Prince Trystane Martell. To further garner Dornish support, he offers Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, a seat on the small council and promises to turn over the men that murdered Doran's sister Elia.[49][14] For his part in giving Cersei private information, Pycelle is confined to the black cells beneath the Keep.[2] Tyrion tries to protect Sansa Stark from Joffrey's cruelties.[50]\n\nWith his place at court secure and successfully outsmarting Cersei at every turn, Tyrion begins a series of initiatives to prepare the city for the siege, commanding the construction of fishing boats. He also opens the kingswood for hunting and sends gold cloaks out to forage, but this is still not enough to feed the overcrowded city. He commands the blacksmiths around the city to begin construction on a giant chain which will allow him to close the Blackwater Rush.[51] He also has Hallyne of the Alchemists' Guild synthesize a large quantity of wildfire.[14] Eventually, he sends his clansmen to the kingswood to snuff out outriders and scouts loyal to Stannis Baratheon.[21]\n\nTyrion sets Shae up in a manse near the Iron Gate to keep her existence in King's Landing a secret.[35] Varys, however, knows her location, and helps Tyrion use Chataya's brothel as a front. Once inside the brothel, Tyrion passes through a tunnel that takes him to a location where he can safely travel to Shae's manse without being followed.[51] She is restless there, however, and wishes to see more of court. Following the riot of King's Landing, Tyrion moves Shae to the Red Keep for her safety in the guise of Lollys Stokeworth's maid.[33]\n\nTyrion's cousin, Ser Cleos Frey, brings peace terms from Robb Stark, asking that Sansa and Arya Stark be released (although Arya is not, in fact, held at King's Landing) in exchange for all captives save Jaime, and that Joffrey renounce all claims to the north and riverlands.[52] Tyrion deems the terms unacceptable[14] and sends Cleos back with the counter-offer that he will release Sansa and Arya along with a number of captive Stark bannermen in return for Robb’s fealty and Jaime’s release, setting up an escape plan for Jaime to be orchestrated by men in Cleos's party.[2] Tyrion is also visited by Ser Alliser Thorne of the Night's Watch, who has brought with him the severed hand of a wight from the Wall, but it rots away before he can present it. Alliser is mocked by Tyrion and the court, but is promised his pick of the city's dungeons as recruits.[49][2] Tyrion's plot to free Jaime fails at Riverrun.[53]\n\nWhen Renly Baratheon is murdered at Storm's End, Tyrion seizes the opportunity to bring the Tyrells to the Lannister cause. He sends Petyr Baelish to treat with the Tyrells and offers Joffrey in marriage to Renly's widow, Margaery Tyrell.[54] Tyrion continues to thwart Cersei's plans, including one to send a disguised Tommen to Rosby to remove him from the reach of the mobs and Tyrion.[33] On one occasion Tyrion drugs her so that she will not be able to attend the small council.[49][2] In retaliation Cersei has Alayaya, whom she believes is Tyrion's whore, seized and beaten, offering her freedom in return for custody over Tommen. Tyrion is furious and swears to take from Cersei everything she cares about.[55]\n\nWhen Stannis's forces attack King's Landing in the Battle of the Blackwater, Bronn raises the chain which traps many ships of the rival royal fleets in the Blackwater Rush. The wildfire commissioned from the alchemists is then launched at the ships and they are trapped in the river to burn, unable to reach the safety of Blackwater Bay.[56]\n\nDuring the battle, Tyrion is forced to lead a sortie out past the city walls because Sandor Clegane, terrified of fire, refuses to do so.[18] Tyrion heads his men in a wedge formation dispersing the men assaulting the King's Gate. He then continues with his men to hold the men crossing over a makeshift bridge made of the sinking galleys of Stannis's fleet in the river. During the battle, Ser Mandon Moore of the Kingsguard turns on Tyrion and tries to kill him, slicing off his nose, but Tyrion is saved by his squire, Podrick Payne, before Mandon can kill him.[57] Tywin's father, Lord Tywin, arrives with Lord Mace Tyrell, and Stannis is forced to retreat.[58]\n\nTyrion wakes up in bed sometime after the battle, suffering from serious facial wounds and the loss of most of his nose.[39] The wounds are treated by Maester Ballabar, but Tyrion asks for him to be replaced with Maester Frenken, whom Tyrion is more familiar with.[39][29] Tyrion suspects that Cersei was behind Mandon's assassination attempt.[39]\n\n\n## A Storm of Swords\n\n\nAfter the Battle of the Blackwater, Tyrion is left with a grisly facial scar.[29] He recovers some time later, only to learn that his father has taken all the glory. Lord Tywin has assumed his role as Hand of the King, greatly diminishing Tyrion's power. He is eventually named master of coin as Lord Petyr Baelish's replacement.[36]\n\nIn an attempt to prevent the Tyrells from marrying Sansa Stark to the heir of Highgarden, Willas Tyrell, Tywin tells Tyrion that he has to marry Sansa, so the Lannisters can claim Winterfell.[36] Tyrion and Sansa marry, though Tyrion refuses to consummate the marriage, saying he will not touch her unless and until she wants him to. His father pushes him to consummate the marriage with Sansa for the good of House Lannister, but Tyrion never does - a decision that earns him scorn and jest in court.[59] Tyrion's marriage brings him no joy, as Sansa is repulsed by him and Shae remains indifferent.[60]\n\nShae desires to attend the feast for King Joffrey I Baratheon's upcoming wedding to Margaery Tyrell, but Tyrion feels it is not safe.[25] Having written a song about Tyrion and his mistress, Symon Silver Tongue blackmails Tyrion by threatening to sing it for Tywin or Queen Cersei.[60] When Symon refuses Tyrion's suggestion to leave the capital for the Free Cities, Tyrion has Bronn murder the singer,[6] who ends up in a bowl of brown.[34]\n\nOn the morning of Joffrey's wedding, Tyrion gives the king a rare book, Lives of Four Kings. Shortly after receiving Tyrion's gift, however, Joffrey carves the book up with his new Valyrian steel sword, Widow's Wail.[61] Tyrion becomes convinced that Joffrey sent the catspaw to assassinate Bran Stark. Tyrion and Sansa attend the royal wedding at the Great Sept of Baelor.[34]\n\nAt Joffrey's wedding feast, the king offends Tyrion by telling him to joust with performing dwarfs. Tyrion insults Joffrey in response, so the king upends his wedding chalice over Tyrion and names his uncle as his new cupbearer. When Joffrey chokes to death while drinking wine from the chalice and eating pigeon pie, Tyrion empties the chalice of the remaining wine. Cersei accuses Tyrion of having poisoned Joffrey and has her brother arrested by the Kingsguard.[34]\n\nSansa vanishes from King's Landing,[62] having been taken to the Vale of Arryn by Petyr Baelish. Littlefinger reveals to the girl that he had plotted Joffrey's death with Olenna Tyrell.[63]\n\nTyrion is imprisoned in a tower cell of the Red Keep, where he prepares his defense for the trial and tries to summon witnesses that could help his case. During the trial, numerous witnesses are presented, and each testimony condemns him further. Cersei brings Ser Osmund Kettleblack to the stand, who lies that Joffrey believed Tyrion meant to murder him; Grand Maester Pycelle claims that Tyrion stole several poisons from him and that the strangler was used on the king; and Shae testifies that Tyrion and Sansa plotted the murder together. After Prince Oberyn Martell visits Tyrion's cell and offers to serve as his champion, Tyrion demands a trial by combat.[64] Oberyn battles against Ser Gregor Clegane and manages to mortally wound him, but Gregor eventually has the upper hand and kills Oberyn.[6]\n\nOberyn's death condemns Tyrion to the black cells and death, but the night before he is to be executed, he is freed from his prison cell by his brother Jaime, with the assistance of Varys, who is to take Tyrion to the Free Cities. Jaime reveals that Tysha had not been a prostitute. She had genuinely loved Tyrion, but Tywin had forced Jaime to lie about it. Furious, Tyrion swears retribution on Jaime, Tywin, and Cersei. He also torments Jaime by telling his brother of Cersei's repeated infidelities, and falsely claims responsibility for Joffrey's death.[65]\n\nWhile following Varys through the tunnels of the Red Keep, Tyrion recognizes a secret tunnel leading to the Tower of the Hand. He asks Varys for directions, and climbs up to Tywin's chambers. There, he finds Shae in Tywin's bed. He strangles her, and then confronts his father about Tysha, whom Tywin remembers as Tyrion's \"first whore\". Tyrion warns him not to call her a whore again and demands to know what happened to her. When Tywin does answers she went \"wherever whores go\", Tyrion slays his father in fury, shooting him with a crossbow.[65]\n\n\n## A Feast for Crows\n\n\nCersei offers a lordship to anyone who brings her the vanished Tyrion.[66] Her bounty results in the killing of a number of innocent dwarfs and children; Cersei refuses to publicly punish anyone who does so, for fear it will discourage other such bounty hunters and allow Tyrion to escape.[67]\n\nFeeling abandoned by Tyrion, an anguished Podrick Payne, Tyrion's squire, joins Brienne of Tarth in search of Tyrion's wife, Sansa Stark.[68]\n\n\n## A Dance with Dragons\n\n\nTyrion flees across the narrow sea, pondering his options and considering himself a kinslayer. Tyrion arrives drunk and despondent at the manse of Magister Illyrio Mopatis in Pentos.[69] There Illyrio tells Tyrion of Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons.\n\nIllyrio sends Tyrion, along with retainers Griff, Young Griff, Ser Rolly Duckfield, Septa Lemore, and Haldon, called Halfmaester, aboard the ship Shy Maid to Volantis. During the trip, Tyrion assumes the aliases Yollo and Hugor Hill.[37] Griff forces Tyrion into recuperation from his increasingly heavy drinking. The companions plan to meet Daenerys in Volantis to strengthen her cause. En route, Tyrion deduces that Griff is the exiled lord Jon Connington and Young Griff is Prince Aegon Targaryen, saved from the Sack of King's Landing. When the boat is ambushed by stone men in Chroyane, Jon rescues Tyrion from the Rhoyne.[70]\n\nWhile in Selhorys, Tyrion (under Haldon's direction) plays a game of cyvasse with Qavo Nogarys, a customs official, to gain information. Tyrion is then captured in a brothel by Ser Jorah Mormont[71] and brought to Volantis, as Jorah plans to bring Tyrion to Daenerys to regain her favor. Jorah takes him to the widow of the waterfront to try and arrange passage out of Volantis. There Tyrion meets a female dwarf performer named Penny who, upon learning that Tyrion was indirectly responsible for her brother Oppo's death, tries to kill him.[72] Penny joins the pair as they travel to Meereen by sea aboard the Selaesori Qhoran, where the crew take to calling him No-Nose, to reach Daenerys. On the ship Penny eventually befriends Tyrion.[11]\n\nWhile aboard the Selaesori Qhoran, Tyrion makes the acquaintance of Moqorro, who sees visions in flames.[11] Tyrion, Penny, and Jorah are captured by a Yunkai'i slaver and bought by Yezzan zo Qaggaz. They are instructed by his overseer, Nurse, on how to treat their new master.[24] Tyrion and Penny are forced to perform a mock joust in the fighting pits of Meereen, not knowing that they were to be eaten by lions at the end of the show. Daenerys Targaryen, for whom the show was staged, learns of their impending fate and stops the lions from being released.[73]\n\nAfter their new master dies of the bloody flux the trio escapes. Tyrion arranges for the three to join a sellsword company, the Second Sons under the command of Brown Ben Plumm, by promising the company the wealth of Casterly Rock.[74][75] While the Sons' current contract is to fight Daenerys, Tyrion hopes to win them to her side.\n\n\n## The Winds of Winter\n\n\nWhile in the Second Sons, Tyrion attempts to sway Brown Ben Plumm's mind over a game of cyvasse, in order to rejoin Daenerys. News of the Iron Fleet entering Slaver's Bay reaches the encampment. While the Sons are preparing for the battle that rages around them, a meeting of their officers occurs in which a Yunkish commander demands they fight. After the Yunkishman is killed by Jorah, a white dragon cyvasse piece falls at Tyrion's feet, and it is declared the Second Sons will rejoin Daenerys.[76]\n\n\n## Quotes by Tyrion\n\n\n\n## Quotes about Tyrion\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n\n\n## Behind the scenes\n\n\nAccording to George R. R. Martin, Tyrion has similarities with Richard III of England.[79]\n\nHis name may be a reference to Tirion, an Elvish town from The Silmarillion by J. R. R. Tolkien, who is a known influence to Martin.[80] It may also be a reference to Tyrian, a character from the 1981 film Dragonslayer, which Martin has cited as one of his favorite fantasy movies.[81]",
